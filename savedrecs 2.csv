This agenda shares considerable overlap with the emerging concept of 'social value' and it is proposed that social impact valuation methods could fill the post-occupancy quantification gap. A review of the social impact sector identifies Social Return on Investment (SROI) as the most developed method with a robust framework for implementation. SROI generates monetized results, anticipated to enhance transferability compared with typical post-occupancy evaluation summaries and facilitate the dissemination and usefulness of findings within the design and construction industry. An in-depth account is presented of a study that trials the six stage SROI method in three non-clinical healthcare buildings; interviews, focus groups, user surveys and financial valuation techniques are used. The SROI results are summarized and the discussion provides a critical reflection on the application of SROI to the built environment: the technical challenges faced, the modifications made as a result, and the lessons learnt from this process. The conclusion offers practical recommendations for future applications of SROI to the built environment.","[Watson, Kelly J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Whitley, Tim] Arup, Manchester, Lancs, England","Watson, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England.",kelly.watson@manchester.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J500094/1]; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [1228565] Funding Source: researchfish,This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council under Grant number ES/J500094/1.,,48,15,15,7,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

An increasing number of smart construction sites have been designed using different techniques to reduce injuries caused by construction accidents and achieve proactive risk control. However, comprehensive smart construction site safety management solutions and applications have yet to be developed. Thus, this study proposes a smart construction site framework for safety management. Design/methodology/approach A safety management system based on a cyber-physical system is proposed. The system establishes risk data synchronization mapping between the virtual construction and physical construction sites through scene reconstruction design, data awareness, data communication and data processing modules. Personnel, mechanical and other risks on site will be warned and controlled. Findings The results of the case study have proved the management benefits of the system. On-site workers gradually realized that they should enter the construction site based on the standard process. And the number of people close to the construction hazard areas decreased. Research limitations/implications There are some limitations in the technology of smart construction site. The modeling speed can be faster, the data collection can be timelier, and the identification of unsafe behavior can be integrated into the system. Construction quality and efficiency issues in a virtual construction site will also be solved in further research. Practical implications In this paper, this system is actually applied in the mega project management process. More practical projects can use the management ideas and method of this paper to ensure on-site safety. Originality/value This study is among the first attempts to build a complete smart construction site based on CPS and apply it in practice. Personnel, mechanical, components, environment information will be displayed on the virtual construction site. It will greatly promote the development of the intellectualized construction industry in the future.","[Jiang, Weiguang; Ding, Lieyun; Zhou, Cheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Zhou, C (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",charleschou@163.com,,"Ding, Lieyun/0000-0002-9873-3776","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB1306905]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71671072, 71732001, 71827001]; Sinopec-SK (Wuhan) Petrochemical Company Limited","This research is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB1306905).

SWP can then transmit these personal data to the cloud for training the machine learning models and offer safety alerts or health insights. However, there are two urgently important challenges. Firstly, the machine learning model needs to aggregate the SWPs' image data from each construction worker, which may pose a risk to private data leakage without strict privacy and security agreement. In addition, the machine learning models trained on all SWPs' image data may compromise the personalization of image-based OHS status monitoring for each construction worker. To address the above issues, this study proposes a FedSWP framework, the federated transfer learning-enabled SWP for protecting the personal image information of construction workers in OHS management. FedSWP executes the gradient parameters aggregation through federated learning for the image data in each SWP and builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Crane operators' facial fatigue monitoring experiments are conducted and have evaluated that FedSWP can achieve accurate and personalized safety alerts and healthcare. This study paves the way for the generalization and extension of FedSWP in many construction OHS applications.","[Li, Xiao; Lu, Weisheng; Xue, Fan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chi, Hung-lin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Jianhuan] Shenzhen Cloud Comp Tech Co Ltd, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Clyde Zhengdao] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil & Transportat Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Clyde Zhengdao] Shenzhen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Resilient Infrastruct Coastal Cities, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Clyde Zhengdao] Shenzhen Univ, Sino Australia Joint Res Ctr BIM & Smart Construc, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Zeng, JH (corresponding author), Shenzhen Cloud Comp Tech Co Ltd, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",xl1991@hku.hk; hung-lin.chi@polyu.edu.hk; wilsonlu@hku.hk; xuef@hku.hk; joy@sztechcloud.com.cn; clyde.zhengdao.li@szu.edu.cn,,,"Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) [ITP/029/20LP]; Hong Kong RGC Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71801159, 52078302]; National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2021A1515012204]; Youth Fund of Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education [18YJCZH090]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission [JCYJ20190808174409266]","This research was financially supported by the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) (No. ITP/029/20LP) and Hong Kong RGC Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Findings The empirical analysis yielded nine distinct narratives regarding the innovation each advancing a different account of the rationale for implementing the new method, and the subjects, objects and implications of the change. The findings suggest that actors' differing framings of innovation may increase ambiguity and equivocality. Originality/value These insights augment existing knowledge of innovation management and system safety in safety-critical megaprojects by revealing project actors' discrepant sensemaking processes with regard to innovations.

A framework is presented for determining the optimal set and timing of activities that are performed on an earthquake-damaged tall building in the aftershock environment. The optimization objective is to minimize the cumulative aftershock loss while considering the necessary safety precautions. To this end, the Markov Process and Dynamic Programming methodology are implemented. The specific post-mainshock actions that are considered include whether to evacuate the building, when to reoccupy the building if it was previously evacuated, whether to repair the building and if so, when to start and stop the repairs. The results for a 42-story reinforced concrete building show that the algorithm is able to balance the need for evacuation during the period of high aftershock seismic hazard with a timely resumption of occupancy and necessary repair activities to minimize functional disruption.","[Zhang, Yu; Burton, Henry, V] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",y.zhang@ucla.edu,,,National Science Foundation CMMI Research GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1538866],The research presented in this paper is supported by the National Science Foundation CMMI Research Grant No. 1538866.,,53,0,0,3,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Thus, interpersonal influences among workers play a crucial role in forming and affecting construction workers' safety behaviors. The social learning literature indicates that interpersonal learning occurs in two opposing ways - positive reinforcement by demonstrating preferred behaviors, and negative reinforcement by demonstrating negative consequences of inappropriate behaviors. Amid theoretical disagreements in the social learning literature, it remains unclear in the construction safety literature how the two reinforced learning methods affect construction workers in safety training. To fill the gap, a human-subject experiment (n = 126) was conducted to investigate people's social learning behaviors in a hazardous construction situation - walking between two highrise buildings. The experiment utilizes a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) system with a motion tracking feature. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (no instruction was given), not-falling group (participants observed an avatar demonstrating appropriate walking behaviors), and falling group (participants watched an avatar quickly walking across a plank and falling off). Indicators, including walking time on the plank, walking speed, and gaze movement, were recorded and analyzed to quantify the effects of the two reinforced learning methods. The results indicate that demonstrating information with positive consequences (not-falling group) encourages people to follow the demonstration and maintain normal walking in a hazardous situation. Showing information with negative consequences (falling group) induced participants to walk faster and more irregularly, which further led to more mistakes and unsafe behaviors, This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VR in safety studies and provides recommendations for better safety training programs.","[Shi, Yangming; Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Herbert Wertheim Coll Engn, ESSIE, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ahn, Changbum R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Ragan, Eric] Univ Florida, Dept Comp & Informat Sci & Engn, Herbert Wertheim Coll Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Herbert Wertheim Coll Engn, ESSIE, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",shiyangming@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu; ryanahn@tamu.edu; eragan@ufl.edu,"Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021; Ahn, Changbum Ryan/AAG-6251-2019; Ahn, Changbum R/R-6837-2017","Shi, Yangming/0000-0002-4400-4332; Ahn, Changbum Ryan/0000-0002-6733-2216; Ahn, Changbum R/0000-0002-6733-2216","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1761459, 1761950]; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA [60NANB18D152]","This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grants 1761459 and 1761950, as well as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under Grant 60NANB18D152.

In this paper, a delay risk assessment method is proposed for projects scheduled by LOB. In the proposed method, a LOB schedule is prepared considering the target rate of delivery, and then risk scenarios are defined considering the sources of uncertainty and vulnerability of activities. Next, probability distributions are determined for the required number of labor-hours for each activity and for learning rates, and finally, the delay risk of the project is quantified using Monte Carlo simulation. The application of the method, its outputs, and its potential benefits are demonstrated by a hypothetical case study. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to a real high-rise building project and the potential benefits of using a probabilistic LOB schedule at the planning stage are investigated. The findings reveal that the outputs of the proposed method may enable decision makers to estimate delay risk under various scenarios, formulate effective risk response strategies, and prepare contingency plans for resource utilization in repetitive tasks. However, the simplifying assumptions made during the development of the proposed model regarding the relationships between activity durations, risk scenarios, and learning rates may limit its applicability for all project conditions.

The extreme requirements for time deadline and competition function expose the venues construction to high risks. These risks would potentially bring negative impacts on the site safety performance. Meanwhile, there is a lack of systematic management for safety risks in China's construction industry, especially for large projects such as the Beijing Olympic venues construction. This paper identifies and assesses safety risk factors inherent in Beijing Olympic venues construction with the involvement of 27 experienced and highly respected experts from government agencies, the construction industry, and academe through brainstorming, workshop discussions, and questionnaire surveys. The finding reveals that more than half of the critical safety risk factors are from contractors and subcontractors such as: lack of emergency response plan and measures; workers' unsafe operation, and contractors ignoring safety under schedule pressure. Based on these critical safety risks, a risk register is composed and a model is developed in application of the analytic hierarchy process to assess the status of risks on site safety. The model has been attempted in two Olympic venue projects under construction and the validity has been approved. The risk checklist, register, and assessment model developed in the paper were integrated into the risk management system that has been used for Beijing Olympic venues construction.","[Sun, Yu; Fang, Dongping; Wang, Shouqing] Tsing Hua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Dai, Mengdong] Beijing 2008 Project Construct Headquarter Off, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lv, Xiaoquan] Beijing Organizing Comm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Fang, DP (corresponding author), Tsing Hua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",fangdp@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,23,74,74,0,72,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Design/methodology/approach Civil engineering students were recruited to interact with a virtual reality (VR) safety simulator. They were divided into four groups covering with and without sound and with and without priming factors. Data were collected on the risks that they perceived and the safety levels of their actions. Findings It was found that obvious stimuli in a virtual environment with sound help people to recognise more hazards near the location of the stimuli. Sound is helpful in training simulations to create high levels of presence. However, priming factors are not suitable to be added to VR simulators for training purposes. Priming of safe choice results in people taking fewer risks in the VR simulator, but this does not carry over into other situations. Compared to priming effects, being injured in a training simulator with sound improves trainees' ability to make safe decisions. Originality/value VR simulation is helpful in construction training because of its unique ability to give trainees exposure to dangerous situations without physical risk. However, the overloading the working memory of users is detrimental to the outcomes. Therefore, the optimum level of complexity in VR simulators should be further studied.","[Lu, Xueqing; Davis, Steven] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lu, XQ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",xueqing.lu@student.unsw.edu.au,,,,,,49,6,6,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

A principal components analysis (with varimax rotation) yielded six distinct safety climate factors reflecting aspects of the organizational safety response (OSR), supervisors' safety response (SSR), and coworkers' safety response (CSR). Perceptions of top management's commitment to safety (an aspect of OSR) and supervisors' safety expectations (an aspect of SSR) were both significantly and inversely correlated with the combined medical treatment and lost time injury rate of workgroups in the analysis. Further, regression analysis revealed that perceptions of supervisors' safety expectations fully mediated the relationship between perceptions of top management's commitment to safety and the workgroup injury frequency rate. The results highlight the critical role played by first-level supervisors in acting as the conduit through which organizational safety priorities are communicated to the workforce.

Evidence of sex differences in construction workers' mental health is starting to emerge, with women and younger workers experiencing the greatest levels of distress. This study takes an upstream perspective on construction human resources to explore sex differences in mental health and resilience in the early career pipeline of emerging built environment (BE) professionals. A survey of 384 BE undergraduates was conducted using the DASS-21 measure of mental health and the Resilience at University scale to explore the psychological adjustment of first and final year student cohorts. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and regression. Compared to first year students, female students' mental health appeared to have deteriorated across the four-year degree, whereas, male students' overall mental health improved. The results suggest that the construction classroom may be operating as a microcosm of the cultural environment faced by women in society in general and in the construction industry with its macho culture filtering back into the university sector. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to sex and gender differences in mental health. It is recommended that construction educators and employers partner together to proactively affect culture change by addressing gender bias early, by consciously creating a female-friendly, inclusive culture which emphasises a sense of belonging, and by providing gender-appropriate support systems and resilience training for emerging construction professionals.","[Scott-Young, Christina M.; Turner, Michelle; Holdsworth, Sarah] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia","Scott-Young, CM (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",christina.scott-young@rmit.edu.au,"Turner, Michelle/J-1757-2015","Turner, Michelle/0000-0002-7893-5848; Scott-Young, Christina/0000-0002-8060-8993",,,,111,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

In situ monitoring of cover-zone concrete is therefore critical in attempting to make realistic predictions as to the in-service performance of the structure. To this end, this paper presents developments in a remote interrogation system to allow for continuous, real-time monitoring of the cover-zone concrete from an office setting. Use is made of a multi electrode array embedded within cover-zone concrete to acquire discretized electrical resistivity and temperature measurements, with both parameters monitored spatially and temporally. On-site instrumentation, which allows for the remote interrogation of concrete samples placed at a marine exposure site, is detailed together with data handling and processing procedures. Site measurements highlight the influence of temperature on electrical resistivity and an Arrhenius-based temperature correction protocol is developed using on-site measurements to standardize resistivity data to a reference temperature; this is an advancement over the use of laboratory-based procedures. The testing methodology and interrogation system represent a robust, low-cost, and high-value technique that could be deployed for intelligent monitoring of reinforced concrete structures.

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to appraise the survival strategies of organisations within the built environment, with a view to showcasing these strategies to ensure continuous survival of organisations within the industry. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a survey approach, and construction professionals across the six geo-political zones of the country were sampled using structured questionnaire. Data gathered were analysed using percentage, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and factor analysis. Findings The study revealed that organisation- and workforce management-related strategies are the most adopted survival strategies in the country, as they have the highest factor loading and accounts for about 37 per cent of the total extracted factors. This is followed by the adoption of strategies relating to organisation's innovation, diversification, financial management and organisation's networking, the combination of which accounts for 27.5 per cent of all extracted factors.

Several improvements have been realized in visualizing construction-project information through building information modeling (BIM). One improvement in construction safety can be found in the collection, analysis, and visualization of safety-leading indicator data including near-miss events. Furthermore, the visualization of reported near misses can assist safety managers to identify high-frequency and high-severity events within a construction site for mitigation or hazard removal techniques. The objective of this research is to provide a framework for near-miss data collection and visualization within a BIM platform. A near-miss database was created in a commercially available BIM design software to allow construction-site personnel to report near misses and visualize within an existing BIM. Algorithms were created to enable filtering for visualization based on user input properties of each individual near miss. A feasibility study for the created tool was conducted with an expert review panel of experienced safety managers. Contributions of this research include a near-miss visualization user interface allows construction personnel to view near misses throughout a construction project to identify hazardous areas and frequency of near misses as well as feasibility study data of the created tool.","[Shen, Xu; Marks, Eric] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 251 HM Comer, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Marks, E (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 251 HM Comer, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",xshen7@crimson.ua.edu; eric.marks@eng.ua.edu,,,,,,58,17,17,4,116,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Unfortunately, such LASs are rarely used in these projects because of the time-consuming schedule generation process, the high probability of introducing errors into the LASs and the inability to find the close-to-optimum LAS from the vast number of feasible alternatives. This paper proposes an automated LAS generation (ALASG) method addressing these challenges. A software prototype developed based on the ALASG method is presented and a simulation-based approach is introduced to find close-to-optimum LASs quickly in terms of construction duration or cost for a case study.

However, the construction industry continues to struggle to achieve higher levels of modularization. Since the characteristics and environments in dense urban areas differ to those in rural areas, strategy, pre-project planning, project execution planning, and actual execution of modular construction should also differ. However, research so far has not focused on the implementation of modular methods in urban environments. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify unique challenges and opportunities for implementing modular techniques in urban environments. To meet this goal, this paper examined the current practices, benefits, and barriers in highly dense urban areas by employing a three staged-sequential approach involving the preliminary investigation, main survey (106 responses from 39 companies), and ex-post in-depth interviews with 10 experts. The results show that (1) 'better site operations' was selected by practitioners as the greatest benefit, and 'site access and on-site storage area' was selected as the key barrier and (2) the practitioners experienced difficulties in transporting modules in urban areas. These findings offer valuable implications to modular technique implementation in urban areas around the world.","[Choi, Jin Ouk] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Chen, Xing Bin] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kim, Tae Wan] Incheon Natl Univ, Div Architecture & Urban Design, Incheon, South Korea","Kim, TW (corresponding author), Incheon Natl Univ, Div Architecture & Urban Design, Incheon, South Korea.",taewkim@inu.ac.kr,"Kim, Tae Wan/D-9792-2015","Kim, Tae Wan/0000-0002-7887-1055; Choi, Jin Ouk/0000-0003-3212-2304",,,,46,29,29,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

This process relies heavily on oral communication with the assistance of construction drawings, schedules, and other related documents. Because most construction projects include multiple working phases and involve multiple parties, it is difficult for participants to clearly grasp the whole picture of a construction site and to make accurate predictions about future activities. In this research, the authors proposed a visualized environment to facilitate the discussion process. It includes a stationary display called BIM Table for displaying public information and for collaboration among disciplines, and multiple mobile devices for showing private information. The authors employed augmented reality technologies to connect the BIM Table and the mobile devices as well as the public and private information. The authors named this discussion environment augmented reality and multiscreen (AR-MS) system. This system aims to reduce the complexity of discussion information while keeping necessary information available during the entire discussion process. To validate the AR-MS system, a user test with 36 participants (N = 36) was conducted. The participants were required to perform the three tasks: Data-finding (DF), problem prediction (PP), and decision-making (DM) using both the AR-MS system and the conventional paper-based method. This research discovered that the completion time is significantly shortened using the AR-MS system in both DF and PP tasks, while the accuracy in all three tasks showed no significant difference between AR-MS system and conventional method. Based on the results, the AR-MS system can be of benefit in information searching and foreseeing potential problems on a construction site and the discussion process can be made more effective and efficient by its use.

An analysis concerning current design coordination practices in the building industry revealed that design changes constitute a major cause of failure. More specifically, propagation of changes among the various design disciplines is deficient due to lack of required linking knowledge. Such knowledge is necessary to propagate the effect of a design change by one discipline on the other disciplines involved in the design of a building. This paper presents an information model that aims to help the coordination of design information through managing design changes. The model uses a central database, which is developed not only to carry the building components data, but also to make these components active in assisting the coordination process. In addition to its ability to propagate design changes, the model is capable of tracking past changes and helping in the planning and scheduling of future ones.

Zoning divides the lifting demand into several vertical clusters of floors and assigns a group of lifts for each cluster. Although zoning has great potential in minimizing the vertical transportation time, it is challenging to derive an optimal zoning configuration for the construction of high-rise buildings because lifting demand can vary significantly with construction progress. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a simulation model that can assist in determining the optimal zoning configuration under varying lifting demand. Application of the model to a high-rise residential building project shows that lifting demand-based zoning can reduce the vertical transportation time by about 40%. Based on this, it is concluded that the model has a great potential to minimize workers' idle time and increase labor productivity. This paper is of relevance to researchers with respect to the development of a mathematical model that can identify the optimal zoning configuration. This paper is also of value to practitioners in terms of providing an effective tool to optimize the vertical transportation plan in the construction of a high-rise building. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Managing a heavy-equipment fleet in a cost-efficient manner is key for long-term profitability. To ensure the cost-efficiency of equipment management, practitioners are required to accurately quantify the equipment life-cycle cost, instead of merely depending on the empirical method. This study proposes a data-driven, simulation-based analytics to quantify the life-cycle cost of heavy equipment, incorporating both maintenance and ownership costs. In the proposed methodology, the K-means clustering and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are applied for input modeling to distinguish the maintenance stages, and to further generate corresponding distributions of these points. These distributions then are used to quantify the uncertainties embedded in the equipment costs through simulations. A historical data set of ownership and maintenance costs for a mining truck model was used to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach. This approach was proven to be effective in predicting the cumulative total cost of equipment, which provides analytical decision support for equipment-management practitioners.

European Union member states must also ensure minimum energy requirements for buildings in order to achieve cost-optimal levels during their life cycle. Cost optimality and nearly zero-energy buildings are important concepts in European Union energy policies. These concepts are related, but one is more focused on costs, while the other is more concerned with low energy consumption and on site-renewable energy harvesting. If these approaches result in major differences in the selection of the best package of retrofit measures, then the transition from the cost-optimal concept to nearly zero-energy buildings might be problematic. To assess the most cost-effective solutions to achieve net-zero, a building in Porto, Portugal, was analysed. This determined not only the most cost-effective retrofit solutions but also compared these net-zero solutions with those resulting from the cost-optimal calculation. Both approaches lead to similar results, indicating that the transition between cost optimality' to nearly zero-energy buildings' could occur in Portugal.","[Ferreira, Marco; Almeida, Manuela; Rodrigues, Ana; Silva, Sandra Monteiro] Univ Minho, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Azurem, Guimaraes, Portugal","Ferreira, M; Almeida, M; Rodrigues, A; Silva, SM (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Azurem, Guimaraes, Portugal.",marcoferreira@civil.uminho.pt; malmeida@civil.uminho.pt; anarocha32846@yahoo.co.uk; sms@civil.uminho.pt,"Almeida, Manuela/A-8400-2013","Almeida, Manuela/0000-0003-2713-6322",,,,19,39,39,3,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Traditionally, construction workers in Hong Kong start work at 8: 00 a.m. and finish work at 6: 00 p.m., having one hour lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and an additional break of 30 min at 3: 15 p.m. Construction workers can beat the heat by starting earlier to avoid some extreme conditions, which may occur at certain times of a day. By maintaining the current practice of 9-h working duration for a day, 21 additional work patterns with different start and finish times were proposed and evaluated by the developed optimization algorithm. An optimized schedule (direct-work rate of 87.8%) of working from 7: 30 a.m. to 12: 00 p.m. with a 20 min break at 9: 40 a.m., having lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and working from 1: 00 p.m. to 5: 30 p.m. with a 30 min break at 3: 00 p.m. is proposed. The proposed work pattern not only maximizes direct-work rates but also minimizes the occurrence of heat stress on construction site. This will enable policy makers to derive solid guidelines for working in hot weather. Because the proposed work pattern is developed specifically for the construction industry, more work is needed to further investigate other industries and other climates to provide a holistic view in the future.

Practice shows that the construction technology project or its parts thereof are to be assessed using 5 to 7 parameters, as in case of a larger quantity of indicators, the significance of each indicator becomes relatively lower and has effect on the priorities of line formation. To ensure the safety of workers on construction sites, when preparing construction technology projects, the application of experimental design is proposed, thus starting the evaluation of the quality of technological solutions to construction projects in terms of safety employing multicriteria mathematical methods.","Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania","Dejus, T (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",titas@vgtu.lt,,,,,,55,13,13,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The data collection for these studies was separated by approximately a decade, but the data collection methods, contexts and analysis procedures were very similar. This offered the opportunity to compare the results of the studies at the workstation level, with the goal of identifying parameters consistent in affecting occupant satisfaction, and of exploring the effects of office type (open-plan versus private) and building type (greenversus conventional). Satisfaction with acoustics and privacy was most strongly affected by workstation size and office type; satisfaction with lighting was most strongly affected by window access and glare conditions; and satisfaction with ventilation and temperature was most strongly affected by pollutant concentration. Occupants of green buildings rated all aspects of environmental satisfaction more highly.

While a considerable body of research has accumulated to explain why accident and incident rates remain high in China, research into safety climate in Chinese major construction projects remains scant. To address this gap in knowledge, a survey of 189 construction professionals across five major construction projects in China was undertaken using a validated safety climate framework. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with nine senior construction safety professionals to verify the survey analysis results. The findings indicate that safety climate in major construction projects in China is perceived to be strong, and management commitment appears to be the underlying factor to promote this positive result. Safety rules and procedures is a dimension that requires attention because of their complexity and competing interests during their implementation. All the dimensions of the safety climate are strongly interrelated, indicating that multidimensional and holistic strategies should be employed to improve safety climate in major construction projects. This research enriches the understanding about the characteristics of safety climate in Chinese major construction projects and the effective measures which can be taken to further enhance the safety performance on these projects.","[Zhang, Shang; Gu, Dapeng] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Management, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Loosemore, Martin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Ultimo, NSW, Australia; [Sunindijo, Riza Yosia] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Zhang, S (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Management, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",zhangshfan@163.com,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,This research is partially financially supported by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.,,71,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

The testbed's uniqueness comes from its relatively low cost and its new and accurate sensing method. The mowing performance is evaluated based on the consistency of consecutive mowing paths from actual outdoor testing. Then, a hypothetical implementation is used to evaluate the practicality of the system in California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) applications. Results show that autonomous mowers have the potential to significantly reduce Caltrans' dependence on herbicide, improve worker and public safety, lead to enhanced levels of environmental quality, and decrease the operation's costs.","[Arsenault, Aaron; Velinsky, Steven A.; Lasky, Ty A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Velinsky, SA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,"Division of Research and Innovation of the California, Department of Transportation through the Advanced Highway Maintenance and Construction Technology Research Center at the University of California, Davis","The writers gratefully acknowledge the Division of Research and Innovation of the California, Department of Transportation for the support of this work through the Advanced Highway Maintenance and Construction Technology Research Center at the University of California, Davis.",,21,3,3,0,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Recent studies have also found that a strong correlation exists between viewing patterns of workers, captured using eye-tracking devices, and their hazard recognition performance. Therefore, it is important to analyze the viewing patterns of workers to gain a better understanding of their hazard recognition performance. From the training standpoint, scan paths and attention maps, generated using eye tracking technology, can be used effectively to provide personalized and focused feedback to workers. Such feedback is used to communicate the search process deficiency to workers in order to trigger self-reflection and subsequently improve their hazard recognition performance. This paper proposes a computer vision-based method that tracks workers on a construction site and automatically locates their fixation points, collected using a wearable eye-tracker, on a 3D point cloud. This data is then used to analyze their viewing behavior and compute their attention distribution. The presented case studies validate the proposed method.","[Jeelani, Idris; Han, Kevin; Albert, Alex] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Jeelani, I (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",idrisj@ncsu.edu,"Jeelani, Idris/AAG-9436-2020","Jeelani, Idris/0000-0001-9691-8163; Han, Kevin/0000-0002-2995-8381",,,,79,41,41,8,52,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to examine the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of one such knowledge worker group-the Engineering Design Teams (EDT) at Bell Canada, the largest telecommunications carrier in Canada. Two functional models of the EDT's were developed and analyzed using input oriented constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) DEA models. First left free, the multipliers were then constrained using DEA Assurance Region models based on economic prices and managerial preferences. This study offers an excellent example where inefficient decision making units (DXW)-i.e., EDTs could be made more efficient by improving their scale efficiency simply by reassigning work amongst the units. Bell divides its EDTs along provincial boundaries into Ontario and Quebec teams and each EDT is responsible for a specific geographic area in the province assigned to it. The results of the DEA analysis indicated that redrawing the geographical boundaries of the market area served by the EDTs could move both increasing and decreasing returns to scale EDTs toward CRS behavior. Substantial performance improvements are possible over the entire system, resulting in significant savings in costs without people dislocation or branch closings.","Univ Toronto, Ctr Management Technol & Entrepreneurship, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada","Paradi, JC (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ctr Management Technol & Entrepreneurship, Toronto, ON M5S 3E5, Canada.",,,,,,,12,31,33,3,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Total emissions for construction activities and projects were previously calculated for various transportation projects as well as for other project types. This paper focuses on how contractors can use different equipment combinations and make project schedule adjustments to reduce total emissions from construction projects. It presents a newly developed optimization model that companies can use to select a fleet for a particular project to achieve the reductions. The model can be used to minimize total equipment cost and total emissions, or to minimize total equipment cost while limiting (capping) emissions for one or more of six pollutants. When the model was applied to example construction projects, the predicted reductions in emissions were significant, ranging from 25 to 85% depending on the pollutant. When the model was used to minimize cost, a reduction of 63% of the total equipment cost was achieved from the minimum-emissions solution. The lower-cost solution also resulted in a 43% reduction in project duration from the minimum-emission solution. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a decision model that can be used to select construction equipment fleets to reduce emissions production or equipment cost. The model can be customized to take into consideration the equipment fleet available for each activity and can be developed in concert with preliminary activity scheduling to look at daily emissions.

New scripts are added to the existing GIS software for cost estimation and easy access to information available in the GIS. The sample resource data for various tasks related to construction materials, labours, and equipments are stored in three different tables, while the recommendations for safety and quality control are stored in two separate tables. A separate table is used for each project to generate bill of quantities (BOQ) bill of materials (BOM), and labour requirement. Accurate BOQ is generated on the basis of the dimensions of different data themes of architectural drawing in GIS environment.

Previous studies have focused on identifying factors affecting the risk of falls, but remained silent on investigating the evidential relationships among these factors to better prevent fall accidents. This research proposes a Bayesian network (BN) based approach to diagnose the accident risk of working at heights. The proposed approach consists of a conceptual and generic model with a protocol for assessing the risk of falls and a computational module. The generic BN model was developed on the basis of an extensive review and evaluation of causal factors leading to falls. The computational module was developed on the basis of Bayes' rule for inference to customize model input and job site characteristics. The results of the proposed approach provide probabilities associated with different states of safety risk. Additionally, sensitivity analysis allows practitioners to identify appropriate preventive actions and safety strategies to reduce risk of fall. The proposed approach was verified and tested with a construction operation in a condo-hotel project. This study contributes to the construction safety body of knowledge by providing an effective quantitative risk assessment tool to predict the safety risk of falls from heights. Researchers and practitioners may customize the model to assess and benchmark the fall risk for different operations in the construction industry.","[Nguyen, Long D.] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA; [Tran, Dai Q.] Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Chandrawinata, Martin P.] HDR Engn, Walnut Creek, CA 94596 USA","Tran, DQ (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",lnguyen@fgcu.edu; daniel.tran@ku.edu; martin.chandrawinata@hdrinc.com,"Nguyen, Long/Q-6992-2019","Nguyen, Long/0000-0002-1879-8327",,,,65,35,35,3,92,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Fully understanding the causes of unsafe behaviors on site will help to prevent them, thus reducing construction accidents. The accurate and timely identification of site workers' unsafe behaviors can aid in the analysis of the causes of unsafe behaviors and prevention of construction accidents. However, the traditional methods (e.g.,site observation) of behavior data collection on site is neither efficient nor comprehensive. This paper develops a skeleton-based real-time identification method by combining image-based technologies, construction safety knowledge, and ergonomic theory. The proposed method recognizes unsafe behaviors by simplifying dynamic motions into static postures, which can be described by a few parameters. Three basic modules are involved: an unsafe behavior database, real-time data collection module, and behavior judgement module. A laboratory test demonstrated the feasibility, efficiency, and accuracy of the method. The method has the potential to improve construction safety management by providing comprehensive data for the systematic identification of the causes to workers' unsafe behaviors, such as inappropriate management methods, measures or decisions, personal characteristics, work space and time, as well as warning workers identified as behaving unsafely, if necessary. Thus, this paper contributes to practice and the body of knowledge of construction safety management, as well as research and practice in image-based behavior recognition.","[Guo, Hongling; Yu, Yantao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ding, Qinghua] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Guo, HL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",hlguo@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Yu, Yantao/S-6035-2018; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012","Yu, Yantao/0000-0003-0400-3068; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201","Tsinghua-Glodon BIM Research Center; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51578318, 51208282]",The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.51578318 and 51208282) as well as Tsinghua-Glodon BIM Research Center for supporting this research.,,49,18,18,8,97,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This paper builds on a recent study that evaluated the accuracy of early highway construction cost estimates for the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT). The study included 996 MDT projects awarded between 2006 and 2015, with more than $2.2 billion in construction costs, accounting for more than 82% of the agency's construction spending. The results suggest that top-down models provide a means to improve the prediction accuracy of agency cost estimates (when measured as the mean absolute percentage error of project costs), particularly for projects with higher levels of complexity and lower sample sizes. These conclusions are drawn from a comparison of agency in-house estimates to predictions obtained through artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression models. In interpreting these findings, the paper demonstrates that the bias-variance trade-off, a common model building concern in the machine learning and artificial neural network literature, is likely a key factor in explaining the prediction performance of simplified models.

This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology to prove how BIM-based clash detection leads to cost savings. A schema is developed based on literature review and industrial expertise to quantify cost savings achieved by the utilisation of BIM-based clash detection and resolution. This paper provides validation of the proposed schema on a major infrastructure project. The developed schema includes the categorisation of identified clashes based on stakeholder involvement and required actions. The validation used the estimated cost of clashes were those not resolved before site operations took place. This schema simplifies both the categorisation and cost estimation of clashes in design. Estimated savings yielded 20% of contract value using the schema, for the multi-million-dollar project case study, thus extending evidence of BIM savings and benefits. The schema improves the existing process and valorises clash detection, thus allowing stakeholders to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. In addition, the categorisation methodology allows prioritising on the most costly clashes, and draw lessons learnt for further projects. This schema opens the path towards a systematic methodology to appraise the benefits of different BIM uses or processes.","[Chahrour, Racha] HOCHTIEF ViCon, Essen, Germany; [Hafeez, Mian Atif; Dawood, Huda; Rodriguez-Trejo, Sergio; Dawood, Nashwan] Teesside Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Digital Technol, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Ahmad, Ahmad Mohammad] Qatar Univ, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Doha, Qatar; [Sulieman, Hashim Ibnauf] Govt Sudan, Minist Infrastruct & Transportat, Khartoum, Sudan","Dawood, N (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, Res & Innovat, Sch Comp Engn & Digital Technol, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, Cleveland, England.",N.N.Dawood@tees.ac.uk,"Hafeez, Mian Atif/AAV-3821-2021","Hafeez, Mian Atif/0000-0001-7256-5981; Rodriguez Trejo, Sergio/0000-0002-4994-0816; AHMAD, AHMAD MOHAMMAD/0000-0002-5845-2873",,,,58,3,3,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Extant literature highlights the financial management challenges facing the proposed integration. These challenges are mainly related to the IPD compensation and the conventional cost control approaches that are not consistent with IPD principles. As such, this paper presents an integration of several methods to support automating risk/reward sharing amongst project parties thus enhancing IPD core team members' relationship. Design/methodology/approach The literature review was used to highlight the challenges that face the IPD-based cost management practices such as the risk sharing/reward sharing amongst IPD core team members and potential methods to bridge the revealed IPD gap. A framework was developed by integrating the activity-based costing (ABC) - as a method to analyse the cost structure - and earned value management (EVM) to develop mathematical models that can determine the three main IPD financial transactions (i.e. horizontal ellipsis ) fairly. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed system, a real-life case study was used, in which, promising results were collected in regard to visualising the cost control data and understanding of the accumulative status of the project cost and schedule for team members. Findings A centralised cost management system (CCMS) for IPD is developed to enable the IPD cost structure as well as automating the risk-sharing/reward-sharing calculations. This system is linked with a web-based management system to display the output of proposed risk-sharing/reward-sharing models. Moreover, a novel grid is developed to show the project status graphically and to respect the diversity in core team members backgrounds. In addition, the case study showed that the proposed integration of different methods (ABC, EVM, BIM and web-based management system) is interoperable and applicable. Originality/value This research presents a comprehensive solution to the most revealed challenges in cost management practices in IPD implementation. The outcome of this research contributes to the body of knowledge through presenting new extensions of the EVM to be used with the IPD approach to calculate risk/reward. Moreover, the implementation of the proposed tools such as centralised cost management system (CCMS) and CCMS for IPD web system will enhance/foster the implementation of the IPD in conjunction with BIM process.","[Elghaish, Faris; Abrishami, Sepehr] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portsmouth, Hants, England","Abrishami, S (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",faris.elghaish@port.ac.uk; Sepehr.abrishami@port.ac.uk,"Abrishami, Sepehr/C-8700-2014","Abrishami, Sepehr/0000-0003-4692-1721; Elghaish, Faris/0000-0002-7558-6291",,,,61,3,3,8,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Nationally, ethanol is blended with gasoline up to 10% (E10) for use in conventional vehicles, and up to 85% (E85) for use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs). Meeting the blending requirements could mean increasing the ethanol blended with gasoline or E85 use in FFVs. The authors estimate costs typically not quantified for FFV drivers refueling with E85, which are a small component of total costs, and consider the infrastructure costs to expand E85 access in Pennsylvania. Even with a retailer incentive of $0.01 to $0.39/gasoline liter equivalent (gle) to encourage ethanol infrastructure installation, an E85 consumer would still also experience higher refueling costs. A E85 consumer refueling and convenience cost of $0.95/gle is higher than historical ethanol subsidies. Additionally, although switching from E10 to E85 could reduce emissions, a refueling incentive of $1,320/metric ton CO2 is 36 times larger than the average U.S. social cost of carbon (CO2) for 2015.

Cost overruns in highway projects have plagued public agencies globally. Hence, this research aims to develop a parametric cost estimation model for SHAs to forecast the completed project cost prior to project execution to take necessary measures to prevent cost escalation. Ordinary least-square (OLS) regression has been a commonly used parametric estimation method in the literature. However, OLS regression has certain limitations. It, for instance, requires strict statistical assumptions. This paper proposes an alternative approach-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-that has proved in other fields of research to be significantly better than the OLS method in many respects, including automatic feature selection, the ability to handle highly correlated data, ease of interpretability, and numerical stability of the model predictions. Another contribution to the body of knowledge is that this study simultaneously explores project-related variables with some economic factors that have not been used in previous research, but economic conditions are widely considered to be influential on highway construction costs. The data were separated into two groups: one for training the model and the other for validation purposes. Using the same data set, both LASSO and OLS were used to build models, and then their performance was evaluated based on the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square error. The results showed that the LASSO regression model outperformed the OLS regression model based on the criteria.

This paper presents the time and cost optimized decision support (TACTICS) model, and it was developed based on the fast-track methodology and genetic algorithms (GAs). TACTICS was applied to two case studies, and the results indicated that the fast-track method could be expected to deliver more efficient projects compared with using the traditional method. In particular, (1) the average reduction in project duration by applying the fast-track method was 40.48% (Case I) and 18.59% (Case II) compared with using the traditional method, and (2) the average project costs were reduced by as much as 0.39% (Case I) and 4.48% (Case II). Consequently, TACTICS could be expected to help in making a decision regarding the fast-track application and further contribute to the project scheduling expertise in the construction engineering and management body of knowledge.

In practice, the square foot method, considered an effective method for time-saving, is widely used. However, this method requires a great amount of effort to calculate a unit price and does not consider the uniqueness of each case. Thus, the use of the square foot method could bring about unwanted consequences. For example, in the case of military projects in Korea, significant differences have been reported between estimations made using this method and the actual costs. In an effort to deal with this challenging issue, this research develops a military facility cost estimation (MilFaCE) system, based on case-based reasoning (CBR), using case data from 422 construction projects at 16 military facilities. Based on system validation experiments involving 10 military officers (engineers), the effectiveness of the system in terms of estimation accuracy and user-friendliness is confirmed.

J,"Stenbeck, T",,,,"Stenbeck, Torbjorn",,,Budgeting Performance-Based Winter Maintenance: Snow Influence on Highway Maintenance Cost,JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Swedish contracting of winter maintenance is combined with weather-regulated payment since the beginning of the 1990's. It reduces the weather risk for the contractor and has helped performance-based specifications to find acceptance. The performance-based approach was introduced to save costs and create incentives for innovation. Theory and practice are often unconnected since the mathematical links are lacking behind the political rhetoric around performance-based contracting. This study attempts to bridge some of the gap between theory and practice by linking a climate factor, snow, to highway maintenance costs. To handle the complexity of weather, an iterative process was assumed necessary, with simplification as a first step. An answer was achieved to the two research questions: which stations correlated best with costs and what the winter maintenance cost would be, given the snowfall at these stations. Once having achieved this answer under simplified circumstances (one weather parameter, one region, few observations, linear relationship), the assumptions were relaxed, one after the other, in second and third iterations, to increase the generalizeability of the method and the results. Maintenance cost and weather data of Washington state were used. The method can be used anywhere where the actual costs of the maintenance are known. In countries and regions with privatized highway maintenance, like in Sweden, British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, the actual costs are not public. The lessons learned from this study may therefore be of particular interest to such privatized systems. The study supports that the Swedish road weather information system stations are in the right spots and proposes snowfall to weather regulate the payment to the contractor.","CBI Swedish Cement & Concrete Res Inst, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden","Stenbeck, T (corresponding author), CBI Swedish Cement & Concrete Res Inst, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",t.stenbeck@swipnet.se,,,,,,15,8,8,0,8,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Design/methodology/approach The research was based on a survey of a purposive sample, 109 engineers and first-line supervisors worked in 23 construction projects of which ten were led by PMP-certified PMs and 13 were led by PMs lacking PMP certification. Each PM completed a demographic questionnaire for the predictor variables of PMP certification controlled for age and experience. To assess the criterion variable of safety culture total score, engineers and first-line supervisors working in the same project completed the questionnaire of safety culture values and practices. Findings Results of this study indicated the level of safety culture was significantly different, and improved, for engineers and first-line supervisors who work under PMs with PMP certification compared to the level of safety culture in projects managed by PMs with no PMP certification. Although alignment of safety culture perceptions among different levels in the organization helps to achieve a positive safety culture, the role of the PM in transferring, implementing and maintaining the safety culture in the construction project is fundamental, particularly in small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Originality/value This study addressed the role of the PMs managerial skills in the safety performance of Saudi Arabian SMEs. The principal finding was that PMs with managerial skills perform better regarding safety performance in SME construction projects than PMs lacking managerial skills. The primary recommendation is that leaders in construction projects must carefully evaluate engineers' managerial skills before hiring the individuals as PMs. A PM's promotion model developed in this study provides a suitable framework and business process component for construction leaders seeking to maintain safety performance successfully.","[Khawam, Abdullah A.; Bostain, Nancy S.] Univ Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA","Khawam, AA (corresponding author), Univ Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA.",akhawam@email.phoenix.edu,/B-8592-2018,/0000-0003-4746-9853,,,,98,2,2,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

A questionnaire form was developed and administered to construction professionals as a data-collection tool about the observable variables and latent dimensions. A total of 180 responses were achieved through data collection. Relationships between observable variables and latent dimensions of the safety performance of construction sites were studied and a multidimensional safety performance model was proposed. The proposed multidimensional safety performance model was supported by structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Moreover, 16 latent dimensions with respect to their relative weights and recommendations for construction safety professionals are provided to improve the safety performance of construction sites.

Unfortunately, existing models tend to underperform because they either (1) ignore relevant explanatory factors or (2) incorrectly specify system feedback and structure. Through a case study with bitumen, a construction material of prime concern for transportation agencies, this paper presents a novel multivariate cost forecasting approach that overcomes these two gaps. Specifically, based on several diagnostic tests, an autoregressive distributed lag and equivalent error-correction model is specified that correctly captures the feedback structure between bitumen and energy commodities. The study then characterizes the relative merits of the approach by introducing robust deterministic and probabilistic out-of-sample forecast measures. The proposed forecasting approach greatly outperforms conventional methods: 6-month-ahead price projections are at least 25% better across the available deterministic and probabilistic metrics. For state planning agencies, this improved forecasting model will allow decision makers to better predict capital budgeting requirements and resource-planning risks. Furthermore, the proposed performance measures will better equip the construction research community to evaluate future forecasting models.

The available cost estimation models for these projects focus on the construction phase, with little or no consideration given to engineering services. This paper presents an artificial neural network model for the conceptual cost estimation of engineering services for public construction projects that considers both design costs and construction supervision costs. In developing the model, the authors first identify the factors that influence the cost of engineering services, and then apply a suitable artificial neural network for a cost estimation model. The model predicts the cost of engineering services as a percentage of construction cost based on project type, engineering services category, project location, and project scope. The model is trained on a data set obtained from the Governmental Tenders Department in Jordan, and then tested on some core data samples that had not been seen by the network during training. The optimal network for the model was selected by conducting a systematic search among a large number of networks with different network architectures and parameter values. The findings demonstrate that the model is able to predict the cost of engineering services with an acceptable performance for conceptual cost estimation models. The present model complements existing models that focus on construction cost estimating by adding in the cost of engineering services. The authors expect that this work will contribute to supporting public construction planners in the early development of total cost estimates for public construction projects.

Nonetheless, the LCC perspective is proving to be most useful during the design phase where the possibilities of cost reductions related to operation and maintenance are large.

Calls have been made for more adventurous research methods, beyond the positivist versus interpretivist philosophical divide traditionally embraced by the industry. This study analyses the extensive scholarly debates, advancing and advocating philosophical positions to understand construction phenomena, and further narrows down the argument to within the specific domain of cost overrun research. A systematic and chronological literature review of the methodological/ philosophical underpinnings of 41 papers was carried out. The papers were selected by following a staged exclusion criterion. The study outcome reveals that similar dialectical debates and methodological conservatism are still evident, with the predominance of mono-paradigm studies in the bulk of the empirical literature. Most of the empirical literature either provides interpretivist theoretical explanations from qualitative data or positivistically analyses quantitative data to provide technical explanations. To this end, mixed paradigm examples are spotlighted, demonstrating the relevance of linking process and product via methodological adventure in cost overrun research. Transcending the paradigmic divide is necessary to develop a more useful and contextually anchored view of practice, essential to mitigate and provide a holistic understanding of what drives cost overruns in public projects.","[Amadi, Alolote Ibim] Rivers State Univ, Dept Quant Surveying, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria","Amadi, AI (corresponding author), Rivers State Univ, Dept Quant Surveying, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.",amadialolote@yahoo.com,,,,,,92,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

However, it involves additional labor costs and the timeliness of task completion should be considered because a BIM application may not be required (and paid for) by the owner in the current stage of BIM development. At present, a project manager often faces much risk in making decisions about the cost because the BIM labor cost is supposed to be proportional to the gross (or total) floor area in practice, and the project managers can only adopt simple linear regression to estimate it. Although this method is straightforward, it tends to have a high risk of estimation error. Therefore, this research tried to develop a new methodology based on Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and proposed a hybrid approach by combining Random Forest (RF) and Simple Linear Regression (SLR) for improving the accuracy of prediction on a project's BIM labor cost in construction phase. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate and validate the prediction results using nineteen completed BIM projects from a leading construction company in Taiwan. A cost breakdown structure (CBS) was proposed to establish the training data set for machine learning. Moreover, this study proposes the use of effective floor area, instead of gross floor area, to be one of the features for training RF and SLR models. Clustering analysis is also adopted and confirmed to improve model performance. Through comparative studies, the hybrid approach of prediction methodology proposed in this study has been proved to be effective in reducing the risk of BIM labor cost prediction.","[Huang, Chien-Hsun; Hsieh, Shang-Hsien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan","Hsieh, SH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",d00521016@ntu.edu.tw; shhsieh@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,34,3,3,6,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Therefore, the Chinese government launched the National Air Pollution Control Plan (hereinafter referred to as the Air Plan) in 2013-2017 to improve air quality and safeguard public health. In this study, an analytical framework for a cost-benefit analysis applicable to China was constructed, and the costs and benefits of the implementation of the Air Plan in 30 cities and provinces in China from 2013 to 2017 were evaluated. Results show that the total cost of implementation of the Air Plan is 1.6511 trillion RMB. The benefits of air quality improvement were determined to be 2.4691 trillion RMB through the willingness-to-pay method to calculate the economic loss of premature deaths. The net benefit related to the implementation of the Air Plan was 818 billion RMB. The public health benefit of air quality improvement was 1.5 times the cost of the nationwide implementation of the Air Plan. At the provincial level, net benefits that reach 279.3 billion RMB were the highest in Guangdong, whereas the benefit-cost ratio, where the benefit was 5.5 times the cost, was the highest in Fujian. Estimations in this study can serve as a reference for China in formulating similar environmental policies and implementing the 3-year Plan to Defend the Blue Sky.

To fill this large knowledge gap, a two-stage research methodology drawing on 1,372 highway improvement projects completed in California was adopted for this study. The Stage I study investigated the marginal change-order impacts of two ACPs, pure A+B and I/D combined with A+B. How ACP change orders affect projects' time-cost performance was numerically modeled and successfully validated over the Stage II study. The results clearly showed that both ACPs led to more schedule-change and cost-change orders than conventionally contracted projects, whereas I/D combined with A+B performed significantly better than pure A+B in terms of the magnitude of schedule-change orders. This conveys an important recommendation to state transportation agencies (STAs) that A+B be used with an I/D provision. The results and numerical models of this study would help STAs better assess and justify the impact of change orders on the duration and cost of projects, enabling them to more effectively use contingency amounts. Use of the models can also benefit contractors requesting a change order because the models can provide them with advanced knowledge of the probable time-cost growth rates specifically for the pursued ACP.

However, up until now, there have been limited studies that analysed cost-benefit and risk factors/barriers of BIPV from a supply chain perspective; and there have also been limited studies that provide strategies to industry and academics in order to encourage BIPV diffusion and application. The aim of this research is to identify the costs, benefits and risks of BIPV and propose suggestions for greater BIPV application, from a stakeholder perspective, through a comprehensive review of current literature. The results of this research show that whilst BIPV have high initial investment capital costs, there are significant long-term benefits to be achieved for clients, end users and the entire society. Further, the results also show that BIPV costs decrease and government policy support and incentives are required in order to promote wider BIPV application. In addition, this research has identified the fact that there was a lack of detailed BIPV cost data (including individual component costs) and lack of methods for BIPV cost-benefit analysis, and there are risks and barriers in BIPV applications. Following this, this research provides a strategic framework and a number of suggestions to industry stakeholders for integration and collaboration within the BIPV supply chain in order to facilitate the cost reduction of BIPV. Finally, this study proposes several topics for future research. It is anticipated that the results presented in this paper have implications not only for government policy and product development and application, but also for academic research.","[Yang, Rebecca Jing] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zou, Patrick X.

Conventional cost evaluation methods do not take the uncertainty and correlation effects into account. In this regard, a simulation-based cost risk analysis model, the Correlated Cost Risk Analysis Model, previously has been proposed to evaluate the uncertainty effect on construction costs in case of correlated costs and correlated risk-factors. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the detailed evaluation of the Cost Risk Analysis Model through scenario and sensitivity analyses. Design/methodology/approach - The evaluation process consists of three scenarios with three sensitivity analyses in each and 28 simulations in total. During applications, the model's important parameter called the mean proportion coefficient is modified and the user-dependent variables like the risk-factor influence degrees are changed to observe the response of the model to these modifications and to examine the indirect, two-sided and qualitative correlation capturing algorithm of the model. Monte Carlo Simulation is also applied on the same data to compare the results. Findings - The findings have shown that the Correlated Cost Risk Analysis Model is capable of capturing the correlation between the costs and between the risk-factors, and operates in accordance with the theoretical expectancies. Originality/value - Correlated Cost Risk Analysis Model can be preferred as a reliable and practical method by the professionals of the construction sector thanks to its detailed evaluation introduced in this paper.","[Okmen, Onder] Minist Transport Maritime Affairs & Commun, Ankara, Turkey; [Oztas, Ahmet] Ishik Univ, Erbil, Iraq","Okmen, O (corresponding author), Minist Transport Maritime Affairs & Commun, Ankara, Turkey.",onderokmen@hotmail.com,,,,,,25,6,7,0,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Behavior management thus plays a key role in enhancing safety, and particularly, behavior observation is the most critical element for modifying workers' behavior in a safe manner. However, there is a lack of practical methods to measure workers' behavior in construction. To analyze workers' actions, this paper uses an advanced and economical depth sensor to collect motion data and then investigates consequent motion-analysis techniques to detect the unsafe actions of workers, which is the main focus of this paper. First, motion data are transformed onto a three-dimensional (3D) space as a preprocess, motion classification is performed to identify a typical prior, and the selected prior is used to detect the same action in a testing data set. As a case study, motion data for unsafe actions in ladder climbing (i.e.,backward-facing climbing, climbing with an object, and reaching far to a side) are collected and used to detect the actions in a new testing data set in which the actions are randomly taken. The result shows that 90.91% of unsafe actions are correctly detected in the experiment.

However, a prolonged schedule delay (SD) can have an extremely detrimental impact on a project's efficiency, cost and investment reputation. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential SD risk factors in international highway projects (IHPs) in Vietnam, and to explore the effects of and influences on such factors. A specific risk management framework is proposed as a useful tool for ICCs. Design/methodology/approach - A system of SD risk indicators is presented for IHPs in Vietnam through a questionnaire survey. The system comprises 50 indicators that are grouped into 12 main factors. A structural equation model (SEM) is then used to assess the influences and mechanisms of these factors. Based on the obtained results, corresponding suggestions for preventing SD risks are presented and discussed. Findings - First, among the 12 aforementioned major factors, the authors identify eight facors that have significant effects on IHP SDs. Second, the SEM analysis reveals that policy flaws and the fiscal ability of the owner play the most important roles, on account of their direct and indirect influences on SDs. Originality/value - Considering stakeholders and external environmental effects, a system of indicators is introduced to explore SD risks to IHPs. In particular, an SEM is used to assess the effects of potential SD factors and characterize their interacting influences. This study could help ICCs to avoid or mitigate project delays and cost overruns in Vietnam, and also provide valuable lessons for other developing countries.","[Hong Anh Vu; Wang, Jian Qiong] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Viet Hung Cu] Natl Univ Civil Engn, Fac Bridges & Rd, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Min, Lian Xing] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Sch Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Cu, VH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Civil Engn, Fac Bridges & Rd, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hungcv@nuce.edu.vn,,,,,,40,9,9,4,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Using this detector and new dataset, the proposed human-object interaction recognition model achieved 79.78% precision and 77.64% recall for hard hat checking; 79.11% precision and 75.29% recall for safety coloring checking. The new model also verifies hand protection for workers when tools are being used with 66.2% precision and 64.86% recall.

Since then, various injury prevention strategies have been developed and resulted in measurable improvements in construction safety management. However, the last decade has seen a deceleration in construction safety improvements, which may be due to the dynamic nature of construction jobsites. Traditional safety planning approaches rely primarily on static information, tacit knowledge, regulations, company safety policies, and 2-dimensional (2D) drawings. As a result, site-specific dynamic information, temporal (e.g. when and who will be exposed to potential hazards) and spatial (e.g. location of dangerous zones) information are currently not specifically addressed. This paper presents a formalized 4-dimensional (4D) construction safety planning process that addresses site-specific temporal and spatial safety information integration. The authors integrated safety data, which includes general safety knowledge, site-specific temporal and spatial information, from a project schedule and a 3-dimensional (3D) model. The authors conducted a case study to test and verify the proposed safety planning process. Findings show that risky activities, days, and zones can be prioritized when project schedule contains activity information regarding number of workers including occupation types and zoning plan. In addition, activity safety risk can be visualized when a 3D model is integrated. The proposed safety planning approach is expected to provide safety personnel with a proactive and site-specific safety planning tool that can be used to better manage jobsite safety. In addition, visual safety materials can enhance safety communication among project participants.","[Choe, Sooyoung] Construct & Econ Res Inst Korea, Dept Technol Policy Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Leite, Fernanda] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Construct Engn & Project Management Program, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Choe, S (corresponding author), Construct & Econ Res Inst Korea, Dept Technol Policy Res, Seoul, South Korea.",sooyoung.choe@cerik.re.kr; fernanda.leite@utexas.edu,"Leite, Fernanda/AAT-2099-2021","Leite, Fernanda/0000-0002-7789-4474",,,,29,41,41,2,62,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Possible solutions for occupational safety depend on the number of criteria such as hazardous factors from which workers must be protected; the number of danger zones; architectural-design and structural solutions of a building; types of technical protection measures, etc. A large set of solutions for occupational safety predetermines the number of respective typical (or repeated) solutions, which are based on specific technical safety measures and are applicable depending on a hazardous factor; besides, it determines systematisation of the solutions on these grounds. It is suggested to use the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique for assessment and selection of appropriate solutions for occupational safety.

However, existing studies have merely discussed violations separately from unsafe behaviors. To respond quickly to workers' violations on site, this study proposes a real-time control approach based on intelligent video surveillance. First, scenes reflecting unsafe behaviors are automatically acquired through camera-based behavior analysis technology. Meanwhile, the time corresponding to the construction phase is recorded. Second, the temporal association rule model of worker's unsafe behavior is constructed, and the rule construction phase -> unsafe behavior is determined by the Apriori algorithm to identify target behaviors necessary for critical control in different construction phases. Finally, statistical process control is used to find the trends of violations with frequency and mass characteristics through the dynamic monitoring of target behavior. In addition, real-time alerts of these unsafe acts are produced simultaneously. A pilot study is conducted on the cross-river tunnel project in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and the violations related to construction machineries is proven to be controllable. Thus, the proposed approach promotes behavioral safety management on construction since it effectively controls workers' violations by real-time monitoring and analysis.","[Guo, Shengyu; Gong, Peisong] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Guo, Shengyu; Gong, Peisong] China Univ Geosci, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Chaohua] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Chaohua] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Guo, SY (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Guo, SY (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",gsy.yu@foxmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) [170649]; Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China [15YJA630019]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573237]; China Institute of Geo-environment Monitoring [0001212016CC60013],"This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) under Grant [number 170649]; the Research Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China under Grant [number 15YJA630019]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [number 71573237]; China Institute of Geo-environment Monitoring under Grant [number 0001212016CC60013].",,48,5,5,9,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This study also evaluated two nearly identical projects and used expert interviews and surveys to determine which factors influence the cost premiums. The projects represented a rare opportunity to compare projects that had the same end requirement: method of execution and acquisition, design/build and firm-fixed price; and location but differed by government construction agent. In addition to identifying the 28 factors that moderately or largely influence cost premiums, five overarching cost-premium themes emerged: failing to balance risk, additional public-sector requirements, stifling or not applying innovation, selection of construction specifications, and parameterization of the execution process. Additionally, once complete, two nearly identical projects differed by over a year of construction time and $7million in spite of the contract requirement similarities. Research frequently cites federal laws and policies as the primary cost-premium driver; however, this research demonstrated that internal construction agent policies also cause increased cost premiums.

In addition, many operations are performed over a considerable period of time. Accordingly, estimating construction costs must consider the trend of costs in the market, where construction costs normally change over time. Insight into the trend of construction costs in the market, therefore, is beneficial, even critical, to the effective cost management of construction projects. In an effort to support such insight development, two time series models were built by analyzing time series index data and comparing them with existing methods in the present study. The developed time series models accurately predict construction cost indexes. In particular, the models respond sensitively and swiftly to a quick, large change of costs, which allows for accurate forecasting over the short- and long-term periods.

Other groups have shown that construction information management with asynchronous Web-based communication can improve decision making among dispersed industry practitioners. It seems reasonable to anticipate that combining 4D visualization with Web-based information management would facilitate dispersed industry practitioners to make collaborative decisions for construction planning and scheduling. The empirical study presented here reports how experiment participants at separate locations collaboratively detected logical errors in a construction schedule when the 4D visualization model of the schedule was represented on the Web browser. Our results show that teams using 4D models detected logical errors more frequently, faster, with fewer mistakes, and with less team communication, than teams using 2D drawings and bar charts.

Design and construction of plants in Canada, though, has tended to be performed on a cost-plus basis, despite pressures from its southern neighbor. This paper reviews the results from the cost-plus contracting of three of Canada's first cogeneration plants. It also examines the contracting strategy used by the nonregulated division of a major Canadian electrical utility to acquire engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) and startup (SU) services for two subsequent cogeneration plants-one in Ontario and one in Quebec-both on a reimbursable-cost basis.

Rapid urban development and climate change combine with wear and tear along with a lack of network maintenance to accelerate this decay and cause a reduction in the hydraulic system's capacity. In this context, the need for system rehabilitation becomes more pressing. Cost figures prominently take precedence in the decision-making surrounding the choice of rehabilitation method employed, but models for assessing cost-effectiveness which consider both structural and hydraulic options, in addition to real-world constraints and time-frame conditions, are lacking. This paper proposes an algorithm to maximize the benefits ensuing from the rehabilitation of urban drainage systems. Potential interventions considered in the algorithm include both traditional rehabilitation methods such as the resizing and rebuilding of damaged pipes, in addition to best management practices (BMPs) aimed at reducing runoff rate and volume.

This paper demonstrates a statistical approach for evaluating the long-term performance and cost effectiveness of pavement warranties via comparison with similar traditional contracts. This is in contrast to past studies that used descriptive statistics and one-to-one comparisons to evaluate the performance of these two contracting approaches. In this study, random-parameter regression models that account for unobserved heterogeneity were developed to evaluate the performance of warranty and traditional contracts for similar projects on the basis of resulting pavement service life. The projects studied involved structural hot-mix asphalt overlay of crack-and-seat rigid pavements. The warranty projects in the study data sample were found to be 10% more effective in terms of average service life compared with traditional contract projects. Additionally, routine maintenance expenditures after the warranty period were up to 194% higher for traditional contract projects. These results suggest that warranty contracts have higher initial and rest-of-life quality. However, in terms of cost effectiveness (herein defined as the ratio of condition or longevity to lifecycle cost), the results suggest that the traditional contracts in the sample were 6-15% more cost-effective, on average, compared with their warranty counterparts, which could be attributed to warranty contracts' higher costs.","[Bardaka, Eleni; Zhang, Zhibo] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Labi, Samuel] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sinha, Kumares C.] Purdue Univ, Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mannering, Fred] Univ S Florida, Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENC 3506, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Bardaka, E (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ebardaka@purdue.edu; zhang989@purdue.edu; labi@purdue.edu; sinha@purdue.edu; flm@usf.edu,"Bardaka, Eleni/ABE-1567-2020; Mannering, Fred/K-8808-2013","Mannering, Fred/0000-0002-2803-4582; Bardaka, Eleni/0000-0001-8306-4939",,,,40,2,2,1,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Previous approaches using experience, gradient search, fuzzy numbers, and analytic hierarchy process are limited in their provision of optimal solutions. This study therefore investigates a GA for weight generation and applies it to real project data. When compared to a conventional construction cost estimation model, the accuracy of the CBR- and GA-based construction cost estimation model was verified. It is expected that a more reliable construction cost estimation model could be designed in the early stages by using a weight estimation technique in the development of a construction cost estimation model.","[Kim, Kyong Ju; Kim, Kyoungmin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea","Kim, K (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",kjkim@cau.ac.kr; kmkim@wm.cau.ac.kr,,,"Ministry of Land, Transport [06 CIT A03]; Maritime Affairs of the Korean Government","This research was supported by a grant (Grant No. 06 CIT A03) from the Research Policy and Infrastructure Development Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs of the Korean Government.",,27,46,47,2,33,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

From the view of international construction ventures, cost comparisons have generally been accomplished using. published currency exchange rates. Global organizations dealing with development aid and the comparison of the gross domestic product (GDP) of nations have used an approach that has its roots in established econometric theories. This approach is based on the Casselian purchasing power parity (PPP) doctrine that essentially conducts the comparison based on the local purchasing power of currencies, as opposed to exchange rates. The World Bank, which conducts the GDP comparison, uses the PPP-based approach to compare construction sector output. This paper provides an overview of the background and application of PPP and its use for international cost comparisons conducted for various nations. Methods currently used for construction cost comparisons are reviewed. A critical review of domestic construction cost comparison approaches is provided with the intent to identify the key differences between temporal and spatial comparisons. Case studies of construction Cost factors are used to demonstrate the importance of PPP-based cost comparisons for construction economics.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; Arizona State Univ, Del E Webb Sch Construct, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; Morgan State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Baltimore, MD 21251 USA","Walsh, KD (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Mail Code 1324, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",kwalsh@mail.sdsu.edu,"Sawhney, Anil/K-7519-2013; Sawhney, Anil/C-2639-2012; Sawhney, Anil/AAQ-6168-2020","Sawhney, Anil/0000-0002-4988-4893; Sawhney, Anil/0000-0002-4988-4893",,,,33,6,6,0,5,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, a trade-off between project time and cost is required. This in turn requires contracting organizations to carefully evaluate various approaches to attaining an optimal time-cost equilibrium. Although several analytical models have been developed for time-cost optimization (TCO), they mainly focus on projects where the contract duration is fixed. The optimization objective in those cases is therefore restricted to identifying the minimum total cost only. With the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are targeting the increased benefits and opportunities of seeking an earlier project completion. The multiobjective model for TCO proposed in this paper is powered by techniques using genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed model integrates the adaptive weights derived from previous generations, and induces a search pressure toward an ideal point. The concept of the GA-based multiobjective TCO model is illustrated through a simple manual simulation, and the results indicate that the model could assist decision-makers in concurrently arriving at an optimal project duration and total cost.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zheng, DXM (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",tstng@hkucc.hku.hk,"Ng, S.

However, there has been limited research on the effect of such increased private-sector participation on road costs. By using data from 521 public and private road projects in India, it was found that there are significant differences between public and private-sector projects. Public-private partnership (PPP) roads have a longer length, a higher project cost, and lower unit costs than public projects. Although regression analysis indicated that private-sector investment tended to increase unit costs, lower unit costs were achieved for PPP road projects because developers could take advantage of economies of scale. It was also found that the presence of foreign sponsors in the private consortium and prevalence of corruption increased unit costs. Results from a logistic regression analysis indicated that states that were more developed and had lower levels of corruption could be more successful in attracting private-sector investment for road projects.

Using a commonly used set of LCAFs, this paper aims to test the accuracy of various spatial prediction methods and spatial interpolation methods in estimating LCAF values for unsampled locations. Between the two regression-based prediction models selected for the study, geographically weighted regression analysis (GWR) resulted the most appropriate way to model the city cost index as a function of multiple covariates. As a direct consequence of its spatial nonstationarity, the influence of each single covariate differed from state to state.

Through an illustrative case and a real world case, the results demonstrate that improving labor productivity of selected activities by allocating existing crews and management can yield an optimized solution. As such, a decision maker can implement a better optimized technique to reduce a project duration under budget while reducing the risk of liquidated damages.

It is necessary to develop policies for evaluation of the urban infrastructure performance and determining the proper time of maintenance and rehabilitation activities to increase system productivity and expand the system's efficient performance time. In this paper, an algorithm is developed to evaluate the efficiency of urban water infrastructure performance, broken down into costs and benefits, and to determine the optimal time of water distribution network (WDN) rehabilitation using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm is examined in a real water distribution network in Iran. Considering different break scenarios, the WDN's performance within the projected performance period is simulated. The efficiency of the WDN is quantified using a reliability-based indicator, and costs and benefits of its performance are also evaluated. Based on the estimated reliability of the WDN and its calculated revenue, the actual remaining operation period of infrastructure is determined. A threshold of system revenue to costs ratio can be considered for determining the end of system life span; here 0.5 is considered. Based on the results in the case study, it can be concluded that the efficient lifetime of a WDN can be much less than its designed life span (here the efficient lifetime is 14-16 years, while the design life span is 20 years). The results of this study could be used efficiently in large water distribution networks to determine the rehabilitation time and avoiding the high costs of WDN failure.

Executing those tasks manually reduces efficiency and can result in less effective project management operations. In order to improve efficiency of information process flow, various types of construction information management systems (CIMSs) have been introduced to construction projects. However, due to the difficulty of tracking fragmental and illusive data, measuring the cost and benefit of the implementation and evaluating the trade-off remain a challenge for construction practitioners. This paper's contributions to the body of knowledge include (1) proposing a framework to assess tangible and semitangible or intangible costs and benefits of innovative construction technology application, (2) determining costs and benefits of the use of CIMSs by conducting a product-specific case study, and (3) summarizing lessons learned through the application of a CIMS from the first-hand users so that construction managers can avoid pitfalls in other projects. This study provides data collected during real-time immersion in the project as part of the project team over a 6 month period. The study found that the use of CIMSs, coupled with mobile technologies, increased efficiency and decreased clerical time of operations-level construction personnel, and thereby increased value to the project through improved allocation of managerial time.

Many studies have been done in the past and continue to be done currently to understand the underlying causes of construction project cost overruns. However, the empirical evidence of the causes seem not be clear due to the silo approach in understanding the causes of construction project cost overruns. The purpose of this paper is to take the debate a step forward by providing an understanding of the causes of project cost overrun from a system's perspective, especially from a less researched environment. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected and analysed from 131 respondents who were mainly involved in construction works in public procurement entities in Ghana. A two-staged approach was employed in collecting data from the respondents. The first stage involved an interview session with key informants in the construction industry in Ghana to ascertain the detailed causes of cost overrun of construction projects. The second stage focussed on the validation of these detailed factors by a wider stakeholder group through questionnaires. Factor analysis was employed to consolidate these detailed factors into major causes of construction project cost overruns. Findings The results show that there are primarily four major causes of most public sector construction projects cost overruns. These four major causes of cost overruns are poor contract planning and supervision; change orders; weak institutional and economic environment of projects and lack of effective coordination among the contracting parties. Originality/value The study provides more insights as to the critical and major factors that underpin public sector construction projects cost overruns and more importantly provides a basis for common treatment of the multiple risk factors engendering public sector construction projects cost overruns.","[Asiedu, Richard Ohene; Adaku, Ebenezer] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Grad Sch Business, Achimota, Ghana","Adaku, E (corresponding author), Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Grad Sch Business, Achimota, Ghana.",eadaku@gimpa.edu.gh,,,,,,97,10,10,4,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

The research goal is to utilize a real history data in estimating project cost and duration.

Statistical regression models and sample tests are developed using real data of 113 public projects. The model outputs can be used by project managers in the planning phase to validate the schedule critical path time and project budget. The comparison of means analysis for project cost and time performance indicated that the sample projects tend to finish over budget and almost on schedule. Regression models were developed to model project cost and time. The regression analysis showed that the project budgeted cost and planned project duration provide a good basis for estimating the cost and duration. The regression model results were validated by estimating the prediction error in percent and through conducting out-of-sample tests. In conclusion, the models were validated at a probability of 95%, at which the proposed models predict the project cost and duration at an error margin of 0.035% of the actual cost and time.","[Abu Hammad, Ayman A.] Appl Sci Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn, Amman 11931, Jordan; [Ali, Souma M.

An empirical model termed conceptual envelope cost model was developed and integrated into a web-based estimator for conceptual building envelopes (WECBE). The developed model was compared with the traditional elemental cost model for predesign cost planning of building envelopes. Results showed that the developed model provides better accuracy than the elemental cost model. The WECBE as a predesign cost planning tool can assist construction cost professionals in providing useful early cost advice on building envelopes.

In regards to project delivery, lack of senior management support is one of the main issues that impact project outcomes. This empirical research study aims to investigate the moderating effect of senior management support on the relationship between schedule delay factors and project performance. A questionnaire survey method was adopted to collect data from project directors, project managers, civil and construction engineers, project supervisors, and experts from small, medium, and large construction companies from major cities in Pakistan. A response rate of 84% was obtained based on 310 valid responses from a sample of 368 potential participants that received the survey. The cross-sectional data were used to test direct relationships and moderating effects through regression analysis and process method, respectively. The findings indicate that schedule delays in construction projects occur due to lack of commitment, insufficient site management, poor site coordination, lack of clarity in project scope, lack of communication and substandard contracts, in addition to major delays owing to improper planning. Moreover, the relationship between schedule delay factors and project performance is moderated by all dimensions of senior management support, i.e. providing resources, structural arrangements, communication, expertise, and power.","[Ahmed, Riaz; Hussain, Abrar] Bahria Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Philbin, Simon P.] London South Bank Univ, London, ON, Canada","Ahmed, R (corresponding author), Bahria Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan.",riazutm@gmail.com,"Philbin, Simon P/AAG-3947-2019","Philbin, Simon P/0000-0001-8456-3342",,,,141,0,0,7,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

An active nD CAD system was developed that possesses features such as a comparative simulation between the on-site image and a 4D object to minimize interference between processes and a 5D object that is specialized to the resource mobilization level of the field. A telepresence-based nD CAD system was developed based on this methodology, and the practicality of the system was verified by webcams installed on a bridge construction site. Thus, the project manager is not only able to utilize the nD object for visualization but is also able to use the system as a decision-making system to formulate the most appropriate project schedule by comparing the nD object with the actual on-site image.

Ideally, inspection routing and restoration scheduling should complement each other, such that multiple inspection and restoration crews can operate simultaneously and optimally in the immediate aftermath of disaster events. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the interaction between inspection and restoration in postdisaster emergency restoration processes of highway-bridge networks, as well as their impacts on the inspection routing, restoration scheduling, and overall process. This paper proposes an integer program for modeling such inspection-routing and restoration-scheduling problems, accounting for the inspection-restoration interactions, for determining the optimal inspection routes and restoration schedules for damaged highway-bridge networks, with the specific aim of maximizing the networks' travel time as their resilience metric. A hybrid genetic algorithm coupled with an early termination test is also developed to improve the proposed integer program's computational efficiency. The results of a case study using the proposed method and data from China's 2008 Wenchuan earthquake show that, as compared to a traditional sequential inspection-restoration model, simultaneously and optimally performing inspection and restoration can significantly improve highway-bridge-network resilience.","[Zhang, Zhenyu; Wei, Hsi-Hsien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wei, HH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hhwei@polyu.edu.hk,,"Wei, Hsi-Hsien/0000-0002-7024-0726; Zhang, Zhenyu/0000-0003-2167-3303",Hong Kong Research Grants Council (HKRGC)Hong Kong Research Grants Council [25223119],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this research by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (HKRGC) under Grant No. 25223119.

The magnitude of expenditure on these infrastructure projects justifies the search for cost deviation reasons, particularly cost overruns. The existing literature also identifies a tendency towards cost overruns in infrastructure projects. However, the analysis of cost overruns determinants has mostly focused on endogenous project characteristics. This research uses a dataset of 4,305 public infrastructure projects, of which 3,338 are local projects, carried out in Portugal between 1980 and 2012. Exogenous determinants (e.g. political, institutional and governance, and economic-related) are also considered in the analysis. An average cost overrun of 19% (9 billion Euros in volume, with a 1 billion Euros overrun) is identified. It is found that central governments incur on an average cost overrun of 23% and local governments on 6%. The analysis confirmed that projects developed by local governments tend to perform better regarding cost deviations and overruns and that exogenous determinants (particularly the political, institutional and governance environment ones) have a strong impact on cost deviations and overruns. These findings on exogenous factors can help local governments to make better management decisions, enhancing governance and institutional frameworks to improve the decision-making process when launching new infrastructure.","[Catalao, Francisco Pinheiro] Univ Europeia, Laureate Int Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cruz, Carlos Oliveira] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS ICIST, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, CSG Adv, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1200078 Lisbon, Portugal","Catalao, FP (corresponding author), Univ Europeia, Laureate Int Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, P-1500210 Lisbon, Portugal.",francisco.catalao@universidadeeuropeia.pt,"Catalao, Francisco Pinheiro/P-7471-2019; Cruz, Carlos Oliveira/H-7921-2013","Catalao, Francisco Pinheiro/0000-0002-6010-3672; Cruz, Carlos Oliveira/0000-0003-2910-5298; Sarmento, Joaquim/0000-0002-1235-5779",,,,64,10,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Due to the differences in physical characteristics and operational conditions across individual pavement segments, it can be hypothesized that the current practice, which imposes a uniform average user fee to cover repair damage of all pavements systemwide or within specific families, is not equitable. To address this issue, this paper assesses the marginal costs of pavement damage by accounting for segment-specific heterogeneity. To do this, the paper uses a random-parameters (RP) regression model. Through application of the developed model, the paper shows that the M&R marginal cost differs significantly across pavement segments. The results suggest that it is feasible for agencies to develop fee structures that charge different highway user fees for individual highway segments on the basis of the damage the users inflict to the pavement. This outcome can help agencies introduce more equitable charging for the use of their highways.

Performance improvement is the key parameter introduced in the proposed framework. The incorporation of this novel feature facilitates the characterization of retrofit cost as a continuous function of the desired performance improvement. Accounting for the performance gained from retrofit enables the use of the models in determining the optimal level of retrofit. Furthermore, accounting for the model uncertainty facilitates the use of the models in risk and reliability analyses. The proposed framework is applied to create seismic retrofit cost models for masonry school buildings in Iran. A cost database of 167 masonry retrofit projects was compiled and used to create cost models for three retrofit actions, namely, Shotcrete, fiber-reinforced polymer, and steel belt. The proposed framework identifies the most influential variables that govern building retrofit cost. Practitioners can use the proposed framework to create cost models for various retrofit actions to decide whether to retrofit a building and to identify the least costly retrofit action.

From this economic point of view, the optimum occurs when the global cost over the lifecycle of a building is minimized, and the cost-optimal energy performance level is that related to the minimum global cost. To determine this cost-optimal level by evaluating a great number of design alternatives, it is necessary to exploit automated optimization search procedures. The work presented here concerns the application of cost optimal methodology, as defined by European regulation, to a low-consumption single-family house in France. The calculation is performed through an iterative input-output process in a computing environment that combines TRNSYS (R), transient system simulation tool, with GenOpt (R), generic optimization program. The methodology that was adopted allowed around ten thousand building configurations to be simulated in a reasonable computational time. The paper focuses on how the energy system affects the technical and economic optimal design solutions of the building in two different French climate conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There are trade-offs between time and cost to complete the activities of a project; in general, the less expensive the resources used, the longer it takes to complete an activity. Using critical path method (CPM), the overall project cost can be reduced by using less expensive resources for noncritical activities without impacting the project duration. Existing methods for time-cost trade-off analysis focus on using heuristics or mathematical programming. These methods, however, are not efficient enough to solve large-scale CPM networks (hundreds of activities or more). Analogous to natural selection and genetics in reproduction, genetic algorithms (GAs) have been successfully adopted to solve many science and engineering problems and have proven to be an efficient means for searching optimal solutions in a large problem domain, This paper presents: (1) an algorithm based on the principles of GAs for construction time-cost trade-off optimization; and (2) a computer program that can execute the algorithm efficiently.","UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT GEN ENGN,URBANA,IL 61801","Feng, CW (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,205 N MATHEWS AVE,URBANA,IL 61801, USA.",,,"Burns, Scott/0000-0002-1251-7758",,,,22,253,261,0,51,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398",0887-3801,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

However, IPD lacks an accurate cost estimation methodology at the front-end of projects, when little project information is available. This study aims to tackle this issue, through presenting analytical aspects, theoretical grounds and practical steps/procedures for integrating target value design (TVD), activity-based costing (ABC) and Monte Carlo simulation into the IPD cost structure, within a BIM-enabled platform. Design/methodology/approach A critical review was conducted to study the status of cost estimation within IPD, as well as exploring methods and tools that can enhance the cost estimation process for IPD. Thereafter, a framework is developed to present the proposed methodology of cost estimation for IPD throughout its entire stages. A case project is used to validate the practicality of the developed solution through comparing the profit-at-risk percentage for each party, using both traditional cost estimation and the proposed solution. Findings After applying the proposed IPD's cost estimation framework, on a real-life case project, the findings demonstrated significant deviations in the profit-at-risk value for various work packages of the project (approximately 100% of the finishing package and 22% of openings package). By providing a precise allocation of overhead costs, the solution can be used in real-life projects to change the entire IPD cost structure and ensure a fair sharing of risk-rewards among the involved parties in IPD projects. Practical implications Using the proposed methodology of cost estimation for IPD can enhance the relationship among IPD's core team members; all revealed financial deficiencies will be considered (i.e. compensation structure, profit pooling), hence enhancing the IPD performance. Originality/value This paper presents a comprehensive solution for integrating BIM and IPD in terms of cost estimation, offering three main contributions: (1) an innovate approach to utilise five-dimensional (5D) BIM capabilities with Monte Carlo simulation, hence providing reliable cost estimating during the conceptual TVD stage; (2) mathematical models that are developed through integrating ABC into the detailed 5D BIM to determine the three IPD's cost structure limbs; and (3) a novel mechanism of managing cost saving (rewards) through distinguishing between saved resources from organisation level, to daily task level, to increase trust among parties.","[Elghaish, Faris; Abrishami, Sepehr] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Hosseini, M.

The main goal of this paper is to broaden the scope of cost-effectiveness estimates for residential buildings by analyzing the expected costs of damage due to natural hazards in the context of other lifecycle costs. Specifically, the lifecycle cost analysis presented here includes the expected cost of repair due to earthquake and hurricane hazards as well as the energy consumption, in addition to the initial construction, routine maintenance, and home improvement. A case study is presented for a single-family, wood-frame residential building at two levels of hazard-resistant design. The overall expected lifecycle cost is estimated in terms of decision-relevant economic measures. The application of the approach to the case study under different scenarios produces some interesting insights about the sensitivity of the comparative cost analysis to different scenarios regarding the locations, future values, and economic measure of comparison.

The model was tested using 254 publicized collusion cases in China, and the results were verified by online interviews with a fair number of experts with extensive experience. It was found that the embodied collusion cost composed of side payments and administrative penalties has a positive relationship with awarding price. Also, from a box plot, it was found that the embodied collusion cost has a low growth trajectory for lower awarding prices, but remains stable for higher awarding prices.

In order to obtain the variables and their importance rankings, we firstly developed a thirteen-variable framework of the hidden transaction costs through a literature review and semi-structured interviews. Then we conducted a questionnaire survey to collect the importance of each variable. Based on the results, it is possible to group these variables into five factors reputation, cooperation and trust, emotion, time, and execution of judgments by factor analysis. Lack of future cooperation and contractors' reputation damage are the two most important variables, while for owners, project delay is the most severe hidden transaction cost. The findings provide construction practitioners with a deep understanding of the potential hidden loss. Therefore, they will resolve disputes more rationally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

A dual-level multiproject scheduling framework is proposed for optimizing resource allocation decisions and minimizing resource dependencies among multiple concurring prefabrication projects. A resource use robustness index is defined to quantitatively gauge interproject resource use dependencies in derived multiproject schedules. How to apply the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study consisting of three projects sharing limited resources. Further, based on the same case study, the proposed framework is contrasted against (1) a single-project scheduling approach and (2) an open-source multiproject scheduling platform. Compared with those two methods, the schedule generated by the proposed dual-level multiproject scheduling method is the most robust in terms of achieving resource work continuity on individual projects. The proposed research provides production managers of fabrication facilities or project managers of prefabrication projects with more reliable and feasible work plans, which are conducive to ensuring crew work continuity on individual projects and enhancing resource utilization efficiency in a multiproject environment.","[Liu, Jing; Lu, Ming] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada","Lu, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada.",jing.liu@ualberta.ca; mlu6@ualberta.ca,"Lu, Ming/J-8290-2014",,,,,70,9,9,1,42,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

One of the main parameters that helps owners in making better decisions in designing their buildings is to look after the cost perspective on different design scenarios. Thus, this study aims to propose a semi-automated BIM-based cost estimation approach that enables practitioners to estimate the cost of projects based on different design scenarios by an accurate and agile system. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes an integrated framework, through which the cost estimation standard of Iran (FehrestBaha) is linked to the materials quantity take-offs (QTO) from BIM models. The performance of the system is based on connecting the classification standards of UniFormat and MasterFormat to the cost estimation standard of FehrestBaha. A BIM-based extension in the Revit environment is developed to automate the cost estimation process. Findings To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach in cost estimation, it is implemented to estimate the cost of the architectural discipline in a real construction project. The results indicate that the proposed BIM-based approach estimated the cost of the architectural discipline with an acceptable level of accuracy. Practical implications The proposed approach could be used by practitioners to have an agile and accurate BIM-based cost estimation of different scenarios during design process. The semi-automated system considerably reduces the time of cost estimation in comparison to the traditional manual approaches, particularly in complex structures. Owners are able to easily trace changes in project cost according to any changes in components and materials of the BIM model. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides a practical roadmap for BIM-based cost estimation based on cost estimation standards in different countries. Originality/value Unlike the traditional manual cost estimation approaches, the proposed BIM-based approach is not highly dependent on the knowledge of experienced estimators, which therefore facilitates its implementation. Furthermore, automating both QTO process and the required calculations in this approach increases the accuracy of cost estimation while decreasing the probability of human errors or omission occurrence.","[Fazeli, Abdulwahed; Dashti, Mohammad Saleh; Khanzadi, Mostafa] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Jalaei, Farzad] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Khanzadi, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",khanzadi@iust.ac.ir,,"Jalaei, Farzad/0000-0002-3365-5818",,,,68,0,0,18,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

To remain competitive in the market, it is crucial for companies to have an accurate estimate of their projects. Nevertheless, given that very little is known about the scope and details of the project, the conventional cost estimation methods tend to be slow and inaccurate. With the rise of computing power, there is now a tendency to use Machine Learning (ML)-based methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for more accurate cost estimation that can remain reliable in face of insufficient details during the tendering phase. While the use of ANN for cost estimation has been abundantly investigated from the perspective of contractors, there are very limited studies on the development and application of ML-based methods for engineering consultancy firms. Given that the nature of products/services offered by consultancy firms is inherently different from that of contractors (i.e. they are more abstract and less material-based) and also given that the type and level of detail of the available data at the tendering stage is dissimilar, it is important to investigate the applicability of ML-based methods for cost estimation in consultancy firms. To this end, this paper presents an artificial neural network approach for the cost estimation of engineering services. In developing the model, first, the influential factors that affect the costs of engineering services are identified. Thereafter, a model is developed using the data of 132 projects. Subsequently, a heuristic method is developed to systematically improve and fine-tune the performance of the model. Eventually, the findings show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can obtain a fairly accurate cost estimate, even with small datasets. In fact, the model proposed in this paper performed better than those proposed in other similar works. The model developed in this study showed a 14.5% improvement in the accuracy of the model, considering MAPE.","[Matel, Erik; Vahdatikhaki, Faridaddin; Voordijk, Hans] Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Enschede, Netherlands; [Evers, Thijs] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands; [Hosseinyalamdary, Siavash] Bilfinger Tebodin, Tender Management, Hengelo, Netherlands","Vahdatikhaki, F (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Enschede, Netherlands.",f.vahdatikhaki@utwente.nl,,,,,,29,11,11,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Life-cycle cost is the most frequently used economic model that considers all cost elements and related factors throughout the service life of the alternatives being considered. These cost elements and related factors are usually associated with uncertainty and subjectivity. As such, it is important to model the uncertainty arising from the assumed data over the service life of competing alternatives. Probabilistic techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation, are commonly used to deal with such uncertainty or vagueness. However, they have been criticized for their complexity and amount of data required. This paper presents a fuzzy-based life-cycle cost model that accounts for uncertainty in a manner that disadvantages commonly encountered in probabilistic models are alleviated. The developed model utilized fuzzy set theory and interval mathematics to model vague, imprecise, qualitative, linguistic, and/or incomplete data. The model incorporates the equivalent annual cost method along with the Day-Stout-Warren (DSW) algorithm and the vertex method to evaluate competing alternatives. An example application is presented in order to demonstrate the use of the developed model and to illustrate its essential features. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000576.

Given the high risk of the project, to attract private investors the bid documents stipulated that the government would offer risk-mitigation mechanisms such as subsidy payments and a minimum demand guarantee (MDG). Because an MDG has option-like characteristics, the real-options approach is used to analyze the effect of these incentives on the value and the risk of the Metro Line 4 concession project, and their cost and risk to the government. The results indicate that the incentives proposed are effective in reducing the risk, and increase the net value of the project by 36% at a cost to the government of 5% of the total value of the project. Additionally, it is shown that for a given cost, the most effective risk-reduction mechanisms are the ones that include a higher portion of minimum demand guarantees relative to the subsidy payment. The approach developed can assist transportation authorities in designing optimal incentive mechanisms. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000095.

This study analyzes the relationship between early growth and the type of government support/contract received by a firm at start-up. It is based on the observation of 73 microelectronics and communication high-tech firms founded between 1965 and 1980 in various parts of Canada. The main conclusion is that firms starting as government suppliers do significantly better than firms receiving other types of government support at start-up, that they tend to be better organized than these firms, are more export-oriented and generally use technologies and serve markets similar to those of a previous employer.

However, most previous social media-based studies have been solely focused on assessing infrastructure damage, which leads to partial situational assessment lacking the other main types of infrastructure conditions, i.e., functioning and restoration. To bridge this research gap, the present study aims to examine the use of social media for systematically sensing infrastructure conditions following disasters. An efficient topic modeling-based approach is proposed (1) to model infrastructure condition-related topics through incorporating domain knowledge into the correlation explanation, and (2) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of topic engagement levels for systematically sensing infrastructure functioning, damage, and restoration conditions. To demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach, electricity infrastructure conditions within Florida following Hurricane Irma are studied. This research provides a systematic situational assessment of critical infrastructure following disasters, thereby enabling practitioners to make informed decisions in infrastructure management. Also, the proposed approach investigates the interactions between humans and infrastructure systems, which advances human-centered infrastructure management.","[Chen, Yudi] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, 4603 Nguyen Engn Bldg,4400 Univ Dr,MS 6C1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ji, Wenying] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, 1411 Nguyen Engn Bldg,4400 Univ Dr,MS 6C1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Ji, WY (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, 1411 Nguyen Engn Bldg,4400 Univ Dr,MS 6C1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",ychen55@gmu.edu; wji2@gmu.edu,,,Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust [223476],"This work was supported by the Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust (Grant No. 223476).

Additionally, soil sensors exhibit static and dynamic characteristics that are different from those of the surrounding soils and therefore can change the response of the measured continuum. The fundamental premise of this research is that transparent synthetic soil surrogates can be used to overcome these difficulties using digital image correlation (DIC). A system consisting of a laser source and a line-generating lens was used to optically slice the transparent synthetic soil models. A digital camera was used to capture images of the slices before and after deformation. This paper presents a new technique for quantifying spatial deformation throughout transparent synthetic soil models using DIC. The accuracy of the DIC technique was evaluated based on a scheme of predefined digital movement of synthetic soil images. Finally, a model consisting of a strip footing on a synthetic transparent soil is presented. The spatial deformations in the model are evaluated using the proposed DIC methodology and compared with the result of finite-element analysis.","Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas Inc, New York, NY 10018 USA; Polytech Univ, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA","Sadek, S (corresponding author), Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas Inc, 469 7th Ave, New York, NY 10018 USA.",SSadek@mta-esa.org; Iskander@poly.edu,"Liu, Jinyuan/M-4797-2019; Iskander, Magued G/E-7535-2017","Liu, Jinyuan/0000-0003-0488-0263; Iskander, Magued G/0000-0001-8245-1451",,,,34,82,90,1,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

A governmentality approach is used to account for these strategies. A metro rail megaproject in India provides the case for the study. The strategies were identified through a content analysis of 640 project and non-project based Tweets posted by the metro rail organization. We augmented this dataset with the community's response through social media, as well as through semi-structured interviews that captured the project teams' responses. The findings indicate that the megaproject used various strategies: promoting the organization, giving progress updates, appealing to the community, as well as targeting of specific sections of the population. The effect of these attempts at governmentality through branding were observed in community discourses on social media platforms that echoed the strategic discourses projected by the megaproject while interviews enabled us to access the project team's responses. For the project community, the effects included a positive brand image, creating community brand advocates and building support for the project during contentious episodes. For the project team, the effects included job attraction, enhanced job perception as well as the creation of project team brand advocates. The relation between the governmentality instruments and their corresponding effects are theorized in six propositions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA.

The proposed BIM adoption model assesses BIM implementation benefits, costs and challenges faced by SMOs. Correlation between BIM adoption in SMOs and the associated impacting factors, including knowledge support and BIM adoption motivation, is captured through the model. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of BIM adoption in construction was first presented. Research data, collected from 80 SMOs in Australia through a conducted survey, are then analysed. Descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate SMOs' understanding of BIM, and to qualify the correlations among the proposed latent variables impacting BIM implementation at SMOs, respectively. Additionally, this study used chi(2) test to compare differences between BIM users and non-BIM users regarding BIM understanding, interested applications and attitudes towards implementation benefits and challenges. Findings Potential benefits associated with BIM implementation are a major motivation factor when it comes to BIM adoption at SMOs. In addition, existing staff's capability in using BIM tools positively affects the establishment of an organisational knowledge-support system, which determines the decision of adopting BIM eventually. Ultimately, there is a need for further emphasis on staff engagement in the implementation process. Originality/value Results of this study provide an insight into the adoption challenges of BIM in SMOs, given that the focus of previous studies has been mostly placed on BIM adoption in architectural firms and large contractors.","[Hong, Ying; Hammad, Ahmed W.

However, the international construction industry is different from the domestic with respect to resource, regulations, culture, entry strategies, and risk levels among other factors. This paper explores various ways and modes of internationalization for SMCCs under 13 key hypotheses that are relevant to the issues of internationalization from the perspective of SMCCs. To verify these hypotheses, this study used actual data from 560 cases of SMCCs' overseas projects performed between 1990 and 2007. It was found that SMCCs' entry scheme as prime contractors was more rewarding than in the case of subcontractors. Moreover, SMCCs are likely to evolve from subcontractors engaged with home-country contractors to subcontractors engaged with foreign contractors. Also, cultural distance is positively related to performance, but the effects of cultural properties are not as strong compared to the international manufacturing industry. The results are expected to help SMCCs build internationalization strategies by determining promising entry modes, proposing possible evolutionary paths to enter overseas projects, and assessing cultural effects in reference to SMCCs' successful performance.","[Jung, Wooyong; Han, Seung H.; Park, Heedae] Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Du Y.] Georgia Inst Technol, Econ Sustainable Built Environm ESBE Lab, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Han, SH (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",trustjung@gmail.com; shh6018@yonsei.ac.kr; icu@yonsei.ac.kr; duyon.kim@gatech.edu,"seung h., han/C-9330-2013; Kim, Du/B-6445-2013; HAN, SEUNGHEON/G-8641-2015; Han, Seung Heon/G-8862-2012",,"Ministry of Education, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea [2009-0081326]","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), a grant funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Grant No. 2009-0081326).",,61,25,26,2,53,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Although substantial progress has been made in discerning how the data can be used, there is a lack of research identifying possible inequities in that use. Previous research has shown that vulnerable populations use social media less in a disaster; however, the extent to which this social media usage disparity is predictable and the magnitude of that disparity has not been explored. This paper compared the covariance in Twitter activity and social vulnerability factors during a steady-state period prehurricane with that during the perturbed state period following Hurricane Harvey's landfall. These models showed that sociodemographic vulnerability factors better predict Twitter activity during a crisis than do infrastructural damage, that sociodemographic factors negatively influence Twitter activity, and that this phenomenon is strengthened by a crisis. The crisis-specific negative covariance indicates the need for increased consideration of vulnerability factors in social media data-driven management of urban resilience and resource distribution.

However, it remains a challenge to use existing risk assessment methods for detecting and classifying awkward working postures because these methods are either intrusive or rely on subjective judgment. Therefore, this study developed a novel and non-invasive method to automatically detect and classify awkward working postures based on foot plantar pressure distribution data measured by a wearable insole pressure system. Ten asymptomatic participants performed five different types of awkward working postures (i.e., overhead working, squatting, stooping, semi-squatting, and one-legged kneeling) in a laboratory setting. Four supervised machine learning classifiers (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)) were used for classification performance using a 0.32 s window size. Cross-validation results showed that the SVM classifier (i.e., the best classifier) obtained a classification performance with an accuracy of 99.70% and a sensitivity of each awkward working posture was above 99.00% at 0.32 s window size. The findings substantiated that it is feasible to use a wearable insole pressure system to identify risk factors for developing WMSDs, and could help safety managers to minimize workers' exposure to awkward working postures.","[Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour; Yu, Yantao; Kong, Liulin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZN1002, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZS734, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Antwi-Afari, MF (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZN1002, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",maxwell.antwiafari@connect.polyu.hk; heng.li@polyu.edu.hk; yt.yu@connect.polyu.hk; llinkong@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/S-2497-2019; Yu, Yantao/S-6035-2018","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Yu, Yantao/0000-0003-0400-3068; Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/0000-0002-6812-7839",Department of Building and Real Estate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; General Research Fund (GRF) [BRE/PolyU 152099/18E],"This research was supported by the Department of Building and Real Estate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the General Research Fund (GRF) Grant (BRE/PolyU 152099/18E) entitled Proactive Monitoring of Work-Related MSD Risk Factors and Fall Risks of Construction Workers Using Wearable Insoles.

The objective of the current study was to develop a novel method to detect and classify loss of balance events that could lead to falls on the same level by using foot plantar pressure distributions data captured from wearable insole pressure sensors. Ten healthy volunteers participated in experimental trials, simulating four major loss of balance events (e.g., slip, trip, unexpected step-down, and twisted ankle) to collect foot plantar pressure distributions data. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to learn the unique foot plantar pressure patterns, and then to automatically detect loss of balance events. We compared classification performance by varying window sizes, feature groups and types of classifiers, and the best classification accuracy (97.1%) was achieved when using the Random Forest classifier with all feature groups and a window size of 0.32 s. This study is important to researchers and site managers because it uses foot plantar pressure distribution data to objectively distinguish various potential loss of balance events associated with specific unsafe surface conditions.

Considering high risk and cost of offshore operations, module lift planning among multiple offshore platforms with transport vessels is required to be carefully conducted. The lift planning usually contains two main parts: module layout on vessels planning and vessel transport schedules arrangement. In contrast to the current experience-driven module lift planning, this paper formulates the lift planning optimization problem and develops a web system integrating building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information system (GIS) to efficiently disassemble topsides for multiple offshore platforms. BIM provides detailed information required for planning module layout on vessels and GIS contains the management and analysis of geospatial information for the vessel transport schedule arrangement. As for module layout optimization, three heuristic algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FA) are implemented and compared to obtain the module layout with the minimum total lift time. While for vessel transport schedule, graph search technique is integrated with a developed schedule clash detection function to obtain the transport schedule with the minimum sailing time. The proposed optimization algorithms and techniques are integrated into a developed BIM/GIS-based web system. An example of three offshore platforms with eighteen modules in total is used to illustrate the developed system. Results show that the developed system can significantly improve the efficiency of lift planning in multiple topsides disassembly. The developed BIM/GIS-based web system is also effective and practical in the resource allocation and task assignment among multiple locations, such as construction sites, buildings, and even cities.","[Tan, Yi; Cheng, Jack C.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews construction vocational education and training (VET) of major political economies to develop a theoretical framework that guides an in-depth case study of Guangdong. Document analysis, field trip observations, meetings and semi-structured interviews were combined to explore the political-economic environment, political stakeholders and quality assurance mechanisms of industrial training in Guangdong's construction sector. The findings were compared with construction VET of other economies reported in the literature. Findings Construction training in Guangdong is deeply rooted in the local history and culture, under strong dominance of the state, while continually evolves to respond to the fluid market and therefore can be conceptualised as market-in-state. The political stakeholders are embedded within the state to ensure that skills policies are implemented in-line with industry policies. The differences between the training of Guangdong and its foreign counterparts are attributed to their divergent political-economic models. Research limitations/implications As the case study was undertaken only with Guangdong, the generalisability of its findings can be improved through future research within a broader context of multiple provinces of China through both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Practical implications Plausible foreign VET approaches are likely adaptable to the Chinese context only when conducive political-economic environment could be enabled. The findings are useful for developing countries to learn from the VET experience of industrialised economies. Construction workers' training in Guangdong can be improved by strengthening labour regulation at lower subcontracting levels and ensuring the presence of industrial associations and unions for collective training supervision. Originality/value The paper contributes to the field of construction engineering and management with a theoretical framework that guides empirical studies on the influence of the political-economic environment upon the ways political stakeholders develop and participate in construction VET. The exploration based on this framework revealed the position of the vocational training of construction workers in Guangdong in the global political-economic spectrum of skill formation.","[Pan, Wei; Chen, Le; Zhan, Wenting] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chen, L (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wpan@hku.hk; lchen103@hku.hk; zhanwt11@connect.hku.hk,,,Construction Industry Council (CIC) in Hong Kong [200007921],"This work was supported by the research funding from Construction Industry Council (CIC) in Hong Kong [Project No. 200007921].

This paper discusses the development of an interdependent network model for vulnerability assessment by combining the characteristics of community IINs and the design of the maximum flow comprehensive index (MFCI) to describe the performance of interdependent networks based on network flow theory. This study is based on the perspective of an infrastructure manager, and identifies the key nodes of interdependent networks by using the optimal attack strategy when dealing with potential external attacks (i.e., terrorism). It is assumed that attackers are sophisticated and will always choose the optimal attack strategy to maximize vulnerability and minimize the performance of interdependent networks. Because it is difficult to identify key nodes in interdependent networks, we proposed a probabilistic solution discovery algorithm (PSDA) that can accurately calculate the final failure state of interdependent networks regarding the interdependent relationships among networks and relationships inside a network. A case study was conducted to validate the proposed method: using MFCI and PSDA. Moreover, the assessment result was analyzed further with a view to improving infrastructure protection and identifying failure propagation paths. The main contributions of this paper are to propose a vulnerability assessment index system and construct a goal optimization with solving algorithm to provide decision support for the infrastructure managers.","[Li, Yulong; Lin, Jie; Li, Guijun; Gao, Lili] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao] Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Zhang, Chi] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Wang, C (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",liyulong@cufe.edu.cn; SurenessLin_cufe@163.com; ligj@cufe.edu.cn; chaowang@lsu.edu; Czhang@tsinghua.edu.cn; gll_cufe@163.com,"Li, Guijun/AAZ-6202-2021","Lin, Jie/0000-0003-2601-5393","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301175, 71473285]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201606495019]; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project [YETP1001]; CRBC; Fundamental Research Funds for Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71301175 and 71473285), China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201606495019), Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project (Grant No. YETP1001), CRBC research funding for Research on Contractor Risk Assessment of Highway Project in Montenegro, and Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities.

They are employed to connect employees with technical specialists, which should reduce repeated mistakes, improve technical practice, and generate thought leadership. While organizations often implement CoPs as a means for coordinating specialist knowledge, very little is known about how professionals actually locate and connect with one another, making it difficult for organizations to employ CoPs effectively. To better understand how professionals identify and connect with colleagues, this research first conducted social network analysis to identify existing connections within three intraorganizational CoPs comprised of 1,791 members in two organizations, and then conducted and analyzed 77 interviews about dyadic connections to determine how individuals within these CoPs connected. From this analysis, four mechanisms of connection were identified, including organizational control, organizational opportunity, social networks, and non-person-centered searching. These connection mechanisms include a hybrid of social and organizational structures, reinforcing the need to strategically create and manage CoPs in project-based organizations. More specifically, these conclusions suggest that managerial control within CoPs is still an important mechanism to facilitate knowledge-sharing connections within distributed CoPs.

We propose a concept of supply chain quality integration (SCQI) that consists of internal, supplier, and customer integration for quality improvement, and develop a model that specifies the relationships among competitive hostility, the organization-wide approach to quality, three types of SCQI, and quality-related performance. We test the model using data collected from 291 high-performance manufacturing plants from ten countries. The results indicate that competitive hostility has a positive effect on the organization-wide approach to quality, and that both have positive effects on SCQI. In addition, internal quality integration significantly enhances external quality integration with both suppliers and customers. Further, internal quality integration significantly improves all quality-related performance (i.e., product quality, cost, delivery, and flexibility), and both supplier and customer quality integration significantly improve cost performance. Whereas customer quality integration significantly improves delivery performance and supplier quality integration significantly improves quality performance, only internal quality integration can improve flexibility performance. The findings reveal how different types of SCQI are related to quality-related performance and highlight internal quality integration as a core strategic resource for quality improvement. As such, they provide important managerial insights for supply chain quality managers to improve quality-related performance.","[Huo, Baofeng] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiande] S China Univ Technol, Inst Supply Chain Integrat & Serv Innovat, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiande] China Europe Int Business Sch, Dept Econ & Decis Sci, Shanghai 201206, Peoples R China; [Lai, Fujun] Soochow Univ, Sch Business, Suzhou 215021, Peoples R China; [Lai, Fujun] Univ So Mississippi, Coll Business, Long Beach, MS 39560 USA","Lai, FJ (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Business, Suzhou 215021, Peoples R China.",baofeng@zju.edu.cn; xiande@ceibs.edu; Fujun.lai@usm.edu,"Huo, Baofeng/S-4274-2019; Huo, Baofeng/D-7480-2011","Huo, Baofeng/0000-0002-0625-9537; ","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-10-0675]; Major Program of National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71090403/71090400]; Joint Program Grant of NSFC [70931160446]; Hong Kong Research Grant CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [HKRGC: N_CUHK461/09]; Institute of Supply Chain Integration and Service Innovation, South China University of Technology; Asia Institute of Supply Chain Management and Logistics, Chinese University of Hong Kong","The work of B.

A socio-technical approach is used to develop and apply a monitoring and evaluation framework. This framework comprises assessment of longitudinal energy use, in-situ monitoring and qualitative social science surveys in order to evaluate the impacts (on changing individual and household energy behaviours) and effectiveness (on achieving real savings in energy use and carbon emissions) of energy retrofits of 27 owner-occupied homes across six low carbon communities (LCCs). Results indicate that the energy retrofits have been reasonably effective in terms of reducing energy use in dwellings (75% of homes experienced reductions in gas and/or electricity use). The research also reveals wider impacts of retrofits on indoor environmental conditions and behaviours of the occupants. Such impacts, intended or otherwise, may not be always positive; however, the LCCs appear particularly successful in facilitating the households, through increased motivations, capability, awareness and knowledge relating to energy use and behaviours. Insights from the study can help to inform future strategy implementation for reducing energy demand from existing housing to meet national CO2 targets.","[Gupta, Rajat; Barnfield, Laura; Hipwood, Tara] Oxford Brookes Univ, Low Carbon Bldg Grp, Oxford Inst Sustainable Dev, Sch Architecture, Oxford OX3 0BP, England","Gupta, R (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Low Carbon Bldg Grp, Oxford Inst Sustainable Dev, Sch Architecture, Headington Campus, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",rgupta@brookes.ac.uk; lbarnfield@brookes.ac.uk; thipwood@brookes.ac.uk,"Hipwood, Tara/AAI-6168-2020","Hipwood, Tara/0000-0001-6102-8398",Research Council UK (RCUK)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) [RES-628-25-0012]; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/I006664/1] Funding Source: researchfish,The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Research Council UK (RCUK) for financially supporting the EVALOC project [grant number RES-628-25-0012].,,29,23,23,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

However, maintaining cooperation over time is also a significant challenge. Arguing that a major, though neglected, precondition for community resilience is sustained cooperation, this paper analyses the conditions triggering collective action in collective housing communities. Particular attention is paid to micro-level pathways through which characteristics of the common courtyard and the related rules for its use play for the maintenance or decay of collective action. The contours of an integrated theory of sustained cooperation is sketched. Drawing on Goal Framing (GF) theory and Common Pool Resource (CPR) theory, it is argued that CPR management institutions can only be effective in a community in which a normative goal frame is salient. Empirical material is presented from a multi-method comparative case study of four low-income urban collective housing communities in Mexico City in 2010. This evidence corroborates both approaches: the two communities characterized by sustained collective action exhibit a salient normative frame in combination with all elements of CPR managing institutions, whereas the two communities with failed collective action do not meet these conditions. The results suggest that both mechanisms are necessary for sustained cooperation to occur.","[Arana, Marina Montelongo; Wittek, Rafael P.

Each change has led to a new balance in the relative priorities of the needs of industry and those of the citizen. Quality-of-life issues have progressively given way to those of industrial efficiency, although more recently a concern for the long term implications of the built environment for the quality-of-life of the individual citizen, has re-emerged. An illustration is given by the EQUAL (Extend Quality Life) initiative which seeks to improve the experience of buildings and the environment of older people and of those with physical and mental impairments. Analysis of the nature of the research tasks underlying the two themes of competitiveness and quality-of-life raises questions about the future development of building research. Further issues are the future balance of priorities, the appropriateness of various approaches to prioritization and organization of research, quality and standards, and the need to broaden university courses to accommodate a better appreciation of quality-of-life issues.","Univ Reading, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Reading RG6 2AW, Berks, England","Lansley, P (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Reading RG6 2AW, Berks, England.",,,,,,,41,5,5,0,4,E & FN SPON,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON SE1 8HN, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Moving obstacles often occlude the sight of view, and sometimes block the view of interest. However, images are often collected for documentation and analysis of the building under construction or operation. The occluding objects, such as the construction workers, compromise the collected image data. On the other hand, the capability of the Context Encoders model took the pioneering step providing the opportunity of image inpainting. This research applies Context Encoders to remove redundant objects in images and inpaints the background context. The original Context Encoders model, a deep learning model, requires a large training dataset for a decent image inpainting. In the model, the region in need of context inpainting is constrained to be a predefined area, fixed in size and position in the image. In this work, we adapted a deep learning architecture, U-Net, for a direct image -to-image translation for context inpainting, and thus relaxing the fixed size and position constraints in the original Context Encoders model. Simultaneously in a single framework, the proposed model not only erases redundant objects but also inpaints the missing content in the pixel scale, based on surrounding semantic clues. Employing the U-Net yields encouraging results for cases in operating buildings and those under construction.","[Angah, Ohay; Chen, Albert Y.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Chen, AY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",r01521306@ntu.edu.tw; albertchen@ntu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Albert/0000-0001-6702-9834","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [103-2221-E-002-125-MY3, 108-2221-E-002-016]; National Taiwan University (NTU)National Taiwan UniversityNanyang Technological University [107L892501, 108L892501]","The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan for grants 103-2221-E-002-125-MY3 and 108-2221-E-002-016, and National Taiwan University (NTU) for grants 107L892501 and 108L892501 for the support that has made this work possible.

This case study work analyzes the social and semantic networks for the Twitter accounts of four large light rail transit (LRT) projects in North America. These networks portray typical features of social networks: consistent small-world behavior, formation of stable subcommunities, and dynamic variation in topic and issues discussed with changes to the project conditions. The proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects-mainly because the cases were analyzed with an additional focus on the dynamics of social networks of participants. In early stages of the projects, these networks have a limited group of participants. As time passes and more interest is cumulated in the project, the number of nodes increases but the number of connections (between the nodes) does not increase at a similar speed. This reduces the overall density of the network and, at the same time, creates hub nodes. These are influential participants with an impact on the information diffusion and formation of opinions. The subcommunities that form evolve in membership, density, and topics of interest, in accordance with the project progress. Citizens migrate between subcommunities, mainly based on the central topics of discussion and, partially, the addition or migration of influential nodes. The use of the proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects because it showcases a sociosemantic approach for the analysis of stakeholders. This can help decision makers to not only understand what is on the mind of communities, but also track how such thoughts (issues) evolve over time and what the role of key players is in forming or changing the issues. A careful analysis over the project life span can help the decision makers to predict some of these trends and, accordingly, shape the project communication strategy in a more proactive fashion to meet the possible community needs. In the era of unstructured big data, this methodology can help practitioners to study the impact of decisions made or scope deviations in a project on the themes and levels of interest of local communities. Both of these two features will help to transfer public communication in construction mega-projects from a one-way outreach to a two-way interaction: try to understand/predict community issues, gather community interests and concerns, and study how community structure and views change based on the changes made to the project scope.","[Nik-Bakht, M.] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1515 St Catherine W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [El-Diraby, T.

The balanced scorecard approach requires each organization to look at itself from four different perspectives to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance: the financial perspective, the customer perspective, the process perspective, the innovation and learning perspective. Twelve Swedish construction sector companies (clients, architectural-engineering consultants, contractors) with well-established quality systems were studied. The results indicate two important points. First, the balanced scorecard can be successfully used to measure the performance of quality systems in the construction process. Second, the organization and learning perspective is neglected in the Swedish construction process. The use of the balanced scorecard highlighted the fact that a lack of balance often exists between the four perspectives. While it is tempting to conclude that investments in quality systems increase organizational performance, there is little (if any) evidence that this is the case. Many investments in quality systems appear to be based more on blind faith than on facts. Tools are only valuable if they improve results, there is a need for further understanding the costs and benefits of quality systems in engineering and construction organizations.","Univ Lund, Dept Construct Management, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; Univ Lund, Inst Econ Res, S-22007 Lund, Sweden","Landin, A (corresponding author), Univ Lund, Dept Construct Management, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,14,11,11,0,2,E & FN SPON,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON SE1 8HN, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

In addition, a dynamic programming-based genetic algorithm is developed to find feasible solutions and a dynamic programming-based initialization, and crossover and mutation are designed to avoid infeasible solutions. Finally, the Jinping-I Hydropower Project is used as a practical example to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the model.

The primary objective of the audit is to control and enhance the construction quality-management system. Definitions from both the construction and quality sciences are reviewed for appropriateness to the construction facility audit. The functions of the facility audit are compared with a financial-audit. An example of a construction facilities audit performed on resident engineering field offices by the Arizona Department of Transportation is presented, and the general steps are discussed. It is recommended that the construction facilities audit be used by large or ongoing construction programs.

However, the number and locations of cameras are currently estimated according to the experience of managers/engineers, and the occlusion effect is rarely considered, resulting in weak coverage of 3D spaces in practice. To address this gap, a novel approach is presented to optimize camera placements for 100% site coverage while considering the occlusion dynamics caused by sidewalls and supports during excavation in metro station projects. A case study of a metro station project is presented to demonstrate and validate the approach, with results showing that the optimized plans for camera placement have larger coverage than the original plan and better performance in safety monitoring and controlling hazards. Optimized in this way, the plans for camera placement can help managers with effective planning and enhanced safety management of metro station construction sites.","[Zhang, Yongcheng; Luo, Hanbin; Zhong, Botao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongcheng; Luo, Hanbin; Zhong, Botao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Construct Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Li, Quan] Future Land Holdings Ltd, Ctr Project Management Business Dev, 6,Ln 388,Zhongjiang Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Zhong, BT (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Construct Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",dadizhong@hust.edu.cn,"zhong, botao/AAH-3781-2019; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012; Hanbin, Luo/AAH-7441-2019; li, chengqian/AAH-7343-2019","Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; ","National 12th Five-Year Plan Major Scientific and Technological Issues [2015BAK33B04]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51678265, 71732001]","This study was supported by the National 12th Five-Year Plan Major Scientific and Technological Issues (No. 2015BAK33B04) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) (Nos. 51678265 and 71732001).

This paper reports the development of a first prototype for the proactive safety management and real-time signaling of potential overhead hazards. It is expected to enhance standard safety policies and assist inspectors and coordinators in executing their tasks. The system performs real-time tracking using ultra wide band technology and implements proactive virtual fencing logics. The development of the system, its laboratory test results, the algorithm optimization, and the final field test results are reported herein.

To prevent undesired results from adverse emotional and mental states, active interventions for workers are important. Taking scaffolders on site as specific objects, a multicomponent (with two intervention sessions) and neurophysiological intervention during working intervals is proposed in this research. A sample of 10 participants is randomly assigned to either an intervention group or control group. Emotional and mental inducement is conducted in advance to simulate the states of scaffolders in normal working conditions. Then a simple, rapid, and active intervention, consisting of a progressive muscle relaxation session and a trigeminal nerve stimulation session, is applied to the experimental group in a lounge environment for 13 min. For the control group, a normal resting mode (i.e. sitting still) is adopted instead. During the experiment, a wearable electroencephalogram sensor is used to collect electrical signals from related brain regions of a subject. Based on corresponding indices, the emotional and mental states of subjects are indicated by electroencephalogram signals. The combined effects of the progressive muscle relaxation and trigeminal nerve stimulation sessions in adjusting adverse emotional and mental states of high-altitude construction workers are determined by statistical analysis.","[Xing, Xuejiao; Zhong, Botao; Luo, Hanbin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Management, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xuejiao; Zhong, Botao; Luo, Hanbin] Hubei Engn Res Ctr Virtual Safe & Automated Const, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xuejiao; Li, Heng; Li, Jue] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Sci & Engn, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Zhong, BT (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Management, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",heng.li@polyu.edu.hk; lijue@hust.edu.cn; dadizhong@hust.edu.cn; rm.skitmore@qut.edu.au,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; Hanbin, Luo/AAH-7441-2019; li, chengqian/AAH-7343-2019; zhong, botao/AAH-3781-2019; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; Li, Jue/0000-0001-8195-8365","General Research Fund (GRF) Grant [BRE/PolyU 152099/18E]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51878311, 71732001, 51678265]","This research was partly supported by the General Research Fund (GRF) Grant (BRE/PolyU 152099/18E) entitled Proactive Monitoring of Work-Related MSD Risk Factors and Fall Risks of Construction Workers Using Wearable Insoles.

However, little is known about the potential health benefits of high-quality housing in poor neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods with unexpectedly good health outcomes despite high levels of deprivation have been deemed resilient places and housing quality in these areas may be a contributor to this resilience. This study aimed to evaluate whether an indicator of neighbourhood housing quality was associated with a previously quantified resilience index (RINZ) in New Zealand. It was found that areas with high housing quality tended to have higher median income, greater proportions of partnered people and shorter-term residents, and very low proportions of Maori. A positive association was found between housing quality and resilience, after adjustment for deprivation. There was no indication of differences by heterogeneity in housing quality within the aggregate unit of analysis. These findings pose the hypothesis that improving housing quality in similarly deprived areas that have poor health outcomes could potentially boost health. To extend this understanding, further development of a more sophisticated housing quality indicator is recommended.","[Pearson, Amber L.; Barnard, Lucy Telfar; Howden-Chapman, Philippa] Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, 23A Mein St, Wellington 6242, New Zealand; [Pearce, Jamie] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Res Environm Soc & Hlth, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kingham, Simon] Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Kingham, Simon] Univ Canterbury, GeoHlth Lab, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand","Pearson, AL (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Publ Hlth, 23A Mein St, Wellington 6242, New Zealand.",amber.pearson@otago.ac.nz; lucy.telfar-barnard@otago.ac.nz; Jamie.pearce@ed.ac.uk; simon.kingham@canterbury.ac.nz; philippa.howden-chapman@otago.ac.nz,"Barnard-Brak, Lucy/K-2009-2019","Pearce, Jamie/0000-0002-0994-7140; Kingham, Simon/0000-0002-2869-3756",,,,25,5,5,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Two specific types of reinforced masonry systems were considered, both based on concentrated vertical reinforcements and on the use of perforated clay units. This contribution focuses on results obtained by radar and sonic techniques. They were applied in the laboratory on two masonry specimens, which were built with known defects. Tests were also carried out on-site, on real walls of a selected case study. On the basis of the results of these experiments, a fully nondestructive quality-control procedure appears feasible and promising. The data can be collected and analyzed in real time with an automatic classification algorithm. The procedure requires the use of a high-frequency GPR (ground-penetrating radar) system. Depending on the type of masonry system, sonic test equipment might also be required to investigate some specific problems that cannot be diagnosed by the GPR. Feedback from the building sector is now essential to understand the interest in and the potential market for this nondestructive testing application. As a result, new investments could be planned to perform the further testing activities that are needed to standardize the procedure. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000054.

While this problem has received significant attention from researchers, less attention has been given to quantifying the impact of availability of craft labour on project performance. The primary contribution of the current work to the body of knowledge is the quantification of the relationship between craft labour availability and project performance, as measured by project productivity and schedule. Data from 97 construction projects completed in the U.S. and Canada between 2001 and 2014 were collected from two industry databases. The primary analysis shows that projects that experienced craft shortages underwent substantial and statistically lower productivity compared to projects that did not. The analysis also shows a significant growth in schedule overrun due to the craft labour shortages among the same population of projects. Further exploration by means of several regression analyses shows a statistically significant correlation between increased craft recruiting difficulty and lower project productivity and also higher schedule overruns in both project databases. The results are confirmed across both databases and serve as informative models that provide valuable insight for project management teams to perceive the risk that lack of skills poses on project productivity and time performance. Understanding the level of impact that craft shortages are having through robust statistical analyses is a first step in developing the motivation for industry leaders, communities and construction stakeholders to address this challenge.","[Karimi, Hossein; Taylor, Timothy R.

They may not only reduce project duration but also create process uncertainty and ambiguity. We propose that the iteration and overlapping are the main causes of uncertainty and ambiguity in the PD process. Based on discrete-event simulation modeling and analysis with Arena software, our empirical research provides a quantitative method to reveal how uncertainty related to iteration and ambiguity related to overlapping impact on project schedule. In the simulation model, we use four variables to characterize uncertainty: iteration probability, iteration length, number of iterations and activity's learning curve effect. And different sequential and overlapped process structures are used to describe the variable of ambiguity in the model. Propositions regarding the reduction of uncertainty and ambiguity by controlling iteration and overlapping are derived. Simulation experiment results yield and reinforce several managerial insights, including: the relationship between uncertainty or ambiguity reduction and the complexity of iteration or levels of overlapping; and how to control project schedule and hedge the risk resulting from overlapping and iteration.

LEDs degrade slowly - unlike incandescent bulbs that fail catastrophically. When the luminous intensity of LEDs falls below a pre-specified threshold, they pose danger to traffic. The long-term performance and degradation rates of LEDs have not been thoroughly studied in order to gain an understanding of their useful lives and appropriate replacement schedules. There exist many stochastic factors that affect LED degradation rates making their analysis complicated. This article provides a statistical methodology based on ordinary least-squares regression for measuring the useful life and the degradation rate of an LED signal, and presents details from a field study conducted in Missouri, U.S. Our results indicated that signal type, color, and manufacturer affect degradation, and therefore useful life should be calculated for each subgroup of LED traffic signals separately. Results of this research provide a much needed methodology for engineering managers in departments of transportation and local communities for replacing LEDs.","[Long, Suzanna; Gosavi, Abhijit; Qin, Ruwen] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Noll, Casey] Sandia Natl Labs, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Long, S (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, 600 W 14th St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",longsuz@mst.edu,,"Gosavi, Abhijit/0000-0002-9703-4076; Long, Suzanna/0000-0001-6589-5528",Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT); Mid-America Transportation Center,"We wish to express our appreciation to the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and the Mid-America Transportation Center for partially funding this research.

Some researchers have suggested that more incremental SISP in an uncertain environment produces greater planning success, while others have suggested that more comprehensive SISP does so in that environment. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of incremental versus comprehensive SISP on SISP success in environments of varying uncertainty. A questionnaire defined SISP in terms of characteristics of incremental and comprehensive planning. It measured environmental uncertainty in terms of 1) the changeability and unpredictability components of dynamism, 2) heterogeneity, and 3) the scarcity and competition components of hostility. It assessed planning success as a second-order construct composed of alignment, analysis, cooperation, and capabilities. A postal survey collected data from 161 IS executives. The constructs were extensively validated. In general, greater SISP comprehensiveness predicted greater SISP success. Greater changeability and unpredictability, however, weakened the impact of such SISP on success. On the other hand, as the environment became more competitive, more comprehensive SISP led to greater SISP success. These findings contribute by suggesting that planners should expect comprehensive SISP to be less effective as changeability and unpredictability increase, but more effective as competition increases.","E Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; Univ Kentucky, CM Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Newkirk, HE (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",newkirkh@mail.ecu.edu; lederer@uky.edu,,,,,,106,26,27,1,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

However, an asymmetry of information and conflicts of interest exists between the government and the private sector. The moral hazard and the opportunistic behaviors of the private sector present significant challenges to the operational efficiency of UWETP-PPP. To encourage the private sector to operate UWETP-PPP with its real capability and further improve and supplement the incentive contracts, the reputation theory is introduced in this study to design the incentive mechanism of UWETP-PPP in a contract to integrate short-term incentives with long-term incentives and finally to realize a win-win situation between two parties. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) A two-period dynamic incentive model for UWETP-PPP is constructed by introducing a reputation mechanism. (2) The effective conditions for exerting the reputation incentive effects are explored to realize the government's effective incentive to the private sector. (3) The incentive effects of the explicit and implicit reputation incentive on the private sector are analyzed, and the incentive models with and without reputational concerns are compared. (4) The change rules of the private sector's effort level and marginal incentive coefficient with the change in related variables that affect the model are revealed. The incentive contract of UWETP-PPP can be optimized using the proposed dynamic reputation incentive mechanism. This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners concerned with the design of incentive contracts.","[Li, Huimin; Lv, Lelin; Wang, Lunyan; Yuan, Chenhui] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China; [Li, Huimin; Zuo, Jian] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Asian & Middle Eastern Architecture, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lv, Lelin] Academician Workstn Water Environm Governance & E, 11 Weiwu Rd, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Su, Limin] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Management & Econ, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China","Su, LM (corresponding author), North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Management & Econ, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China.",lihuimin3646@163.com; lvlelin1205@163.com; jian.zuo@adelaide.edu.au; suliminlove2010@163.com; wanglunyan@ncwu.edu.cn; yuanch@stu.ncwu.edu.cn,"LI, Huimin/M-9615-2019","LI, Huimin/0000-0001-7494-6745","MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [19YJC630078]; National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFC0406905]; Youth Talents Teachers Scheme of Henan Province Universities [2018GGJS080]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71302191]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Henan (Humanities AMP; Social Sciences), China [2017-cxrc-023]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201908410388]; 2018 Henan Province Water Conservancy Science and Technology Project [GG201828]","The authors acknowledge with gratitude the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (No. 19YJC630078), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFC0406905), Youth Talents Teachers Scheme of Henan Province Universities (No. 2018GGJS080), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71302191), Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Henan (Humanities & Social Sciences), China (No. 2017-cxrc-023), China Scholarship Council (No. 201908410388), 2018 Henan Province Water Conservancy Science and Technology Project (No. GG201828).

We identify structures that balance the tradeoffs between productivity, handoffs, and waiting time. In particular, we seek to better understand the conditions where a task assigned to a single worker should be split into two or more serial activities. A heuristic is developed that considers the tradeoffs and determines the number of workers and subactivities into which an assigned task in a project should be subdivided. We suggest practical applications of the model and provide guidance as to the length of the activity structures within real world settings. Our findings suggest that in many cases tasks should be treated as a single activity node but that there are conditions under which it is beneficial to utilize a tandem structure of two or even more subactivity nodes.","George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Meixell, MJ (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mmeixell@gmu.edu; Manuel.Nunez@business.neonn.edu; atalalay@gnm.edu,"Meixell, Mary/M-1017-2019",,,,,42,9,10,0,25,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

With the rapid development of subway systems in Chinese urban areas, construction workers are being exposed to new risks which are poorly understood and managed. Subway construction projects are large scale and scattered over many construction sites, and involve numerous stakeholders and sophisticated technologies in challenging underground environments. Accident rates are high and have significant economic and social consequences for the firms and people involved. Addressing the gap in research about the safety risk in these projects, the purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of the factors influencing the safety of Chinese subway construction projects with the overall objective of reducing accident rates. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with 399 subway construction professionals across five stakeholder groups. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with five experienced experts in safety management on subway projects to validate the results. Findings It was found that the eight most critical factors perceived by stakeholders to influence safety risks on Chinese subway projects are: project management team; contractor-related factors; site underground environment; safety protection during the use of machines; safety management investment; site construction monitoring and measurement; hazard identification and communication; and use of machines in all stages. This indicates that in allocating limited project resources to improve the safety of subway projects, managers should focus on: developing safety knowledge and positive attitudes in leadership teams; formulating effective risk management systems to identify, assess, mitigate, measure and monitor safety risks on site; improving communications with stakeholders about these risks and effectively managing plant, equipment and machinery. Originality/value This research contributes a new multi-stakeholder perspective to the lack of safety research in Chinese subway construction projects. The research findings provide important new insights for policymakers and managers in improving safety outcomes on these major projects, producing potentially significant social and economic benefits for society and the construction industry.","[Zhang, Shang] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Sunindijo, Riza Yosia] UNSW Sydney, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Loosemore, Martin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wang, Shejiang; Gu, Yajun] Suzhou Rail Transit Grp Co Ltd, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongfei] China Railway 12th Bur Grp Co, Taiyuan, Peoples R China","Zhang, S (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",zhangshfan@163.com; r.sunindijo@unsw.edu.au; Martin.Loosemore@uts.edu.au; 380520910@qq.com; 389138779@qq.com; 120343759@qq.com,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This research is partially financially supported by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.

Abundant studies have focused on cause and effect on fatalities or safety training system, and so on. Most of them on this issue have been emphasized the necessity and utilization of information, rather than how to exchange, share and transfer safety data efficiently in the construction industry. With this regard, this paper proposes the Social Network System for Sharing Construction Safety & Health Knowledge (SNSS), which utilizes state-of-the-art of semantic wild web and ontology construction technologies for better communication and representation for construction safety information. The SNSS is developed on the basis of safety semantic wiki template (SSWT), which consists of the following three modules: 1) A Safety information module (SIM) which upload common accident and hazard information for sharing; 2) A Safety knowledge module (SKM) where the safety information is refined, confirmed and transferred to safety knowledge; 3) A Safety dissemination module (SDM) which allows its users to monitor, manage and retrieve safety information and knowledge easily. The SNSS is tested by a scenario of using falling accident information by which the potentials and limitations of the system were addressed. The study emphasizes the potential applicability and benefits of social network system that could be utilized to enhance communication among participants in the construction industry.

Integration parameters are the basis for adjusting the facility development process so that it produces increasingly higher quality facilities each time the process is repeated. We measured the flow of information iri the facility development process: vertically (between functions such as operations and engineering), horizontally (between disciplines such as process piping and electrical design), and longitudinally (across time). We also measured the plant manager's satisfaction with the operational facility. A study of 17 industrial facilities shows that the three dimensions of information flow are good predictors of facility quality.

Also, it is labor-intensive. In order to overcome these limitations, automated inspection using image processing techniques was proposed. However, the current work can only detect defects in an image without the ability of evaluating them. This paper presents a novel approach for automatically assessing the impact of two common surface defects (i.e., air pockets and discoloration). These two defects are first located using the developed detection methods. Their attributes, such as the number of air pockets and the area of discoloration regions, are then retrieved to calculate defects' visual impact ratios (VIRs). The appropriate threshold values for these VIRs are selected through a manual rating survey. This way, for a given concrete surface image, its quality in terms of air pockets and discoloration can be automatically measured by judging whether their VIRs are below the threshold values or not.

Motivated by the growing interest in online commerce, we focus our research questions on examining the factors that contribute to e-service, the relationships among these factors and the consumers' attitude toward e-service. To explore answers to our research questions, we developed an e-service model. Specifically, our proposed model consists of such constructs as individual differences, e-service convenience, Web site service quality, risk, e-satisfaction, and intention. We develop an e-service quality survey instrument and use empirical data to validate the instrument. The results of our empirical study validate our eight hypotheses. We confirm seven of the eight hypotheses. One hypothesis that tested individual differences and service convenience was not confirmed. However, we found that service convenience, Web site service quality, and risk are significant factors affecting consumers' satisfaction level, which in turn affects intention. The findings suggest that managers need to understand e-convenience from the consumers' perspective. In order to provide better services for users, companies need to invest in Web site service quality design and evaluation, and at the same time, control the perceived risk associated with using it.","No Kentucky Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA; Univ N Texas, Coll Business Adm, Informat Technol & Decis Sci Dept, Denton, TX 76203 USA","Zhang, XN (corresponding author), No Kentucky Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Highland Hts, KY 41099 USA.",zhangx@nku.edu,"CASTRO LOPEZ, ADRIAN/I-1234-2012","Prybutok, Victor/0000-0003-3810-9039",,,,138,114,115,1,70,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In practice, most of construction site layout planning problems are dynamic, multi-objective and uncertain in nature. To enhance the general practice of dynamic construction site layout planning, this paper proposes a fuzzy random multi-objective decision making model. In this model, two objectives are considered: (1) minimizing the total cost of site layout: and (2) maximizing the distance between the 'high-risk' facilities and the 'high-protection' facilities to reduce the possibility of safety or environmental accidents. After stating the problem and presenting the mathematical formulation, this paper deals with fuzzy random variables to propose an equivalent crisp model. According to the characteristics of the proposed model, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) with permutation-based representation is proposed to solve the problem. The approach is applied to the Longtan hydropower construction project to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of scientifically tested propositions, a shifting consensus of beliefs fills the need, and it can take decades of social costs to show the inadequacy of these beliefs. The problem of social theory and the built environment is then defined for the purposes of this paper in terms of the potential for testable propositions at the level at which one intervenes in the built environment. This is called the need for 'design-level' theories, defining design in the broad sense of all the choices and decisions made by built environment professionals in creating and modifying the built environment. Examining social theory under two broad headings, 'urban sociology' and 'society and space', it is noted that both approach the society-environment relation 'society first', in that the form of the environment is sought as the product of the spatial dimensions of social processes. This is called the 'spatiality' paradigm, and note that such approaches have never reached, and probably can never reach, the level of precision about the built environment which would be needed to found testable propositions at the design level. The alternative is to turn the question the other way round and through 'environment first' studies look for evidence of social processes in the spatial forms of the built environment. Recent work of this kind is outlined within the 'space syntax' paradigm and it is shown how the greater descriptive precision this brings to the built environment both permits linkages to mainline formulations in social theory and leads to testable design-level propositions.","[Hillier, Bill] UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England","Hillier, B (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",b.hillier@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,67,53,54,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

This paper aims to identify and assess the key drivers for the implementation of smart sustainable practices in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Inferential and descriptive statistical techniques were employed in analyzing the data collected via an international empirical questionnaire survey deployed in soliciting the perceptions of 220 construction professionals across 21 countries. Factor analysis was used to categorize the identified key drivers into their underlying clusters for further discussion. Also, the data were analyzed based on the various groups and regions of the study's respondents. Findings The key drivers (KDs) are related to the technical competence of staff as well as knowledge and awareness level within the industry, issues related to organizational and project's strategy and policies, availability of financial resources and development of relevant standards and policies to aid its execution among others. A comparative analysis of the perceptions of the different respondents' groups was undertaken and discussed. Originality/value The study has generated valuable insights into the significant drivers that can enhance the implementation of smart and sustainable practices across regions. It is evident that synergy among the relevant stakeholders in the built environment will help accelerate the implementation of smart sustainable practices in the construction industry. The study findings have provided profound contributions to theory and research as well as to industry practice.","[Olawumi, Timothy O.; Chan, Daniel W.

The researchers faced tremendous tasks in optimizing imaging algorithms to speed up the processing at the same time without sacrificing accuracy in identifying and classifying cracks. This paper introduces the automated real-time system and summarizes the experiences in developing parallel algorithms in imaging processing used in the real-time system. The hardware system for processing images is based on the ubiquitous multiple Central Processing Unit (CPU) X86 platform that has the capability of two levels of parallel processing at multiple CPU level and within each CPU level. The former is commonly called Symmetrical Processing (SMP) and the latter is called Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). The paper also presents results of a network level survey with the DHDV and the distress analyzer on a network of about 161 km (100 mil) of pavements. In addition, a manual survey was conducted on the same network of pavements. World Bank's universal cracking indicator (CI) is used in this study. Because the distress analyzer is fully automated and results of the analysis are provided in synch with image collection, the potential cost savings when compared with manual survey methods and other semiautomated survey technologies are tremendous.","[Wang, Kelvin C.

Data from an environmental survey of 26 offices in Europe (the Smart Controls and Thermal Comfort, or SCATs, project) are used. These show that dissatisfaction with one or more aspects of the indoor environment does not necessarily produce dissatisfaction with the environment overall. Conversely, satisfaction with one or more environmental aspect does not necessarily produce satisfaction with the total environment. Building occupants balance the good features against the bad to reach their overall assessment. Not all aspects are equally important in this subjective averaging process. Satisfaction with warmth and air quality is more important than satisfaction with the level of lighting or humidity. The relative importance of the various aspects differed from country to country, making it impossible to develop an internationally valid index to rate office environments by means of a single number. The best linear index constructed from the data failed to rank the indoor environments of the buildings in the correct order, as defined by the occupants' overall assessments. It is therefore wise to assess each of the several aspects separately rather than rely only on a combined index.","Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; Univ Oxford, Ctr Christian & Culture, Regents Pk Coll, Oxford OX1 2LB, England","Humphreys, MA (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Headington Campus,Gipsy Lane, Oxford OX3 0BP, England.",mahumphreys@brookes.ac.uk,,,,,,22,119,120,2,41,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Traditional assessment methods can hardly evaluate the impact of crooked members in existing grid structures accurately due to difficulties lying in crookedness measurement and residual load-bearing capacity analysis. In this paper, a new method of refined model adjustment and structural ascessment with crooked tubular members of steel grid roofs taken into consideration is proposed, while the crooked measurement is conducted with an image-based 3D measurement method for the first time. Firstly, the original shape of crooked members is recovered using image-based 3D measurement method. Secondly, the measured deformation of the crooked members is adjusted from the load status at the time of measurement to the zero-load status in two ways. Finally, the FE model of the entire grid structure, together with the adjusted crooked tubular members is adopted in the residual load-bearing capacity analysis considering both geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity. A large span steel grid roof structure containing four crooked tubular members is utilized for the illustration and validation of the proposed methodology. The proposed method inventively offers a new direction for refined assessment of existing grid structures with crooked members and provides significant potential for practical implementation.","[Liu, Yu-Fei; Fan, Jian-Sheng; Wei, Xiao-Chen; Kong, Si-Yu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, China Educ Minist, Key Lab Civil Engn Safety & Durabil, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiao-Gang; Guo, Xiao-Hua] Cent Res Inst Bldg & Construct Co Ltd, MCC, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Spencer, B.

These accidents cause huge losses because most metro construction is located in the center of very congested cities. Therefore, safety management is a priority in the metro construction industry. This paper proposes an approach for safety management using visualization technology. Safety is integrated with the construction management process throughout the project life cycle. Information from the design phase about construction components and scheduling has been gathered to formulate a 4 dimensional (4D) model. Before construction begins, a rule-based tool analyzes this combined information, automatically detects potentially unsafe activities and conditions and provides instructions for correction. More importantly, actual site monitoring data are continuously compared to the 4D model during the construction process. Therefore, the safety status of related components can be continuously visualized in the system as conditions change and potential safety risks evolve. This paper presents a prototype which was developed and verified with a case study of a real project. The results show that the proposed approach can be a tool of collaboration, virtual analysis and prediction for designers, site project managers, safety engineers and other participants. With real-time safety status visualized, it can detect safety risks before and during the construction process and then provide preventive measures. Thus, timely decisions can be made to avoid accidents. This contributes to the success of safety management in the metro construction industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ding, L.

Schedule estimates of tunnel construction projects are subject to major uncertainties caused by uncertain geologic conditions and risks. This research presents an adaptive cyclic operation network simulation (CYCLONE) simulation technique to predict the schedule of tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunneling and quantifies the impacts of geologic risks along a tunnel in the design phase. A geologic prediction model is integrated with expert judgments to evaluate the probabilistic geologic risks along the tunnel alignment. An adaptive CYCLONE simulation technique is developed to flexibly adjust the durations, arrangements, and modes of construction operations in response to the occurrences of geologic risks and changes of geologic conditions. The applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated by an illustrative case study-Jinping (JP) hydraulic tunnel project in southwest China. The simulation results indicate that this project has a high risk of delays caused by geologic hazards. The analysis of the simulation results reveals that the schedules of tunneling and the uncertainty in the schedules will be underestimated if geologic risks are not considered well in the simulation. The incorporation of geologic risks and the adaptability of the simulation model would lead to a more accurate and robust simulation.

To ensure that design interventions are safe for construction workers to build and maintain, design firms need to have the appropriate organisational capability in respect of DfOSH. However, empirical insight regarding the attributes that constitute DfOSH organisational capability is lacking. The purpose of this paper, which trailblases the subject of DfOSH organisational capability in construction, is to address two key questions: what organisational attributes determine DfOSH capability? What is the relative priority of the capability attributes? Design/methodology/approach The study employed three iterations of expert focus group discussion and a subsequent three-round Delphi technique accompanied by the application of voting analytic hierarchy process. Findings The study revealed 18 capability attributes nested within six categories, namely: competence (the competence of organisation's design staff); strategy (the consideration of DfOSH in organisation's vision as well as the top management commitment); corporate experience (organisation's experience in implementing DfOSH on projects); systems (systems, processes and procedures required for implementing DfOSH); infrastructure (physical, and information and communication technology resources); and collaboration (inter- and intra-organisational collaboration to implement DfOSH on projects). Whilst these categories and their nested attributes carry varying weights of importance, collectively, the competence-related attributes are the most important, followed by strategy. Originality/value The findings should enable design firms and other key industry stakeholders (such as the clients who appoint them) to understand designers' DfOSH capability better. Additionally, design firms should be able to prioritise efforts/investment to enhance their DfOSH capability.","[Manu, Patrick] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Poghosyan, Anush] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed] Univ West England, Fac Environm & Technol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mahdjoubi, Lamine; Akinade, Olugbenga O.] Univ West England, Bristol, Avon, England; [Gibb, Alistair] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Behm, Michael] East Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Manu, P (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",patrick.manu@manchester.ac.uk,"; Manu, Patrick/N-9004-2013","Poghosyan, Anush/0000-0002-9400-1578; Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed/0000-0001-7757-8562; Manu, Patrick/0000-0001-7766-8824","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N033213/1, EP/N033213/2]","This research was funded by The UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant Nos: EP/N033213/1 and EP/N033213/2).

Construction work is tough and physically demanding, and the difficulty is exacerbated by the hot and humid weather of tropical and subtropical regions. Having established heat stress models through different environmental indicators, this study aims to ascertain which environmental indicator would be better able to predict the effects of heat stress on construction workers. Field studies were conducted during the summer in Hong Kong from July 2011 to August 2011. Physiological, work-related, environmental, and personal parameters were measured to validate the established heat stress models on the basis of 411 sets of synchronized meteorological and physiological data collected from construction workers on two different construction sites. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Theil's U inequality coefficient were used to assess these models in terms of predictive accuracy. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) was found to have the highest validity (MAPE=6.5%; Theil's U inequality coefficient=0.05) and practicality in predicting the effects of heat stress on construction workers. Specific heat stress guidelines can be formulated based on the WBGT, which can protect the health and safety of site personnel working in hot and humid weather conditions.","[Yi, Wen; Chan, Albert P.

Current compaction quality assessment methods, such as graphical reports or simple prediction models, are imprecise and can cause unobserved quality assessment defects. These methods do not comprehensively consider factors that affect the compaction quality because they do not integrate heterogeneous construction data sets collected by different data acquisition systems. In this research, a method of assessing compaction quality on the basis of support vector regression (SVR), the chaos-based firefly algorithm, is presented. The assessment method has three stages. In the first stage, a chaotic firefly algorithm (CFA) is proposed to optimize the SVR hyperparameters. In the second stage, a multisource heterogeneous data integration subsystem based on the compaction monitoring system is designed, in which compaction monitoring data, material source statistical data, and detected data from test pits are integrated. Finally, the optimized SVR is used to evaluate the compaction quality of the storehouse surface. The significance of the proposed method is threefold: first, it integrates both chaos theory and the firefly algorithm to optimize the SVR hyperparameters; second, it integrates heterogeneous construction data, allowing comprehensive consideration of factors that affect the compaction quality; and third, it has high prediction accuracy because it implements structural risk minimization. Compared with current models based on empirical risk minimization, the proposed method performs the best according to several error measures.

Like in the original study, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract fundamental attributes from raw incident reports and machine learning models are trained to predict safety outcomes. The outcomes predicted here are injury severity, injury type, body part impacted, and incident type. However, unlike in the original study, safety outcomes were not extracted via NLP but were provided by independent human annotations, eliminating any potential source of artificial correlation between predictors and predictands. Results show that attributes are still highly predictive, confirming the validity of the original approach. Other improvements brought by the current study include the use of (1) a much larger dataset featuring more than 90,000 reports, (2) two new models, XGBoost and linear SVM (Support Vector Machines), (3) model stacking, (4) a more straightforward experimental setup with more appropriate performance metrics, and (5) an analysis of per-category attribute importance scores.

Unfortunately, current risk assessment strategies are problematic because they require every new infrastructure feature and construction method to be individually evaluated using laborious research processes. To enhance the current construction safety management methods, an attribute-based risk identification and analysis method is presented that helps designers and preconstruction planners identify and model safety risk independently of specific activities or building components. The inspiration for this new risk management technique was derived from the Human Genome Project, which implies that while there are billions of people around the world, their vulnerability towards specific kinds of disease can be explained by a limited number of genes. This concept for attribute-based risk assessment was adapted by testing the hypothesis that injuries and fatalities in construction result from a finite number of hazardous attributes of the work environment. The research reported in this paper includes content of large, representative, and reliable national database of 1,812 injury reports of struck-by incidents. The combined manual and automated content analysis procedure was created for this specific application to overcome the challenges associated with a large and complex dataset. In total, 22 safety risk attributes that lead to struck-by incidents were identified and their relative risks were quantified. The results can be used by practitioners to integrate robust safety risk data into technological models and management systems, thereby facilitating proactive safety management. The contribution of fundamental and empirical attribute-based safety risk data fills a knowledge gap that has long prevented the integration of empirical safety data with technological models. It is expected that this new knowledge will serve as a catalyst for proactive safety management in emerging technologies.

Incorporating recent contributions from the fields of inertial-based step detection and vision-based egomotion estimation, this paper develops and evaluates infrastructureless inertial and visual systems to ubiquitously localize people in construction environments. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments demonstrate that a lightweight, portable, and cost-effective hybrid inertial-vision tracking system provides the most promise for accurate, precise, and robust localization of mobile users in construction environments. It achieves, on average, an accuracy of around 1% of the total traveled distance, compared to the INS and vision systems that provide an accuracy of less than 2% and 3% of the total traveled distance respectively.

In this regard, the use of building information modelling (BIM) tools has arisen as a new trend in the construction industry to improve the sustainable assessments of buildings in the design phase. For that purpose, current approaches either focus on the use of BIM together with several programs, or solely use it for an automatic quantity take-off. However, as noted in the literature, the lack of semantic information within BIM models can lead to ineffective decision-making processes and models that are unsuitable for the operation and maintenance stages. Therefore, the present study explores the potential of BIM as a repository for the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) information, and how that information should be used for an environmental and economic analysis. By doing so, the authors intend to discuss the potential of BIM as a data repository and its capacity for supporting an automatic/semi-automatic environmental and economic assessment. A BIM-LCA/LCC framework was proposed, which led to the development of an information delivery manual and a model view definition (IDM/MVD), using the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, for the integration and exchange of information within a BIM-based environment. Finally, the authors implemented the proposed framework with a case study. It is observed that, although most recent IFC schemes already consider some of the required information, a considerable number of properties are still required to conduct a comprehensive LCA and LCC analysis. Thus, the work presented here contributes to the existing background knowledge necessary for future implementations of BIM-based LCA/LCC and for software developers to develop a suitable BIM-LCA/LCC tool.","[Santos, Ruben; Pyl, Lincy] Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Costa, Antonio Aguiar; Silvestre, Jose D.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal","Santos, R (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Ruben.Santos@vub.be,"Silvestre, Jose Dinis/C-1699-2009; Santos, Ruben/F-1284-2014; Costa, Antonio Aguiar/G-2467-2010","Silvestre, Jose Dinis/0000-0002-3330-2000; Santos, Ruben/0000-0001-8300-1516; Costa, Antonio Aguiar/0000-0002-5123-4451","Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB); Department of Mechanics of Materials and Constructions (MeMC); CERIS Research Centre, Institute Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa; FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; BIMcert project [H2020-EE-2017-11-14]","The authors wish to acknowledge the feedback provided by the anonymous reviewers and Automation in Construction journal that improved the quality of this article.

The design of these local systems has traditionally been based on simplistic approaches that fail to account for performance and integration. Given the extra demands associated with climate change, these limitations will take on increasing importance due to the potential for site-level flooding or water damage. To address the concerns, new tools are needed to describe and assess performance as well as to enable a more integrated approach. Research is presented on the development of an integrated property-level drainage simulation model and associated whole-life costing model. Application of the model illustrates the importance of accounting for flow interactions in order to assess the hydraulic effectiveness of different adaptation schemes.

This common assumption is not backed up by recent research and should be questioned.

Transitioning from the visualization and prototyping stages into functional and actual part replacement opens further design possibilities. Among the diverse applications of AM, construction applications have not yet seen a commercially available and widely used product in the market. Nevertheless, it has been a subject of interest to researchers in recent decades. There are evident challenges and risks for the integration of AM towards large-scale construction. Therefore, progress in their commercialization seems to proceed at a slow pace, as only a few 3DP trials for large-scale construction can be found in the literature. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based baseline along with progresses in relevant disciplines related to 3DP in construction, which will provide an opportunity to experts in all domains to understand the multidimensional constraints and to specify the future research directions in these sectors. The distinct merit of this article is that it provides, for the first time, a diverse review on literature in the field of construction 3D printing. It offers up-to-date and in-depth information of hindrances (from processes, materials, structural design and standards) which add up towards low pace of automation in construction sector, identify deficiencies in the current research and provides future research trends for researchers. The findings from intensive literature review will guide engineers, designers and investors from construction sector to grab research gaps and business opportunities. First of all, the development of different 3DP processes in built environment are presented to highlight the process constraints along with the commercial applications of these processes for industrialists and investors to identify the business opportunities. Secondly, process parameters and difficulties in optimization of material mixtures are presented as a guide to civil engineers following the discussion on materials urging the need for development of eco-efficient and environment friendly materials. Conclusions drawn from discussion in individual sections along with issues/constraints and challenges involved are explained separately.","[Al Rashid, Ans; Khan, Shoukat Alim; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G.; Koc, Muammer] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar","Al Rashid, A; Koc, M (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar.",anrashid@hbku.edu.qa; mkoc@hbku.edu.qa,"Rashid, Ans Al/ABA-7272-2020; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./AAH-6959-2020; Koc, Muammer/A-3228-2015","Rashid, Ans Al/0000-0002-1563-8539; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./0000-0002-7416-5153; Koc, Muammer/0000-0001-6543-8116",Qatar National Library (QNL); Scientific and Technological Research Council of TurkeyTurkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [AICC02-0429-190014]; Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) [AICC02-0429-190014],"Authors would like to acknowledge Qatar National Library (QNL) for supporting open access publication.

However, IS project selection is difficult because there are lots of factors to be considered, such as business goals, benefits, project risks and limited available resources. In fact, IS project selection takes place in an incomplete, vague and uncertain information environment. The aim of this paper is to present a multiple-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) for selecting an information system project based on the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy integral. In this paper, the subjective opinions of decision makers are described in linguistic terms expressed in trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. After aggregating the fuzzy ratings of all decision makers, the vertex method is applied to transform the aggregated fuzzy rating into a crisp value. And then, a new algorithm is developed to deal with the IS projects selection problems. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the procedure for the proposed method.

Previous research has not clearly distinguished between SMS factors and accident precursors. This background examines the relationships between SMS factors and accident precursors using empirical data. Specifically, five structural equation models (SEMs) were developed to map causal paths between SMS factors and accident precursors. Each of the SEMs helps identify what specific SMS factors would have a significant influence on the occurrence of a particular type of accident precursor. These models can thus help describe what specific SMS factors would need to be improved when a certain type of accident precursor appears on site. The SEM results show in particular that the occurrence of accident precursors can be attributed largely to adverse project conditions such as project schedule pressure, reworks, and change orders. Construction organizations may capitalize on these findings by prioritizing safety management resources to address specific observed accident precursors in a more informed and targeted manner.","[Pereira, Estacio] Univ Nottingham, Dept Civil Engn, Coates Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Ahn, Seungjun] Univ South Australia, Sch Nat & Built Environm, North Terrace & Frome Rd, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Han, SangUk] Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Abourizk, Simaan] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-203 D-ICE,9211 116 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada","Abourizk, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-203 D-ICE,9211 116 St, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",estacio.pereira@nottingham.ac.uk; jun.ahn@unisa.edu.au; sanguk@hanyang.ac.kr; abourizk@ualberta.ca,"AHN, SEUNGJUN/L-7000-2016; Pereira, Estacio/S-9092-2017","AHN, SEUNGJUN/0000-0001-7427-8986; Pereira, Estacio/0000-0002-1654-1827; AbouRizk, Simaan/0000-0002-4788-9121",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [CRDPJ 492657],"This research was made possible by the financial support of a Collaborative Research and Development Grant No. (CRDPJ 492657) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

However, due to the imperfections inherent in real-world sensor data, the collected location data might be imperfect (missing, uncertain, erroneous, and inconsistent). Among those types of imperfection, error is one of the most common. In many cases, jobsite safety monitoring applications are built on the assumption that the collected location data represent the exact situation, which might not be true due to erroneous data. However, data errors and their potential impacts on the decisions in autonomous jobsite safety monitoring systems have not been substantially studied. This paper describes an autonomous jobsite safety monitoring testbed developed to collect data from location-aware sensors. The authors developed six jobsite crane-safety monitoring test scenarios to replicate the construction activities on a full-scale jobsite and used the collected data, as well as simulated sensor data at various error levels, to quantify the impacts on decision-making performance in terms of precision and recall of workers' dangerous situations. The results indicated that the worst performance appears near the transition area of different risk levels (red to yellow/yellow to green) and the performance degrades significantly after the standard deviation of the localization errors reaches 2 cm in the testbed, corresponding to 2 m in a jobsite. The study provides researchers with an understanding of how much data errors impact safety monitoring system performance and guide future research directions.

Real options valuation methods are the available approaches for valuing project flexibilities, whereas they have shortcomings in considering managers' reasonable risk preferences in project decisions. Therefore, researchers have suggested approximating the perspective on risk of real options methods and practitioners in project management. This study proposes a fair real options valuation for project-based environments by a behavioral economic approach, which adopts binomial lattice method, Monte-Carlo simulation, and cumulative prospect theory. The results show that behavioral factors such as 'risk attitude' and 'loss aversion' should be accepted in project investment decisions while limited to an acceptable amount depending on the project conditions (e.g. uniqueness of decision-making scenarios).

The objective of this research is to systematically gain an in-depth understanding of research trends as well as reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area. To achieve this objective, this research explores the state-of-the-art in VR applications for the built environment by a mixed quantitative-qualitative review method. A total of 229 journal articles are collected using a structured data acquisition approach from Scopus and then fed into a bibliometric analysis to construct science maps. By doing so, the main research outlets, articles, and themes of this research field are quantitatively identified. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative discussion is presented to provide deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities of main research topics. Furthermore, future research directions are proposed as follows: 1) user-centered adaptive design, 2) attention-driven virtual reality information systems, 3) construction training systems incorporating human factors, 4) occupant-centered facility management, and 5) industry adoption.

The authors previously studied a worker's gait movements (measured by Wearable Inertial Measurement Units, WIMUs), providing evidence for the pertinence of collecting workers' gait information to identify fall hazards in a steelwork environment. However, gait parameter measurement accuracy has not been examined in settings with different walk-path conditions and hazards, like those in construction environments. To address this knowledge gap, this study evaluates the accuracy of a WIMU-based gait parameter measurement and examines each gait parameter's ability to distinguish hazardous conditions. Data collection was performed in a laboratory environment with both a WIMU-based system and a marker-based motion tracking system (i.e., the reference system). The presented WIMU-based approach resulted in a 6.48 mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in a non-hazard condition and manifested comparable performance for distinguishing hazardous environments compared to the reference motion tracking system. The results of this study indicate the validity of an ambulatory gait parameter measurement and demonstrate an opportunity to measure changes in gait parameter values caused by hazards.","[Yang, Kanghyeok; Ahn, Changbum R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, 330B Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Kim, Hyunsoo] Gyeongnam Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architectural Engn, 33 Dongjin Ro, Jinju Si 52725, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea","Ahn, CR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, 330B Francis Hall, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.",kyang12@tamu.edu; ryanahn@tamu.edu; hkim@gntech.ac.kr,"Ahn, Changbum Ryan/AAG-6251-2019; Ahn, Changbum R/R-6837-2017","Ahn, Changbum Ryan/0000-0002-6733-2216; Ahn, Changbum R/0000-0002-6733-2216",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1800310],"The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Terry Stentz - Associate Professor, Durham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction, University of Nebraska at Lincoln; Dr. Nicholas Stergiou- Professor, Department of Biomechanics, University of Nebraska at Omaha; and Benjamin Senderling- Biomechanical Engineering Technician, Center for Research in Human Movement Variability, University of Nebraska at Omaha -for conducting the experiment and analyzing data.

Effective strategy enables construction firms to match their activities to the changing environment and achieve superior performance in competition. Therefore, there is a need for studying contractors' competitive strategies. This paper does that in relation to the Hong Kong construction industry. The impact of competition environment on contractor performance, and the relationship between competitive strategy and performance are examined by a questionnaire survey. The findings show that competition environment has a great impact on contractor performance, and four generic competitive strategies have been applied by contractors. Contractors can indeed be classified into four groups according to their different strategic orientations: prospectors, analyzers, defenders, and reactors. As a result, the strategies that contractors should pursue in the local construction industry can be identified with confidence. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000407.

However, many factors have caused fires at construction sites, where workers are in close proximity and large amounts of materials and machinery are stored. Traditional smoke- and temperature-based sensors cannot be used because of the open-environment conditions and environmental complexities of construction sites. Moreover, traditional fire management on site mainly relies on artificial patrol mode, which is inefficient. Most previous studies focused on traditional real-time fire monitoring of constructed buildings. Therefore, a new, intelligent, and effective method should be developed for real-time fire monitoring of construction sites. The current study proposed a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which is suitable for various construction environments and can recognize real-time fires on site. This research built a fire-recognition model and developed a real-time construction fire detection (RCFD) system. Experiments were conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed system in different environmental conditions. Experimental results showed that the fire detection model based on the CNN algorithm can be applied to various field construction environments, and the recognition accuracy is above 90%. This study used a data-driven method to solve the problem of construction fire safety management. Results indicate that the RCFD system can guide project teams in the timely detection of fires on construction sites, improvement of safety management efficiency, and reduction of fire-related losses.","[Su, Yang; Mao, Chao; Liu, Guiwen] Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Rui] Curtin Univ, Sch Design & Built Environm, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Wang, Jun] Deakin Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong Waterfront Campus,Locked Bag 20001, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia","Mao, C (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",suyang0814@cqu.edu.cn; maochao1201@126.com; rui.jiang2@postgrad.curtin.edu.au; gwliu@cqu.edu.cn; jun.wang1@deakin.edu.au,,", Rui/0000-0001-5007-5746; Wang, Jun/0000-0003-3384-4050",National Social Science Foundation of China [19BGL278]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0701807]; Chongqing University through the Special Social Science Research Program of the Central Universities Fundamental Research Foundation [2019CDSKXYJSG0041],"This study was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 19BGL278), National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0701807), and by Chongqing University through the Special Social Science Research Program of the Central Universities Fundamental Research Foundation (Grant No. 2019CDSKXYJSG0041).",,47,1,1,36,46,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

(2015), who posited the Uncertainty Kaleidoscope as a framework for identifying uncertainties. Our findings are that the six determinants of project uncertainty are similar across both civil nuclear and aerospace projects. The most commonly mentioned determinant of project uncertainty was the Environment, followed by Complexity, Capability and Information. The impact of Time on project uncertainty and Individual perceptions of uncertainty were mentioned less frequently by respondents. Our key contribution is to validate the Uncertainty Kaleidoscope over a larger data set, thereby enriching our understanding of the sources of project uncertainty in these two important and highly-consequential project environments.

Especially, in an environment where multiple, often geographically dispersed, teams of workers are involved, it becomes imperative that the information be generated in optimally balanced distributions of project resources, so that it can be disseminated and reused efficiently. We introduce in this study a model to address this problem. The model is validated by formulating its structure on the essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain. To simulate development situations where creative human endeavor is more emphasized than automated applications of routine procedures, we use a set of human-centered input decision variables and examine the optimal output production relative to their dynamics and control. Our model is not tied to the characteristics of any individual project per se but can be easily modified and generalized to address other allied types of production situations. Simulations are performed for a variety of practical decision-making scenarios. Our results suggest that workers' contextual work experience, interactions, and background learning all govern production optimality, although nonuniformly in distinct temporal domains of development.","Natl Inst Sci Technol & Dev Studies CSIR NISTADS, Council Sci & Ind Res, New Delhi 110012, India","Ghosh, J (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sci Technol & Dev Studies CSIR NISTADS, Council Sci & Ind Res, New Delhi 110012, India.",jghosh20770@gmail.com,,,,,,49,1,1,1,30,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock.","[Mathur, Ajay] Energy & Resources Inst, Delhi, India","Mathur, A (corresponding author), Energy & Resources Inst, Delhi, India.",dg@teri.res.in,,,,,,13,3,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

While establishing the applicability of the proposed simulation procedures, this study demonstrates that the simulated cost results present superior simulation accuracy in addition to separating the principal work items and unit price component model.

This is why there has been much interest lately in cost prediction models that use case-based reasoning (CBR). It has been pointed out, however, that existing CBR-based cost prediction models may yield inaccurate results even though they could survey optimal similar cases, if the number of cases in the case base is not enough. As opposed to the existing CBR-based construction cost prediction models, this study developed a CBR revision model that reflects the revise phase of the CBR cycle (retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain) based on nine multifamily housing projects executed recently by A Housing Corporation. To verify the developed model, a case study was performed using three case projects completed by B and C Housing Corporations. The result showed that the prediction error ratio after the Revise (I) phase decreased from 97.44 to 22.58%.

The implementation of the concept began with analysis of the issue and identification of relevant stakeholders followed by a goal analysis. Combining the gained goal tree and its objectives and criteria with the multicriteria decision-making methods analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method For Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) II, the priority ranking of schools' facilities was determined. Afterward, using budget and/or other constraints introduced by the PROMETHEE V method, several different sets of schools to be sequentially funded in the following investment years were defined. Depending on introduced constraints, three policy design styles were defined (budget, spatial-functional, and combined) and compared mutually, and one was selected.

Coping with either natural or built environments in isolation is extremely challenging in its own right (e.g. built environments at different scales: a single building, a collection of buildings, a neighbourhood or a city are in themselves very complex). In the Anthropocene era, where human activities shape the planetary system in which built and natural environments are becoming more tightly linked across scales, these complex systems need to be considered as elements in a global network, i.e. as a coupled social-ecological system (SES) at the global scale. In the context of this spiralling complexity, multi-scale and multilevel processes become more important and design/management problems become extraordinarily difficult. Preliminary ideas are explored for how research on this multilevel design problem might proceed. Specifically, based on combining insights from a collection of theories and models based on resilience and robustness concepts, the basic elements of a new approach are presented that recognizes the importance of self-organizing processes at multiple scales and emphasizes the use of feedbacks to link these processes across scales.","[Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Anderies, John M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Ctr Study Inst Div, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Anderies, JM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",m.anderies@asu.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GEO-1115054],"The author would like to thank Richard Lorch and three anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Application of this system to the study of the design consistency of highways is described, using three examples.","[Castro, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSICCP, Dept Transportes, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Sanchez, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSICCP, Dept Ingn Civil Hidraul & Energet, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Vaquero, Casto M.] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIGC, Madrid 28031, Spain; [Iglesias, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIM, Dept Explotac Recursos Minerales & Obras Subterra, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Rodriguez-Solano, Roberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, EUITF, Dept Construct & Vias Rurales, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Castro, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSICCP, Dept Transportes, Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,"Rodriguez-Solano, Roberto/L-8009-2014; Castro, Maria/B-2618-2010; Martinez, Luis Iglesias/ABF-7231-2020; Martinez, Luis Iglesias/K-7222-2014; Sanchez-Fernandez, Jose Angel/L-2401-2019","Castro, Maria/0000-0001-8941-5795; Martinez, Luis Iglesias/0000-0003-2561-8934; Martinez, Luis Iglesias/0000-0003-2561-8934; Sanchez-Fernandez, Jose Angel/0000-0003-2425-5422",,,,42,24,26,0,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

Cost justification has been a challenging but essential decision-making aspect for smart city projects. Whilst market costs are measurable, non-market costs are often obscure and even intangible. The adverse effects on individuals arising from ICT services are usually underestimated due to the exclusion of intangible elements. This study is devoted to the non-market costs of ICT to users (i.e. Privacy leak, Cyber-attack, Non-availability, and Impediment) and non-users (due to Digital divide) in smart cities. Contingent Valuation is conducted on representative ICT services in Hong Kong which is an emerging smart city. Ordinal regression is adopted to calculate Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for avoiding detriments as the proxy of non-market cost. The results indicate that the WTPs increase with data input needs. Information overload is remarkable in smart cities. Age is identified as a significant determinant through a discussion of influential factors of WTP. The impacts of Age on digital divide are studied with further insights through supplementary interviews. The estimated non-market costs should be incorporated into the Cost-Benefit Analysis of smart city projects for decision-making. Accordingly, policy recommendations on ICT use and security are provided for smart city managers.","[Yang, Wenjing; Lam, Patrick T., I] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hung Hom, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lam, PTI (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hung Hom, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bsplam@gmail.com,"; Lam, Patrick T I/A-7340-2009","YANG, Wenjing/0000-0001-5026-9938; Lam, Patrick T I/0000-0002-2116-6953",Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR GovernmentHong Kong Research Grants Council [PolyU15233116],This work was supported by a grant from the General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government (Project no.

As CBR relies on historical data, it is important to perform data preprocessing to obtain high-quality of base cases. Normalization preprocessing gives all attributes standard scores so that they can be compared. This research examines the effects of normalization methods through performance evaluations of normalization-based CBR models to improve construction cost estimation in the early design stages. Multi-family housing complexes were used as case studies, and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used for model validation. The perfor-mance of the CBR models was evaluated using the mean absolute error rate (MAER), mean squared deviation (MSD), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and standard deviation (SD) for accuracy and stability. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method was used to examine the appropriateness of the normalization methods. The results are expected to contribute to the enhancement of accuracy and stability of CBR-based cost estimation and to support decision-making. The suggested method could also be applied to other CBR areas such as energy prediction, noise management, bid decision-making, and scheduling, as well as other data-oriented methods, such as regression analysis and artificial neural networks.","[Ahn, Joseph] Hoseo Univ, Dept Architectural & Civil Engn, Asan 31499, South Korea; [Ji, Sae-Hyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Construct & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Ahn, Sung Jin] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Informat Stat, 501 Jinju Daero, Jinju 660701, Gyeongnam, South Korea; [Park, Moonseo; Lee, Hyun-Soo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Kwon, Nahyun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Lee, Eul-Bum; Kim, Yonggu] POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, Pohang 37673, South Korea","Ji, SH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Construct & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",josephahn@hoseo.edu; oldclock@snu.ac.kr; ahnsj@gnu.ac.kr; mspark@snu.ac.kr; hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; dreblee@postech.ac.kr; ch61park@postech.ac.kr,,,Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University; Institute of Engineering Research at Seoul National University; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1F1A1058866],This research was supported by the Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering and the Institute of Engineering Research at Seoul National University.

Practical implications - The EVM method, based on the gray numbers, reduces the budget and time shortage risk. Also, using this method, the managers would not be restricted to provide very exact values in their progress reports in the non-deterministic conditions. Originality/value - One notable and significant point in all projects during the execution process is to estimate the project completion time and cost. However, non-deterministic conditions for both planned and actual physical completion percentage of projects have not been considered for predicting the project completion time and cost in the literature.

The purpose of this study is to determine the factors responsible for impacting the cost performance of Ethiopian public construction projects. For this purpose, 35 attributes responsible for impacting performance of the projects were identified and presented to Ethiopian construction professionals in the form of structured questionnaire and responses were collected. The factor analysis conducted on success attributes and failure attributes separately resulted in seven success factors and six failure factors. Further analysis using stepwise multiple regression indicates that scope clarity and project manager's competence have positive impact on cost performance. On the other hand, conflict among project participant, and project manager's ignorance and lack of knowledge have negative impact on cost performance of Ethiopian public construction projects. The findings are expected to assist researchers and practitioners to gain better understanding of the critical success and failure factors and helping them to take proactive measures to improve project cost performance.","[Sinesilassie, E.

However, these models were found to produce limited results because they ignored the impacts on all the preceding/succeeding MRR activities in a multiyear plan when the initially identified implementation time of one MRR activity was adjusted for cost-leveling purposes. This paper proposes a method to generate multiple MRR solutions at the facility level for existing cost-leveling models at the network level. The method utilizes two concepts as follows: (1)the fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate a Pareto optimal set of feasible MRR alternatives, and (2)the pseudoweight vector approach with the Euclidean distance and a confidence interval to select multiple MRR solutions from the Pareto optimal set identified by NSGA-II. The proposed method is applied to a sample concrete bridge deck as a case study in this paper; the results show that the proposed method was able to provide multiple MRR solutions having various profiles in terms of the intervention times of the MRR activities and annual MRR costs. Consequently, the proposed method advances the theoretical framework of existing cost-leveling models by combining four approaches to provide multiple MRR solutions at the facility level: (1)NSGA-II algorithm, (2)pseudoweight vector approach, (3)Euclidean distance, and (4)a confidence interval. In addition, it is expected that the proposed method can be well applied to existing multiobjective optimization models to generate a set of nondominated good policies for infrastructure asset management.","[Yoon, Yoojung] West Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Hastak, Makarand] Purdue Univ, Div Construct Engn & Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cho, Kyuman] Chosun Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Gwangju, South Korea","Cho, K (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Gwangju, South Korea.",yoojung.yoon@mail.wvu.edu; hastak@purdue.edu; cho129@chosun.ac.kr,,,"South Korean Ministry of Education, Science, and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea [NRF-2014R1A1A1004766]","This study was supported by the South Korean Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (NRF-2014R1A1A1004766).",,44,0,0,1,13,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

This study hence investigates road structure deformations identifiable by drone surveys from 40, 50 and 60 m flight altitudes. The surveys were georeferenced in 21 different ground control point configurations using integrated georeferencing. Comparisons between the resulting models and terrestrial laser scanning ground truth yielded the optimal configurations. The determined deformation estimates by using the optimal georeferencing configurations were validated using high-precise levelling results, which yielded the best deformation residual RMSE estimate of 0.29 cm for the 50 m altitude survey. These tests demonstrated that the proposed method can be employed for quick and contactless quantification of magnitude of built environment deformations.","[Varbla, Sander; Ellmann, Artu; Puust, Raido] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Ehitajate Rd 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia","Varbla, S (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Ehitajate Rd 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",sander.varbla@taltech.ee; artu.ellmann@taltech.ee; raido.puust@taltech.ee,,"Varbla, Sander/0000-0003-3031-8645",European Regional Development Fund within 'National Programme for Addressing SocioEconomic Challenges through R&D (RITA)' 'Use of Remote Sensing Data for Elaboration and Development of Public Services' [RITA1/025210]; Estonian Research CouncilEstonian Research Council [PRG330],"This research is supported by the European Regional Development Fund within 'National Programme for Addressing SocioEconomic Challenges through R&D (RITA) ' [grant number RITA1/025210] 'Use of Remote Sensing Data for Elaboration and Development of Public Services'.

Image-based modeling is a non-invasive and low-cost technology that allows 3D reconstruction of objects and scenarios by using only images. However, although several tools currently exist for converting from two-dimensional (2D) to 3D, the specific requirements of quality and completeness for these types of scenarios are difficult to determine. In this paper, a methodology for automatically reconstructing 3D complex scenarios, particularly electrical substations, using images acquired from an unmanned aerial system is analyzed and proposed. This methodology has been incorporated by the Iberdrola Company as an optimal technique for obtaining low-cost 3D as-built metric models of electrical substations. The results obtained show that this camera-based low-cost system is a competitive alternative to laser scanning systems for modeling as-built complex constructions and can become an essential tool for facility planning and management tasks.

First, in the general-random-process-based analysis the probability of accidents in a period of time is calculated. Then, the Markov property of the construction safety risk evolution process is illustrated, and the analytical expression of probability density function of first-passage time of Markov-based risk-accident process is derived to calculate the construction safety probability. In the normal-process-based analysis, the construction safety probability formulas in cases of stationary normal risk process and non-stationary normal risk process with zero mean value are derived respectively. Finally, the number of accidents that may occur on construction site in a period is studied macroscopically based on Poisson process, and the probability distribution of time interval between adjacent accidents and the time of the nth accident are calculated respectively.

Experimental approaches and policy creation are not straightforward because of the problems around existing methods of drug testing for marijuana that stem from the fact that its longevity in the body outlasts actual intoxication and a lack of scientific agreement of quantifiable long-term effects on work performance. Here, a social constructionist methodology has been adopted to explore perspectives of marijuana legalization as revealed through conversations with 50 construction site workers. Findings show that although legalization has had no impact on use among construction workers, impairment while at work remains unacceptable. A conflict now exists around personal freedoms and drug testing, leading to both resignation and dissatisfaction among workers. This could negatively influence the development of a positive safety culture on sites and hinder worker engagement with safety overall. It is recommended that companies and unions recognize that blanket testing policies are problematic in practice and support the development of accurate testing for immediate impairment from marijuana use.","[Sherratt, Fred] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Construct Management, Bishop Hall Ln, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, Essex, England; [Welfare, Katherine] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, UCB 428,1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hallowell, Matthew] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Construct Engn, UCB 428,1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Tania, Marzia Hoque] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Anglia Ruskin IT Res Inst, Bishop Hall Ln, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, Essex, England","Sherratt, F (corresponding author), Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Construct Management, Bishop Hall Ln, Chelmsford CM1 1SQ, Essex, England.",fred.sherratt@anglia.ac.uk; dewlanek@colorado.edu; matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu; marzia.hoque@pgr.anglia.ac.uk,"Tania, Marzia Hoque/AAB-4182-2019; Sherratt, Fred/ABH-3272-2020","Tania, Marzia Hoque/0000-0002-4496-1896; ",Anglia Ruskin University,"The authors would like to thank the Anglia Ruskin University Sabbatical Scheme for their financial support of this work, as well as the companies and all the workers and supervisors that took part in the study.

Improvement efforts by the government and industry have yielded little results. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for developing a productivity and safety monitoring system using Building Information Modelling (BIM). Design/methodology/approach - The framework, Intelligent Productivity and Safety System (IPASS), takes advantage of mandatory requirements for building plans to be submitted for approval in Singapore in BIM format. IPASS is based on a study comprising interviews and a questionnaire-based survey. It uses BIM to integrate buildable design, prevention and control of hazards, and safety assessment. Findings - The authors illustrate a development of IPASS capable of generating productivity and safety scores for construction projects by analysing BIM model information. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates that BIM can be used to monitor productivity and safety as a project progresses, and help to enhance performance under the two parameters. Practical implications - IPASS enables collaboration among project stakeholders as they can base their work on analysis of productivity and safety performance before projects start, and as they progress. It is suggested that the BIM model submitted to the authorities should be used for the IPASS application. Originality/value - IPASS has rule-checking, hazards identification and quality checking capabilities. It is able to identify hazards and risks with the rule-checking capabilities. IPASS enables practitioners to check mistakes and the rationality of a design. It helps to mitigate risks as there are built-in safety measures/controls rules to overcome the problems caused by design deficiency, wrong-material-choice, and more.","[Lin, Evelyn Teo Ai; Ofori, George; Tjandra, Imelda; Kim, Hanjoon] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Clementi, Singapore","Tjandra, I (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Clementi, Singapore.",imelda.tjandra@gmail.com,,"Ofori, George/0000-0003-0854-366X",Workplace Safety and Health Institute (WSH Institute) of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM); Building and Construction Authority (BCA); Samwoh Corporation Pte Ltd,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding received from the Workplace Safety and Health Institute (WSH Institute) of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for the whole duration of the research project.

In contrast, this paper presents a statistical model that can support a more dynamic form of safety control, by utilizing real-time tracking data to control the exposure of construction workers to safety risks that accumulate and change over time, The model addresses risks that are the result of concurrent activities on the construction site, and provides proactive alerts in case of an increasing risk exposure for a worker or crew. Statistical zones that are related to medium risk areas on the site are defined in the model. A number of statistical rules are then used to identify deviations from a predefined maximum allowable risk exposure for workers located in the statistical zones. The model can thus prevent potential accidents from occurring, without unnecessarily affecting the efficiency of the activities carried out on site. Laboratory tests of the model were carried out, using a Wi-Fi-based RTLS. The results of the tests demonstrate that the model can identify an excessive exposure to risk for workers, support an initial analysis of the causes for the excessive risk exposure, and compensate for errors in the RTLS measurements.

Accidents often occur under dysfunctional interactions among them. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a multi-agent based safety computational experiment system (SCES) and use it to identify the main influential factors of various aspects of human, shield machine and underground environment. Design/methodology/approach: The methods mainly comprised computational experiments and multi-agent technologies. First, a safety model with human-machine-environment interaction consideration is developed through the multi-agent technologies. On this basis, SCES is implemented. Then computational experiments are designed and performed on SCES for analyzing safety performance and identifying the main influential factors. Findings: The main influential factors of two common accidents are identified. For surface settlement, the main influential factors are ranked as experience, soil density, soil cohesion, screw conveyor speed and thrust force in descending order of influence levels; for mud cake on cutter, they are ranked as soil cohesion, experience, cutter speed and screw conveyor speed. These results are consistent with intuition and previous studies and demonstrate the applicability of SCES. Practical implications: The proposed SCES provides comprehensive risk factor identification for shield tunneling projects and also insights to support informed decisions for safety management. Originality/value: A safety model with human-machine-environment interaction consideration is developed and computational experiments are used to analyze the safety performance. The novel method and model could contribute to system-based safety research and promote systematic understanding of the safety performance of shield tunneling projects.","[Lu, Hui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Qi, Junxiong; Li, Jue; Xie, Yong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Gangyan] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Architecture, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongwei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Wang, HW (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",luhui@cug.edu.cn; qijunxiong@hust.edu.cn; lijue@hust.edu.cn; xyhust@163.com; gangyan@hit.edu.cn; hwwang@hust.edu.cn,"wang, hongwei/G-3843-2013","wang, hongwei/0000-0002-6206-7353; Li, Jue/0000-0001-8195-8365","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71821001, 71390524, 71771096]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019109]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (Nos. 71821001, 71390524, and 71771096), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (No. 2019109).

Current activity-based scheduling techniques do not provide adequate support for the planning of work-flow due to practical and methodological reasons. Location-based scheduling techniques provide a promising alternative to activity-based scheduling techniques for planning of work-flow. However, neither location-based nor activity-based scheduling techniques provide users with insight in the spatial configuration of scheduled construction operations. A technique that can provide this insight is 4D CAD in which 3D CAD models are combined with data from construction schedules. This article presents a process method for the planning of work-flow by combined use of location-based scheduling and 4D CAD. We suggest that a location-based approach to 4D CAD can improve the usability of the 4D CAD models for work-flow analyses. In addition, the article suggests that 4D CAD can enhance the value of location-based schedules. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This has been partly due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable cost data and the small size of the sample. In addition, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has required formal risk assessment on transit projects since 2003. Whether this strategy has improved the accuracy of cost estimates is not known. To fill these gaps, this study has collected the cost data of 81 US rail transit projects built during the last 40 years, the largest sample of its kind. It is found that the accuracy of cost estimates at the decision-making phase has improved over time. Also, major projects have higher percentage cost overruns than smaller projects. Further, the accuracy of cost estimates decrease as project implementation durations increase. The utilized statistical methods yielded no evidence to suggest that cost overruns differ between projects designed before and after 2003, when the FTA risk assessment program started. However, since project size and implementation duration have increased over time, the positive impact of the FTA risk assessment program can be inferred and acknowledged to some extent. This research can serve as a reference point for studies on the accuracy of conceptual cost estimates and help in budgeting future projects. It can also help in understanding the causes of cost overruns in capital projects.","[Gao, Nan; Touran, Ali] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 400 SN, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Touran, A (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 400 SN, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",gao.n@husky.neu.edu; a.touran@northeastern.edu,,,,,,44,0,0,3,20,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The index is used as an important input when estimating construction budgets and assessing risks in resource planning and cost management. To ensure accurate measurement, the properties of cost indexes should be investigated in their long-and short-run interactions with other variables, such as the consumer price index. This paper presents a cointegrated vector autoregression (VAR) model for forecasting the construction cost trend. This model has several advantages in terms of flexibility and dynamic interaction, and a comparison with existing methods demonstrates that the cointegrated VAR model can provide more accurate forecasts of the CCI. Practitioners can implement the cointegrated VAR forecasting technique using their own historical data. The index forecasts can not only provide more accurate estimation of construction budgets, but also evaluate the risk and uncertainty of cost escalation. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000112.

The purpose of this paper is to identify resource allocation challenges and practices in service units that perform both project and non-project activities in dynamic environments. Its goal is to show that top-down mechanisms of project resource allocation need to be replaced by or supplemented with mechanisms that are more flexible. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative comparative case study was conducted in two service units of two project-based firms. The main source of data consisted of semi-structured interviews with 17 service managers and staff members. Findings - This study shows that resource allocation is not necessarily a top-down process at all, and the practices are context-dependent. Two more flexible approaches are revealed - hybrid resource allocation and bottom-up resource allocation - as examples of managing resource allocation in service units that engage in projects under uncertain conditions. The results of the analysis highlight prioritisation and adapting to change and delay as the main issues that managers face in allocating resources to different types of projects and service activities in dynamic environments. Research limitations/implications - The two target companies chosen for the qualitative research design limit the analysis to project-based firms in a business-to-business context. Further, the viewpoint of the service unit is central to the study. Studying project resource allocation in different organisational contexts and uncovering the perspectives of product development and delivery units would offer promising directions for future research. Practical implications - The study reveals that in dynamic project settings such as service organisations, top-down mechanisms of resource allocation need to be accompanied by other, more flexible approaches to ensure the sufficient resourcing of projects and related services in dynamic environments. Companies need to establish practices for resource allocation changes that are caused by re-prioritising tasks and accommodating changes and delays in their project and service activities. Originality/value - Compared to a top-down perspective taken in previous research, the study proposes a more flexible approach for resource allocation in constantly changing environments with different project and service activities. Previous studies have focussed on resource competition between projects, placing project managers in the central role for resource allocation. By contrast, this study discusses hybrid and bottom-up resource allocation, both of which involve broader personnel engagement in resource allocation tasks, drawing on the experience of all employees.","[Momeni, Khadijeh; Martinsuo, Miia Maarit] Tampere Univ Technol, Tampere, Finland","Momeni, K (corresponding author), Tampere Univ Technol, Tampere, Finland.",khadijeh.momeni@tut.fi,"Momeni, Khadijeh/AAB-9221-2019; Martinsuo, Miia M/G-4351-2014","Momeni, Khadijeh/0000-0002-1235-7272; Martinsuo, Miia M/0000-0002-0640-2911",Finnish Technology and Innovation Agency TekesFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES),"the Finnish Technology and Innovation Agency Tekes, companies and research institutes.",,52,5,5,2,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

Approaches for the generation of virtual environments can be manual, automatic, or hybrid. Manual approaches are time consuming, inaccurate, and coarse whereas automatically generated data sets are less than optimal for practical use within real-time virtual environments because of the huge unstructured amount of data. Therefore, common approaches are most likely to have a balance between human and computer effort. Based on different projects, we discuss possible distributions of manual and automatic methods for the generation of 3D virtual environments. We present different facets of the pipeline from initial data gathering up to the final deliverable. The approaches employed in these projects vary from fully hand made up to semi-automatic reconstruction of the environments. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding the reconstruction methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Policy-makers find it difficult to promote changes that require cooperation from these numerous and dispersed actors and to align their sometimes divergent interests. Established research traditions on the economics and management of innovation pay only limited attention to stakeholder choices, engagement and motivation. This paper reviews the insights that emerge as research in these traditions comes into contact with work on innovation from sociological and political perspectives. It contributes by highlighting growing areas of research on user involvement in complex innovation, collective action, distributed innovation and transition management. To differing extents, these provide approaches to incorporate the motivations of different actors into theoretical understanding.

We give the price decisions and discuss price distortion. Under the downward decentralization model, our analysis reveals that first, symmetric decentralization improves supply chain profit only when the fixed marketing costs are high or product substitutability is high; second, decentralization improves channel profit, and symmetric decentralization (i.e., both manufacturers use decentralization) is an equilibrium if the fixed marketing (or unit production) costs are sufficiently high and the market scales are sufficiently small; and third, the presence of fixed marketing costs and asymmetry of supply chains support the existence of asymmetric equilibrium. Under the upward decentralization model, we find that symmetric outsourcing emerges when the fixed manufacturing cost or the unit production cost is low while both market scale and product substitutability are large in the supplier-led setting, the channel profit under downward decentralization is higher than that under symmetric outsourcing only if product substitutability is high, and the sourcing strategy largely depends on the specific game sequence.","[Xiao, Tiaojun] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Game Behav & Operat Management, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Tiaojun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Choi, Tsan-Ming] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Business Div, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, T.

Current practices relying on human inspection are not only impractical but also ineffective due to dynamic construction activities. Furthermore, a scaffold typically consists of multiple bays and stories, which leads to complexity in its structural behaviors with various modes of failure. However, previous studies considered only a limited number of failure cases for a simple one-bay scaffold while exploring machine-learning (ML) approaches to predict safety conditions. Thus, the authors have proposed an approach to monitor a complicated scaffolding structure in real time. This study explored a method of classifying scaffolding failure cases and reliably predicting safety conditions based on strain data sets from scaffolding columns. Furthermore, the research team successfully enhanced the predicting accuracy of ML classification by the proposed self-multiplication method to increase the number of features such as strain data sets. Implementation of the proposed methodology is expected to enable the monitoring of a large, complex system at construction sites.","[Sakhakarmi, Sayan; Park, JeeWoong] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Cho, Chunhee] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Cho, C (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",sayan.sakhakarmi@unlv.edu; jee.park@unlv.edu; chunhee@hawaii.edu,"Sakhakarmi, Sayan/ABE-9678-2020","Sakhakarmi, Sayan/0000-0001-8652-1613; Park, Jee Woong/0000-0003-2205-6585",,,,37,7,7,6,37,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, transaction costs (TCs) cause low economic efficiency to stakeholders and hinder the further promotion of PH. No relevant study has yet been made to investigate the TCs and their causes in the PH field. This paper identifies critical TCs and explores the influencing factors from the developers' perspective. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey were used to collect data about TCs and influencing factors. The most influential factors are identified with their impacts on particular TCs, yielded from correlation analysis and logistic regression. Findings From the developers' perspective in China's PH market, this study identified that the most concerning sources of TCs are: hidden costs arising from disputes, extra workloads from design changes, learning costs, intensive communication and coordination in assembly and unexpected information costs in decision-making. The use of an ordered logistic regression approach indicates that the four most influential factors are: qualification of the general contractor, mandatory local policies, owner type and competitiveness of the developer. Practical implications To reduce the TCs, experiencing learning and ensuring the design scheme's complicity are recommended to save information searching and exchanging costs. The implications for the PH developers are for them to: (1) professionalize their own organization and (2) procure high-qualified general contractors. For the policymakers, this means they should improve the clarity of the mandatory local policies for PH step-by-step. Originality/value By applying the TCs economic theory, this study explores factors that influence TCs in the PH industry. It sheds light on the influencing mechanism behind the TCs in the context of prefabricated housing.","[Wu, Hongjuan; Qian, Queena K.; Straub, Ad; Visscher, Henk J.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands","Wu, HJ (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands.",H.Wu-2@tudelft.nl; k.qian@tudelft.nl; A.Straub@tudelft.nl; H.J.Visscher@tudelft.nl,,,"China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology","This study is supported by the China Scholarship Council and Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology.

This study uses descriptive statistics and regression analysis to examine the flexibility of owner-built housing construction cost in response to different cost-push factors based on survey data on 43 main and 20 outbuilding projects implemented in Dar es Salaam Tanzania between 1990 and 2013. It has been observed that factor cost-flexibility of incremental construction is significantly enhanced through longer construction periods, the use of local cement and drainage system materials and larger built space. This flexibility is explained by the owner-builders' ability to internalize these cost-push factors over time which is reflected through lower annual construction costs facing owner-builders even at times of shortage in services and material supply, cost underestimation or high interest rate. These observations suggest that longer construction periods not only offer the cost-spread advantage but also allow a more thorough search for appropriate plot location, cheaper sources of materials, more affordable design and an appropriate match between changing life cycle housing needs and household income. Therefore, the incremental owner-built approach has lower annual construction costs not only because of the cost-spread effect of a longer construction period but also as a result of owner-builders' cost-saving choices made in terms of utilization of certain local materials, purchasing plots in less challenging environments, preferring single-storey over two-storey houses and avoiding complex house design.","[Alananga, Samwel] Ardhi Univ, Sch Real Estate, Dept Land Management & Valuat, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Lucian, Charles] Ardhi Univ, Sch Real Estate, Dept Property & Facil Management, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kusiluka, Moses Mpogole] Minist Land & Human Settlement Dev, Commissioner Lands, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania","Alananga, S (corresponding author), Ardhi Univ, Sch Real Estate, Dept Land Management & Valuat, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",alananga@aru.ac.tz,"Alananga, Samwel/L-6858-2019","Alananga, Samwel/0000-0002-3995-6486",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),This research project would not have been possible without the concerted financial support of Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) research project which allowed Ardhi University (ARU) to support this project.

The accurate determination of the productivity of machines working in sets is a major problem in earthworks execution planning. Earthworks are conducted in random condition and so the parameter values achieved during their realization have a random character. Using an existing database based on measurements carried out on a construction site, an artificial neural network was built. The latter was used to predict productivity for selected sets of machines and to calculate the task execution time and cost. The obtained set of results allows one to select the machinery set optimum with regard to earthworks execution cost or time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

At present, the maintenance and inspection of FSE must be performed according to the standards and methods specified by fire safety regulations, which makes it necessary to consult relevant files and drawings. However, the reading of maintenance and inspection information can be a very time-consuming endeavor as the majority of these files are in paper. To solve the aforementioned issues, building information modeling (BIM) was used in this study to construct the FSE elements so that the required information could be rapidly acquired by FSE inspectors. A cloud database for equipment inspection and maintenance was then generated by organizing the compiled information. This database was combined with the augmented reality (AR) technology to facilitate FSE inspection and maintenance using mobile devices, thus overcoming the constraints imposed by paper files on these tasks. The results of the demonstration and validation shown that the proposed BIM AR FSE system provides highly comprehensive, mobile, and effective access to FSE information.

The models have been developed for the purpose of forecasting construction costs of sports fields as a specific type of construction objects. The research included simulation and selection of numerous neural networks that became the members of the ensembles. The ensembles included either the networks of different types in terms of their structure and activation functions or the networks of the same type. The research also included practical implementation of the developed models for cost analysis based on a sports field BIM model. This case study examined and confirmed all of the four models' predictive capabilities and superiority over models based on single networks for the particular problem. Verification including testing and the case study enabled selection of the best ensemble-based model that combined ten networks of different types.

Unlike normal roadway applications, work zone pavement markings are often placed on the roadway for a limited period of time, such as during an interim phase of construction. The performance and total cost for each material may vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as traffic volume, surface type, and project duration. The objective of this study is to develop a systematic approach to provide practitioners with objective guidance for selecting cost-effective pavement marking materials for work zones that meet specific performance requirements. A Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analyses were conducted to establish a cost-based decision support guidance given a set of factors influencing the performance of marking materials. Four types of materials considered in this study were paint, thermoplastics, temporary tapes, and traffic buttons. The analysis results indicated that traffic buttons perform slightly better at shorter phase durations and moderate traffic levels on the concrete surface. The use of thermoplastics was recommended as the lowest-cost alternative only on the asphalt surface with moderate project durations and traffic levels. Paint markings are recommended for short-duration projects regardless of traffic conditions or pavement surfaces. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000043.

Despite the potential benefits of adapting stochastic programming and feedback control approaches for decision-making for excavation schedules, the lack of formal representations of the planners' rationales required to estimate the costs and durations of excavation schedules makes the implementation of these approaches extremely challenging. To address these limitations, the authors developed an ontology that represents the estimation rationales (e.g., transition costs and durations among excavation methods, multiple sets of rock mass properties, and schedule adjustment policies). This ontology enables planners to explicitly describe more the comprehensive information required to consistently estimate the costs and durations of excavation schedules for both preconstruction and construction compared to the current practices and the existing studies. Further research that accounts for learning effects resulting from transitions among excavation methods would make cost and duration estimations for excavation schedules more realistic.","[Kim, Jung In] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fischer, Martin] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Suh, Min Jae] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Engn Technol, 1905 Univ Ave, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA","Kim, JI (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Yeung Kin Man Acad Bldg,Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jungikim@cityu.edu.hk; fischer@stanford.edu; mjs068@shsu.edu,,"Kim, Jung In/0000-0003-0583-0348",Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) at Stanford UniversityStanford University,The presented work was based upon research funded by the Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) at Stanford University.,,47,1,1,5,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Maintenance prioritisation is becoming more prominent in the building maintenance industry due to budget constraints, poor maintenance management and to yield better maintenance performance. Design/methodology/approach Two main categories with eleven facilities services that require maintenance were identified through extensive literature review. A total of 321 returned questionnaires were analysed to distinguish the relationship between the maintenance priority and cost variance. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to validate the findings. Findings The findings revealed that five essential facilities services were significantly correlated to cost variance and a regression model which examines the probability of over-budget was developed. Meanwhile, the interviews recognised that maintenance prioritisation has impact towards maintenance cost. Research limitations/implications - This research focusses on the maintenance priorities of facilities services and their effects to maintenance cost. However, it is undeniable that the maintenance cost can be affected by other factors, contributing to a lower percentage of the total variance in the regression model. Thus, it creates research opportunity to study the factors (i.e. manpower, materials, wear and tear, etc.) affecting the variance of maintenance cost. Practical implications - This study is useful to property managers in efforts to enhance the cost performance via appropriate maintenance prioritisation. The essential facilities services should be highly prioritised compared to the value-added facilities services. Originality/value The paper signifies the importance of maintenance prioritisation. It serves as a guide to plan and execute maintenance planning in a more logical way within budget and time constraints.","[Au-Yong, Cheong Peng; Chua, Shirley Jin Lin; Ali, Azlan Shah] Univ Malaya, Ctr Bldg Construct & Trop Architecture BuCTA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Tucker, Matthew] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Au-Yong, CP (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Ctr Bldg Construct & Trop Architecture BuCTA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",auyongcp@um.edu.my,"Au-Yong, Cheong Peng/K-7599-2012; chua, shirley jin lin/H-4040-2016","Au-Yong, Cheong Peng/0000-0003-1306-9595; chua, shirley jin lin/0000-0002-4526-6190",University Malaya Research Fund Assistance (BKP) [BK021-2015],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the University Malaya Research Fund Assistance (BKP), grant no.

Modeling results found that a stacking model that combined the results from several classifiers produced the best results. The stacking ensemble model had an average accuracy of 43.72% for five model runs. The model performed best in predicting projects completed with large cost overruns and projects near the original low bid amount. It was found that a stacking model that used only numerical data produced predictions with lower precision and recall. A potential application of this research is as an aid in budgeting sufficient funds to complete a construction project. Additionally, during the planning stages of a project the research can be used to identify a project that requires increased scrutiny during construction to avoid cost overruns.

On the other hand, studies attempting to measure greenhouse gas emission due to construction activities have yet to develop a methodology that correlates their findings and implications with construction productivity. In order to address the immediate need for improving the sustainability performance of construction projects, it is imperative for the construction industry to evaluate greenhouse gas emission as a cost factor in construction planning, equipment selection, and cost estimating. In this context, this paper formalizes an integrative framework for equipment cost analysis based on the concepts of lean construction and green construction, aimed to guide the selection of appropriate construction equipment considering exhaust emission and productivity performance at the same time. The framework is elaborated in earthwork construction in order to evaluate the impact of greenhouse gas emission in estimating equipment hourly rates and assessing greenness and sustainability for alternative equipment options.","[Lu, Ming; Diaz, Nicolas; Hasan, Monjurul] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada","Lu, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",mlu6@ualberta.ca,"Hasan, Monjurul/AAL-1132-2021; Lu, Ming/J-8290-2014","Hasan, Monjurul/0000-0003-2066-7948; ",,,,59,2,2,0,18,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

An empirical profiling of cost overrun research reveals the predominance of mono-method studies, all of which are underlain by positivism. The study argues that such positivist philosophies, although methodologically valid, cannot adequately provide in-depth understanding of the contextual cost overrun drivers in highway organisations. Using a mix of methods, the paper examines the contribution of geotechnical risks to the extreme cost overruns experienced on Niger Delta's highway projects, and demonstrates the relevance of context in cost overrun research. Adopting a geotechnical narrative, data sourced from 61 highway projects along with 16 interviews conducted with highway agencies in the region is analysed. The results of the analysis identified that poor project governance and procurement practices, have inhibited the competent management of geotechnical risk, creating a propensity for extreme cost overruns on highway projects. The study submits the phenomenon of cost overruns in public infrastructure projects is underlain by a complexity of contextual social constructs, which would have been overlooked in positivists studies. Cost overrun research, therefore, needs to be contextually and numerically anchored.","[Amadi, Alolote, I; Higham, Anthony] Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, 30 Norfolk, Salford M6 6DP, Lancs, England","Amadi, AI (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Built Environm, 30 Norfolk, Salford M6 6DP, Lancs, England.",amadialolote@yahoo.com,,"Amadi, Alolote/0000-0002-0569-6604",,,,77,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Because predicting CCI is crucial to the investment planning, bidding, and profitability of construction projects, considerable effort has been devoted to CCI estimation, and substantially accurate results have been obtained. However, these findings were based on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of data, which limits the estimation accuracy for fluctuating data. To overcome the limitation of such conventional methods, the present study aimed to refine CCI prediction performance by applying the concept of long memory. First, the existence of long memory in CCI is examined by performing rescaled range (range/scale or R/S) analysis. Second, a time-series model was developed: the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model, which reflects the characteristics of long memory. Finally, the prediction performance of the ARFIMA model was compared with that of the conventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. CCI data from January 1990 to August 2016 were used to develop these models. The results showed that ARFIMA outperformed ARIMA in terms of prediction performance, on average, by 9.5%. The ARFIMA model achieved higher CCI prediction performance by incorporating the properties of long memory.

Engineering and construction companies in the construction industry are confronted with an imminent need to develop and employ effective strategies and methods to retain experienced estimators' knowledge and skills and successfully transfer to junior estimators. This study investigates the effectiveness of 10 traditional and advanced methods in retaining and developing core estimating competencies. In total, 77 completed questionnaire survey forms were collected from the Construction Industry Institute member companies and American Society of Professional Estimators. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was employed to assess the effectiveness of each method in retaining estimating competencies by analyzing empirical cause and effect relationships between methods and estimating competencies. The SEM analysis results were also used to prioritize methods to effectively retain estimating competencies. The results show that implementing advanced methods has a higher effect on the development of estimating competencies than traditional methods do. The results also indicate that by implementing both traditional and advanced methods, the estimating competencies of an estimating workforce can be effectively improved. The findings of this study are expected to significantly assist engineering and construction companies in designing effective training and education programs for their estimating workforce's competency development and improvement.

First, these systems require the user to manually craft the time-cost curves for formulating the objective functions. Second, these systems only deal with linear time-cost relationships. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a computer system called MLGAS (Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms based System), which integrates a machine learning method with GA. A quadratic template is introduced to capture the nonlinearity of time-cost relationships. The machine learning method automatically generates the quadratic time-cost curves from historical data and also measures the credibility of each quadratic time-cost curve. The quadratic curves are then used to formulate the objective function that can be solved by the GA. Several improvements are made to enhance the capacity of GA to prevent premature convergence. Comparisons of MLGAS with an experienced project manager indicate that MLGAS generates better solutions to nonlinear time-cost trade-off problems.","Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Build & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Peoples R China","Li, H (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Build & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Peoples R China.",,"Love, Peter/D-7418-2017; Li, Heng/B-2821-2015","Love, Peter/0000-0002-3239-1304; Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Cao, Jiannong/0000-0002-2725-2529",,,,29,63,68,0,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The success of the bid is therefore heavily dependent on the accuracy of that estimate, meaning that sufficient resources should be allocated to the estimation process. This paper develops a novel optimization model for simultaneously determining the bid markup and the resources that should be allocated to cost estimation. We begin by deriving optimality conditions for this simultaneous optimization model and illustrating them with numerical examples, for which purpose only we assume a single competitor and uniformly distributed estimation errors. To analyze a more realistic situation, we then examine computational solutions to our model. Through these two approaches, we investigate the effects of the bid markup decision and resource allocation on the contractor's expected profit, and we highlight the significance in competitive bidding of the markup and allocation.","[Takano, Yuichi] Senshu Univ, Sch Network & Informat, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan; [Ishii, Nobuaki] Kanagawa Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Kanagawa Ku, 3-27-1 Rokkakubashi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2218686, Japan; [Muraki, Masaaki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Decis Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-W9-73 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan","Takano, Y (corresponding author), Senshu Univ, Sch Network & Informat, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",ytakano@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp; n-ishii@kanagawa-u.ac.jp; m.muraki8511@gmail.com,"Ishii, Nobuaki/AAJ-3950-2020","Ishii, Nobuaki/0000-0003-1718-1664","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25350455, 16K01252]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26242027, 16K01252] Funding Source: KAKEN",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 25350455 and 16K01252.,,39,10,10,1,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

While the occupational safety and health (OSH) coordinator has been a key actor in European efforts proposed to improve OSH in the industry since 1992, it is important to study the competences needed for the successful coordination of OSH in the construction industry. Existing literature on OSH coordinator competences are examined, and an expert survey is used to identify the competences characterising the most successful coordinators in Denmark. Finally, observational case studies of the perceived most successful coordinators in the Danish construction industry are used to exemplify the newly identified competences. The most frequently mentioned competences, not covered in previous research, are innovativeness, having overview, persistency, thoroughness, sociability, and being systematic. The results demonstrate the important practice of knowing, rather than possessing formal knowledge, education, and/or skills. The most important practice of knowing for the coordinators is likely that of the ability to transfer knowledge into practice. Future research, education and legal requirement in this field could benefit from a focus on what practices of knowledge actually work in real-life settings, rather than focussing on idealistic notions of these qualities.","[Moller, Jeppe L.; Kines, Pete; Dyreborg, Johnny; Andersen, Lars L.; Ajslev, Jeppe Z.

The application of serious games in construction safety is growing rapidly because serious games offer an interactive and innovative environment for delivering safety training. Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of such safety training tools is indispensable. However, most of the studies that introduce serious game-based safety training use qualitative methods for validation. Therefore, a gap in the literature exists in verifying the effectiveness of serious games by using empirical methods. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of serious games by using various methods such as paper-based assessment and degree of recall. For this purpose, we conducted experiments with a total of 42 senior civil engineering students. According to the mixed ANOVA results, students significantly increased their occupational safety knowledge compared to traditional training after receiving serious game-based safety training. The results also show that serious game-based training provides effective training that ensures the maintenance of safety knowledge acquired over time. Moreover, the game experience levels of the participants did not influence their safety training performance.","[Kazar, Gokhan] Istanbul Gedik Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34870 Istanbul, Turkey; [Comu, Semra] Bogazici Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey","Comu, S (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",gokhan.kazar@gedik.edu.tr; semra.comu@boun.edu.tr,,,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [315M186],We would like to acknowledge the support of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) within Grant No. 315M186.,,40,1,1,3,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

As a means of prevention, a number of active technologies have been developed to provide proximity sensing and alerts for workers and equipment operators. However, most of these systems are based on the distance/proximity level between workers and equipment and neglect the variations caused by different settings and environmental conditions, such as equipment types and approaching speeds, which can result in inconsistency and delay of the systems. As of yet, previous research has insufficiently investigated these issues. This research addresses the issues by utilizing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based proximity sensing and alert system developed by the authors. This paper discusses the development and assessment of parameter adjustment and adaptive signal processing (ASP) methods. The research conducted field trials in various dynamic conditions and settings to assess the performance of the system. The test results showed that the parameter adjustment function reduced the inconsistency of the alert distances resulting from different types of equipment, and that the ASP method reduced the time delay resulting from high approaching speeds.

Findings The studies demonstrated additivity neglect of probabilities that are graphically displayed. People's evaluations of the accuracy of interval estimates revealed a boundary (a cliff) effect, with a sharp drop in accuracy ratings for outcomes above an arbitrary maximum. Several common verbal phrases (what can happen, is entirely possible and not surprising) which might seem to indicate expected outcomes were regularly used to describe unlikely values near or at the top of the distribution (an extremity effect).

A number of noise-related problems can cause significant risk to an ongoing project. As a first step toward coping with noise, this paper presents a model developed for estimating the noise-related compensation cost through case-based reasoning (CBR). An experiment was performed with 20 randomly selected test cases. The compensation costs were estimated based on damage days and excessive noise level of similar cases. A Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was adopted to deal with limited and uncertain data. The results showed that the cases had a similarity of 91.8% on average, and the mean absolute error ratio (MAER) of the estimated cost based on data revised by MCS was approximately 11.8%. This indicates that the estimated and actual costs were similar, which validates the applicability of the model. This research contributes to the field of construction noise management by providing environmental managers with a systematic approach for estimating noise-related compensation during the preconstruction phase.","[Kwon, Nahyun; Cho, Jongwoo; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Yoon, Inseok; Park, Moonseo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, 39-425,Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea","Park, M (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, 39-425,Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",nhkwon@snu.ac.kr; leone1118@snu.ac.kr; hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; yoon92411@snu.ac.kr; mspark@snu.ac.kr,"Kwon, Nahyun/V-1422-2019","Kwon, Nahyun/0000-0001-9965-9611; Yoon, Inseok/0000-0002-4337-2950","Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Government of Korea under the Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Program [18RERP-B082884-05]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIT) [2017R1A2B2007050]","This research was supported by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Government of Korea under the Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Program (18RERP-B082884-05) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korea Government (MSIT) (2017R1A2B2007050).",,57,7,7,2,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Design/methodology/approach Information about residential building projects is collected based on project documents from construction companies with regard to the design parameters and the actual structural construction costs at completion. Storey enclosure method (SEM) is fundamental for determining the building design parameters, forming the potential variables and developing the cost estimation models using regression analysis. Nonparametric bootstrap method is used to establish range estimation for the structural construction cost. Findings A model which is developed from an integration of advanced SEM, principle component analysis and regression analysis is robust in terms of predictability. In terms of range estimation, cumulative probability-based range estimates and confidence intervals are established. While cumulative probability-based range estimates provide information about the level of uncertainty included in the estimate, confidence intervals provide information about the variability of the estimate. Such information could be very crucial for management decisions in early stages of residential building projects. Originality/value This study could provide practitioners with a better understanding of the uncertainty and variability included in the cost estimate. Hence, they could make effective improvements on cost-related management approaches to enhance project cost performance.","[Chau Ngoc Dang] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Grad Program Construct Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Long Le-Hoai] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","Le-Hoai, L (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",lehoailong@hcmut.edu.vn,"Le-Hoai, Long/AAW-1802-2020; Dang, Chau/AAZ-8208-2020; Dang, Chau Ngoc/AAC-5426-2019","LE-HOAI, LONG/0000-0003-4940-8560; Dang, Chau/0000-0002-4740-6986",,,,58,6,6,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In this paper, fuzzy sets theory is applied to model the managers' behavior in predicting time and cost pertinent to a specific option within an activity. Genetic algorithms are used as a searching mechanism to establish the optimal time-cost profiles under different risk levels. In addition, the nonreplaceable front concept is proposed to assist managers in recognizing promising solutions from numerous candidates on the Pareto front. Economic analysis skills, such as the utility theory and opportunity cost, are integrated into the new model to mimic the decision making process of human experts. A simple case study is used for testing the new model developed. In comparison with the previous models, the new model provides managers with greater flexibility to analyze their decisions in a more realistic manner. The results also indicate that greater robustness may be achieved by taking some risks. This research is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers. By incorporating the concept of fuzzy sets, managers can represent the range of possible time-cost values as well as their associated degree of belief. The model presented in this paper, can, therefore, support decision makers in analyzing their time-cost optimization decision in a more flexible and realistic manner. Many novel ideas have also been incorporated in this paper to benefit the research community. Examples of these include the use of fuzzy sets theory, nonreplaceable front concept, utility theory, opportunity cost, etc. With suitable modifications, these concepts can be applied to model to other similar optimization problems in construction.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Zheng, DXM (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cemzheng@graduate.hku.hk; tstng@hkucc.hku.hk,"Ng, Thomas/C-1809-2009; Ng, S.

This research found literature using those techniques has been solely focused on estimating model performance with little to no attention to the level of effort required to conduct the conceptual estimate. It is commonly believed using more input data enhances estimate accuracy. However, this paper finds for the highway agency studied that using more input variables than necessary in the conceptual estimate does not improve estimate accuracy. Conceptual estimates using the minimum amount of input data to produce an estimate with a reasonable level of confidence is more cost effective. This paper quantifies the effort expended to undertake conceptual estimates using data from a highway agency and concludes that input variables that have a large influence on the final predicted cost and require a low amount of effort are desired in data-driven conceptual cost-estimating models for the agency studied.","[Gardner, Brendon J.; Gransberg, Douglas D.; Jeong, H.

Often times such criteria may be in conflict with each other. That is, an MCDA problem may involve both benefit and cost criteria at the same time. Although this is a frequent characteristic of many real-life MCDA problems, this subject has not: received adequate attention in the literature. This paper examines the use of four key MCDA methods when two approaches for dealing with conflicting criteria are used. The two approaches are the benefit to cost ratio approach and the benefit minus cost approach. The MCDA methods used in this study are the weighted sum model, the weighted product model, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) along with some of its variants, including the multiplicative AHP. Not surprisingly, these two approaches for aggregating conflicting criteria may result in a different indication of the best alternative or ranking of all alternatives when they are used on the same problem. As it is demonstrated here, it is also) possible for the two approaches to even result in the opposite ranking of the alternatives. An extensive empirical analysis of this methodological problem revealed that the previous phenomena might occur frequently on simulated MCDA problems. The WSM, the AHP, and the revised AHP performed in an almost identical manner in these tests. The contradiction rates in these tests were rather significant and became more dramatic when the number of alternatives was high. Although it may not be possible to know which ranking is the correct one, this study also theoretically proved that the multiplicative AHP is immune to these ranking inconsistencies.","Louisiana State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Triantaphyllou, E (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",trianta@lsu.edu,,"Triantaphyllou, Evangelos/0000-0002-2029-2720",,,,51,66,67,0,31,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The framework clarifies the nature of the indicators in terms of definition, purpose, and attributes. A pragmatic method for systematically identifying a set of leading indicators for construction projects is proposed. The method consists of four steps: conceptualization, operationalization, indicator generation, validation, and revision, and emphasizes two functions of leading indicators: informative and decision aiding. First, leading indicators must be able to provide information about the state of construction safety. Second, they must be able to help decision makers take remedial actions. These two functions should promote double-loop learning, reflecting any existing safety model and facilitating the construction of a new one through ongoing validation. A hypothetical example is provided to illustrate the entire development process. The conceptual framework, together with the development method, provides the construction industry with both theoretical and methodological guidance on developing leading indicators that can better serve the purpose of proactive safety management.

One of the key concerns in the industry is the management of workers' safety behavior. This paper aims to explore the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of not anchoring a safety harness when working at height. In addition, multiple stepwise linear regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree techniques were applied in the study to assess their usefulness in evaluating survey data of safety cognitive factors. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was adopted to model the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of scaffolders. The TPB postulates that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms affect the intention of workers, which ultimately affects intentional behavior. The unsafe act of not anchoring harnesses while working on a scaffold was selected as the focal behavior based on observations and interviews with safety supervisors. Supervisors also provided their opinions on the underlying reasons for the unsafe act. A questionnaire was then developed based on the site observations, interviews, and literature review. Subsequently, 40 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, and China were surveyed. Stepwise multiple linear regression, neural network, and decision tree analyses were implemented. The analyses revealed that subjective norm was the key variable influencing a worker's decision to anchor the safety harness. The significance of subjective norm was probably affected by the national culture of the migrant workers. In addition, the analyses showed that the relationships between the variables were probably nonlinear, thus neural network and decision tree are suitable techniques. The exploratory study provides the basis for design of an in-depth study on the cognitive factors influencing safety behavior and it expands the choice of analyses techniques.

The purpose of this study is to identify accident factors by work type for highway construction projects through analysis of accidents occurring in Korea from 1997-2008. Analysis of variance and cross-tabulation analysis were used to identify statistically significant differences among nine factors and 248 variables in six work types. This analysis shows that contributing factors and variables to injuries vary depending on time of accident, work, and accident environment. The results outline trends of construction injuries by highway work. The results can be used to identify high-risk types of accidents, measure potential risks, improve safety training, and develop prevention plans for each work type under various work environments. The study shows that most accidents in highway construction fell into six construction work types. Because the relationships among contributing environment classification factors to accidents are identified, the factors can be considered to reduce the possibility of accidents by controlling closely related factors. This research can be used to develop an effective safety plan for highway construction projects.

The following research question is investigated: How does the privatization of financing decrease or increase agency costs in social infrastructure PPPs? A comparative case study consisting of four Norwegian PPP projects with different financial configurations is undertaken. The findings suggest that the private sector is risk averse, increasing the cost of capital.

Furthermore, the fluctuation related to price of energy has been much higher than the general inflation and interest rate. This makes the energy price inflation an important variable that should be addressed when performing life cycle cost (LCC) studies regarding asphalt pavements. The present value of future costs is highly sensitive to the selected discount rate. Therefore, the choice of the discount rate is the most critical element in LCC analysis during the life time of a project. The objective of the paper is to present a discount rate for asphalt pavement projects as a function of interest rate, general inflation and energy price inflation. The discount rate is defined based on the portion of the energy related costs during the life time of the pavement. Consequently, it can reflect the financial risks related to the energy price in asphalt pavement projects. It is suggested that a discount rate sensitivity analysis for asphalt pavements in Sweden should range between -20 and 30%.","[Mirzadeh, Iman] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Infrastruct, Infrastruct Maintenance, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Birgisson, Bjorn] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England","Mirzadeh, I (corresponding author), Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Infrastruct, Infrastruct Maintenance, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",iman.mirzadeh@abe.kth.se,"Birgisson, Bjorn/AAP-9558-2021",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Referencing two established data mining frameworks, namely, CRISP-DM and KDD, this paper identifies the key tasks of implementing conceptual cost estimation models. The results of reviewing key tasks show that the literature did not provide sufficient solutions to data preparation and model evaluation. Critical judgments on the accomplishment and deficiencies of the current conceptual cost estimation studies, from the perspective of data modeling process for the first time, is the main contribution of this paper.

This paper exposes the modeling of 3D-printed curved walls through parametric programming in building information modeling (BIM) in order to support a cost-efficient building design. The advantage of using curved walls is based on the possibility of reducing their thickness with respect to straight walls of similar length given their higher resistance to overturning forces. The programming developed here can propose a considerable set of solutions using curved walls for a rectangular enclosure of dimensions given by the user. A case study for a vehicle sale pavilion is shown, for which a set of 1,600 solutions with curved walls of different curvature angles and lengths is generated and subsequently analyzed. From this analysis, those models with lower material consumption and execution time are selected to be more thoroughly studied in the design process. Thus, a novel strategy is provided to researchers and practitioners for developing more efficient and expressive building designs based on 3D-printed construction. The most efficient solution identified in the example reduces material consumption by 61%, with an estimated cost saving of 53%.

The results indicate that the impact of transaction attributes on transaction costs varies. Uncertainty has a positive impact on all three transaction cost elements. Frequency and some dimensions of contracting parties' asset specificity are positively associated with set-up costs and monitoring costs, which, however, does not apply to enforcement costs. The findings provide empirical evidence in support of the transaction cost economics' prediction regarding the influence of transaction attributes on transaction costs in the Australian construction industry, and thereby add another perspective to the knowledge base in the construction management discipline.

The difference between the expected and actual project outcomes is usually attributed to risk events and how they are managed throughout the project. Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects.

This paper proposes the Cost and Time Project Management Success - CTPMS, an essential measure in this context because projects must dynamically address cost and time success under an agreed scope. The goal of the paper is to identify the project management practices through which an organization can optimize the CTPMS of IS development projects. Because multiple factors can influence project management success, we analyze a real-world sample of 899 IS projects of a leading bank, using hierarchical models to account for the effects of predictors at four levels of analysis: portfolio network, project, project manager, and team. In addition to proposing and discussing a new measure of project management success for information systems development projects, we identified that project size, duration, postponement, and project manager formal power showed positive effects, whereas team size and team allocation dispersion presented negative effects. The results suggest guidance for factors such as team member allocation and prioritization, among others. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

This paper assesses the impact of rework with regard to both a project's costs and its duration. We have introduced a model that estimates the project development time by taking into account the premises of the task overlapping, the moment of information transfer, the risks of rework, and the consequences of the premature transfer of information. The model was used in the planning of a project for the construction of a fuel distribution terminal in a large Brazilian oil company. In this case, it was possible to demonstrate that the uncertainty derived from the premature transfer of information may increase a project's duration and should be analyzed in the light of cost variations due to rework. The model determines the best moment in which to transmit information and assesses the impact of premature information transfer. More importantly, it demonstrates that the alternative to the early transfer of information does not necessarily result in a shorter project duration or in larger costs.","[Campos Silva, Daniel D.; Santiago, Leonardo P.; Silva, Pedro Marinho S.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Prod Engn, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Silva, DDC (corresponding author), Petrobras Distribuidora, BR-20271900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",dsilva@br.com.br; lsantiago@ufmg.br; pedromss@ufmg.br,"Santiago, Leonardo/G-3017-2011","Santiago, Leonardo/0000-0002-7041-7480","PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras; Research Foundation of Minas Gerais State (FAEMIG); CAPES Foundation, Ministry of EducationCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)","This work was supported in part by Petrobras, the Research Foundation of Minas Gerais State (FAEMIG), the CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil.

The study presented in this paper aims at predicting this cost by employing a more advanced modeling technique known as the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology. Using this methodology, a series of nonparametric ANN models was developed based on significant predictors of the retrofit net construction cost (RNCC). Data on these predictors, together with the RNCC, were collected from 158 earthquake-prone public school buildings, each having a framed structure. A novel systematic framework was proposed with the aim to increase the generalization ability of ANN models. Using this framework, the values of critical components involved in the design of ANN models were defined. These components included the number of hidden layers and neurons, and learning parameters in terms of learning rate and momentum. The sensitivity of the developed ANN models to these components was examined, and it was found that the predictive performance of these models was more influenced by the number of hidden neurons than by the value of learning parameters. Also, the results of this examination revealed that the overlearning problem became more serious with an increase in the number of predictors. In addition to the framework proposed for the successful development of ANN models, the primary contribution of this study to the construction industry is the introduction of building total area as the key predictor of the RNCC. This predictor enables a reliable estimation of the RNCC to be made at the early development stage of a seismic retrofit project when little information is known about the project.

These variations are problematic for cost estimation, bid preparation, and investment planning. The accurate prediction of CCI can be invaluable for cost estimation and budgeting of capital projects, and can result in accurate bids. The research objective of this paper is to create appropriate multivariate time series models for forecasting CCI based on a group of explanatory variables that are identified by using Granger causality tests. The results of cointegration tests recommend vector error correction (VEC) models as the proper type of multivariate time series models to forecast CCI. Several VEC models are created and compared with existing univariate time series models for forecasting CCI. It is shown that the CCI predicted by these VEC models is more accurate than that predicted by the previously proposed univariate models (i.e.,seasonal autoregressive integrated mean-average and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing). The comparisons are based on two typical error measures: mean absolute prediction error and mean squared error. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the creation of multivariate time series models that are more accurate than the current univariate time series models for forecasting CCI. It is expected that this work will contribute to the construction engineering and management community by helping cost engineers and capital planners prepare more accurate bids, cost estimates, and budgets for capital projects.","[Shahandashti, S.

They provide a benchmark or norm for those making key decisions about getting best whole-life value for money from a proposed new building, and a starting point for research to discover the reasons for a variance in the ratios in individual buildings about the means. Such ratios and research can be the basis for the case that 'better buildings' can add more to whole-life value than they add to cost. It is unfortunate, therefore, that in the UK one particular proposition about 'typical' ratios (that they are, respectively, of the order, for most workplace buildings, of 1 (construction)/5 (facility management)/200 (operation)), has become widely cited and accepted amongst policy-makers and practitioners. It is argued here that these proportions are exaggerated, and that the difference of mean ratios between buildings of different functions is sufficient to require function-specific ratios. An economically valid conceptual framework is set out to classify costs. This framework is then applied to the best available datasets for Central London office buildings (finding that in this case 1/1.5/15 is approximately the mean proportions appropriate for benchmarking purposes). It is suggested how this common framework can be applied to analyse data and calculate mean ratios for buildings of any function, in any country. This whole-life economic cost and value method is compared with another method in widespread use by building occupiers: the 'total costs of occupancy' method. Propositions about how 'good design' might affect whole-life value for money can be explored if both benchmark and single-project data exist for the ratios of the costs of operation to construction costs, on the one hand, and of value added to costs of operation, on the other. Although broadly adequate data exist for most building functions on construction cost and for some building functions on facility management cost, there is a lack of adequate published data on both operating costs and the value added of buildings. To address this problem, a programme of research is recommended to fill these gaps.","UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, London WC1E 6BT, England","Ive, G (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",g.ive@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,24,27,27,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

This study aims to investigate the magnitude of rework costs generated by different sources for residential building projects in China. Six residential building projects were selected as sample cases; rework activities and their detailed cost information were collected and analysed. The result revealed that average rework cost of residential building projects was 4.95% of the total project cost. The majority of rework costs were generated by three sources including contractor field management (20.10%), design management (18.91%) and client management (14.73%). It was also found that the main liability bearers of rework costs did not take corresponding responsibilities. The establishment of rework costs allocation mechanism is therefore required to enhance the sense of responsibility among different entities. The magnitude of rework cost may well motivate them take collaborative actions to reduce rework cost. This article provides valuable empirical data for practitioners to understand the major sources of rework costs and main liability-bearers. Therefore, practitioners can take targeted measures to address certain key factors that cause rework based on the data.

However, very little success has been achieved in solving the problem for medium and large-scale projects. This paper presents a new particle swarm optimization method to achieve an advancement in the Pareto front optimization of medium and large-scale construction projects. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer (PFPSO) is based on a multiobjective optimization environment with novel particle representation, initialization, and position-updating principles that are specifically designed for simultaneous time-cost optimization of large-scale projects. PFPSO brings several benefits for the discrete time-cost optimization, such as an adequate representation of the discrete search space, fast convergence properties, and improved Pareto front optimization capabilities. The computational experiment results reveal that the new particle swarm optimization method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of the number of Pareto front solutions and computation time, especially for medium and large-scale problems. A large number of nondominated solutions are achieved within seconds for the first time, for a problem including 720 activities. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer provides a fast and effective method for optimal scheduling of construction projects.

Numerous optimization techniques have been developed to solve such problem; however, they are not applicable to large-sized projects. Although heuristic methods can handle large-sized problems, they do not guarantee optimum solution. In a project network, the proper sequence of activities can be maintained by allowing a precedence constraint for each path. In practice, only small number of paths are dominant while others are redundant. In this paper, an efficient optimization model is developed to minimize project direct cost where redundant paths are eliminated, precise activity discrete time-cost relationship is used and overlap between activities is permitted. The optimization model is formulated in the standard form of zero-one programming. The model requires as inputs: discrete utility data of activities, precedence relationships and overlap between consecutive activities. Details of model formulation is illustrated by an example project and then is validated by a real-life project. Based on the obtained results, the developed model is compared with traditional optimization models. The developed model guarantees optimal solution and can be applied efficiently to large-sized projects. The proposed approach provides both academicians and practitioners with an efficient technique that produces optimal solution based on realistic assumptions.","[Ammar, Mohammad A.] Kingdom Univ, Coll Architectural Engn & Design, Riffa, Bahrain; [Ammar, Mohammad A.] Tanta Univ, Struct Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Tanta, Egypt","Ammar, MA (corresponding author), Kingdom Univ, Coll Architectural Engn & Design, Riffa, Bahrain.; Ammar, MA (corresponding author), Tanta Univ, Struct Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Tanta, Egypt.",mamammar@yahoo.com,,,,,,30,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

The EVA's accuracy of early cost projections is low since the method assumes static cost performance during construction. A project's cost performance is evidenced as a stochastic process. In an effort to improve the EVA's accuracy of early cost predictions, this work reports a modified method of Markovian simulation cost projection (MSCP). Based on Markov chain simulation, MSCP simulates the probability distribution of the cost performance indicators for each period of a project, and predicts the final cost using the summation of each simulated period cost. The MSCP method is demonstrated and validated through a case study of a real-world power plant project. Data analysis indicates that MSCP improves the prediction accuracy four times higher than EVA. Findings also suggest that MSCP is able to capture erratic changes of cost performance throughout a project's lifecycle and thus provides better EAC (estimate at completion) predictions and early warnings.

For a contractor to be financially successful in international projects, a careful examination of the project is a prerequisite to understanding the cost variance characteristics. Based on the reasonably accurate characterization of the cost performance, the markup or contingency amount is determined to ensure both a decent level of profit and a good chance of winning the contract. This paper presents a classification model to categorize international construction projects, particularly faced by Korean contractors, into five cost-variation classes: extreme cost overrun, moderate cost overrun, neutral, moderate cost saving, and extreme cost saving. The model is able to characterize an international project for its cost performance prediction in comparison to the contractor's initial cost estimate. A linear discriminant analysis is utilized to develop the predictive classification model with the support of the bootstrap method. Tests show that the proposed model is able to help cost estimators determine a proper level of cost contingency before bidding on an international project.","[Kim, Du Y.; Han, Seung H.; Kim, Hyoungkwan] Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea","Han, SH (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",cagedbird@yonsei.ac.kr; shh6018@yonsei.ac.kr; hyoungkwan@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Du/B-6445-2013; Kim, Hyoungkwan/G-8205-2012; Han, Seung Heon/G-8862-2012; HAN, SEUNGHEON/G-8641-2015",,,,,47,39,39,0,47,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The demand-capacity model based on the Highway Capacity Manual, and macroscopic and microscopic traffic simulation models were utilized for traffic delay analysis. Based on these analyses, the California Department of Transportation decided to implement eight 72 h weekday closures with round-the-clock operations for this reconstruction project. This was found to be more beneficial for both the agency and the traveling public than the alternative of: (1) 55 h weekend, (2) 10 h nighttime, or (3) one-time continuous closures.

Design/methodology/approach Expert interviews are conducted to identify the study variables. Based on bills of quantities and project documents, historical data on residential construction projects in flood-prone areas are collected. Pearson correlation analysis is first used to check the correlations among the study variables. To overcome multicollinearity, principal component analysis is used. Then, stepwise multiple regression analysis is used to develop the cost prediction model. Finally, non-parametric bootstrap method is used to develop range estimation of the implementation cost. Findings A list of project-related variables, which could significantly affect implementation costs of residential construction projects in flood-prone areas, is identified. A model, which is developed based on an integration of principle component analysis and regression analysis, is robust. Regarding range estimation, 10, 50 and 90 percent cost estimates, which could provide information about the uncertainty levels in the estimates, are established. Furthermore, implementation cost contingencies which could show information about the variability in the estimates are determined for example case projects. Such information could be critical to cost-related management of residential construction projects in flood-prone areas. Originality/value This study attempts to predict implementation cost contingencies for residential construction projects in flood-prone areas using non-parametric bootstrap method.

User resistance to ESs implementation is consistently identified as a critical reason for this high failure rate. While previous research, primarily through case studies, has explored several reasons for user resistance, the results of status quo bias research suggest that switching costs are the main reason. This study classifies switching cost subtypes based on status quo bias research, develops a theoretical model based on the equity implementation model, and examines the effects of switching costs on user resistance through a survey of employees at a manufacturing company that was in the process of implementing a new ES. The results of this survey indicate that uncertainty costs and sunk costs directly increase user resistance, while transition costs and loss costs indirectly increase user resistance by reducing the perceived value of switching. The results of this study advance the theoretical understanding of ESs implementation and user resistance to change. These findings also offer suggestions to organizations for managing user resistance and may help reduce the failure rates of ESs implementation projects due to user resistance.","Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Seoul 120749, South Korea","Kim, HW (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",kimhw@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Korean GovernmentKorean Government [NRF-2010-327-B00168],"Manuscript received November 6, 2009; revised May 11, 2010, September 7, 2010, and September 29, 2010; accepted October 11, 2010.

A recent report indicates that 64% of ongoing megaprojects globally are facing cost overruns. Despite their increasing occurrence, there has been limited published research in the mainstream literature that has specifically examined why and how they occur. Consequently, suggestions regarding how to constructively address cost overruns in hydrocarbon megaprojects are scant. To better understand the causal nature of cost overruns in hydrocarbon megaprojects, this article provides a critical review of the extant literature. Findings from the research indicate that complex interactions between project characteristics, people, technology, and structure and culture contribute to cost overruns occurring. As a result, it is suggested that chaos theory can be used to explain how cost overruns arise in hydrocarbon megaprojects. This article provides a reference point for engendering future research in this pervasive and fertile area.","[Olaniran, Olugbenga Jide; Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Perth, WA, Australia; [Love, Peter E.

The methodology relies on two key stages. First, a computer model generates the set of feasible options for work zone layouts and schedules, and combines them to include all options for the intervention's planning and undertaking. Subsequently, a multiple-criteria decision model is used to compare all the alternatives included in the previously obtained set using agency cost, duration, and traffic delay as criteria, according to the weightings that correspond to the decision-maker's preferences. It constitutes an advance in the current knowledge by avoiding the prior characterization of each alternative and, based on the novel integration of the mentioned criteria, pointing towards the set of alternatives that merit additional analysis. Two case studies with different traffic levels are discussed, showing the capabilities of this methodology while identifying the most adequate alternatives for each context.

Usually, the uncertainties in subsurface projects arise from the unknown ground conditions that may cause the designer to fail to consider all the potential issues prone to occur during the construction procedure. Total time and costs uncertainties can be considered as the most important uncertainties during the planning and excavation of a tunnel project that is directly connected with cognition of the subsurface conditions. This work presents an updating procedure and associated code, which allows one to refine predictions during construction. Updating does not only involve replacing the original prediction by actual data from the excavation but also includes a learning effect. The updating uses information from the actual excavation to arrive at an improved prediction for the unexcavated part. Updating the ground conditions and time-cost scatter-gram in tunnels during excavation is a tool, which helps the user refine input parameters by deriving relevant information from construction data and presenting it together with original input. In this paper, an example project shows that the updating result has a significant impact on the precision of the prediction and reduces the uncertainty about ground conditions and construction time and cost of the tunnel substantially. It facilitates both the owners and the contractors to be aware of the risk they should carry before construction of the unexcavated part, and it is useful for both tendering and bidding.","[Mahmoodzadeh, Arsalan; Daraei, Ako; Sherwani, Aryan Far H.] Soran Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Soran, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq; [Mohammadi, Mokhtar; Darwesh, Aso M.] Univ Human Dev, Dept Informat Technol, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq; [Rashid, Tarik A.] Univ Kurdistan Hewler, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Erbil, Kurdistan, Iraq; [Faraj, Rabar H.] Univ Halabja, Dept Bldg & Construct Engn, Halabja, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq","Mahmoodzadeh, A (corresponding author), Soran Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Soran, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq.",arsalan.mahmoodzadeh@soran.edu.iq,"Rashid, Tarik A./P-3473-2019; Sherwani, Aryan Far H./AAO-5919-2020; Daraei, Ako/AAK-7917-2021; mohammadi, mokhtar/U-4872-2019","Rashid, Tarik A./0000-0002-8661-258X; Sherwani, Aryan Far H./0000-0001-6999-2106; mohammadi, mokhtar/0000-0002-1393-5062; Faraj, Rabar H./0000-0003-0810-3867; Faraj, Rabar H./0000-0001-7101-925X; Daraei, Ako/0000-0002-0635-768X",,,,60,9,9,2,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Cost estimators use this index frequently to estimate the cost of construction projects. The CCI forecast provides contractors with more accurate bids. It also helps owners with their projects' budgeting. Previous studies have forecasted this index via multivariate and univariate techniques. Homogeneity of variance is assumed on these techniques, however the CCI shows periods of substantial volatility. So far the standard tools used to address volatility on time series have been the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. In this study, a seasonal historical data set of ENR Construction Cost Index is analyzed in order to extract and forecast volatilities of the CCI in the short term. Results of this study show high and persistent volatility of the CCI in the cases of economic shocks. The maximum of the conditional variances over the entire sample period (January 1987 to July 2012) occurred in October 2008. The variance equation shows that both lags of residuals and the lag of GARCH term are highly significant, implying that the volatility of risk is influenced by past square residual terms as well as current variance of the series.

This study integrates the fuzzy c-means clustering technique and the chaotic technique into the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to develop the Fuzzy Clustering Chaotic-based Differential Evolution (FCDE) algorithm, an innovative approach to solving complex optimization problems. Within the FCDE, the chaotic technique prevents the optimization algorithm from premature convergence and the fuzzy c-means clustering technique acts as several multi-parent crossover operators in order to utilize population information efficiently and enhance convergence efficiency. Further, this study applies a serial method to reflect individual-user priorities into the active schedule and the project duration calculations. The FCDE and serial method are then integrated into a novel optimization model called the Fuzzy Clustering Chaotic-based Differential Evolution for Solving Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (FCDE-RCPSP). Experiments run indicate that the proposed FCDE-RCPSP obtains optimal results more reliably and efficiently than the benchmark algorithms considered. The FCDE-RCPSP is a promising alternative approach to handling resource-constrained project scheduling problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the government efforts for driving BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US, so as to develop appropriate roadmaps for increasing BIM implementations in other countries. Design/methodology/approach This study performs a review on the government efforts and roles in BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US. Findings Through cross comparison with existing literature, it is found that Singapore and the UK adopt a government-driven approach and a phase-by-phase development pattern is observed. The first phase focuses on the building sector to rapidly increase the use of BIM and the government generally plays the role of an initiator. In the second phase, BIM is expanded to other implementation areas, e.g. smart city. The importance of the initiator role decreases and more attention is paid to supporting roles such as researcher, educator and regulator. In contrast, an industry-driven approach is adopted in the US. The main role of the government is that of a regulator, with research institutions actively supporting the BIM implementation. Research limitations/implications General roadmaps of the two mandating approaches are presented. The results can provide a useful reference for countries and regions that intend to develop roadmaps to increase their BIM maturity level and enhance readiness to accept and implement BIM. Originality/value This study is one of the first studies that investigate the step-by-step roadmaps for implementing BIM from the perspective of changing government roles.","[Jiang, Rui; Wu, Chengke; Lei, Xiang; Wu, Peng] Curtin Univ, Sch Design & Built Environm, Perth, Australia; [Shemery, Ammar; Hampson, Keith D.] Curtin Univ, Sustainable Built Environm Natl Res Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia","Wu, P (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Design & Built Environm, Perth, Australia.",rui.jiang2@postgrad.curtin.edu.au; chengke.wu@postgrad.curtin.edu.au; xiang.lei@postgrad.curtin.edu.au; a.shemery@sbenrc.com.au; k.hampson@sbenrc.com.au; peng.wu@curtin.edu.au,,", Rui/0000-0001-5007-5746; Hampson, Keith/0000-0003-0339-5637; wu, peng/0000-0002-3793-0653",Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher AwardAustralian Research Council [DE170101502]; Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR,This research was funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (Project No. DE170101502) by the Australian Government.,,106,0,0,7,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This study examines the current usage of SM within the construction industry. It also analyzes the potential risks and rewards and the collaborative and innovative aspects of these online applications. To understand this, an SM log was developed to track activity on popular SM platforms for 10 construction organizations. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from construction organizations that were familiar with SM as a company resource. The main finding was that traditional SM platforms are being used within the daily operations of construction companies. Popular sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are being used to share industry events with the communities of followers. LinkedIn, on the other hand, is being used to develop professional networks and assist in recruitment.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in two stages. First, data from a sub-set of construction industry workers were extracted from a large scale survey of workers in Victoria, Australia (the VicWAL survey). The survey measured work-life interference using the Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI). Next a subset of survey respondents was identified and interviewed to gain more detailed explanatory information and insight into work-life experiences. Findings - The survey results indicated that respondents who reported working for a construction firm with between 16 and 99 employees reported significantly higher AWALI scores (indicating high work-life interference) than workers in organisations employing 15 or less or more than 100 workers. The follow-up interviews revealed that workers in small construction organisations were managed directly and personally by the business owner/manager and able to access informal work-life supports that were provided on an as needs basis. In comparison workers in medium-sized firms perceived higher levels of work pressure and an expectation that work would be prioritised over family life. Research limitations/implications - The research shows that the findings of work-life balance research undertaken in large construction organisations cannot be generalised to SMEs. Organisation size should also be treated as an important variable in work-life balance research in construction. Practical implications - The research suggests that a better understanding of how workers in SME construction firms experience work-life balance is important in the design and development of work-life balance programs. In particular the challenges faced by workers as companies grow from SMEs require careful consideration and management. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on the work-life balance experiences of employees in large construction firms. Little was previously known about the experiences of workers in SME construction firms. The research provides new insight into the work-life experiences of construction workers in organisations of varying sizes.","[Lingard, Helen] RMIT Univ, Ctr Construct Work Hlth & Safety, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Turner, Michelle] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Charlesworth, Sara] RMIT Univ, Sch Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Lingard, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Ctr Construct Work Hlth & Safety, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au,"Charlesworth, Sara/F-1098-2011; Turner, Michelle/J-1757-2015","Charlesworth, Sara/0000-0001-6975-9283; Turner, Michelle/0000-0002-7893-5848; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390",,,,34,12,12,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Moreover, the primary contribution of this study is to emphasize the support of the local government in the development of emerging industries on the perspective of the creation of a large-scale market demand. The creation of large-scale market demand may inspire actors to be proactive in responding to these incentives; thus, public and private actions may help increase the accessibility to technology, infrastructure, and finances. Hence, a market-oriented policy that incentivizes the creation and expansion of market demand among diverse public and private actors should be seen as the key issue for the emergence and growth of emerging industries.

This study investigates the relationship between leadership styles and worker performance outcomes for construction organisations in Wellington, New Zealand. Data were obtained from workers using the well-known Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to determine the relationship between identified leadership attributes and worker performance outcomes. The study found that there was a significant relationship between all of the leadership style attributes and worker performance outcomes. Specifically, transformational leadership was found to be the most prominent leadership style adopted. The result shows that workers accomplished set tasks and goals as an outcome of this leadership style. Regarding leadership attributes, the study found that managers exhibited more of Idealised Influence (Attributed) and Inspirational Motivation attributes than others. Also, it was found that managers' failure to engage with worker and respond to urgent matters when required (Lassiez-Faire and Management by Exception (Passive)) were identified as major deterrents to the performance of workers.

This sudden widespread shift to home-based teleworking was not anticipated. Consequently, the ability to make provisions to ensure the health and safety of workers was limited. Further, in many cases, the shift to working at home has been involuntary and likely to continue for an extended period. The study presented in this paper aimed to examine the health and well-being experiences in a sample of professional/managerial workers who were engaged in teleworking as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation developed. Data were collected from workers in the Australian construction industry who were required to work from home on alternate weeks to reduce the number of people in project offices. A multiwave survey was conducted at three construction projects. Longitudinal analysis of the data indicated a consistent gradual decline in the mental well-being of participants. The analysis identified a positive and significant relationship between work-life satisfaction and mental well-being and indicated that the effects of work hours, work pressure, work engagement, and work-life interference on mental well-being were mediated by the extent to which participants were satisfied with their work-life balance. Combining these results with qualitative comments made by participants helped to understand their varying experiences during the pandemic and the impact on their mental well-being. The results highlight the importance of considering work-life satisfaction and creating opportunities for improved work-family balance when designing teleworking arrangements. The paper contributes to knowledge and practice by providing the evidence that helps organizations to maximize the health benefits and reduce the risks associated with home-based working during (and potentially beyond) the pandemic.","[Pirzadeh, Payam; Lingard, Helen] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia","Pirzadeh, P (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",payam.pirzadeh@rmit.edu.cn; helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au,,"Pirzadeh, Payam/0000-0001-6511-0946; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390",RMIT Alumni and Philanthropy; 2020 Malcolm Moore Industry Research Award; Lendlease Building,The study was supported by the RMIT Alumni and Philanthropy and a 2020 Malcolm Moore Industry Research Award.

Although it seems convenient to store the required local information (e.g., information about neighborhood, buildings) in a centralized database, S&R teams usually cannot access centralized databases because the information infrastructure is usually damaged or overloaded immediately after a disaster. This paper describes the search and rescue data access point (SR-DAP) system that was designed for storing and retrieving the required local information in/from data storage units that are deployed at buildings. In the paper, the developed approach is presented, and two key technologies (i.e., radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes) that are used as local storage mediums in SR-DAP are empirically evaluated. The results of the field experiments show that current technologies can be effectively utilized in the developed system. However, comparison of the technologies highlights the fact that the current wireless sensor technology is advantageous over RFID technology. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000093.

However, the impact on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is not always clear as the resources required to implement such a strategy in an SME often falls beyond what is considered to be acceptable risk. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issue of whether SMEs truly know how to effectively operate in an environment driven by customization. This paper introduces and demonstrates, through two case studies, how the principles of MC have been adopted by SMEs within the context of manufacturing agility and product flexibility. The paper explores the issues of product configuration, component similarity and the set of tools and measures of performance developed to steer the MC implementation process. The paper examines how the reuse of common components in product families can reduce internal variety. Coefficients that measure the similarity of products within a family are presented. These consider the factors of product structure, cost, volume and contribution. The product-component matrix is introduced to represent product families and calculate the similarity coefficients.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L23 2SW, Merseyside, England","Ismail, H (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L23 2SW, Merseyside, England.",hsismail@liv.ac.uk,"Reid, Iain/AAY-2296-2020","Reid, Iain/0000-0003-2581-1283",,,,34,28,28,0,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

This study evaluates the effects of lifting weights and postures on spinal biomechanics (i.e. muscle activity and muscle fatigue) during a simulated repetitive lifting task undertaken within a strictly controlled laboratory experimental environment. Twenty healthy male participants performed simulated repetitive lifting tasks with three different lifting weights using either a stoop (n = 10) or a squat (n = 10) lifting posture until subjective fatigue (a point in time at which the participant cannot continue lifting further). Spinal biomechanics during repetitive lifting tasks were measured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Results revealed that (1) increased lifting weights significantly increased sEMG activity and muscle fatigue of the biceps brachii (BB), brachioradialis (BR), lumbar erector spinae (LES), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles but not the rectus femoris (RF) muscle; (2) sEMG activity and muscle fatigue rate of the LES muscle were higher than all other muscles; (3) a significant difference of sEMG activity of the RF and MG muscles was observed between lifting postures, however no significant difference of muscle fatigue was apparent (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that risk factors such as lifting weights, repetitions and lifting postures may alleviate the risk of developing WMSDs. However, future research is required to investigate the effectiveness of using ergonomic interventions (such as using team lifting and adjustable lift equipment) in reducing WMSDs risks in construction workers. This work represents the first laboratory-based simulated testing conducted to investigate work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) primarily caused by repetitive lifting tasks and manual handling. Cumulatively, the results and ensuing discussion offer insight into how these risks can be measured and mitigated.","[Antwi-Afari, M.

However, measuring the level of workers' motivation at workplace is not always straightforward because the workers' motivation is a function of various personal and external factors. This paper proposes a fuzzy rule-based model for evaluating the motivation level of construction workers using their working patterns. The motivation level evaluated using the fuzzy rule-based model was compared with motivational levels determined by the traditional Vroom's expectancy theory or Expectancy-Instrumentality-Valence (EIV) method. EIV method used questionnaire surveys and interviews to determine workers' motivation. The results of fuzzy rule-based models aligned closely with the EIV model, especially for the middle range of motivation levels. Compared to traditional EIV model, the fuzzy rule-based system is simple to implement and found to be very pragmatic in construction field settings.","[Yeheyis, Muluken; Reza, Bahareh] Univ British Columbia, Okanagan Campus,1137 Alumni Ave, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Hewage, Kasun; Sadiq, Rehan] Univ British Columbia, Sch Engn, Okanagan Campus,1137 Alumni Ave, Kelowna, BC, Canada; [Ruwanpura, Janaka Y.] Univ Calgary, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB, Canada","Hewage, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Engn, Okanagan Campus,1137 Alumni Ave, Kelowna, BC, Canada.",kasun.hewage@ubc.ca,"Hewage, Kasun/AAQ-2395-2020",,,,,82,3,3,1,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The mutual interferences among construction activities of long-distance diversion tunnels (LDDTs) are complicated because of their crisscrossing and intensive layout, which will affect scheduling to some degree. Especially, lithology has a conclusive influence on underground construction. But the lithology determination methods of current construction simulation, such as the trend of extrapolation from observations, do not fully consider lithology's inherent characteristics and the transition probability between different lithological classifications. In the present study, the authors propose a hierarchical simulation model coupling the critical path method (CPM) and cycle operation network (CYCLONE) to arrange the intricate construction sequence of LDDTs. Additionally, a Markov prediction model is embedded into the CYCLONE model as a specific component to consider lithological uncertainty and estimate construction parameters of each cycle automatically. Based on the proposed simulation model, a real-time construction schedule analysis system is built. A case study project is analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology and to highlight its capabilities. For this project, a reasonable planned schedule is proposed, an optimal equipment selection is determined, the excavation intensity is balanced, and it is verified that a simulation model considering lithological uncertainty using a Markov process provides a higher level of accuracy in prediction than traditional simulations. Finally, regulatory measures are presented for site management based on the simulation results and the deviations between the actual and planned schedules.

By performing case studies on four actual projects, the probabilities of risk factors for each project were confirmed based on project attributes; furthermore, delay probabilities for the renovations of each project were accurately estimated.

Multiskilling is one workforce strategy that has been traditionally proposed as a pathway to retain the current workforce. This study aims to understand the changes in multiskilling and the influence of race on multiskilling patterns. While many demographic populations of the US construction workforce have declined, the Hispanics population has actually grown. Unfortunately, the growth of the Hispanic workforce has primarily occurred in low-skilled construction trades. While the study finds that there are significant differences in formal training between Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers that possess only a single skill, there are no statistical differences in the formal training between multi-skilled Hispanic and non-Hispanic construction craft workers. Further, there are no difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic trade patterns among craft workers with dual-skills, but differences were found in multiskilling combinations between craft workers with more than two skills. Hence when afforded the same access to education and training, the findings suggest that differences in career progression, as measured by skill attainment across multiple trades, lessen between Hispanics and non-Hispanic construction workers.","[Albattah, Mohammed A.] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Goodrum, Paul M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Nicholas R Petry Prof Construct Engn & Management, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Littlejohn, Ray] Univ Colorado, Lockheed Martin Engn Management Program, Management, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Taylor, Timothy R.

As construction projects are labor-intensive and heavily rely on manual tasks, understanding the ever-changing behavior and activities is essential to manage construction workers effectively regarding their safety and productivity. While several research efforts have shown promising results in automated motion and activity recognition of the workers using motion sensors, there is still a lack of understanding about how motion sensors' numbers and their locations affect the performance of the recognition, which can contribute to improving the recognition performance and reducing the implementation cost. Moreover, further research is necessary to seek the motion recognition model that accurately identifies various motions using motion sensors attached to the workers' bodies. This study proposes a construction worker's motion recognition model using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of motion sensors' numbers and locations to maximize motion recognition performance. The evaluation is conducted by generating different datasets containing motion sensor data collected from the sensors located on different body parts. Comparing the performance of five machine learning models trained using the datasets, the desired numbers and locations of motion sensors are identified. The quasi-experimental test with multiple subjects is conducted to validate the findings of the evaluation. Based on the findings, the LSTM network for recognizing construction workers' motions is developed. The LSTM network classifies various motions of the workers that can be utilized as primitive elements for monitoring the workers regarding their safety and productivity.","[Kim, Kinam; Cho, Yong K.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Cho, YK (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",kkim734@gatech.edu; yong.cho@ce.gatech.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1919068],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (#1919068).

However, in construction projects, 'who owns float and buffers and how much' are fundamental challenges when deciding on their fair allocation among activities within a schedule. Based on the hypothesis that the network structure of the schedule must be considered in such allocation, this research introduces new theory to fairly and efficiently allocate such protective time periods, hereinafter referred to as float, at the activity level, where critical ones are most in need. Its contribution to the body of knowledge is fourfold: First, copulas are modified to correlate the activity durations. Second, the delay risk score is defined to reflect both the probability and the severity of their delay. Third, an algorithm rooted in political apportionment methods is created to allocate float via the delay risk score to those activities within the structure that have potential to turn critical in a Monte Carlo simulation. Fourth, saturation apportionment is identified for various test schedules. This can aid decision-makers in rationally allocating float in schedules to protect their projects from delays.","[Su, Yi] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Econ & Management Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Lucko, Gunnar; Thompson, Richard C., Jr.] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA","Lucko, G (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USA.",suy@bucea.edu.cn; lucko@cua.edu; thompsrc@cua.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI1265989],"The support of the National Science Foundation (Grant CMMI1265989) for portions of the work presented here is gratefully acknowledged.

In the aftermath of a disaster, enormous and diverse community recovery needs emerge, necessitating an effective interplay of cyber-physical-social systems during emergencies and throughout the phases of short- and long-term recovery. With recognition of the important roles played by multidimensional infrastructure, considerable research and development has been undertaken in each discipline to support communities in the aftermath of disasters. These multiple domains of infrastructure systems are heterogeneous in their structure and operation but are nevertheless interrelated. Therefore, the absence of an integrated platform on which emergency personnel from different disciplines could coordinate resilience planning often hampers the smooth and effective recovery process of communities during postdisaster recovery. This study proposes a new approach for analyzing capacity needs of a wide range of critical infrastructure during postdisaster recovery, framed within seven interrelated infrastructure layers: civil, civic, social, financial, environmental, educational, and cyber/communication. This research employs node analysis to deal with the complexity of the infrastructure layer networks and visualize the interplay among them. The proposed seven-layer framework facilitates an understanding of the interdependencies within and between the infrastructure layers, and an analysis of various communities' needs specific to the phases of postdisaster recovery. Finally, the implementation and the benefits of this seven-layer conceptualization are demonstrated through case studies of past postdisaster recovery operations.","[Choi, Juyeong] FSU, FAMU, Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA; [Deshmukh, Abhijeet; Hastak, Makarand] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hastak, Makarand] Purdue Univ, Div Construct Engn & Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Hastak, M (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Hastak, M (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Div Construct Engn & Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jchoi@eng.famu.fsu.edu; abhid1684@gmail.com; hastak@purdue.edu,"Choi, Juyeong/AAH-2268-2021","Choi, Juyeong/0000-0002-7136-0500",,,,86,6,7,8,39,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

We first present (1) role-conflict theory and exchange theory to establish the multiple dimensions of commitment (affective, continuance, and normative) and (2) social identity theory to support our argument for different foci of commitment-organization and profession. Building on these theoretical lenses, we present the literature review that compares organizational and professional commitment of project workers with respect to the three dimensions of commitment. Adopting a positivist approach and a sample of 141 project workers, we use Pearson's correlation to identify the relationship between affective organizational and affective professional, continuance organizational and continuance professional, and normative organizational and normative professional commitment. We report significant correlation between affective organizational commitment and affective professional commitment of project workers. The correlations between continuance organizational commitment and continuance professional commitment and normative organizational commitment and normative professional commitment are moderate. We then discuss the implications of these findings for the project management profession.","[Dwivedula, Ravikiran] Univ Lille Nord France, F-59000 Lille, France; [Dwivedula, Ravikiran] SKEMA Business Sch, Lille Sch Management Res Ctr, Lille, France; [Dwivedula, Ravikiran] IBS Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Bredillet, Christophe N.] SKEMA Business Sch ESC Lille, Lille, France","Dwivedula, R (corresponding author), Univ Lille Nord France, F-59000 Lille, France.",,"Bredillet, Christophe/J-1371-2012; Bredillet, Christophe/L-6799-2019","Bredillet, Christophe/0000-0002-8823-4375; Bredillet, Christophe/0000-0002-8823-4375",,,,54,17,19,1,48,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",8756-9728,1938-9507,,PROJ MANAG J,Proj.

In ancient times this process seems to have been accomplished based on the scheme of arrangements being contained in the leader's mind and instructions communicated verbally. Modern approaches to solving the twin challenges of first thinking through the 'plan' and then communicating the plan to the people who need to do 'the right work, at the right time, in the right place' use sophisticated graphics, charts, diagrams, and computations. This paper traces the development of the concepts most project managers take for granted including bar charts and critical path schedules from their origins (which are far earlier than most people think) through to the modern day. The first section of the paper looks at the development of concepts that allow the visualization of time and other data. The second looks at the shift from static representations to dynamic modeling through the emergence of computers, dynamic calculations and integrated data from the 1950s to the present time.","[Bourne, Lynda M.] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Weaver, Patrick] Mosaic Project Serv Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Vic 3205, Australia","Weaver, P (corresponding author), Mosaic Project Serv Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Vic 3205, Australia.",patw@mosaicprojects.com.au,,,,,,37,3,3,0,10,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

This widely studied problem from the scheduling theory links the sophisticated solution algorithms with the moderate real world applications. This paper presents a novel multiobjective discrete artificial bee colony algorithm based decomposition, called MODABC/D, to solve the sequence dependent setup times multiobjective permutation flowshop scheduling problem with the objective to minimize makespan and total flowtime. First, in order to make the standard artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the scheduling problem, a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed to solve the problem based on the perturbation operation. Then, a problem-specific solution builder heuristic is used to initialize the population to enhance the quality of the initial solution. Finally, a further local search method are comprised of a single local search procedures based on the insertion neighborhood structures to find the better solution for the nonimproved individual. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested on the well-known benchmark suite of Taillard. The highly effective performance of the multiobjective discrete artificial bee colony algorithm-based decomposition is compared against the state of art algorithms from the existing literature in terms of both coverage value and hypervolume indicator.","[Li, Xiangtao; Ma, Shijing] Northeast Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China","Li, XT (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",lixt314@nenu.edu.cn; masj195@nenu.edu.cn,"Li, Xiangtao/A-4804-2019",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61603087]; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province [20160101253JC],This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61603087 and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province under Grant 20160101253JC.

The objective of this research is to improve the capability of project managers for making informed decisions by providing a reliable forecasting method of the final cost and duration. The method put forth and its evaluation make use of a well established project management method, a recent technique for analyzing schedule performance, and the mathematics of statistics to achieve its purpose-EVM, earned schedule (ES) and statistical prediction and testing methods. The calculation method proposed was studied using data from 12 projects. The results for both final cost and duration are shown to be sufficiently reliable for general application of the forecasting method. The use of the method is encouraged; it may be applied irrespective of the type of work or cost and duration magnitude of the project. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Data collected using regular inspections are used for maintenance decision making in the period between consecutive inspections, disregarding the future degradation of the assets and the resultant levels of service. Forecasting future conditions using historic data is difficult because of the uncertainty and stochastic nature of deterioration. A major gap in knowledge is the lack of methods for predicting this highly uncertain degradation process for components of community buildings to support a strategic decision-making process. This paper presents a Markov process-based method for deterioration prediction of building components using condition data collected by the City of Kingston in Australia. Markov transition matrices for building components have been derived using a modified method combining the genetic algorithm with Monte Carlo sampling called direct absolute value difference, which offers superior accuracy. The derived matrices are validated using a new data set collected in 2011. Fourteen transition matrices for building components are proposed. The paper presents a typical decision-making method based on the Markov process.

The visualizations implemented are tested to show their usefulness and to identify opportunities for incorporating new visualization features that are common to other visualizations supported in the environment. The key lesson learned from the bottom-up development process is that by attending to individual image details, the developed visualizations: 1) are responsiveness to answering specific CM questions, 2) apply state-of-the-art data visualization techniques, 3) fit within an environment architecture, and 4) allow for the enrichment of design guidelines and lists of common visualization features.

Design/methodology/approach A social constructionist epistemology supports the discourse analysis of talk (semi-structured interview and conversational), text (SMS and documentation) and visual (safety related signage) data collection from five large (+20 pound m) UK construction sites. Findings Construction workers readily understand safety to be an emergent phenomenon with the complex system that is the construction site. Contemporary safety management approaches struggle with this complexity, yet there is the potential to mobilise situational self-organising on sites to improve safety in practice. Research limitations/implications - Epistemological foundations mean no claim is made to generalisability as perceived by traditional positivistic parameters. The data are limited to large (+20m) pound UK construction sites; however, underlying construction management systems are common to the industry as a whole and can find fit with practitioner experiences and other empirical academic work from both the UK and other countries. Practical implications - Situational self-organising of safety management within the construction workforce is proposed as a key contribution to a relevant, dynamic and effective SMS. Originality/value Data are analysed from a social constructionist perspective and considered through a complexity lens. This approach unpacks these data in an original way to seek synergy with existing adaptive safety approaches, specifically situational self-organising and make recommendations for practice.","[Sherratt, Fred] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Chelmsford, England; [Ivory, Chris] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Ashcroft Int Business Sch, Cambridge, England","Sherratt, F (corresponding author), Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Chelmsford, England.",fred.sherratt@anglia.ac.uk,"Sherratt, Fred/ABH-3272-2020",,,,,45,3,3,7,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This alarming statistics, together with the fact that the construction working environment is less structured and predictable than other industries, indicate the need for better coordination and management of equipment on earthwork sites. Location based Guidance Systems (LGSs) have been introduced and implemented for improving high-precision earthwork operations. However, the state of practice in LGSs is limited to machine-level equipment management. In view of the LGSs ability to control the finest motion of earthwork construction equipment, there is a great potential to boost their applicability at the project level, where decisions about the equipment control are made based on the global consideration of a fleet rather than a local view of one single piece of equipment. Accordingly, the present paper aims to design a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture that combines LGS technology with advanced safety management methods to support the equipment operators on the construction site. A two-layer safety mechanism is proposed for the safety management in the MAS that enables proactive and reactive responses for the prevention of equipment-related collisions on the construction site. A case study is developed to validate the proposed method. It is found that the proposed MAS structure is able to effectively address the fleet-level coordination between earthwork equipment and potentially improve the safety of earthwork projects.","[Vandatikhaki, Faridaddin] Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Horsttoren Z-210,Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Langari, Seied Mohammad] Concordia Univ, Bldg Civil & Environm Engn Dept, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Taher, Alhusain] Concordia Univ, Concordia Inst Informat Syst Engn, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [El Ammari, Khaled] Concordia Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Hammad, Amin] Concordia Inst Informat Syst Engn, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada","Hammad, A (corresponding author), Concordia Inst Informat Syst Engn, 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",f.vandatikhaki@utwente.nl; al_taher@encs.concordia.ca; elamm_k@encs.concordia.ca; hammad@ciise.concordia.ca,,"Vahdatikhaki, Faridaddin/0000-0001-9914-2612",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; WorkSafeBC [RS2011-0G05],This research has been supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and WorkSafeBC (RS2011-0G05).

This study proposes a Construction Project Cops-based Knowledge Management (ConPCKM) system for use by general contractors during the construction phase. The ConPCKM is then applied in selected case study of a construction building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge.

Whereas manual reconstruction of 3D indoor models is a time-consuming task, methods for automatic or semiautomatic reconstruction can achieve a significant reduction of the time and labor required for indoor modeling. This paper proposes a new shape grammar approach for efficient generation of 3D models of indoor environments from point clouds. The shape grammar derives 3D models of complex environments by using a simple primitive and iterative application of grammar rules governed by a production procedure. The method can reconstruct both building elements and navigable spaces along with their topological relations. It produces 3D parametric models with high geometric accuracy and rich semantic content compliant with building information modeling (BIM) standards. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets show the ability of the method to generate highly accurate indoor models with computation times ranging from seconds to a few minutes. The usefulness of the output models in supporting indoor path planning at varying granularities is also demonstrated.","[Tran, H.; Khoshelham, K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Kealy, A.] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Diaz-Vilarino, L.] Univ Vigo, Appl Geotechnol Grp, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain","Tran, H (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",tran5@student.unimelb.edu.au,"Vilarino, Lucia Diaz/ABI-6394-2020; Diaz-Vilarino, Lucia/B-3020-2017; Kealy, Allison/C-6082-2014","Vilarino, Lucia Diaz/0000-0002-2382-9431; Diaz-Vilarino, Lucia/0000-0002-2382-9431; Kealy, Allison/0000-0002-6776-3411",University of Melbourne through the Melbourne International Research Scholarship; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [ED481B 2016/079-0],Financial support from the University of Melbourne through the Melbourne International Research Scholarship is gratefully acknowledged.

A brief overview of recent construction data visualization work is first provided. Then, as part of a top-down design approach, we introduce concepts and useful terminology related to a structured way of thinking about analytical reasoning and visual analytics, and their relationship with construction management functions. The focus of the latter then shifts to how a construction data visualization environment can support project participant analytical reasoning needs for the management of time, specifically planning/predicting and monitoring/diagnosing/controlling construction conditions and time performance. A case study of aspects of an actual project examined using the construction data visualization environment developed to date is then presented. Purposes served include demonstrating the breadth of support that can be offered for reasoning by such an environment, and providing a test case for demonstrating the kind of evaluation process one should engage in to assess how well an environment conforms to the requirements set out for it. Time management functions treated for this case study include assessing quality of a baseline schedule, assessing actual vs. planned construction conditions and time performance, and assessing reasons for deviations. An evaluation of the current environment is then made to assess conformance/non-conformance with the requirements established for it and to identify worthwhile extensions to it. The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned from work performed to date, and their application to create a more comprehensive visualization environment that supports multiple CM functions.

This paper presents three new community-based metrics to identify the critical elements of a network system. Two of these metrics assess intracommunity and intercommunity behavior for any community structure, and the third metric accounts for the multiple levels of community structure. First, these metrics are studied to establish their characteristics with different community structures, and then the Great Britain Railway Network is used as a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of these new metrics. The results show that an assessment of the system using these metrics leads to the identification of not only those elements that are critical at the global level, but also those that greatly affect the local performance of the communities. Such identification of the critical components at the community and global levels would enable a better understanding of system behavior by stakeholders with competing demands.

Typically, available systems rely heavily on a static scenario in the calculation of safest routes for evacuation. In addition, egress route calculation and evacuation simulations are performed separately from path-finding for rescue teams. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art dynamic approach, which deals not only with a 3D environment, shape of spaces and hazard locations, but also with the dynamic distribution of occupants during evacuation. A database of densities and information about hazard influence are generated and used to calculate optimal paths for rescue teams. Three simulation scenarios were rigorously compared in this study, namely static with constant density values determined for subsequent stages of evacuation, semi-dynamic with densities representing an actual people distribution in a building during evacuation simulation, and dynamic with temporal distribution of evacuees stored in a database, and dynamically used in optimal path calculations. The findings revealed that static simulation is significantly different from semi-dynamic and dynamic simulations, and each type of simulation is better suited for the decision task at hand. These results have significant implications on achieving a rapid and safe evacuation of people during an emergency event.","[Boguslawski, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Geoengn Min & Geol, Wroclaw, Poland; [Mahdjoubi, Lamine; Zverovich, Vadim] Univ West England, Fac Environm & Technol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Fadli, Fodil] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Doha, Qatar","Boguslawski, P (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Geoengn Min & Geol, Wroclaw, Poland.",pawel.boguslawski@pwr.edu.pl,"Fadli, Fodil/AAF-4259-2020; Boguslawski, Pawel/K-7144-2012","Mahdjoubi, Lamine/0000-0001-8021-6159; FADLI, Fodil/0000-0002-7917-0939; Boguslawski, Pawel/0000-0002-1914-9214",Qatar National Research Fund (Qatar Foundation) [NPRP-06-1208-2-492],This research/publication was made possible by a National Priority Research Program NPRP award [NPRP-06-1208-2-492] from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation).

It would benefit from engaging with a rich vein of work on the production of the built environment over the last 30 years. Theory inherently develops in the political context in which it exists; if it fails to do so, it may be dangerous. This commentary traces the intellectual underpinning concerned with understanding the process of change in the built environment, particularly the result of changes in social relations and the social labour process. The production of the built environment is seen as encompassing all the social processes concerned with producing the built environment, built products, buildings and infrastructure, and out of natural resources, whilst consumption is applied to all the processes involved in consuming these, including the well-being of tenants. And between these are situated the processes of exchange, distribution, and circulation, involving complex webs of relations between developers, builders, and landlords and landowners. The challenge is not only to engage and learn from past work, but also to state explicitly what is currently driving the need for a theory (or set of theories).","[Clarke, Linda] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, London NW1 5LS, England; [Janssen, Joern] GB Off, European Inst Construct Labour Res, London N7 9RQ, England","Clarke, L (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",L.M.Clarke@westminster.ac.uk; joern.janssen@btinternet.com,,,,,,4,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

This effectively enables the creation of virtual environments with logic based on DES models, something that recent research efforts have made possible. This paper introduces this technology with the help of a case study. In particular, the paper presents how interactivity can improve the process of model validation in simulation studies, which is a critical step in achieving model credibility. Via a complex earthmoving operation, a construction engineer can use real-time interactivity to create situations of interest and study the model's response to those, and thus validate that the response is appropriate. These capabilities can significantly enhance the process of model validation, thereby adding to the value of DES for practical use in operations planning and design.

For example, rapid and convenient access to Contextual project information, through continuous position tracking of engineers, managers, and inspectors, can lead to significant cost and time savings due to the accuracy and immediacy with which relevant project information can be made available to field personnel. Considering the spatial expanse and dynamic nature of typical construction projects. mobile users need to be constantly tracked both outdoors as well as indoors. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an attractive option for outdoor environments, but is not suitable for indoor applications because it needs a clear line-of-sight to orbital satellites in order to track position. As a result, alternate means of tracking users' location in indoor environments without relying on GPS is needed. This paper presents research that investigated the effectiveness of three wireless technologies for dynamic indoor user position tracking. In Particular, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN).

The rating system provides an opportunity to rate projects based on the importance given to construction worker safety and health and the degree of implementation of safety and health elements. A Delphi survey using an expert panel of 12 experienced safety and health professionals representing different sectors of the construction industry was employed to develop the SCSH rating system. The study resulted in a rating system consisting of a total of 50 safety and health elements organized into 13 categories. Each category contains safety and health elements which carry credits based on their effectiveness in preventing construction worker injuries and illnesses. The rating system was initially validated based on data from 25 construction projects and found to accurately represent the safety performance of large projects. The SCSH rating system can be used as an effective tool to develop and plan construction safety and health programs and evaluate the potential safety performance of construction projects.,"[Gambatese, John A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan] Hoffman Construct Co, Portland, OR 97205 USA","Gambatese, JA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 220 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",sathy-rajendran@hoffmancorp.com; john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu,"Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan/K-8306-2012",,,,,33,88,89,1,25,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Contrary to prior research, results indicate the level of risk from inadequate communication is not significantly greater when team members are not grouped in one location. Further, despite increased dependence of virtual teams on technology for communication, there was no evidence of significantly more project risk due to technological failure. However, virtual team projects exhibited notably more risk due to insufficient knowledge transfer. A plausible explanation is decreased implicit or informal knowledge transfer in virtual environments. We conclude that the possibility of insufficient knowledge transfer should be included in virtual project risk management plans, and consideration should be given in such projects to the extent to which knowledge that is traditionally shared implicitly might be shared explicitly through electronic means.

Design/methodology/approach Extant literature identified 137 potential factors that influence the construction safety performances of building developers. Focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with 11 panels of experts and professionals. The Relative Importance Index (RII) was used to analyse the response feedback described in a similar paper. In this study, the survey tool used was set up with 40 variables grouped into eight latent variables in the framework, which were agreed and certified as extremely important by the panel. Based on random sampling, data were collected from 229 valid respondents. Structural equation modelling (SEM) technique using Smart PLS software was then used to analyse the respondent's feedback. Findings The results show that safety administration and processes, effective communication of safety behaviour, significantly influenced safety performance on a construction site with beta values of 0.330 and 0.431 along with t values of 3.005 and 2.547 at p < 0.1, respectively. These factors, among others, provide a distinct approach to understanding and improving on-site construction safety. The study findings will potentially benefit building professionals and other stakeholders by improving awareness of safety practices. Research limitations/implications The study may not have covered all possible factors that influence the construction safety performance of building developers. Also, the generalizability and transferability of the research outcome to the construction industry wide use is also limited when reference is made to the characteristics of the research respondents and/or participants. In addition, validation of the framework by five professionals is rather small. Practical implications Theoretically, the framework through the identified factors provide a distinct approach to understanding and improving on-site construction safety through voluntary adherence to self-regulatory standard where there are no enforceable laws and regulations to promote safety. The study findings will potentially benefit building professionals and other stakeholders by improving awareness of the health and safety practices of the construction industry. Originality/value Many research efforts have developed frameworks and models for construction safety. However, the particularity of these frameworks to countries other than Nigeria requires similar research to be conducted to enhance the safety performance of building developers.","[Mahmoud, Abubakar Sadiq] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dammam Community Coll, Safety Technol Program, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Hamdan Ahmad, Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Skudai, Malaysia; [Mohd Yatim, Yahya] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying, Main Campus Skudai, Skudai, Malaysia; [Aminu Dodo, Yakubu] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey","Mahmoud, AS (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dammam Community Coll, Safety Technol Program, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.",mahmouds@kfupm.edu.sa; b-hamdan@utm.my; b-yahya@utm.my; ydodo@gelisim.edu.tr,,"Mahmoud, Abubakar Sadiq/0000-0001-6000-5493",,,,76,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Safety climate serves as a frame of reference for employees to make sense of safety measures in the workplace and adapt their behaviors. Though safety climate research abounds, fewer efforts are made to investigate the formation of a safety climate. An effort to explore forming psychological safety climate, an operationalization of safety climate at the individual level, is an appropriate starting point. Taking the view that projects are social processes, this paper develops a conceptual framework of forming the psychological safety climate, and provides a preliminary validation. The model suggests that management can create the desired psychological safety climate by efforts from structural, perceptual, interactive, and cultural perspectives. Future empirical research can be built on the model to provide a more comprehensive and coherent picture of the determinants of safety climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

This paper presents an agent-based construction bidding model that allows modeling different bidding strategies of contractors, observing their interaction and learning over time, and detecting emergent market behavior and bidding patterns. This model is used to simulate a variety of bidders competing against each other under a low-bid tendering approach in order to study the effect of different bidding parameters on their optimal markup decision, long-term financial performance, and survival in the market. Specifically, this paper observes the effect of the market competition level, a contractor's risk attitude, his cost estimation and project management skills, and the project complexity on the contractor's bidding decisions and market equilibrium.

To accomplish this goal, operators need to be able to reliably predict the spatial distribution of PTU demand and to optimize the distributional allocation of resources to meet this demand. This paper proposes a three-step mathematical programming approach that addresses PTU supply vehicle routing and PTU repositioning that minimize the weighted total travel costs and unmet user demand. The methodology combines discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to predict the demand at PTU stations, considers travel cost and unmet user demand in a multiobjective model and solves it with a multiobjective coevolutionary algorithm (MOCA), and incorporates the demand uncertainty to ensure robustness of the optimal repositioning and routing strategy for all the PTU stations. The paper demonstrated the proposed approach using real-world bicycle-sharing data from Nanjing, China, and showed that the proposed approaches for demand prediction (DWT-ANN) and optimization (MOCA) significantly produce superior results compared with traditional methods. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the proposed approaches.","[Feng, Jiaxiao; Ye, Zhirui] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, 2 Southeast Univ Rd, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sikai; Miralinaghi, Mohammad; Labi, Samuel] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Connected & Automated Transportat, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Chen, Sikai] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Robot, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Chai, Jinling] Henan Coll Transportat, Dept Architectural Engn, Zhengzhou 450015, Henan, Peoples R China","Chen, SK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Connected & Automated Transportat, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Chen, SK (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Robot, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",fengjiaxiao@seu.edu.cn; chen1670@purdue.edu; yezhirui@seu.edu.cn; smiralin@purdue.edu; labi@purdue.edu; 395654346@qq.com,,"Labi, Samuel/0000-0001-9830-2071",Key R&D and Promotion Projects in Henan Province [192102310470]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M642790],"This paper represents a joint collaboration between Purdue's Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) and Southeast University, and was sponsored by the Key R&D and Promotion Projects in Henan Province (192102310470) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (2018M642790).",,54,0,0,1,1,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

To achieve this goal, periodic cost estimation is vitally important not only in the planning phase, but also in the execution phase. Due to high uncertainty in operational environment, point estimation of project cost is oftentimes not sufficient to assist the decision-making process. This study utilizes Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), machine learning based interval estimation (MLIE), and Differential Evolution (DE) to establish a novel model for predicting construction project cost. LS-SVM is a supervised learning technique used for regression analysis. MLIE is employed for inference of prediction intervals. Moreover, our model deploys DE in the cross validation process to search for the optimal values of tuning parameters. The newly developed model, named as EAC-LSPIM, yields results consisting of a point estimate coupled with lower and upper prediction limits, at a certain level of confidence, to accentuate uncertainty.

Design/methodology/approach Four explanatory factors were identified for the implementation of CSP in international projects based on literature review. A questionnaire survey was then conducted among Chinese organizations that have been involved in international projects. In total, 121 valid responses were received from the questionnaire survey and were modeled using logistic regression to examine the impact of each factor on the observed event of interest. Findings The factors related to the effectiveness of implementing CSP, including attitudes toward safety management measures (ASMM), operational mechanism for safety regulations (OM), safety knowledge management system (SKMS) and systematic safety training scheme (STS), were selected. The results revealed that OM and SKMS were significant predictors (p < 0.05) of the odds of implementation satisfaction of CSP, but ASMM and STS were not. The probability of satisfactory CSP implementation increased as the value of SKMS increased, whereas the probability of unsatisfactory implementation improved as the value of OM increased. Research limitations/implications The questionnaire was distributed to respondents in international contractors headquartered in China. Other types of international organizations can be covered in future research. Furthermore, other factors, such as the local construction environment, should be considered in future studies. Practical implications The results provide new insights on CSP implementation overseas. Effective implementation of CSP contributes to the improvement of the safety performance of contractors. The practical significance of interpreting the influence factors is that the contractors can implement more efficient and targeted approaches and tools in the execution of their CSP. The impact of OM reminds safety managers of the synchronization of CSP as well as its implementation environment and characteristics. The effect of ASMM encourages contractors to adopt Web-based and digital knowledge management systems to improve the implementation efficiency of CSP. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in the selection of factors and their impacts on CSP implementation in international projects. This study has also extended knowledge on normative safety in international projects based on quantitative modeling.","[Zhang, Qing-Wen; Liao, Pin-Chao; Wan, Yao-Lin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Perth, WA, Australia","Liao, PC (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qwzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn; heap-yih.chong@curtin.edu.au; pinchao@tsinghua.edu.cn; wanyl16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530; ZHANG, QINGWEN/0000-0003-3068-7387",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51878382],The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51878382) for the support for this study.

Yet, despite workers being made aware of the dangers associated with not wearing a safety harness, many forget or purposefully do not wear them when working at heights. To address this problem, this paper develops an automated computer vision-based method that uses two convolutional neural network (CNN) models to determine if workers are wearing their harness when performing tasks while working at heights. The algorithms developed are: (1) a Faster-R-CNN to detect the presence of a worker; and (2) a deep CNN model to identify the harness. A database of photographs of people working at heights was created from activities undertaken on several construction projects in Wuhan, China. The database was then used to test and train the developed networks. The precision and recall rates for the Faster R-CNN were 99% and 95%, and the CNN models 80% and 98%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the developed method can accurately detect workers not wearing their harness. Thus, the computer vision-based approach developed can be used by construction and safety managers as a mechanism to proactively identify unsafe behavior and therefore take immediate action to mitigate the likelihood of a FFH occurring.","[Fang, Weili; Ding, Lieyun; Luo, Hanbin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Dept Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fang, Weili; Ding, Lieyun; Luo, Hanbin] HUST, Hubei Engn Res Ctr Virtual Safe & Automated Const, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Love, Peter E.

Since concrete formwork is often exposed to concentrated loads, geological instability, etc., the structural body should be constantly monitored to maintain safety throughout the construction operation. The objective of this paper is to present a holistic integration environment for monitoring the safety of concrete formwork and increase safety during concrete placement. Based on USN technology, the holistic integration environment combines multiple ICT developments such as sensors, wireless networking, safety monitoring applications, and independent power supply. This holistic approach streamlines the transmission of the sensory data that are collected on the deformation of concrete formwork. A case study has been conducted on an actual concrete placement. The application in the case study demonstrates that a holistic integration environment can be used as an essential tool for safety improvement in the construction operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study specifically aims to: (1) verify the relationships among risk factors, accident types, and injury severity; (2) determine significant risk factors associated with each accident type that are highly correlated to injury severity; and (3) analyse the impact of the identified key factors on accident and fatality occurrence. The analysis results explained that safety managers' roles are critical to reducing human-related risks - particularly misjudgement of hazardous situations - through safety training and education, appropriate use of safety devices and proper safety inspection. However, for environment-related factors, the dominant risk factors were different depending on the different accident types.

Despite a determined effort to improve, the results are still disappointing. Improving the industry's track record requires an in-depth understanding of the factors that drive risks to individual safety and of how behavior and attitudes can be improved. Construction managers lack knowledge of the safety leadership characteristics, which specifically reduce risk-taking behavior of subordinates on construction sites. This information is presented in this research. A leadership-based safety model consisting of subordinates' self-reported accident and near miss records were investigated along with leadership considerations and initiating constructs, the construction manager's safety behavior and attitude profile, and the safety climate characteristics to determine whether any of these factors contributed significantly to a safer construction site. A stepwise regression model was developed to determine key drivers toward the risk-taking behavior of construction workers. Construction managers were also classified by their effective management of safety. Contrary to the postmodern perspective on safety leadership, construction managers who focused on safety standards on-site, ruled with an iron rod, and needled people working with them for greater efforts were more effective at reducing accidents on-site than those construction managers who did otherwise.

Apart from some positive sign of this boost, several other issues have also been developed in the region. One of such issues is the safety of workers at the construction sites. This article, based on a variety of applications of drones in other industrial sectors, considers the use of drones for construction safety improvement in the GCC countries. This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society. The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges.","[Umar, Tariq] Kingston Univ, Sch Engn & Environm, Dept Civil Engn Surveying & Construct Management, London, England","Umar, T (corresponding author), Kingston Univ, Sch Engn & Environm, Dept Civil Engn Surveying & Construct Management, London, England.",tariqumar1984@gmail.com,"Tariq Umar, CEng IntPE/AAJ-9631-2020","Tariq Umar, CEng IntPE/0000-0002-1197-8181",,,,94,0,0,8,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In the past many examples have been reported of where fire caused significant damage to priceless monuments of the world's cultural heritage (e.g.,Chiado area in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1988; Fenice Theatre in Venice, Italy, in 1996). A holistic approach to the preservation of historic buildings should include, among other things, a concern for suitable fire protection design. Such actions, however, are frequently subjected to stringent budget restrictions that confront designers with challenging trade-offs in their decision-making process. In this context, the current study provides an integrated scheme that embodies innovative tools for the solution of the budget allocation problem with respect to protecting historic buildings from fire. In particular, a generic selection and resource allocation model for updating the fire safety of historic buildings is proposed, along with an effective technique for efficiently solving the model for real-world test cases. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is presented for the case of the Mount Athos Monasteries, and results are discussed.","[Naziris, Iordanis A.; Papaioannou, Kyriakos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Bldg Construct & Bldg Phys, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Lagaros, Nikos D.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Inst Struct Anal & Antiseism Res, Athens 15780, Greece","Naziris, IA (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Bldg Construct & Bldg Phys, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",inaziris@gmail.com; nlagaros@central.ntua.gr; kirpap@civil.auth.gr,"Lagaros, Nikos/R-7382-2017","Lagaros, Nikos/0000-0001-6114-9632",Anastasios Anastasiadis endowment,The first author acknowledges the financial support of the Anastasios Anastasiadis endowment.,,41,3,3,1,22,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Despite many documented benefits of thermographic inspection for better characterizing the conditions of built environments, current thermographic inspections still have several inefficiencies. Inspectors typically collect and store large numbers of thermal images or long-sequence thermal videos to support decision making on the maintenance and rehabilitation of built environments. However, more importantly, these large-scale visual data are typically unordered and not localized (a term used to define a process of finding locations or relative positions of a camera). This paper proposes and compares two approaches for simultaneous localization and thermal mapping. These methods estimate a camera's pose and map the environment in three dimensions in real-time. Case studies using an off-the-shelf hardware configuration using solely thermal cameras and an author-customized configuration using both thermal and red, green, and blue (RGB) cameras are conducted and the results are compared with a well-established offline three-dimensional mapping tool. The results show that combining information from RGB and thermal cameras provides significant benefits to real-time localization compared with using solely thermal cameras and that the proposed real-time methods have localization performance comparable to the offline tool.","[Ramachandra, Bharathkumar; Nawathe, Pranav; Vatsavai, Ranga Raju] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Monroe, Jacob; Han, Kevin] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ham, Youngjib] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ramachandra, B (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",bramach2@ncsu.edu,,"Vatsavai, Ranga Raju/0000-0002-7083-0267",NVIDIA Corporation,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Tesla K40 graphics processing units used for this research.

A prototype ubiquitous concrete pour monitoring system (u-CPMS) has been developed to test the applicability of RFID-based monitoring in the concrete pouring operation. The prototype can automatically generate time-related data for activities such as batch delivery, waiting, concrete pouring, and vehicle return. Using the u-CPMS, the batch plant personnel dispatched to the construction site can keep track of the progress of concrete pouring through the wireless internet and make decisions on the batch intervals of mixer trucks. The prototype u-CPMS was implemented on a commercial building site, and it demonstrated that the RFID-based system can help increase the effectiveness of data communication in the concrete pouring operation.","[Moon, Sungwoo; Yang, Byongsoo] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Moon, S (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",sngwmoon@pusan.ac.kr; f252ybs@hanmail.net,,,Pusan National UniversityPusan National University,This work was supported for two years by Pusan National University Research Grant.,,21,26,26,2,17,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

Furthermore, the study design takes a multi-country view towards establishing the role of contextual and geographical influences on cost overrun. An evaluation of 102 major infrastructure projects was performed covering railways, roadways and energy sectors in different regions in Asia. Findings reveal that differences in the propensity for cost overrun are mostly dependent on a type of infrastructure with rail projects being the most likely to overrun budget. Theoretically, propositions on the influence of project contextual factors are tested highlighting the influence of project size, project type, geographical locations, and the length of implementation period of a project as well as factors related to political, economic, strategic, and competence in infrastructure delivery which vary across countries.","[Andric, Jelena M.; Wang, Jiayuan] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Mahamadu, Abdul-Majeed] Univ West England, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Bristol, Avon, England; [Zou, Patrick X.

However, those studies were mainly focused on the relationship at the building level. The authors of this study argue that a better understanding of such a relationship at the material level is equally important, because many decisions related to design and construction methods are made based on the selection of materials or products. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine data patterns of installation time, cost, and environmental impacts in terms of CO2 emissions at the material level. Six material categories, i.e.,structural components, exterior claddings, insulation, roofing, concrete footings, and concrete slabs-on-grade, were analyzed to examine the relationship between material cost and CO2 emissions. Two scenarios were considered for each category to better understand the impact of material installation on the relationship and identify dominant materials within each category under a certain level of confidence. Results show that only under a very low level of confidence that a dominant material exists in all six categories. In addition, the relationships at the material level appear to be rather random. It is thus important to have a better tool for decision-making and for future studies to understand how the randomness at the material level affects the relationships at the building level.","[Inyim, Peeraya; Orabi, Wallied] Florida Int Univ, OHL Sch Construct, Coll Engn & Comp, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Zhu, Yimin] Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management, Coll Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Inyim, P (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, OHL Sch Construct, Coll Engn & Comp, Miami, FL 33174 USA.",pinyi001@fiu.edu; yiminshu@lsu.edu; worabi@fiu.edu,"Orabi, Wallied/B-7207-2008","Orabi, Wallied/0000-0003-3622-7947",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1000136]; FIU Graduate School Dissertation Year Fellowship,"This research was supported by NSF award No. 1000136 and a FIU Graduate School Dissertation Year Fellowship.

Proper utilization of temporary structures can have a significant influence on critical aspects of the project such as cost, productivity, and safety. However, a process of planning temporary structures still relies on labor-intensive and error-prone efforts based on implicit knowledge of workers. Moreover, temporary structures are planned without detailed spatiotemporal analysis of their implications and systemized approach to safety. This tendency may yield the inefficient employment of temporary structures and unsafe job sites. Lack of systemized approach for identifying hazards related to the temporary structure would result in not only an economic loss but also fatalities and injuries. This paper introduces a building information model- (BIM-) based decision support system that provides safety plans for temporary structures considering their costs and durations. Focusing on scaffolding, the system automatically generates multiple scaffolding plans and quantitatively evaluates them regarding safety, cost, and duration. By analyzing project-specific spatiotemporal information to identify relevant hazards and variations of cost and duration, a specific plan for utilizing scaffolds, which is the most appropriate regarding safety, cost, and duration, is selected among the generated plans. The developed system was implemented using a BIM software tool and validated with an in-depth case study on a real-world construction project. This can be utilized as a decision-support system that enables the users to develop a plan with minimized safety hazards related to scaffolding while considering workflow, cost, and duration at the same time.","[Kim, Kyungki] Univ Houston, Dept Construct Management, 4734 Calhoun Rd 111, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Cho, Yong; Kim, Kinam] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Cho, Y (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",kkim38@central.uh.edu; yong.cho@ce.gatech.edu; kkim734@gatech.edu,,"Cho, Yong/0000-0002-3677-8899; Kim, Kyungki/0000-0002-7978-4025",,,,18,14,14,5,37,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In particular, concrete as one of the main construction load bearing materials can be affected. Road managers should therefore base their decisions regarding the selection of de-icing agent not only on data regarding their defrosting potential but also on data related to deterioration rates of materials built in the road infrastructure system. The paper presents the results of a study where the influence of different types of de-icing salts upon concrete performance was assessed in laboratory conditions. The theoretical background of freezing and thawing in the presence of de-icing salts in concrete is summarized. Salt scaling tests were performed using 3 selected de-icing salts on 3 different types of concrete. The mass scaled off the surface was weighed after every 5 freeze-thaw cycles. The results obtained show that a CaCl(2) solution has the most destructive effect upon concrete performance, regardless of the type of concrete. Deterioration was the least when a MgCl(2) solution was applied to the concrete surface.","Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia","Selih, J (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Civil & Geodet Engn, Jamova 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",jana.selih@fgg.uni-lj.si,,,,,,18,22,22,1,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Besides the inherent interest in such fascinating technology, the question remains as to why an owner, operator, or user of the built environment should care. The construction industry is now adopting new types of contracting practice. Previously the contractor simply implemented a given design, but the current trend is for clients to commission certain performance requirements to be met with performance-based design. The emphasis of the industry is becoming the delivery of certain structural behavior states rather than simply building to a client's set plans. The contracting process becomes the determination of the performance criteria, and delivery becomes a long-term fulfillment of these criteria. This can only take place if the performance states can be measured, and the measurement utilized in a decision-making process. The tools needed for both the evaluation of the delivery after construction and during operation are changing accordingly. The process is increasingly dependent on densely spaced sensor data, valid models to turn the data into physical behavior, and decision-making tools to determine whether the performance requirements are being met. This process must take place in order to satisfy all stakeholders. This paper describes the approaches in monitoring the performance, the obtaining of data and refining into information for decision making. Example cases concern the continuous performance and condition monitoring within buildings and civil structures, and indicators of the economical impacts of informed decisions including structural safety, hygro-thermal, and energy aspects. A case study of structural health monitoring of the Golden Gate Bridge is also presented. The enabling sensor technology is described, and the exploitation of the data for life cycle needs is discussed.","[Glaser, Steven D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Glaser, Steven D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Informat Technol Res Interest Soc, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tolman, Anne] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, FI-90571 Oulu, Finland","Glaser, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",glaser@berkeley.edu; Anne-tolman@vtt.fi,"Liu, Xuesong/E-9177-2010",,,,,84,28,29,0,15,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

A continuum of contracts in construction projects attempts to provide fit for purpose relationships to different working conditions; hosting levels of relationship quality. This study aims to explore contracting methodologies within construction procurement in search of practical and manageable relationship quality attributes. Initially relational attributes such as teamwork, commitment and trust along with seven main strategies for achieving these attributes are extracted from relevant studies. In the second stage construction expert interviews suggest that performance satisfaction is also a practical attribute and necessity of relationship quality. The study proposes a framework of actions and seven strategies which can facilitate the attributes associated with relationship quality. Finally based on the framework and three case studies five levels of transaction, action, strategy, attribute and relationship are demonstrated for relationship quality evaluation in construction project's procurement practices.

Despite their significance, the majority of today's accident prevention programs react passively to situations in which workers or equipment enter predefined unsafe zones. To support systems that proactively prevent these accidents, this paper presents a path prediction model for workers and equipment. The model leverages the extracted video frames to predict upcoming worker and equipment motion trajectories on construction sites. Specifically, the model takes two-dimensional (2D) tracks of workers and equipment from visual data-based on computer vision methods for detection and tracking-and uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder followed by a mixture density network (MDN) to predict their locations. A multihead prediction module is introduced to predict locations at different future times. The method is validated on an existing dataset, TrajNet, and a new dataset of 105 high-definition videos recorded over 30 days from a real-world construction site. On the TrajNet dataset, the proposed model significantly outperforms Social LSTM. On the new dataset, the presented model outperforms conventional time-series models and achieves average localization errors of 7.30, 12.71, and 24.22 pixels for 10, 20, and 40 future steps, respectively. The benefits and limitations of the method to worker and equipment path prediction are discussed.","[Tang, Shuai] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 205 North Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Golparvar-Fard, Mani] Univ Illinois, Civil Engn Comp Sci & Technol Entrepreneurship, 205 North Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Naphade, Milind] Nvidia Corp, Metropolis, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA; [Gopalakrishna, Murali M.] Nvidia Corp, Autonomous Machines, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA","Tang, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 205 North Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",stang30@illinois.edu; mgolpar@illinois.edu; mnaphade@nvidia.com; muralig@nvidia.com,,"Tang, Shuai/0000-0001-7822-6972","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI 1446765, CMMI 1544999]; NVIDIA internship","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grants CMMI 1446765 and CMMI 1544999 and the NVIDIA internship.

However, attempts at ensuring safety in the workplace run the risk of focussing on formalities and compliance rather than on joint engagement in safety. Drawing on an understanding of safety as practice, this study attempts to empirically unpack the difference between cooperation as engaging with local knowledges and the disciplining of unsafe behaviour. The research involved an ethnographic study at two large construction sites in Denmark and follows empirical examples of how safety breaches are identified, catalogued, and revealed later on at safety meetings. Managers saw this as an attempt to engage the workers. However, the workers saw this as a punitive way of criticizing their work at a distance. They felt that this practice of moving safety from the construction site and in to meeting rooms ran counter to aims of establishing engaging and effective safety practices close to the work. Efforts to engage workers in safer ways of working should therefore acknowledge the integrated nature of safety practice and the value placed on independence, discretion and negotiation when developing cooperation about workplace safety.","[Grytnes, Regine; Andersen, Lars Peter Sonderbo] Reg Hosp West Jutland, Univ Res Clin, Dept Occupat Med, Gl Landevej 61, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Tutt, Dylan E.] Univ Reading Whiteknights, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England","Grytnes, R (corresponding author), Reg Hosp West Jutland, Univ Res Clin, Dept Occupat Med, Gl Landevej 61, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",reggry@rm.dk,,"Tutt, Dylan/0000-0001-9216-8617; Grytnes, Regine/0000-0002-8682-8540",Danish Working Environment Research Fund,The present work was financially supported by The Danish Working Environment Research Fund.,,63,7,7,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

In this paper, a risk-based assessment of a case petroleum pipeline asset in Nigeria was used to examine the project conceptualization phase of an asset. The paper adopts a case study method, semistructured interviews, and field observations, and drew on pipeline failure data. Key managerial issues that need to be considered in project conceptualization for SCPA were identified. These issues include consideration for risk receptors and the need to assess organizational capabilities with respect to owning, operating, and regulating SCPA. This paper contributes theoretically by providing a performance-based learning framework for the conceptualization of new SCPA.","[Ambituuni, Ambisisi] Coventry Univ, Sch Strategy & Leadership, William Morris Bldg, Coventry CV1 5DL, W Midlands, England; [Ochieng, Edward] London South Bank Univ, Sch Built Environm & Architecture, London SE1 0AA, England; [Amezaga, Jaime M.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Devonshire Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Ambituuni, A (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Sch Strategy & Leadership, William Morris Bldg, Coventry CV1 5DL, W Midlands, England.",ambi.ambituuni@coventry.ac.uk; EdwardOchieng@live.co.uk; jaime.amezaga@ncl.ac.uk,,"Ochieng, Professor Edward/0000-0002-3888-5743",Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF),This work was supported by the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF).

The Swedish construction sector is investigated with emphasis on the implications of the local culture. Construction in a cold country on the periphery of Europe is affected by the merger of traditions of craftsmanship and military engineering. Centralized state control and weak professional identities have been influential. However, social and cultural traits reflected in a national management style (based on low power distance, loose control and low uncertainty avoidance) can be traced in the development of specific quality and collaboration practices in Swedish construction. Egalitarian distrust of both elitism and strong professions, expressed as a tendency for two parties to settle disputes without referring to neutral third parties, has also been identified. Some implications for adapting Sweden's construction culture of quality management and dispute resolution to a larger international framework are proposed.","Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Serv Management, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Bldg Econ & Management, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Brochner, J (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Serv Management, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,"Brochner, Jan/E-4825-2018; Per-Erik, Josephson/K-3343-2012","Brochner, Jan/0000-0002-1961-0330; Kadefors, Anna/0000-0001-5608-5013",,,,45,12,12,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Design/methodology/approach - The research focuses in the implementation of a VRE prototype of a building management system using game engine technologies. To evaluate the prototype, a usability study has been conducted that contrasts the virtual reality interface with a corresponding legacy application showing the users perception in terms of productivity improvement of facilities management (FM) tasks. Findings - The usability tests conducted indicated that VREs have the potential to increase the productivity in maintenance tasks. Users without training demonstrated a high degree of engagement and performance operating a VRE interface, when compared with that of a legacy application. The potential drop in user time and increase in engagement with a VRE will eventually translate into lower cost and to an increase in quality. Originality/value - To date no commonly accepted data model has been proposed to serve as the integrated data model to support facility operation. Although BIM models have gained increased acceptance in architecture engineering and construction activities they are not fully adequate to support data exchange in the post-handover (operation) phase.

Empirical data were collected using questionnaires distributed in three provinces in South Africa. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, to output mean scores, standard deviation and Pearson's correlation values. The study revealed a strong correlation between an organization's leadership, involvement, procedures, commitment, communication and competence (LIP +3C) and the Safety Culture Maturity as well as behavior. These findings demonstrate that improving the level of factors characterized by the LIP +3C model would lead to improving H&S performance as evidenced on the SCMM model and the exhibited behavior in workers and management.

Capturing the full cost benefits of modularized processes requires careful consideration of different aspects related to material, design, technology, logistics, installation, and so forth. Although many previous research efforts provided models to assess the feasibility of modularization in construction projects, no previous study developed a risk-based approach to assess the impact of adopting modular approaches on the cost performance of construction projects. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors followed an interrelated multistep research methodology. First, 50 modular risks were identified based on an extensive analysis of the literature conducted in a previous research study. Second, an industry survey was conducted in which 48 construction professionals-with an average of 24.25 years experience in construction operations and 13.6 years experience in modular construction-examined and assessed the impact of modular risks on cost performance. Third, integrated statistical and mathematical techniques-including distribution fitting-were utilized to develop a predictive model that (1) maps the 50 modular risks under investigation to cost performance data collected from 56 modular construction projects, and, consequently, (2) computes the associated cost saving and/or growth. The proposed model was verified using extreme condition tests, surprise behavior test, and sensitivity analysis, and was validated by industry experts. The authors provide guidelines for using the proposed model by industry practitioners. The developed model allows for maximized use of available project information to enable a reliable a priori cost assessment for the modularization processes throughout the different project phases. This is particularly important in the case of varying conditions over the project lifecycle. The developed model helps project stakeholders identify cost enablers and barriers that are interrelated with modularization processes. Accordingly, corrective actions and mitigation plans can be established. This research provides improved practices for decision-making, risk management, and project team alignment to maximize the cost benefits of modularization in construction projects.","[Abdul Nabi, Mohamad] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Engn & Management, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Missouri Consortium Construct Innovat, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA","El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Engn & Management, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.; El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Missouri Consortium Construct Innovat, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.; El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",mah59@mst.edu; eladaway@mst.edu,,,Missouri Consortium for Construction Innovation (MO-CCI),"This study was conducted through the financial support provided by the Missouri Consortium for Construction Innovation (MO-CCI) as represented by its member companies, including McCarthy Building Companies, Brinkman Constructors, Arco Construction, Clayco, BJC Healthcare, Alberici, and Greensfelder.",,81,0,0,10,10,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Currently, few investigators consider the multiobjective optimization model suitable for high-rise buildings considering energy consumption optimization problems in construction. Nevertheless, the implementation of civil engineering in the construction industry is always an important cause of energy consumption. In this study, construction process analysis (CPA) is used to calculate statistical parameters of the energy consumption in high-rise buildings during the construction stage. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then used to describe the correlation among time, cost, and energy consumption, and also quantifies their interdependence. The statistical analysis illustrates that the correlation between energy consumption and cost is stronger than that between energy consumption and time. And the correlation between cost and time is similar to that between time and energy consumption. Additionally, cost and energy consumption have a positive correlation, cost and time have a negative correlation, and time and energy consumption also have a negative correlation. The major contribution of this study is to provide a time-cost-energy consumption multiobjective optimization model taking account of the different decision preferences of project managers. It could also help project managers create the best combination of project construction activities in practical engineering management. The simulation in a real case is proposed to verify the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, the model could also provide reference value for further construction projects.","[He, Wei; Li, Wenjing; Xu, Shan; Wang, Wei] Yanshan Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Mech, Qinhuangdao 066004, Hebei, Peoples R China; [An, Xu] Corp Ltd, China Construct Seventh Engn Div, Chendong Rd, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China","He, W (corresponding author), Yanshan Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Mech, Qinhuangdao 066004, Hebei, Peoples R China.",hewei@ysu.edu.cn; liwj@ysu.edu.cn; xushan@ysu.edu.cn; 13B910046@hit.edu.cn; 497211649@qq.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [E2016203174],This research was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China under Grant No. E2016203174.,,55,0,0,12,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

A range of tools have been utilised for estimating building energy use and environmental impacts; these are time-consuming and require massive data that are not necessarily available during early design stages. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an Environmental Impacts Cost Assessment Model (EICAM) that quantifies both energy and environmental costs for residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to develop the EICAM. The model consists of six input parameters, including wall type, roof type, glazing type, window to wall ratio (WWR), shading device and building orientation. In addition, the model calculates four measures: annual energy cost, operational carbon over 20 years, envelope embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre. The ANN architecture is 6:13:4:4, where the conjugate gradient algorithm was applied to train the model and minimise the mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, regression analysis for the ANN prediction for each output was performed. Findings The MSE was minimised to 0.016 while training the model. Also, the correlation between each ANN output and the actual output was very strong, with an R-2 value for each output of almost 0.998. Moreover, validation was conducted for each output, with the error percentages calculated at 0.26%, 0.25%, 0.03% and 0.27% for the annual energy cost, operational carbon, envelope materials embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre, respectively. Accordingly, the EICAM contributes to enhancing design decision-making concerning energy consumption and carbon emissions in the early design stages. Research limitations/implications This study provides theoretical implications to the domain of building environmental impact assessment through illustrating a systematic approach for developing an energy-based prediction model that generates four environmental-oriented outputs, namely energy cost, operational energy carbon, envelope embodied carbon, and total carbon. The model developed has practical implications for the architectural/engineering (A/E) industries by providing a useful tool to easily predict environmental impact costs during the early design phase. This would enable designers in Saudi Arabia to make effective design decisions that would increase sustainability in the building life cycle. Originality/value By providing a holistic predictive model entitled EICAM, this study endeavours to bridge the gap between energy costs and environmental impacts in a predictive model for Saudi residential units. The novelty of this model is that it is an alternative tool that quantifies both energy cost, as well as building's environmental impact, in one model by using a machine learning approach. Besides, EICAM predicts its outcomes more quickly than conventional tools such as DesignBuilder and is reliable for predicting accurate environmental impact costs during early design stages.","[Hamida, Amneh] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Alsudairi, Abdulsalam; Alshaibani, Khalid] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Dept Architecture, Coll Architecture & Planning, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Alshamrani, Othman] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Dept Bldg Engn, Coll Architecture & Planning, Dammam, Saudi Arabia","Hamida, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands.",amneh.hamida@gmail.com,"Hamida, Amneh/AAR-1169-2021; Alshaibani, Khalid A./A-3301-2015","Hamida, Amneh/0000-0003-1646-2085; Alshaibani, Khalid A./0000-0002-0970-6187",Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,The authors would like to thank Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University for the support and facilities provided to carry out this research.,,61,4,4,6,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In addition, the study reviews different computational intelligence (CI) techniques and ensemble methods conducted to develop practical cost prediction models. This study discusses the hybridization of these modeling techniques and the future trends for cost model development, limitations, and recommendations. The study focuses on reviewing the most common artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for cost modeling such as fuzzy logic (FL) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression models, case-based reasoning (CBR), hybrid models, diction tree (DT), random forest (RF), supportive vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, scalable boosting trees (XGBoost), and evolutionary computing (EC) such as genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, this paper provides the comprehensive knowledge needed to develop a reliable parametric cost model at the conceptual stage of the project. Additionally, field canals improvement projects (FCIPs) are used as an actual case study to analyze the performance of the ML models. Out of 20 AI techniques, the results showed that the most accurate and suitable method is XGBoost with 9.091% and 0.929 based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and adjusted R2, respectively. Nonlinear adaptability, handling missing values and outliers, model interpretation, and uncertainty are discussed for the 20 developed AI models.

These negative impacts of highway work zones can be minimized by a number of mitigating measures such as reducing the length of work zone segments, using the shoulder temporarily for traffic, and working during low-traffic nighttime hours. These work zone layout measures, however, cause an increase in highway construction cost. Accordingly, these tradeoffs between reducing work zone delays and minimizing construction cost need to be analyzed to establish an optimal balance between these two critical and conflicting objectives. This paper presents the development of a novel multiobjective optimization model for highway work zone layouts that is capable of generating optimal tradeoffs between minimizing traffic delays and construction cost. The model was developed in three main phases: formulation, implementation, and performance evaluation. First, the model was formulated to (1)identify all relevant work zone decision variables that affect mobility and cost, (2)model the two objective functions of minimizing work zone delay and construction cost, and (3)represent all practical constraints. Second, the model was implemented using a genetic algorithm to perform the multiobjective optimization computations and enable generating optimal tradeoffs among the two objectives in a single run. Third, the performance of the model was evaluated using an application example of a highway work zone. The results of the performance evaluation phase illustrate the novel and unique capabilities of the model in optimizing work zone layout parameters and generating optimal tradeoffs between minimizing traffic delays and construction cost.","[Abdelmohsen, Ahmed Z.; El-Rayes, Khaled] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","El-Rayes, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",azafer@illinois.edu; elrayes@illinois.edu,,,Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) [R-27-109],"This material is based on a work supported by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), research funded under Project No. R-27-109.

As a consequence, the studies also differ in their project management recommendations. We show that studies with a project size measure based on the actual cost systematically report an increase in percent cost overrun with increased project size, whereas studies with a project size measure based on the estimated cost report a decrease or no change in percent cost overrun with increased project size. The observed pattern is, we argue, to some extent a statistical artifact caused by imperfect correlation between the estimated and the actual cost. We conclude that the previous observational studies cannot be considered to provide reliable evidence in favor of an underlying project size related cost estimation bias. We discuss the limited, statistically robust evidence and the need for other types of studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Thus, many attempts have been made to reduce it worldwide. Against this backdrop, this paper suggests Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI) established based upon laser profiling technique for the effective management of tunnel contour quality, and analyzes TCI as well as the factors on TCI through field investigations using laser profilers in Norway and Korea. TCI is defined as a fraction form consisting of three elements (overbreak depth, contour roughness, longitudinal overbreak variation) that are calculated from surveyed tunnel profiles, three weights for the elements and one constant for range adjustment. The result shows a large difference in TCI, i.e., TCI for the Korean tunnels is average 63.4 by overbreak depth of 21.4 cm, contour roughness of 1.066 (meaning a 6.6% increase than the planned contour area by blasting) and longitudinal overbreak variation of 5.7 cm, while TCI for the Norwegian tunnels is average 45.9 by 64.2 cm, 1.120 and 11.1 cm respectively. The main causes for the large difference are the different philosophy in tunnel design between the two countries, as well as the hard rock having distinct joints of Norway that makes it easier for blasting pressure to break off rock masses along existing joints than to develop new cracks in the hard rock. In addition, it is found that the major element affecting TCI is overbreak depth because large overbreak depth increases the possibility of high contour roughness. The results show that most overbreak primarily results from large look-out and poor rock masses, and major causes resulting in high contour roughness are heterogeneous geological conditions in the tunnel face and big deviation in drilling position of contour holes. Finally, it is thought that TCI established based upon laser profiling technique can be used for the more effective management of tunnel contour quality.","[Kim, Yangkyun] NORTRON, Dongmangsan Gil 47, Seoul 105809, South Korea; [Bruland, Amund] NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hgsk Ringen 7A, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Kim, Y (corresponding author), NORTRON, Dongmangsan Gil 47, Seoul 105809, South Korea.",ykim.nortron@gmail.com; amund.bruland@ntnu.no,,,,,,27,4,4,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

The importance of enabling these residents to enjoy a good quality of life is recognized. Results from two research projects show that the physical environment can affect a person's quality of life, but it is one of a number of interrelated factors. Design in Caring Environments (DICE) and INDEPENDENT, both funded by the EPSRC EQUAL programme, use different methods to examine the impact of design on quality of life. The tools and methods developed are discussed, as are the implications of the findings for policy and practice. The Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (SCEAM) is a method for recording the characteristics and use of a care home building. The effects of the building on well-being can be unpicked by a multilevel analysis of building data against measures of quality of life. Used in a study of care homes in Sheffield, UK, it gave some significant results: in homes where the safety of residents had high priority, the scope for pleasurable activities tended to be low; activity appeared to have a beneficial impact on well-being; people in larger homes tended to have a poorer quality of life; staff satisfaction and retention increased with the amount of training and tended to be high in more personalized settings; and most homes under-used the facilities available. INDEPENDENT developed technologies to enhance well-being based on a `wish list' of favourite activities derived from consultations with users. The policy and practice implications of these findings are discussed.","Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Torrington, J (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Arts Tower, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.m.torrington@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,31,23,23,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Yet many public agencies also deliberately use procurement strategies, such as contract types, delivery methods, or bidding terms, that restrict competition to obtain other benefits. One such tool in the US public sector is the indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, which selects a limited number of firms to compete for subsequent construction requirements. Because IDIQ contracts by design limit competition after the initial award, the purpose of this study is to explore whether these contracts are associated with cost differences from traditional contract forms in the context of US defense sector construction procurement. The study presents a statistical analysis of three cost metrics across 316 completed US Air Force projects, the largest analysis of costs on IDIQ contracts to date. The results show a 5% cost premium when using IDIQ contracts based on differences at the contract-award and no statistically significant difference in costs after the contract-award. The findings suggest that public sector owners should carefully consider and justify the cost tradeoffs before employing IDIQ contracts for construction services. The findings contribute to a small but growing body of knowledge on IDIQ contracting, while establishing a path forward for researchers to examine transaction costs and the total value for money in using these contracting tools.

Older people's experience of disabling conditions can be affected by the design and layout of their accommodation. Adaptations and assistive technology (AT) are a major way of addressing this gap between functional capacity and the built environment. The degree of adaptability and the differences in the average cost of adaptation of different types of property are large and there is major variation within property type. Based on a series of user profiles, it was found that a comprehensive package of adaptations and AT is likely to result in significant economies arising from a reduction in the need for formal care services. This finding is sensitive to assumptions about how long an individual would use the adaptations and AT, as well as to the input of informal care and the nature of their accommodation. The present study, which focused on social housing, has implications for how practitioners specify ways of meeting individual needs as well as providing a case to support the substantial increase in demand for specialist adaptation work.","Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England; Kings Coll London, Inst Gerontol, London SE1 9NN, England; Kings Coll Hosp London, Ctr Rehabil Engn, London SE5 8RX, England","Lansley, P (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England.",p.r.lansley@reading.ac.uk,,"Tinker, Anthea/0000-0002-0305-7198",,,,33,17,17,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

It allows owner agencies and contractors to monitor construction market fluctuations so that they can more accurately estimate construction costs and project long-term funding needs. However, various CCI calculation methods in the highway construction industry are limited in two respects: (1) inability to account for inconsistent pay items, primarily caused by changes in pay item catalogs, and (2) insufficiency in statistically cleaning pay item data, e.g., unbalanced bid prices. For this reason, the resulting highway construction cost index (HCCI) cannot accurately reflect the construction market. To address such limitations, this research develops a three-step holistic framework for automated HCCI development using inconsistent pay items. The three-step methodology encompasses (1) data cleaning, where a text analysis algorithm and outlier detection algorithms are developed to clean inconsistent pay items and unbalanced bid prices; (2) pay item sampling, which helps to select and edit pay items through various statistical analysis; and (3) HCCI calculation, where the chained Fisher index formula is applied to calculate HCCIs at the state level, as well as indexes for specific regions and item categories. A prototype application is developed to generate quarterly and annual HCCIs automatically using the Python programming language. Ten-year data, i.e., 251,033 records, were used to verify and validate the prototyped system. The resulting HCCI and sub-HCCIs provide reliable insights into construction market conditions with high granularity. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering a holistic framework for automated HCCI development that leverages the text analysis algorithm for accounting for inconsistent pay items and two-stage outlier treatments for cleaning pay item data.","[Liu, Hexu; Kwigizile, Valerian] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Huang, Wei-Chiao] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",hexu.liu@wmich.edu; valerian.kwigizile@wmich.edu; wei-chiao.huang@wmich.edu,,"Huang, Wei-Chiao/0000-0002-8069-2099; Kwigizile, Valerian/0000-0002-5427-6235; liu, hexu/0000-0002-5397-9369",Michigan DOT (MDOT) [2019-0313/Z3],"The authors would like to thank the Michigan DOT (MDOT) for financial support (Grant File 2019-0313/Z3) and for providing all bid data, as well as personnel from MDOT for their advice.

At present, from an operational perspective, almost all contractors pay more attention to maintaining their equipment fleets in well-sustained workable conditions and having a high accessibility of the necessary equipment pieces. However, such an approach alone is not enough to maintain an efficient and sustainable business. In particular, for large-scale construction companies that operate in multiple sites in the U.S. or overseas, the problem extends to an optimal allocation of available equipment. Given the current state of the construction industry in the U.S., this problem can be solved by geographically locating equipment pieces and then wisely re-allocating them among projects. Identifying equipment pieces geographically is a relatively easy task. The difficulty arises when informed decision-making is required for equipment allocation among job sites. The actual allocation of equipment should be both economically feasible and technologically preferable. To help in informed decision-making, an optimization model is developed as a mixed integer program. This model is formed based on a previously successfully developed decision-support model for construction equipment selection. The proposed model incorporates logical strategies of supply chain management to optimally select construction equipment for any construction site while taking into account the costs, availability, and transportation-related issues as constraints. The model benefits those responsible for informed decision-making for construction equipment selection and allocation. It also benefits the owners of construction companies, owing to its cost-minimization objective.","[Avetisyan, Hakob] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Avetisyan, H (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",havetisyan@fullerton.edu,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018",,,,,15,1,1,4,19,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

This paper proposes a knowledge-based risk mapping tool for systematically assessing risk-related variables that may lead to cost overrun in international markets. The tool uses an ontology that relates risk and vulnerability to cost overrun [1] and a novel risk-vulnerability assessment methodology [2] to estimate potential risk paths that may emerge in international construction projects. The tool has been developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, a construction management company that gives risk management consultancy services to Turkish contractors working in international markets. The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool. As the reliability and usability of the tool significantly depend on the subjective evaluations of users about level of vulnerability and magnitude of potential risk events, a lessons learned database has been incorporated into the tool so that decision-makers may refer to risk event histories of previous projects to make estimations about forthcoming projects. In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool.

The first step of investigation should begin with identifying the relevant contributing factors affecting at-risk work behaviours. Thus, the aim of this research is to identify important organisational factors that will reduce at-risk work behaviours. The implications of these findings are further used to quantify and investigate the role of organisational factors as an integral feature of safety intervention. Case studies are used to identify and categorize organisational factors. This identification process begins with literature reviews as commonly performed. The literature related with organisational factors was used as a primary source to investigate the influences of organisational factors on at-risk work behaviours. Hence, semi-structured interviews and reviews of the company's documents were conducted involving safety experts and workers to gain experiential and practical knowledge. The obtained results identified seven important factors of Thailand construction industry: communication, culture, management commitment, leadership, organisation learning, empowerment, and reward system. The implications of particular applications from these factors are considered as critical features for handling work behaviours. In addition, empirical findings provide particularly insight factors from expertise in a practical way. Validations with previous publications of some factors are also discussed. The identified contributing determinants from empirical findings can be expected to be influential at different levels within an organization. Consequently, the proposed hypothetical casual models enables determination of disparity in their influences of organisational factors when considering interventions to reduce at-risk work behaviour or to promote safe work behaviours.","[Jitwasinkul, Bhanupong; Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

An experiment on a test bed showed that data values were effectively transmitted through a local wireless network from the USN nodes to a host PC. The data were compared with allowable limits for deflection, strain, and inclination, and the comparison provided useful information on the behavior of the temporary structure.

As a preventive step, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) of workers (e.g., hard hat and vest) at all times. This paper presents three deep learning (DL) models built on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture to verify PPE compliance of workers; i.e., if a worker is wearing hard hat, vest, or both, from image/video in real-time. In the first approach, the algorithm detects workers, hats, and vests and then, a machine learning model (e.g., neural network and decision tree) verifies if each detected worker is properly wearing hat or vest. In the second approach, the algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and verifies PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In the third approach, the algorithm first detects only the workers in the input image which are then cropped and classified by CNN-based classifiers (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception) according to the presence of PPE attire. All models are trained on an in-house image dataset that is created using crowd-sourcing and web-mining. The dataset, named Pictor-v3, contains similar to 1,500 annotated images and similar to 4,700 instances of workers wearing various combinations of PPE components. It is found that the second approach achieves the best performance, i.e., 72.3% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 11 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a good candidate for running on light-weight mobile devices. The closest alternative in terms of performance (67.93% mAP) is the third approach where VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception classifiers are assembled in a Bayesian framework. However, the first approach is the fastest among all and can process 13 FPS with 63.1% mAP. The crowed-sourced Pictor-v3 dataset and all trained models are publicly available to support the design and testing of other innovative applications for monitoring safety compliance, and advancing future research in automation in construction.","[Nath, Nipun D.; Paal, Stephanie G.] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, 3136 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Behzadan, Amir H.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, 3137 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Behzadan, AH (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, 3137 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",nipundebnath@tamu.edu; abehzadan@tamu.edu; spaal@tamu.edu,,,U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI 1800957],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) for supporting this project through grant CMMI 1800957, as well as Mr. Yalong Pi for assisting in data preparation.

The lack of a proper long-term plan can lead to financial difficulties, especially in older buildings where the components are old and in need of extensive maintenance and renovation. These difficulties are complex and more pronounced in less-attractive markets where maintenance and renovation budgets are limited and socioeconomic issues are prevalent. In order to address the complexity of the problem and fully utilize the potential value in buildings, multiobjective analyses of maintenance and renovation plans need to be carried out together with proper life expectancy analyses. Current planning methods are not flexible or efficient enough to combine life expectancy analyses with multiobjective optimization processes. This paper presents a maintenance and renovation scheduling method that utilizes a modified deterioration function for life expectancy analyses and combines it with a service life-cycle cost analysis to facilitate multiobjective optimization processes. To demonstrate its application, the proposed method is used for maintenance and renovation planning for two identical buildings of different ages. To further demonstrate its economic benefits, the proposed method is used for planning under a restricting annual budget constraint and the results are compared to the results from a conventional method used by the managing company. The proposed planning method helps decision makers choose maintenance and renovation strategies in difficult market situations and/or under budget constraints.","[Farahani, Abolfazl; Wallbaum, Holger; Dalenbaeck, Jan-Olof] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden","Farahani, A (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",abolfazl.farahani@chalmers.se; holger.wallbaum@chalmers.se; jan-olof.dalenback@chalmers.se,"Wallbaum, Holger/B-6272-2008; Farahani, Abolfazl Sousanabadi/AAK-4585-2020","Wallbaum, Holger/0000-0001-5809-9400; Dalenback, Jan-Olof/0000-0001-8771-0416; /0000-0002-2221-7492",Swedish energy agencySwedish Energy Agency [37578-2],"The authors would like to thank Andreas Engberg at SUSTEND AB for his contribution to this work, the materials and information provided, as well as the discussions and very constructive feedback.

The simulation offers the opportunity to reduce the risk of an Oops by collecting more information or to go ahead and make the choice with the information at hand. There are two extreme strategies. Nothing is invested in planning in the so-called Guts-ball approach, but this increases the likelihood that an Oops will occur and thus increases the cost to complete the project. The second strategy is to invest in planning before attempting to build. This will increase the cost of planning upfront, but may reduce the risk and cost of an Oops in building. In reality, the cost and value of planning depends on the complexity level of the project, the amount of uncertainty that we need to deal with it, and the cost of an Oops. We used computer simulation to show how the value of planning is sensitive to those factors. The results showed that the project with the reliable planning strategy had a 35% higher productivity and a cost-benefit ratio of 13:1. The contribution to the body of knowledge of The Oops Game lies in providing a simple and effective means to show the value of planning to construction practitioners and students.

The authors have developed construction and O&M cost models for different unit operations and processes involved in water treatment plants. These models are developed from historical cost data and can be used to develop preliminary cost estimates for major project components and to screen alternative process trains of a water treatment project during the planning phases of the project. The historical cost data were updated to April 2011 costs by using cost indexes from Engineering News Record (ENR) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in addition to April 2011 costs of energy and labor. This paper presents the use of a single cost index to further update construction and O&M costs. This approach has significant advantages over using multiple indexes (such as ENR and BLS indexes) for different cost components. Using the method presented in this paper, future cost updating by ENR construction and building cost indexes becomes simple and straightforward. Actual bid prices for one new water treatment plant construction and two water treatment plant expansion projects were obtained from reputed consulting firms and compared to estimated costs by using the cost models presented in this paper. Further validation is recommended by use of the equations and comparisons of the costs to the detailed estimates and actual bids. Accurate forecasting of the costs of a project is site specific and cannot be generalized. Design plans and specifications are needed to develop accurate cost estimates based on equipment, materials, and labor.

We examine the moderating effect of resource-constrained environments on the relationship between feedback and innovative outcomes. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies to collect data from 191 executives in the first study and 92 engineers in the second study as they create innovative outcomes within low and high levels of resource-constrained environments along with different levels of supportive and constructive feedback. Both studies highlight that supportive and constructive feedback was valuable in enhancing innovative outcomes.

In doing so, to investigate whether different project environments, notably project governance, impacts the relationship between methodologies and project success. Design/methodology/approach - A deductive approach was applied to validate a theoretically derived research model. In total, 19 interviews across 11 industrial sectors and four countries were used to collect data. Pattern-matching techniques were utilized in the analysis to deductively validate the research model. Findings - There is a positive relationship between projectmethodology elements and the characteristics of project success; however, environmental factors, notably project governance, influence the use and effectiveness of a project methodology and its elements with a resulting impact on the characteristics of project success. Research limitations/implications - Project governance plays a major role in the moderating effect of a project methodology's effectiveness. Contingency theory is applicable to a project's methodology's selection and its customization according to the project environment. Practical implications - Understand the impact of project methodologies and their elements on the characteristics of project success while being moderated by the project environment, for example, the risk of suboptimal project performance due to the effectiveness of methodology elements being negatively impacted by the project environment.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and state departments of transportation (DOTs) are continuously seeking to improve work-zone safety and mobility. To accomplish this, the layout of highway work zones needs to be carefully planned and optimized to accomplish the multiple and often conflicting objectives of maximizing safety and mobility. This article presents the development of an innovative multiobjective optimization model to search for and identify a set of Pareto-optimal work-zone layouts that provide a wide range of optimal trade-offs between minimizing traffic delays and minimizing the probability of crashes. The model has four phases: (1) identify all relevant decision variables for work-zone layout, (2) formulate the optimization objective functions in the model, (3) define all relevant and practical constraints that affect the optimization problem, and (4) perform the model-optimization computations using multiobjective genetic algorithms. The performance of the developed optimization model was analyzed and verified using an application example of work-zone layout. The results of the analysis of this example illustrate the novel and unique capabilities of the developed model in searching for and identifying optimal work-zone layouts. These new and unique capabilities are expected to support state DOTs and construction planners in their ongoing efforts to maximize work-zone safety and reduce traffic delays in the work-zone area.","[Abdelmohsen, Ahmed Z.] Port Said Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Port Fouad 42526, Egypt; [El-Rayes, Khaled] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Abdelmohsen, AZ (corresponding author), Port Said Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Port Fouad 42526, Egypt.",eahmedzafer@gmail.com; elrayes@illinois.edu,,,Illinois Department of Transportation [R-27-109],"This material is based on work supported by the Illinois Department of Transportation, with research funded under Project No. R-27-109.

Thus, it is crucial to many civil infrastructure applications based on three-dimensional (3D) models. However, in many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to align point clouds with low-density or small overlaps. It is difficult to extract stable features and enough features for registration, whether keypoint features or overall posture features, under this condition. Existing methods cannot solve this problem well. This work proposed an end-to-end registration network that can self-adaptively focus on the overlap. The network learned to directly encode posture information from the overlapping area instead of using sparse keypoint correspondences, which makes the network more generalized and efficient. This work also proposed a self-supervised overlapping detector as an extension module to expand the use of this network to align large-scale point clouds of indoor building environments. The proposed detector is compatible with any registration approaches to promote their accuracy and efficiency further. The proposed network was experimentally demonstrated to outperform the state-of-the-art methods in registering sparse and low-overlapping point clouds, with higher robustness to point density and overlap ratio change. The proposed detector can reliably detect the overlapping area and empower the network to accurately align the sparse and low-overlapping point clouds of the large-scale indoor scene, thus simplifying and promoting laser scanning practices in civil infrastructure applications.","[Zhang, Zhenghua; Chen, Guoliang; Wang, Xuan] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Spatial Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Han] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Chen, GL (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Spatial Informat, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",13685196078@163.com; chgl_cumt@163.com; 19851628637@163.com; 986889401@qq.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFB0502105]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41371423],"This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China, Grant No. 2016YFB0502105; and National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 41371423.

Children spend a large proportion of their time at school, hence school-based interventions targeting physical activity and sitting behaviour may be important. Whilst some aspects of school buildings, their layout and furniture may influence children's physical activity and sitting, these effects could be intertwined with pedagogical approaches. This scoping review aims to identify gaps in the research literature regarding the influence of the indoor school environment on pedagogical approaches and on physical activity and sitting. In primary schools, it was found that physical activity can be integrated into lessons with some benefits on academic behaviour and possibly academic performance. Overall, however, the role of the indoor built environment is poorly investigated, although a handful of studies suggest that a radical change in primary school classrooms may increase physical activity and that stand-biased desks may be promising. This study provides a contribution to the emerging research fields of active design' from the perspective of indoor school design, highlighting a dearth of research, especially on sitting and for secondary education, and a lack of relevant conceptual frameworks.","[Ucci, Marcella; Marmot, Alexi] UCL, UCL Inst Environm Design & Engn, London NW1 2BX, England; [Law, Stephen] UCL, Bartlett Space Syntax Lab, London NW1 2BX, England; [Andrews, Richard] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Cambridge CB1 1PT, England; [Fisher, Abi; Smith, Lee; Sawyer, Alexia] UCL, Hlth Behav Res Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England","Ucci, M (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Environm Design & Engn, 132 Hampstead Rd, London NW1 2BX, England.",m.ucci@ucl.ac.uk; stephen.law@ucl.ac.uk; richard.andrews@anglia.ac.uk; abigail.fisher@ucl.ac.uk; lee.smith@ucl.ac.uk; alexia.sawyer@ucl.ac.uk; a.marmot@ucl.ac.uk,,"Andrews, Richard/0000-0003-0741-7864",Strategic Partnership Ideas Incubator Fund; University College London (UCL); Institute of Education (IOE); Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [14133] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I02929X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,This review was supported by the Strategic Partnership Ideas Incubator Fund co-funded by University College London (UCL) and the Institute of Education (IOE).,,66,9,11,3,89,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Most decisions that are made on a safety-critical project involve uncertainty, the consequences of which may be highly significant to the safe and timely delivery of the project. Based on interviews with project management practitioners on nine large-scale civil nuclear and aerospace projects, we explore how uncertainty emerges, and how project management practitioners identify, analyse and act on it. We make three important contributions. First, we present three approaches - structural, behavioural and relational - that individuals and organizations can adopt when contending with project uncertainty. Secondly, we characterize nine dualities at play in the management of project uncertainty and thirdly, we identify key differences between how civil nuclear and aerospace project managers confront project uncertainty, which have important implications for how projects might be organized in both these industry sectors. Drawing attention to the structural, behavioural and relational approaches to project uncertainty and the tensions that manifest themselves in each approach should enable the project management community to make progress in environments of high uncertainty where situations are often complex, rapidly changing and confusing, and yet where, for reasons of safety, failure is not an option.","[Saunders, Fiona C.; Gale, Andrew W.] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Pariser Bldg,Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Sherry, Andrew H.] Natl Nucl Lab, Chadwick House,Warrington Rd,Birchwood Pk, Warrington WA3 6AE, Cheshire, England; [Sherry, Andrew H.] Univ Manchester, Dalton Nucl Inst, Pariser Bldg,Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England","Saunders, FC (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Pariser Bldg,Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",fiona.saunders@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,51,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Safety in construction is a complex issue and is influenced by many factors, such as the technology being used, worker behaviour, actual site conditions and, of course, the design being constructed. Given this background, safety hazards identification and accident precautions are important elements in any construction site safety management system. The development described in this paper has produced a visualization of the construction process that can be used to assess safety hazards. The aim of the research is to produce a design-for-safety-process (DFSP) tool. This will help to identify safety hazards inherited during the building construction phase that are actually produced during the design phase. The domain, in which this particular application is being developed, is a typical 40-storey Hong Kong Housing Authority residential block. In this paper, the components of DFSP tool are discussed. The components of DFSP tool comprise of virtually real construction components and processes, virtual reality functions, and DFSP database. The integration of these components enables a user to do a walk-through in the virtually real project and to identify safety hazards inherited within construction components and processes as well as to select accident precautions needed to prevent the occurrence of accidents.

Three major problems are addressed: (1) Conception of a hierarchical computer integrated construction control structure that links rebar Fabrication to the other construction project functions: (2) comparative evaluation of alternative algorithms For prediction of springback; and (3) portability of a springback control model that uses real-time electronic sensing. Bending tests were conducted with both a laboratory prototype and an actual shop table bender to experiment with alternative models for in-process springback prediction including a neural network model. Limitations in control system portability were realized in the transfer from the laboratory prototype bender to the shop bender.

The elderly population is increasing worldwide. Yet only limited information exists about housing conditions: changes over time, and the relationships between health and safety among the elderly. Based on repeated surveys (2007 and 2011), housing and health issues in Finland were assessed, especially among the elderly (more than 65 years old). From various housing factors studied, the largest differences between surveys were in thermal comfort. From the six outcomes studied - satisfaction with the dwelling, maintenance, indoor air quality (IAQ), perceived safety, general health, and sleeping difficulties- only satisfaction with the dwelling had significant temporal variation. Modelling the outcomes led to a selection of variables that were significantly associated with the outcomes. The models' sensitivity was 65-81% for perceived safety and satisfaction with the dwelling, maintenance, and IAQ, whereas it was only 5% for sleeping difficulties and 32% for general health status. Among the elderly, higher odds ratios (ORs) were found for the associations between housing satisfaction and non-elevated radon concentrations, accessibility, dwelling size, and stuffy odour, as compared with the total population sample. The results are useful for developing policies that increase wellbeing, and for building owners wishing to increase housing satisfaction among occupants.","[Pekkonen, Maria; Turunen, Mari; Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth Protect, Kuopio, Finland","Haverinen-Shaughnessy, U (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth Protect, Kuopio, Finland.",haverinen@fulbrightmail.org,"Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla/O-5688-2015","Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla/0000-0002-9456-7256","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [109062]; Ministry of the EnvironmentMinistry of the Environment, Japan; Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA); INSULAtE project; EU Life+ programme; Juho Vainio Foundation","The national questionnaire data collection was funded by the Academy of Finland [grant number 109062], the Ministry of the Environment, and the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA).

This paper presents a decision-support tool developed to support a state planning agency seeking to select a cost-effective data procurement strategy; specifically, the agency is considering whether to continue collecting and processing infrastructure performance data in-house or outsource to a third-party vendor. The probabilistic tool integrates uncertainty estimation via statistical methods and elicitation of expert judgement with Monte Carlo simulations to compute the probabilistic life-cycle cost of alternative data procurement strategies. For this particular case study, the expected cost to continue data collection and processing activities in-house is higher than the cost to outsource such activities. More importantly, the case study results lead to other important insights and contributions that are more generalizable to other contexts. For example, the labor resources required to collect, process, and maintain infrastructure condition data is the largest driver of total life-cycle costs for in-house data collection. Furthermore, because the decision to outsource data collection is made well before an agency selects a vendor, and such cost estimates are frequently unknown, there is a higher level of uncertainty and potential risk associated with outsourcing these activities. These conclusions, as well as the methods and framework presented in this paper, should assist planning agencies as they develop their data procurement strategy.","[Leo, Brandon; Swei, Omar] Univ British Columbia, Dept Civil Engn, 6250 Appl Sci Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Swei, O (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Civil Engn, 6250 Appl Sci Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",brandonaleo@alumni.ubc.ca; oaswei@civil.ubc.ca,,,,,,40,0,0,1,1,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

This study sought that relationship by looking at the fee expressed as a percentage of the construction cost and the final construction cost growth from the engineer's initial estimate of the construction cost at the time the design contract was awarded. The research team analyzed 31 projects from the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority with a total construction value of $90 million. The projects were divided into road and bridge projects. Based on the results of the analysis, it seems that as the design fee decreases, the absolute percentage of construction cost growth from the engineer's early estimate increases. The relationship is strongest for bridge projects, which tend to be more technically complex to design than roadway projects. This confirms for U.S. projects the result of an earlier study in Saudi Arabia. This paper concludes that the design fee should be viewed as an investment at a point in time where the ability to impact the project is the highest and can accrue the benefit of reduced cost growth.","Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; So Illinois Univ, Dept Construct, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; Oklahoma Turnpike Author, Oklahoma City, OK 73134 USA","Gransberg, DD (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",dgransberg@ou.edu; clopezd@siue.edu; dhumphrey@ota.state.ok.us,"Gransberg, Douglas/W-1731-2019","Gransberg, Douglas/0000-0002-5588-5024",,,,19,21,21,0,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

For addressing the limited data availability in conceptual cost estimation, this study proposes an enhanced ANN-based cost estimating model that incorporates artificial neural networks, ensemble modeling and a factor analysis approach. Design/methodology/approach In the ANN-based conceptual cost estimating model, the ensemble modeling component enhances training, and thus, improves its predictive accuracy and stability when project data quantity is low; and the factor analysis component finds the optimal input for an estimating model, rendering explanations of project data more descriptive. Findings On the basis of the results of experiments, it can be concluded that ensemble modeling and FAMD (Factor Analysis of Mixed Data) are both conjointly capable of improving the accuracy of conceptual cost estimates. The ANN model version combining bootstrap aggregation and FAMD improved estimation accuracy and reliability despite these very low project sample sizes. Research limitations/implications The generalizability of the findings is hard to justify since it is difficult to collect cost data of construction projects comprehensively. But this difficulty means that our proposed approaches and findings can provide more accurate and stable conceptual cost forecasting in the early stages of project development. Originality/value From the perspective of this research, previous uses of past-project data can be deemed to have underutilized that information, and this study has highlighted that - even when limited in quantity - past-project data can and should be utilized effectively in the generation of conceptual cost estimates.","[Lee, Jin Gang] SunMoon Univ, Div Architecture, Asan, South Korea; [Lee, Hyun-Soo; Park, Moonseo] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Seo, JoonOh] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lee, JG (corresponding author), SunMoon Univ, Div Architecture, Asan, South Korea.",jinganglee@sunmoon.ac.kr; hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; mspark@snu.ac.kr; joonoh.seo@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,57,0,0,8,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Although many research efforts have been made on automatic point cloud registration, prior works have some limitations. Automatic registration was tested in a bounded region and required a large overlapped area between scans. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel method that achieves automatic point cloud registration in an unbounded region and with a relatively small overlapped area without using artificial targets, landmarks, or any other manual alignment process. For automatic point cloud registration, the proposed framework uses the feature detection algorithms commonly used in computer vision to identify geometric correspondences among the series of scans for the initial alignment. Then, it computes the overlapped area between scans and determines a method to use for the final alignment. If the overlapped area is sufficiently large, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to generate the proper transformation. Otherwise, a plane-matching algorithm is used to achieve precise registration. The proposed framework was tested at outdoor construction sites and an indoor environment, which resulted in deviation angle accuracy of less than 0.35 degrees for outdoor and 0.13 degrees for indoor testbeds, respectively, with processing time of less than 4 min. These promising results demonstrate that the proposed target-free automatic registration method can significantly reduce the manual registration time and data gathering time without compromising the registration accuracy, thus simplifying and promoting laser scanning practices in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management (AEC/FM) industry.

However, previous probabilistic cost estimation models are mostly devoid of loss-sharing considerations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic cost estimation model integrating risk allocation and claim. The bargaining game between the owner and the contractor is first used to determine the proportion of risk allocation in the price fluctuation and the claim amount in the engineering quantity variation. Then, these two key parameters are incorporated into a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic cost risk simulation. The proposed model is applied to an actual hydropower project, and the results show that the risk reserve fund of the proposed model only accounts for 2.66% of the budget under 80% completion probability, and the average cost risk sensitive coefficient of the proposed model has more than tripled. From the results, the cost estimation value calculated by the novel model is more competitive and accurate in bidding; in addition, to reduce additional cost expenditures, the contractor should maintain a high level of patience during negotiations. This research contributes to improving the probability of winning a contract without sacrificing the contractor's profit and to extending the current theory of probabilistic cost estimation.","[Chen, Yun; Chen, Shu; Jin, Lianghai; Zheng, Xiazhong] China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Construct & Management Hydropower E, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yun] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chaoran] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China","Chen, S (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Construct & Management Hydropower E, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.",chenyun77@whu.edu.cn; chenshu@ctgu.edu.cn; 2014165107@ctgu.edu.cn; jinlianghai@ctgu.edu.cn; zhengxz@126.com,,"Chen, Yun/0000-0002-3706-9883",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51609128]; Open Foundation of the Hubei Key Laboratory of Construction and Management in Hydropower Engineering [2019KSD06],This study is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51609128) and the Open Foundation of the Hubei Key Laboratory of Construction and Management in Hydropower Engineering (Grant No. 2019KSD06).,,47,0,0,3,33,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Such a workflow can be managed effectively by promoting work-plan reliability through better planning strategies. The Parade Game is a construction management educational tool that demonstrates the impact of production capacity variability (influencing work-plan reliability) on the construction project performance. Previous studies on Parade Game simulation assumed the same amount of variability across the board for all trades due to the interest of simplicity in simulation. However, in reality, the level of variability differs from one trade to another, depending on the complexity level of the work and effort in planning. Furthermore, the allocation of crews with different variability and its impact on project performance has not been studied in previous research. This paper further developed Parade Game simulation as an education tool by proposing a new simulation model that uses different variability levels and the corresponding costs at different work stations. The objectives of this research were to (1) identify the consequence of having higher or lower variability levels at early, middle, or late stations, and (2) demonstrate the benefits of reliability improvement from the cost and production standpoints. The contribution to the body of knowledge is that this research analyzed the cost and benefit trade-off between investment in planning reliability and productivity improvement in different scenarios of a construction production system.

Linear programming (LP) and integer programming (IP) techniques have traditionally been applied to minimize transportation costs and mass-haul distances associated with earthwork processes. However, typical formulations of the earthwork allocation problem do not consider the sequence of equipment movement and are, therefore, limited in their ability to establish a practical and workable hauling plan. A more complex problem, which is formulated and solved in this research, is the least-cost route cut and fill problem (LCRCFP). The primary objective of the LCRCFP is to determine the specific route to be traveled and the quantities of soil that construction equipment must haul to meet the desired grade while minimizing the total distance traveled. In this research, the LCRCFP was formulated as a mixed binary optimization problem and solved using a traditional branch-and-bound method and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Accordingly, this solution can provide efficient and practical hauling plans for construction sites. Furthermore, a linear variation of the problem, which is common for linear roadwork or utility construction, was also formulated and solved. Extensive computational results are reported for several randomly generated instances of the LCRCFP. Realistic problems can be effectively solved using PSO. Thus, the derived plan can be used in mapping and path planning and by on-site engineers. It can also be used for the deployment of unmanned construction equipment in autonomous vehicle control systems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000512.

Of this population, research shows that approximately 19% work in the construction industry, comprising around 14% of all construction workforces. The main objectives of this research are to (1) to predict possible effects of immigration and immigration reform legislation on worker wages and (2) to assess the likely wage increase due to decreased supply of immigrant labor. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, the construction workforces for low-skilled trades such as concrete, masonry, drywall, painting, flooring, and roofing are comprised of approximately 55% illegal immigrant. Based on four factors evaluated in this research (1) prevailing wage provision in legislation; (2) forced tax compliance of the workforce; (3) market correction from currently depressed wages due to immigrant penetration into the workforce; and (4) a labor shortage resulting from a depleted supply of immigrant labor, proposed legislation could increase the cost of trade labor up to almost 70% in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Overall labor costs for projects could increase by almost 18%, and total project costs could rise almost 12% in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region.","[Golden, Sabrina K.] US Marine Corps, Dept Installat & Logist, Def Program Review Initiat, Installat Implementat Branch,Facil & Serv Div, Washington, DC 20380 USA; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Project Management Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Golden, SK (corresponding author), US Marine Corps, Dept Installat & Logist, Def Program Review Initiat, Installat Implementat Branch,Facil & Serv Div, Washington, DC 20380 USA.",sabrinagolden@gmail.com; mirek@umd.edu,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018","Skibniewski, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7102-753X",,,,16,6,6,0,10,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

It seeks to complement methods for measuring performance in construction by providing feedback and capturing perceptions of design quality embodied in buildings. The research team worked closely with the sponsors and an industry steering group to develop the indicators that could be readily used by clients and practitioners to better understand and promote value through design. The development and piloting process was explored within a context of lessons from earlier attempts by others. The three main elements of the DQI toolkit (conceptual framework, data-gathering tool, weighting mechanism) mapped the value of buildings in relation to their design for different uses and their ability to meet a variety of physical, aspirational and emotional needs of occupants and users. The DQI pilot studies consisting of five design and construction projects are discussed along with their graphical representation of results generated by end-users, individual team members and project teams. The process raises questions about the difficulties in the description and application of indicators for design quality. It is argued that the benefit of the DQI is a 'tool for thinking', rather than an absolute measure, because it has the potential to capture lessons from current building design for strategic future use as well as initiate, represent and inform discussions involving designers', clients', producers' and end-users' perceptions on the tangible and intangible aspects of possibilities within live design projects. The limitations of the approach, the next phase of development and further research issues are raised.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Innovat Studies Ctr, London SW7 2PG, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2PG, England","Gann, DM (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Sch Business, Innovat Studies Ctr, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2PG, England.",d.gann@imperial.ac.uk,"Whyte, Jennifer/D-3885-2009; Salter, Ammon/A-9217-2010; Whyte, Jennifer/AAF-9739-2021","Whyte, Jennifer/0000-0003-4640-2913; Salter, Ammon/0000-0003-2065-1268; Whyte, Jennifer/0000-0003-4640-2913; Gann, David/0000-0002-8245-3948",,,,42,120,122,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

MOT work is an essential part of any construction project and can constitute a significant fraction of overall project cost. It is hypothesized that MOT costs can be reduced significantly through project bundling (consolidation of several separate projects into a single contract). However, no existing study has quantified the impact of bundling on MOT costs. In addressing the issue, this paper develops statistical models that take into account the effects of bundling and other influential factors. Six construction work categories that involve 36 different project types were considered. Several significant variables were identified including the project cost, bundle size, geographical proximity, functional class, traffic volume, and letting season; It was found that the impacts of these variables on MOT cost varies significantly by project type. The study results can provide construction managers with knowledge on projects of specific attributes for which MOT cost could be reduced significantly by project bundling, and those for which bundling would have no such effect.","[Qiao, Yu; Fricker, Jon D.; Labi, Samuel] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr W, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Labi, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr W, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",qiao14@purdue.edu; fricker@purdue.edu; labi@purdue.edu,,"Qiao, Yu/0000-0002-7808-5687",Joint Transportation Research Program,"This work was supported by the Joint Transportation Research Program administered by the Indiana Department of Transportation and Purdue University.

Further, the fluctuation of economic variables and indexes (EV&Is), such as liquidity, wholesale price index, and building services index, causes variation in costs. These changes may increase or reduce the construction cost, are hard to predict, and are normally ignored in the traditional cost estimation computation. This paper presents an innovative construction cost estimation model using advanced machine-learning concepts and taking into account the EV&Is. A data structure is proposed that incorporates a set of physical and financial (P&F) variables of the real estate units as well as a set of EV&Is variables affecting the construction costs. The model includes an unsupervised deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) learning approach along with a softmax layer (DBM-SoftMax), and a three-layer back-propagation neural network (BPNN) or another regression model, support vector machine (SVM). The role of DBM-SoftMax is to extract relevant features from the input data. The role of the BPNN or SVM is to turn the trained unsupervised DBM into a supervised regression network. This combination improves the effectiveness and accuracy of both conventional BPNN and SVM. A sensitivity analysis was performed within the algorithm in order to achieve the best results taking into account the impact of the EV&I factors in different times (time lags). The model was verified using the construction cost data for 372 low- and midrise buildings in the range of three to nine stories. Cost estimation errors of the proposed model were much less than those of both the BPNN-only and SVM-only models, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategies employed in this research and the superiority of the proposed model.

The performance of bridge structures should be carefully monitored, especially in severe climatic conditions. The objective of this study is to develop a rational method that predicts the most cost-effective intervention schedule for bridges, where the structural safety is maintained with the minimum possible lifecycle cost. The framework functions through (1)a central database that contains the asset inventory along with the maintenance actions list, (2)a biquadratic system reliability-based deterioration model, (3)an intervention effect model that simulates the effect of undertaking various intervention scenarios on the bridge superstructure performance, (4)a financial model that computes the lifecycle costs throughout the planning horizon, and (5)an optimization model that utilizes a genetic algorithms engine to compare the different intervention scenarios and selects the most cost-effective one. This method is applied to a simply supported bridge superstructure case study, designed in accordance with Canadian highway bridge design standards. The results indicate that undertaking less costly minor repair actions may considerably reduce the lifecycle costs as a result of decreasing the number of costly major interventions. The optimum scenario resulted in an equivalent uniform annual cost of US$8,277 per year, which shows 4.5 times cost saving as compared with the conventional scenario where only major repairs are performed. This innovative combination of reliability analysis, nonlinear finite-element modeling, and genetic algorithms optimization supports asset managers in long-term planning and ensures undertaking rational and objective decisions.","[Ghodoosi, Farzad; Abu-Samra, Soliman; Zayed, Tarek] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Zeynalian, Mehran] Univ Isfahan, Dept Civil Engn, Esfahan 8176737841, Iran","Ghodoosi, F (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",farzad.ghodoosi@gmail.com; solimanamr_8@aucegypt.edu; m.zeynalian@eng.ui.ac.ir; zayed@encs.concordia.ca,"Zayed, Tarek/L-6437-2018; Zayed, Tarek/A-3765-2011; Zeynalian, Mehran/M-5531-2019","Zayed, Tarek/0000-0003-3249-7712; Zeynalian, Mehran/0000-0002-0681-2654",,,,34,24,25,1,32,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

A model for predicting the environmental costs of construction noise and vibration was developed in this study. The model uses noise- and vibration-level data of construction equipment to predict the construction noise and vibration levels and estimates the environmental costs based on the predicted noise and vibration levels. Monte Carlo simulation was used to develop the model, considering the uncertainty of the noise- and vibrationlevel data of construction equipment. As it is difficult to collect actual compensation cost data for noise and vibration, the validity of the model was verified by comparing the actual noise and vibration levels measured at six receiving nodes with the predicted noise and vibration levels. The results showed that the predicted noise and vibration levels differed by 2.76 dBA (4.28%) and -3.76 dBV (-5.35%) from the actual noise and vibration levels, respectively. The correlation coefficients of the predicted and measured results were 0.991 and 0.982, respectively, which show that the model was reasonably accurate. The case study showed that the environmental cost of noise and vibration was US $237,679.25 when the noise barrier was not installed. It is expected that the developed model can be used to establish a mitigation strategy for contractors to reduce damage due to construction noise and vibration in the preconstruction phase.

FRP composites, however, are still relatively unknown to the practicing civil engineer and infrastructure systems planner. There are several unresolved issues to be considered in order to increase their application in construction of infrastructure. Recently, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) has been shown to identify how cost-effective FRP composites are compared with conventional materials [Hastak, Makarand and Daniel W Halpin (2000). Assessment of life-cycle benefit-cost of composites in construction. Journal of Composites for Construction, ASCE, 4 (3) 103-111]. Although many models for estimation of life-cycle cost in FRP composites have been proposed, it remains difficult to predict the end of service life for new advanced materials. It is, therefore, important to assess the life-cycle costs of replacing conventional construction materials with advanced composites. This paper introduces an analytical model to determine optimal life-cycle cost under different discount factors (i.e., interest rates) and inflation rates. It presents a method to estimate the service life for FRP bridge deck panels. Monte Carlo simulation is used to account for uncertainty in those two parameters. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An RRT*-based algorithm is proposed and validated via a case study of real-world lift jobs. Results indicate that the proposed method significantly improved the path quality in terms of practicality considerations without compromising computational efficiency. The proposed method is promising in generating operable and realistic paths that can be practically executed by crane operators.

To address this anomaly, traffic control planners are tasked with making decisions geared toward reducing hazardous situations caused by transiting vehicles and construction equipment. The growing application of technologies to enhance worker safety should be considered during the traffic control planning process. In certain cases, decisions such as choosing among technology options are made using experiential individual knowledge without the application of scientific and systematic decision-making methods. Use of experience-based decision making in this context is largely the result of sparse literature on scientific methods of selecting between alternatives in highway construction work zones. By applying the Choosing by Advantages (CBA) decision-making method, a process that achieves sound and effective decisions, the current study aims to fill the gap in practice by proposing a decision-making framework that could enhance the value-cost selection process of safety technologies in highway construction work zones. A situation that applied work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs) was selected as a case study.

In addition, it attempts to validate an existing SC scale in the cross-cultural environment of a developing country and highlights the implications of its cross-validation. The SC data collected from 40 under-construction multistorey building projects were split into calibration and validation samples for conducting the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively. This resulted in a 24-item SC scale comprised of four factors: management commitment and employees' involvement in health and safety (MC & safety enforcement and promotion (SE & applicability of safety rules and safe work practices (SR & and safety consciousness and responsibility (SC&R). The factor structure obtained through structural equation modeling (SEM) achieved a desirable goodness-of-fit, composite reliability, and construct validity. The SE&P was discovered as one of the most influential SC factors, whereas SR&WP was detected as the most overlooked factor. A correlation was observed among the error variables of SE&P and SR&WP factors, thus necessitating the development of synergy in the safety enhancement efforts of these two factors. The study has reinforced the body of knowledge by highlighting the consequences of cross-validation in a developing country, and unveiling the deviations in the existing SC factor structure such as the discovery of SE&P as a novel SC factor. The study concludes that existing SC scales cannot be generalized across countries and regions without cultural adjustments. The designed SC scale and the study's findings would help the key stakeholders to measure the SC and streamline their safety enhancement strategies on building projects in Pakistan.

Enormous legislative efforts have been made to minimize this problem. In Europe, the Directive 92/57/EEC, which establishes a mandatory safety and health requirements, defines the Safety and Health Plan. This paper contains a methodology for automatically extracting structured relevant information from this textual document. Such plans are crucial to provide safety in this sector. However, current documents are often enlarged with nonessential information, while the most relevant information is missing or difficult to locate. The information extracted by our methodology makes it easier for Safety and Health Plans to be validated and approved at an early stage, as well as facilitating their later use and updating. The main steps of this methodology are: i) the definition of the relevant content to be extracted as seven items, in collaboration with experts in the area; ii) text preprocessing and enrichment using existing software resources for the natural language employed; and iii) automated content analysis for extracting information, on the basis of a collection of previously established rules for identifying the content defined in the first step. The output is a detailed and structured report containing the percentage of relevant information identified, as well as the desired items of information. To illustrate and validate our methodology, we have implemented and applied it to 50 real Safety and Health Plans. As a result, our system was able to identify most of the required information for five of the seven items in all of these plans. In addition, we have been able to detect the problems in the textual plan that caused the missing information in the other two items, which will be corrected in future developments.","[Martinez-Rojas, Maria; Martin Antolin, Ruben; Salguero-Caparros, Francisco; Carlos Rubio-Romero, Juan] Univ Malaga, EI Ind, C Dr Ortiz Ramos S-N Teatinos, Malaga 29071, Spain","Martinez-Rojas, M (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, EI Ind, C Dr Ortiz Ramos S-N Teatinos, Malaga 29071, Spain.",mmrojas@uma.es; ruben.ma@uma.es; fsalguero@uma.es; juro@uma.es,"Rojas, Maria Martinez/T-3911-2017","Rojas, Maria Martinez/0000-0002-7050-3629","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the postdoctoral program Juan de la Cierva [FJCI-2015-24093]; project Composite Leading Indicators para la mejora de la resiliencia de la seguridad laboral, en las actividades de diseno y ejecucion de estructuras [BIA2016-79270-P]","This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the postdoctoral program Juan de la Cierva (FJCI-2015-24093) and the project Composite Leading Indicators para la mejora de la resiliencia de la seguridad laboral, en las actividades de diseno y ejecucion de estructuras (BIA2016-79270-P).",,54,6,6,7,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

The practice is characterized by fragmented configurations of proprietary information systems that, jointly, lack of a shared structure to represent the road tunnel. This makes it difficult to retrieve the required information needed to conduct legally prescribed evaluations. This paper proposes an information model to support safety professionals that is based upon fieldwork in two business subdomains: maintenance governance and road-user safety evaluation. The core of the tunnel information model is based upon the standardized architecture of road tunnels and concepts from Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) literature. The authors explain the design in detail and argue that this representation will allow for better integration over the lifecycle. Findings of a validation meeting show that the explicit representation of road tunnel information is sufficiently broad and deep to meaningfully support safety evaluation. Specifically, it allows reasoning about the functional impact of technical failures and the suitability of maintenance concepts proposed. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for extension of the information model, as experts indicated both inclusion of categories of law-prescribed inspections and road tunnel closure-related categories to provide added value.

Findings confirm insights from previous studies, detailing in addition: the role of trial and error; alternative bodies of knowledge underpinning competing authority structures; and complex and subtle patterns of the informal authority of elite manual workers, its ambiguity and its limitations. The experiential knowledge valued by site personnel forms a basis for the recognition of authority on site that can conflict with that of construction professionals. The conflict between forms of authority and knowledge can inhibit the dissemination of good safety practice: initiatives will meet significant resistance if they contradict the experiential knowledge of site operatives; if they do not make use of this experiential knowledge, they may fail to address hazards fully; methods of site learning, particularly in the development of innovative practice, are inherently hazardous.","Univ Salford, Res Inst Built & Human Environm, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England; Univ Salford, Inst Hlth & Social Care Res, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England; Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Birmingham B15 4TT, W Midlands, England","Rooke, J (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Res Inst Built & Human Environm, 7th Floor,Allerton Bldg,Frederick Rd Campus, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England.",j.rooke@salford.ac.uk,,,,,,27,25,25,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Architects and design engineers have the opportunity to positively affect construction worker safety and health through the choices they make in the design process. Lack of designer knowledge about construction processes and limited availability of tools to assist in assessing the safety risk associated with a design are considered as inhibitors to implementation of the design for construction safety (DfCS) concept. This paper presents research conducted to quantify the construction safety risk of each of the design elements present in typical multistory buildings in the United States. The major research efforts were (1) identification of the typical building design elements and associated construction activities; (2) quantification of the unit and cumulative risks of the design elements and construction activities; and (3) development of an online design risk-assessment tool. Absolute safety risks were quantified for 141 design elements and 683 construction activities using the survey-analytical research method. The risk factors developed were incorporated into an online tool titled Safety in Design Risk Evaluator (SliDeRulE). The research contributes to the construction industry body of knowledge by providing quantitative values that link specific design features to construction safety. The website is designed to assist building designers with assessing the level of construction safety risk associated with their designs and is intended for use by designers during the design phase to create buildings that are safer to construct.

Hazard measurement and risk scales are essential components of an integrated model aimed at quantitatively determining the safety level of individual construction sites, on a comparative basis. The paper focuses on two factors identified in earlier studies as considerably affecting safety on sites with tower cranes, overlapping cranes and operator proficiency. These two factors are inherently different from each other in their characteristics and therefore also in the methods used to measure both the factors and the risk resulting from them. A probability-based method was prescribed for the measurement of overlapping cranes, while the analytical hierarchy process method and knowledge elicitation from experts were applied to develop metrics for operator proficiency. In both cases, an intimate understanding of the crane work environment is necessary. The uniform format and specific methodologies presented here can be used in the development of measurement techniques and risk scales for other safety factors concerning crane operation on construction sites.","[Shapira, Aviad; Simcha, Meir] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Simcha, Meir] Plaza Ctr Serbia & Balkans, Belgrade 11040, Serbia","Shapira, A (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",avishap@technion.ac.il; meir@plazacenters.rs,,,"Manof Fund for Safety and Hygiene at the Workplace, National Insurance Institute of Israel","The writers gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the equipment and safety professionals who were interviewed for this study, and particularly Shlomo Carmel (Solel Boneh Ltd.), Yaakov Gutenberg (Ashtrom Ltd.), and Shaul Carmel (Danya Cebus Ltd.).

Three municipal road PPP projects published by China Public Private Partnerships Center are selected as cases. The data of these cases are analyzed based on the model established. Findings The prolongation of the cooperative period affects the increase in transaction cost, which gradually decreases when the prolonged cooperative period increases. Furthermore, the large-investment PPP projects own more transaction cost compared with less-investment projects. The decrease in transaction cost in the former is less than that in the latter. The increase in transaction cost is evidently alleviated in a project with less investment when the cooperative period is prolonged further. Originality/value The study systematically analyzes the relationship among transaction cost economics, real option theory and prospect theory and proposes a theoretical flowchart of the effect of nonmonetary incentive on the transaction cost. A model to quantify the effect of nonmonetary incentive (i.e. prolongation of cooperative period) on the transaction cost is proposed for the first time. The results of the study verify that the nonmonetary incentive affects transaction cost.","[Liu, Fangfang; Wang, Yousong; Zhou, Xiaowei] South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongyang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Transportat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongyang] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Li, HY (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Transportat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Li, HY (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",li.terryhy@yahoo.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71501074]; 13th Five-Year Plan of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Guangdong Province (2019 General Project) [GD19CGL27]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology, China [2020ZB17]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019MS116, x2tj/D2192640]","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71501074); the 13th Five-Year Plan of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Guangdong Province (2019 General Project) (Project No.: GD19CGL27); the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, South China University of Technology, China (2020ZB17); and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (approval number 2019MS116; project number x2tj/D2192640).",,58,0,0,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Most available indexes exhibit significant variation, creating a challenge for state agencies to make accurate budget estimations. Numerous researchers have attempted to forecast the index using quantitative models, but two major problems still exist. First, few models work effectively with highly volatile data. A model that is only fitted well with stable data does not validate its forecasting power. Second, a good prediction model should be able to forecast at different time horizons. Many prior research projects only predicted one index point ahead, limiting the application effectivity in practice. This research fills the gap by applying the long short-term memory (LSTM) units built in the encoder and decoder architecture to model and predict the variation of the HCCI. An illustrative example used the Texas HCCI as the raw data, and the results were compared to the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. The results show that the developed LSTM model outperformed the time series models in terms of providing more accurate prediction in all three forecasting scenarios, short-term, medium-term, and long-term prediction. The main contributions of this study to the body of knowledge in cost engineering and forecasting are summarized in the following two areas: first, the paper presents a novel application of an artificial intelligence algorithm for cost index forecasting that provides more accurate prediction than the prevailing time series models, particularly for highly volatile cost indexes. Future researchers could be benefited from the explored results in this paper and use them as a referenced benchmark. Second, this is one of the first papers in construction management that shows the performance of the forecasting models when shape-change of index exists.","[Cao, Yang] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ashuri, Baabak] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, Econ Sustainable Built Environm Lab, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ashuri, Baabak] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Ashuri, B (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, Econ Sustainable Built Environm Lab, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.; Ashuri, B (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 280 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",ycao86@gatech.edu; baabak@gatech.edu,,,,,,34,8,8,3,42,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Analyzed air emissions include carbon, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. The study focuses on general residential installations within the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Pareto frontiers are determined for costs and emissions, and the best options for suppliers are identified in each case, including sensitivity analysis of the installation planning horizon. Choosing multicrystalline silicon modules over thin film modules has the greatest impact on cost reduction. The electricity mix with which the modules are produced has the greatest impact on the emissions.

In order to maximize the profit, both the client and contractor would strive to minimize the project duration and cost concurrently. In the past, most of the research studies related to construction time and cost assumed time to be constant, leaving the analyses based purely on a single objective of cost. Acknowledging this limitation, an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm known as an ant colony system is applied in this study to solve the multi-objective time-cost optimization problems. In this paper, a model is developed using Visual Basic for Application (TM) which is integrated with Microsoft Project (TM). Through a test study, the performance of the proposed model is compared against other analytical methods previously used for time-cost modeling. The results show that the model based on the ant colony system techniques can generate better solutions without utilizing excessive computational resources. The model, therefore, provides an efficient means to support planners and managers in making better time-cost decisions efficiently.","[Ng, S.

Carbon dioxide concentrations showed substandard ventilation in rooms in five of the eight schools. Monthly reports of results prepared for each school assisted school personnel in planning and implementing improvements in air quality. Unusual values of carbon monoxide concentrations and volatile organic gas concentrations were investigated when observed. The schools that volunteered for the study represented school districts with a high interest in indoor air quality issues in their buildings.

This study identifies and prioritizes key factors affecting healthcare facility costs based on the analysis of data collected from multiple projects. The database used for this study included information on project characteristics, building parameters, dimensions, and costs covering several phases of the project life cycle, from programming to activation. Initially, the study identified project characteristics and building parameters that influence overall owner project costs. Then, several quantitative methods were employed to rank these factors based on how they influence overall project costs. In the end, this study distinguished 39 healthcare-specific factors from 62 factors investigated in the research.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established standards for pollutant emissions for different tiers of equipment to attain a least-pollution equipment spread or fleet. Although using higher-tier vehicles and equipment can reduce pollutant emissions under otherwise identical conditions, policies and contractor operations can also significantly affect the total pollutant emitted for a given amount of work, such as cubic yards of earth moved or tons of surface course placed. Previous studies demonstrated the direct relationship between pollutant emissions and operational productivity and the quantitative effects of that relationship using real-world emissions data. This paper describes the results of a study conducted using computer-based simulation techniques to compare costs and pollutant emissions for a typical earth-moving project using a wheel loader and dump trucks to move a quantity of soil. Emissions were based on previously published field data. Simulation results are compared to classical, closed-form solutions from queuing theory. This study found that excess pollution-that is, the amount of pollution created without generating productive work-was lowest for the least-cost fleet and that the marginal increase in emissions was relatively small for changes in fleet configuration near the least-cost and least-pollution alternate.

Especially, spatial relationships and arrangements of components within a design are explicitly dealt with. Hierarchical graphs are used as the design representation to enable capturing different ways components can be related by taking into account the fact that a component can form a part of another one. As the human evaluation is often based on the experience gained from seeing and analyzing many designs a similar approach is proposed in this paper. This approach uses methods drawn from machine learning, in particular kernels for structured data. Kernel functions are used to calculate similarity of new designs to other designs for which the evaluation is known thus simulating the process of learning from experience. The proposed approach is illustrated by experimental results obtained for the task of floor layout design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model uses the Indoor Environmental Index (IEI) to assess the IEQ and select among three management options. IEI values are either calculated using measured environmental variables or predicted by a simple linear regression model with the Percent of Occupants with Two or More Persistent Symptoms (POPS2) index as the independent variable. Responses to a questionnaire determine POPS2 values. The paper investigates if the predicted IEI values lead to the same IEQ management decisions as the expensive calculated IEI values. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between predicted and calculated IEI values. The second objective examines the consultant effect on environmental stressor and IEI measurements by testing the null hypothesis of no difference among consultants. The difference between the calculated and predicted IEI values is not statistically significant and the inexpensive predicted values can be used for management purposes. The consultant effect on IEI values is statistically significant but interpreted to have no practical importance because it does not affect selection of management options. Consequently, it is argued that the conceptual model can be used as a proactive management tool that may be used to improve and maintain IEQ.","IIT, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA","Moschandreas, J (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, 10 W 33rd St, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.",djm@iit.edu; yoonsun2@iit.edu; darina.demirev@acordia.com,,,,,,23,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The sets of rules outlined in the article are adaptable and extendable in order to respond flexibly to different model structures. The investigation focuses on how important and recurring tests can be carried out automatically and how to make the results analyzable in a transparent and standardized manner. The proposed concept thoroughly extends well-known methods such as attribute testing and clash detection analysis of the 3D model. Doing so, the paper presents a set of novel methods for quality assurance, including 4D clash detection and checks for semantic-geometric coherence. The paper discusses in detail: the influence of modeling errors on clash detection, the difference of 3D and 4D clashes, formal methods for checking the correct linkage between 3D BIM and the bill of quantities, formal approaches for checking the semantic-geometric coherence of BIM objects. The quality assurance concept presented in the article concludes with a standardized evaluation for the individual quality criteria using a school grading system, traffic light, and percentage scale.

Despite potentially significant roles of gender differences in IEQ satisfaction, it has not always been acknowledged by researchers and findings are debated. Through a self-administered questionnaire over nine years, students (n = 3140) in 11 different higher education classroom buildings in Minnesota, USA rated their satisfaction with 23 IEQ factors. They were most satisfied with overall cleaning and maintenance followed by overall indoor air quality and amount of electric lighting. Students were least satisfied with access to electric outlets followed by daylighting IEQ factors. Mann-Whitney U tests showed that female students were statistically less satisfied with overall thermal conditions and temperature, while male students were statistically less satisfied with daylighting, electric lighting, and view conditions. Subsequent logistic regression analyses indicated the most significant impact of amount of electric lighting. The results imply that once students were dissatisfied with amount of electric lighting, they were more likely to be dissatisfied with the classroom. Despite the significant impacts of all IEQ factors, the different degree of the likelihoods indicates that some IEQ factors may impact classroom satisfaction more than other IEQ factors as indicated by this benchmark study.","[Bae, Suyeon] Univ Missouri, Dept Architectural Studies, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Martin, Caren S.] Martin & Guerin Design Res LLC, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Martin, Caren S.; Asojo, Abimbola O.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Design Housing & Apparel, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Bae, S (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Architectural Studies, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",suyeonbae@missouri.edu,,"Asojo, Abimbola/0000-0002-5119-279X; Bae, Suyeon/0000-0001-8121-1464",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Minnesota Agriculture Research and Extension (AES) program,This work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) grant and University of Minnesota Agriculture Research and Extension (AES) program.,,69,2,2,7,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The evidence gathered from construction experts as well as from previous studies suggests that the efficiency and effectiveness of current inspection processes are less than satisfactory. This paper reports an Australian research project that develops an innovative safety inspection approach to incorporate mobile computing technologies into safety inspection processes in order to facilitate more effective data collection, processing, and control practices. The paper also discusses the interview results of safety practitioners about the proposed inspection approach. The approach was implemented through the development and test of a prototype mobile inspection tool. The feasibility and usefulness of the tool was evaluated and recognized by industry practitioners. The results show that the developed approach and tool have the potential to improve safety inspection performance on construction sites as well as enhance the integration of safety management systems.

A recycling program is, therefore, needed to properly manage the waste and to avoid landfill shortages and future environmental problems. This research examines the feasibility of a construction and demolition waste recycling program in Bangkok, Thailand, using a system dynamics (SD) modeling technique. The model consists of two main elements, namely the total benefits and total costs. The simulation results show that it takes 14years for the recycling program to be worth the investment. However, with the minimum acceptable internal rate of return (IRR) of 12% for most government projects, the recycling program must be continued until the end of Year 17 to be considered feasible. The results also show that saving in landfill charges and green image are the two key benefits in the recycling program. This could be seen from the high impact of the recycling rate and green image rate parameters on the construction and demolition waste recycling program. The developed dynamic model provides a better understanding of the construction and demolition waste situation in Bangkok, and plans for an effective waste management in the long term.","[Dat Tien Doan] Thammasat Univ, Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol, Sch Management Technol, Sci, 99 Moo 18,Km 41 Paholyothin Highway Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Chinda, Thanwadee] Thammasat Univ, Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol, Sch Management Technol, 99 Moo 18,Km 41 Paholyothin Highway Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand","Doan, DT (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol, Sch Management Technol, Sci, 99 Moo 18,Km 41 Paholyothin Highway Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",doantiendat90@gmail.com; thanwadee@siit.tu.ac.th,"Doan, Dat Tien/J-2062-2019","Doan, Dat Tien/0000-0002-5890-0277",,,,41,22,22,8,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In this paper, we use data from Indiana highway projects to provide empirical evidence that a simultaneous relationship exists between cost and time overruns and that analysis of these two contractual outputs need to take due cognizance of such simultaneity. Using the three-stage least-squares technique, we identify a number of factors that significantly affect cost overrun and time overrun and we show how the effect of these variables vary by attributes such as project type and results of the bidding process.

Applying contingencies and estimating risks at the project level often do not capture the multiple uncertainties in the construction process of large transportation projects. Thus, there is a need for innovative approaches and tools to avoid large construction cost and duration overruns. To counteract such underestimations, a construction model and an uncertainty model are developed. In the construction model, the construction of the four main types of structures in rail lines (tunnels, viaducts, cuts, and embankments) is modeled bottom-up from the single activity to the entire rail line. In the uncertainty model, three sources of uncertainty (variability in the construction process, correlations between the costs of repeated activities, and disruptive events) are modeled jointly at the level of the single activity. In a Monte Carlo simulation environment, these uncertainties are propagated to the total construction cost and duration through the combination of the individual activity costs and durations. The construction and uncertainty models are incorporated in the decision aids for tunneling (DAT), which have been extended beyond tunneling to consider these different structures and uncertainty types. All this was applied in the Portuguese high-speed rail project, in which historical data and expert estimations were used to model the cost and duration uncertainty. This application allowed validation of the model and then illustration of a variety of effects: the three sources of uncertainty produce different cost and duration impacts depending on the type of structure, suggesting structure-specific mitigation measures. Most importantly, their cumulative impact causes significant increases in construction cost and duration of the modeled rail line compared with the deterministic estimates: specifically, 58% in the construction cost of tunnels, and 94% in the construction duration of cuts and embankments. The proposed construction and uncertainty models contribute and advance the body of knowledge: For the first time, variability, correlations, and disruptive events are quantitatively modeled in one simulation environment, and the impact of these uncertainty sources can be assessed jointly and compared. The proposed models also significantly contribute to practice by providing transportation agencies with a modeling tool to tackle cost and duration uncertainty in the construction of rail lines and other linear or networked infrastructure projects.","[Moret, Yvonne] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Einstein, Herbert H.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Moret, Y (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ymoret@mit.edu,,,,,,49,19,19,5,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Therefore, accuracy of construction project cost estimates is pivotal in project success. Several studies have determined factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates. Comparatively less information is available for construction industries in developing countries. This study identified factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates for construction projects in Pakistan. Cost data was collected for 46 completed construction projects. Four dimensions 60 factors were considered. Dimensions included: project characteristics, project team, estimating procedures, and (costing related) information items. A rigorous analysis framework based on principal component analysis and regression analysis was used. Involvement of the contractor in the estimation procedure and labour rates were found to be the most significant factors. Early involvement of the contractor can result in realistic estimates through timely input from subcontractors, materials suppliers and manufacturers among others. This also helps in controlling labour costs as most of the construction projects in Pakistan employ labour through subcontractors.","[Arif, Farrukh] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Karachi, Pakistan; [Lodi, Sarosh H.] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, Karachi, Pakistan; [Azhar, Nida] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Urban & Infrastruct Engn, Karachi, Pakistan","Arif, F (corresponding author), NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Karachi, Pakistan.",farrukharif@gmail.com,,,,,,17,10,10,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Semi-structured group interviews and mini interviews during work were carried out with 13 concrete work crews (totalling 53 persons) at five large construction sites. The organization of work fosters social identification within a crew, resulting in distancing from and social categorization of site management. Social identification influences safety behaviour in the crews, where worksite safety rules may meet resistance. Future safety initiatives at large construction sites should take into account the dynamics of social identification and categorization in the implementation of safety measures, e.g. by creating an alternative organization of work, thus making it easier for a work crew to identify themselves with the site management. Site/crew managers should consider how safety can become a salient and valued group norm by altering the social structure at the sites and/or fostering dual social identity.","[Andersen, L.

In 2002 the construction industry had the undesirable distinction of having two of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with fatalities among structural steel workers at 58.2 per 100,000 workers (fourth highest rate) and among construction laborers at 27.7 per 100,000 workers (ninth highest rate). Costs associated with construction accidents, such as increased insurance premiums and medical expenses, and loss of productivity are also concerns in the industry. It has not been demonstrated how unsafe working conditions affect worker performance, and the impact of unsafe work practices on worker performance has not been quantified. This paper describes a methodology that included direct observation of steel erection activities and statistical analysis of task duration data. The data collected at steel erection sites included safety conditions such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), elevation of the work area, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, and worker performance in the form of task durations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis of 186 of steel erection task durations collected over a six-month period showed that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). the time of day during which the operation was being performed, the elevation at which the work was being performed, and the presence of decking below the work area had statistically significant effects on the durations of steel erection tasks.","So Polytech State Univ, Sch Architecture Civil Engn Technol & Construct, Marietta, GA 30060 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Stat, Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Irizarry, J (corresponding author), So Polytech State Univ, Sch Architecture Civil Engn Technol & Construct, 1100 S Marietta Pkwy, Marietta, GA 30060 USA.",irizarry@spsu.edu; simonsen@purdue.edu; dulcy@ecn.purdue.edu,"Irizarry, Javier/AAC-9460-2019; Simonsen, Katy/A-4193-2012",,,,,26,17,18,0,9,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Elevation data accuracy, efficiency, and cost effectiveness were compared with the traditional aerial photogrammetry and ground based total station survey methods. The elevations of centerline and 15 different cross sections were compared with groundtruthing data from the total station survey. Using appropriate flight mission parameters, the airborne laser technology permits elevation accuracy of 0.13 m (5 in). There are less operating constraints which adversely affect the productivity of traditional methods, such as cloud and vegetation cover, time of day, and intrusion into private properties. It is recommended to combine the low-altitude airborne laser technology with centerline staking by total station survey and aerial photography.

Based on the results of these interviews, the authors generated 160 leading indicator questions to incorporate into their design quality assessment tool. The developed implementation tool enables practitioners to assess project design quality and prevent undesirable risks in a timely manner. This study deepens understanding of building design defects and supports design quality improvement through an effective design quality assessment tool.","[O'Connor, James T.] Univ Texas Austin, Project Management, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Koo, Hyun Jeong] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Koo, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jtoconnor@mail.utexas.edu; hjkoo@utexas.edu,,"Koo, Hyun Jeong/0000-0003-1178-8609",Construction Industry Institute (CII),"This research was sponsored by the Construction Industry Institute (CII).

In this paper a new heuristic method is designed and developed to achieve fast and high-quality solutions for the large-scale RCDTCTP. The proposed method is based on the novel principles to enable effective exploration of the search space through adequate selection of the activities to be crashed for a resource constrained schedule, by only crashing the activities with zero float in a resource constrained-schedule, which form the critical sequence. The computational experiment results reveal that the new critical sequence crashing heuristic outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of the solution quality concerning project cost and computation time. Solutions with a deviation of 0.25% from the best known solutions are achieved within seconds for the first time, for a large-scale project including up to 2,000 activities. The main contribution of the new heuristic to practitioners and researchers is that it provides a fast and effective method for optimal scheduling of real-life-size construction projects with project deadlines and resource constraints.

The cost overruns experienced in 49 road construction projects procured using traditional lump contracts are analyzed. The theoretical probability distributions are fitted to cost overrun data derived from the sampled projects whose contract values ranged from AU $0.5 and AU $97million. Goodness of fit tests are used in conjunction with probability-probability (P-P) plots to compare the sample distribution from the known theoretical distribution. A log logistic probability density function (PDF) was found to best describe the behavior of cost overruns. The cumulative distribution function is then used to determine a realistic probability of a cost overrun being experienced from the point at which a contract is awarded. This is required so that public sector clients can determine an appropriate contingency at contract award, which takes into account the nuances that contribute to increasing project costs. The research findings and methodology adopted to determine the best fit probability distribution provides a more robust approach for governing a construction contingency for road construction projects so that they can be procured successfully.

Although equipment replacement models described in the literature suggest that the consequential costs of equipment failure are significant and should be considered in replacement decisions, most fail to explicitly include consequential costs or fail to provide methods to calculate the consequential cost in complex systems. This lack of consequential cost in a model seriously diminishes the effectiveness of a company's equipment replacement policies and the company's ability to earn a project. This work describes a case study that used simulation to quantify the consequential costs of equipment availability for a company engaged in tunnel-construction. The study includes the simulation of activities of the drill-and-blast method for five tunnel types. The simulation proved to be very valuable when seeking to evaluate consequential costs. The results indicate that consequential costs are very relevant to the replacement decision of the most expensive equipment. Also, the results show a significant effect of the consequential costs on the company's equipment replacement policies. Therefore, changes in existing policies to consider consequential costs have the potential of providing important future benefits for such companies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000480.

As globalization and migrant movement increases, construction projects are becoming more nationally diverse. Among multinational workforces, language barriers present an obvious but largely unresolved H&S communication challenge, with current strategies in use yet to be assessed. On a large construction project in the United Kingdom, H&S communication strategies were explored through an ethnographic approach. This paper contributes by revealing the impracticalities of using employees as interpreters in workgroups of six or more and the limitations of technologies in a dynamic construction site environment. It also highlights the unresolved challenge of translating safety videos in multiple languages. Challenges arose including translators refusing to translate because they were not receiving extra financial benefits or recognition in their workload. Translators were also given favorable treatment during disciplinary processes because they were crucial to the continued operation of the site team. This reveals the complexities involved in implementing effective H&S communication strategies on international and multinational projects, which have previously remained largely ignored.

This situation is typical of most remanufacturing environments, where inputs are product returns (also called cores). Production (remanufacturing) cost increases as the quality level decreases, and any unused cores may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. Decision variables include, for each period and under a certain probabilistic scenario, the amount of cores to grade, the amount to remanufacture for each quality level, and the amount of inventory to carry over for future periods for ungraded cores, graded cores, and finished remanufactured products. Our model is grounded with data collected at a major original equipment manufacturer that also remanufactures. We formulate the problem as a stochastic program; although it is a large linear program, it can be solved easily using Cplex.

This research draws on complex systems theory and high reliability organisations (HRO) literature to develop insights into the cultural aspects of safety management and regulation of high-risk buildings. Ten semi-structured interviews were undertaken to explore the opinions and experiences of built environment professionals in England about the ongoing regulatory changes regarding high-risk buildings following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower. The findings expose some aspects of the organisational culture that underpin the safety-related behaviour in high-risk building life cycle in England, which are incompatible with those that underpin HRO. The findings also show how the studied regulatory changes are subsumed by this organisational culture and fail to deliver their intention. Hence, the paper establishes organisational culture of the building life cycle as a key consideration for safety management and regulation of high-risk buildings. The conclusion calls for future regulatory, practical and research efforts to develop a better appreciation of the organisational culture, and to aim for measures to cultivate a culture that enables collective mindfulness.","[Cidik, Mustafa Selcuk] UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Phillips, Stephen] Northumbria Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Newcastle, England","Cidik, MS (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",selcukcidik@gmail.com,,"Cidik, Mustafa/0000-0002-8965-5200",,,,61,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Presently, however, designers typically are not involved in construction safety. They are often uncertain of their responsibilities in relation to construction safety and fail to be responsible for avoiding or reducing safety-related risks. In this study, the concept of safety impact assessment to achieve design-for-safety in the design phase is introduced. For this purpose, a safety impact assessment model was devised, and a methodology using the risk-based safety impact assessment approach for open-cut type underground construction projects in Korea is suggested. The suggested methodology includes a safety information survey, classification of safety impact factors caused by design and construction, and quantitative estimation of magnitude and frequency of safety impact factors. A checklist which can be easily used for assessing the safety performance of design products is also proposed.

The findings indicated that 33% of the respondents had no knowledge of the concept of BIM, 28% of the respondents' organizations are not using BIM and if used it was implemented to a limited extent. The results indicated that 'hazard identification and minimization' and 'safety training and education' are the most important safety-related applications provided by BIM tools to improve safety performance in construction. Lack of universal use in the construction sector and insufficient training availability are the highest ranked barriers to adopting BIM in construction to improve safety.

Findings The findings of the empirical study resulted in the development of a 22-item scale that measures the constructs such as design quality, project administration quality, communication quality, relationship quality and dependability quality. Research limitations/implications This study has developed a context-specific psychometric scale of service quality for architects in India using snowball sampling. Although this study identified five valid service quality factors, the classified information relating to the formation of expectations was not collected. Practical implications This reliable and valid scale would be helpful for architects to measure the level of service quality in enhancing business performance. This study has established that service quality for architects is achieved only when the perceived benefits are available from the aspects like design, project administration, communication, relationship and dependability. Social implications This study can facilitate an architect interested in opportunities relating to contracting, consulting and engineering to explore possibilities of higher fees from clients. Originality/value This study is an original attempt in developing a validated tool to measure service quality of architects in India.","[Prakash, Anand; Phadtare, Milind] Natl Inst Construct Management & Res, Sch Gen Management SOGM, Pune, Maharashtra, India","Prakash, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Construct Management & Res, Sch Gen Management SOGM, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",anandprakash.indira@gmail.com,"PRAKASH, ANAND/E-3854-2018","PRAKASH, ANAND/0000-0002-7298-6978",,,,74,5,5,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

These activities require many heavy truck trips for equipment and materials, which can damage state and local roads that were not designed for high volumes of heavy truck traffic. For state transportation agencies, one measure of costs of shale gas development is the potential degradation of roadways resulting from shale gas development. This technical note, provides a first-order an estimate of roadway consumptive use costs of additional heavy truck traffic on Pennsylvania state-maintained roadways from Marcellus Shale natural gas development in 201, estimated at 1 about $13,000-$23,000 per well for all state roadway types, or $5,000-$10,000 per well if state roads with the lowest traffic volumes are excluded. This initial estimate of costs, is based on data on the distribution of well activity and roadway type in Pennsylvania, estimates for the number of heavy truck trips to construct and operate a single well, the corresponding equivalent single-axle loadings, and estimates of roadway life and reconstruction costs by roadway maintenance class in Pennsylvania.

In order to understand more about the relative effects of sunk cost and project completion information, a role-playing experiment was conducted in which business students mere asked to decide whether or not to continue funding an IT project given uncertainty regarding the prospects for success, Three variables were manipulated in the experiment: the level of sunk cost, degree of project completion, and the presence or absence of an alternative course of action, Results showed that subjects' willingness to continue a project increased with the level of sunk cost and the degree of project completion, but that subjects were more apt to justify their continuation on the basis of sunk cost. As theory would predict, the presence of an alternative course of action had a moderating effect on the escalation that was observed.",,"KEIL, M (corresponding author), GEORGIA STATE UNIV, COLL BUSINESS ADM, DEPT COMP INFORMAT SYST, ATLANTA, GA 30302 USA.",,,,,,,46,49,50,1,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

This research aims to systematically investigate the feasibility of forecasting facilities' LCC by implementing machine learning on historical data. The authors propose a comprehensive and generalizable framework for developing facility LCC analysis machine learning models. This framework specifies the data requirements, methods, and expected results in each step of the model development process. First, a literature review and a questionnaire survey were conducted to determine the independent variables affecting facility LCC and to identify the potential data sources. The process of using raw data to derive LCC components is then discussed. Finally, a proof-of-concept case study was conducted on a university campus to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. This research concludes that current building systems already contain the data for LCC analysis and that the proposed framework is effective in facility LCC prediction.","[Gao, Xinghua] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Myers Lawson Sch Construct, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Pishdad-Bozorgi, Pardis] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Gao, XH (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Myers Lawson Sch Construct, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",xinghua@vt.edu,,,Digital Building Laboratory (DBL) at Georgia Institute of Technology; Centre for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT) at Georgia Institute of Technology [4906638],This work was supported by the Digital Building Laboratory (DBL) at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Centre for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT) at Georgia Institute of Technology (project No. 4906638).

In conventional approaches, LCCA assumes that regular and preventive maintenance will be performed according to each replacement cycle for individual components, and replacement for each component is considered independently. However, because the components of equipment used in buildings are installed systemically, replacements of major components may cause unexpected replacements of dependent minor components. Therefore, it is necessary to identify additional replacements based on the associations among these related replacement components to achieve a more reliable LCCA. In response, this study proposes an LCCA model that comprehensively considers the relationships among the maintenance components. The development of the model involves identifying relationships among components using social network analysis (SNA), arranging individual replacement timings of the components that reflect these relationships, and analyzing the life-cycle cost (LCC) based on the arranged timing. To validate the model, its applicability and effectiveness was illustrated and tested using 19 components of a rainwater reuse system. This study makes a theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge by suggesting concepts of synchronous relationships and replacements based on SNA. In addition, the use of the model proposed in this study enables practitioners to analyze LCCs that reflect synchronous replacements, which allows more reasonable decision-making considering hidden costs in conventional LCC.

This trade-off relationship can roughly be estimated using past and cumulative knowledge, but since the early 1970s, researchers have been working on a systematic and mathematical solution to define this relationship more accurately. These researchers have used different optimization techniques such as the genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony, and fuzzy logic to further explore the relationship. In the present paper, the authors have used their previously introduced construction schedule generator algorithm to present graphical relationships between pre-defined objectives of schedule optimizations. The process starts with developing construction schedules from the project's Building Information Model (BIM) as part of the input along with resource data. Then the process continues with optimization of all developed construction schedules according to the two mentioned objectives along with the introduced job-site movement objective, which mathematically helps the sequence of installation be more logical and practical.

Even though construction literature involves plenty of studies that emphasize the importance of environmental impact during the construction phase, most of the previous studies failed to combine environmental analysis with other project performance criteria in construction. To achieve environmentally conscious construction and successfully manage a complex construction environment, multiple project objectives and their relationships need to be considered. In this study, the authors propose a framework on the basis of the concept of control accounts to determine optimal construction operations when project time, cost, and environment impact (TCEI) are considered as project objectives during project planning. The framework also supports decision-making by using sensitivity analysis. Life cycle assessment is applied to the evaluation of environmental impact in terms of global warming potential (GWP). The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, or NSGA-II, is selected for implementation in MATLAB to determine optimal construction operations. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the framework. It is shown by the case study that the application of the genetic algorithm to search problems, such as the case study, is promising in terms of determining optimal solutions, but computation speed can be an issue, if it involves a large set of data. In addition, data collection and processing is a major challenge, especially the processing of environmental impact data. Tools are needed to facilitate data collection and processing. Currently, the proposed framework includes a critical path method, on the basis of fixed logical relationships among activities, to determine the duration of a project. The effect of resource and other constraints on such logical relationships, and potentially the duration of a project, is not addressed in this study. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000098.

Developing an analytical methodology for characterizing the effect of variability in productivity on labor cost budgeting is vital to this particular construction type. Integrating current practices of estimating, scheduling, and budgeting in industrial construction, this paper describes an error propagation model for calculating the standard deviation of the cumulative labor hours at particular time points of the project duration and establishing a confidence interval around the average value. Analogous to plotting an S-curve, the lower bound and upper bound of the interval for cumulative labor hours budgeted at control points along the project duration can be articulated to form the S-stripe, which visually portrays the risk of labor cost budget due to risks inherent in labor productivity. The application and verification of the proposed analytical methodology are illustrated with a steel fabrication project case. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to the same project data in the case study, resulting in a near-perfect correlation between the two sets of results. In the simulation experiment design, determining the minimum number of simulation runs that are deemed sufficient to obtain reliable sampling results entails trial and error, and the obtained result is case-specific. In contrast, the proposed analytical method circumvents this barrier by analytically deriving the project labor cost budget in the form of an S-stripe.","[Hasan, Monjurul; Lu, Ming] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, DICE Bldg 9211,116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada","Lu, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, DICE Bldg 9211,116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",mdmonjur@ualberta.ca; mlu6@ualberta.ca,"Hasan, Monjurul/AAL-1132-2021","Hasan, Monjurul/0000-0003-2066-7948",,,,28,1,1,3,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The cracks in lightweight partition walls caused by frequent earthquakes decrease customer satisfaction and increase repair costs in the case company. This research demonstrates how a Six Sigma team can determine and improve the key input variables affecting the cracks in lightweight partition walls. A case study methodology is used in this research to illustrate the tools of Six Sigma by using the project charter to define problems, by using tools of process mapping to display all the input and output variables affecting cracks in lightweight partition walls, by using the C&E (cause-and-effect) Matrix to select highly correlated input variables, and by using failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify causes of the cracks. Unlike conventional Six Sigma, finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation software ABAQUS was used instead of statistical tools to verify variables and to identify initial causes of cracks because data collecting was time consuming. The results showed that a 1-cm preset spacing between the board and the main structure substantially reduces cracks caused by earthquakes. A new earthquake-proof construction method has been developed based on the finding of this research and was recently granted a new patent (M 431196) by the Intelligent Property Office in Taiwan.

In this study, the long-term pavement performance (LTPP) data and machine learning algorithms were used to predict the deterioration in the pavement condition index (PCI) over 2, 3, 5, and 6 years. In selecting the attributes for conducting the analysis, we targeted ones that are freely available. This approach can help smaller municipalities, which could be short on money or required expertise. For larger ones and transportation agencies, this can save the increasingly significant costs for collecting field data and any associated safety or traffic implications. In addition, we used this category of attributes to better examine the role of data analytics in asset management. Without considering a causal model, can trends in data help assess deterioration in the PCI? Several models using combinations of 15 attributes were learned and tested. The algorithms used in this study were two types of decision trees and their boosted models based on gradient boosted trees. The accuracy of the ensemble of boosted classifiers was considerably higher than their base learners, with some reaching over 80% in predicting unseen data. We also found that dividing data into different climatic zones can change the relative importance of attributes and the overall accuracy of the models. Increasing the prediction span reduces accuracy, while reducing the number of prediction classes (levels of deterioration) increases the accuracy. In addition to automating the calculation and prediction of PCI, this study presented informative or important attributes for prediction. Such analyses could help municipalities and departments of transportations with forming a more effective policy for data collection and management.","[Piryonesi, S.

For a case study, the project analyzes 163 public apartment buildings from 15 housing complex projects in Korea. To examine the validity of the proposed AI, the case study carries out two types of validation in terms of estimate accuracy using the parametric method and the case-based reasoning (CBR) applicability test. The validation results support the acceptable use of the suggested AI in measuring the weights of attributes and its estimate accuracy when combined with parametric or CBR estimation.

In the DBB method, the contractors build the project according to the detailed design and specifications prepared by the engineers. Using the DBB method, the quality of design has an impact on the construction performance. To date, only a few studies have measured the effect of design cost on the project performance of the road projects. In order to determine the impact of design cost on construction cost and schedule performance, this paper analyzes a sample of 47 Clark County public road projects of Nevada and 17 road projects of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The sample includes projects completed between 1991 and 2009, and cost more than $3.43billion in construction value, converted to a 2010 base cost. Besides determining the impact of design cost on the cost and schedule growth of the road projects, this study also determines a correlation between the design cost percentage and the final project cost of the projects. The analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the design cost percentage and the total cost growth of the project. In addition, the design cost percentage was found to have a strong negative correlation with the final project cost for this sample. The t-test showed that the design cost percentage of road projects that have total cost growth less than or equal to zero was significantly higher than that for road projects that have a total cost growth higher than zero.","[Shrestha, Pramen P.] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Mani, Nirajan] Univ Nebraska, Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, Lincoln, NE 68182 USA","Shrestha, PP (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Howard R Hughes Coll Engn, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",pramen.shrestha@unlv.edu; nirajan.mani@huskers.unl.edu,,"Shrestha, Pramen/0000-0001-6362-2315",,,,20,15,15,3,47,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

To improve existing methods, the proposed algorithm aims to achieve three goals: (1) to obtain the entire Pareto front in a single run; (2) to be insensitive to the scales of time and cost; and (3) to treat all existing types of activity time-cost functions, such as linear, nonlinear, discrete, discontinuous, and a hybrid of the above. The proposed algorithm modifies a population-based search procedure, particle swarm optimization, by adopting an elite archiving scheme to store nondominated solutions and by aptly using members of the archive to direct further search. Through a fast food outlet example, the proposed algorithm is shown effective and efficient in conducting advanced bicriterion time-cost analysis.

The procedure considers types of materials and the structural shapes of the AutoCAD drawings to compute the cost of the structural skeleton elements using interactive automation. The main concept focuses on using layer computation of the AutoCAD drawing after converting it into a drawing inter-exchangeable file format (DXF). Once the coordinates are detected, it is easier to determine the area and volume for any structural shape, including circles and polygons. The extracting method is a new technique for structural engineers and quantity surveyors to estimate required material for beam, columns, slabs and foundations. The algorithm extracts and recognizes the layers and objects from a two dimensional DXF drawing along with the coordinates information. The results obtained using this technique are more accurate and reliable than manual procedures or any other traditional techniques. In this paper, an automated and interactive procedure for B.o.Q computation is demonstrated. The process involves a user-friendly interface, dynamic linking to the structural drawings and tracking of B.o.Q modifications at the same time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These maintenance activities are classified into six categories and the period after construction into four categories in order to create a risk matrix, after which the severity and frequency distribution for each cell is calculated and the results combined to derive the total maintenance cost distribution. Maintenance activities incurred 11 to 20 years post-construction were found to have the greatest impact on cost and highest occurrence, likely because facilities such as fire safety and electrical equipment require replacement during that period and the painting is renewed. Adapting an LDA for maintenance cost evaluation, therefore, allows both the total cost distribution and the specific cost distribution incurred by particular circumstances to be analyzed, making it possible to allocate sufficient maintenance funding to properly maintain the building structure and systems and ensure adequate housing quality for occupants.","[Kim, Suryeon] Hanyang Univ, Architectural Engn, 55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Sanghyo] Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Architecture & Civil Engn, 346 Joongang Ro, Samcheok Si 25913, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Ahn, Yong Han] Hanyang Univ, Sch Architecture & Architectural Engn, 55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Lee, S (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Architecture & Civil Engn, 346 Joongang Ro, Samcheok Si 25913, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",21kimsl@naver.com; leesh0903@kangwon.ac.kr; yhahn@hanyang.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2015R1A5A1037548]","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (2015R1A5A1037548).",,36,9,9,1,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

In MASs, negotiation is the key form of interaction that enables groups of agents to arrive at a mutual agreement regarding some belief, goal, or plan. The aim of this study is to develop a MAS that simulates the negotiation process between parties (mainly contractor and client) about risk allocation and sharing of cost overruns in construction projects. The MAS was developed using three different negotiation protocols: time-dependent concession, Zeuthen's strategy, and Zeuthen's strategy with Bayesian learning. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect of reservation value, first-offer value, and negotiation protocol on the settlement amounts. The model was also tested on three hypothetical cases. Results show that it is mainly the reservation value that determines the settlement amount of the negotiation. The developed system can be used by decision makers to understand how the risks and associated costs are shared between parties under different scenarios. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000218.

However, durability is impinged upon by the interaction of different factors such as construction materials, construction method, quality systems in use at the construction stages, environmental exposure of the structural elements and their functions, ease of access for inspection and maintenance. It is therefore necessary to investigate frameworks that address the above outlined factors, for use by construction professionals. The framework should integrate the outlined durability factors and facilitate achieving the objectives of durability design that account for life cycle costs and sustainability of design options, rather than just focusing on the initial design and construction cost. This paper highlights the application of an object-oriented (OO) framework to decision-making in designing for durability in the bridge domain, and a prototype implementation of this framework. It discusses how an object-based solution could contribute towards achieving the objectives of durability and minimum maintenance costs at project level.

Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a small sample of projects with exceptional increases in cost estimates during the front-end phase. The authors analyzed the magnitude of cost increases and possible reasons for them. Findings - The paper concludes that underestimation in the front-end phase was significant in the sample and poses a serious problem in that suboptimal projects are approved. The causes of underestimation include underestimating risk, overestimating opportunities, inadequate estimation methods and skills, reliance on weak information, and strategic/deliberate scope creep and division of projects. Research limitations/implications - The study builds on a small sample, and hence further studies should be undertaken to verify whether the findings are generalizable. Practical implications - The sample shows that the projects with the most unrealistic early estimates have disputable relevance. The paper suggests a number of recommendations that might help to counter the problem of unrealistic early cost estimates, which in turn, might allow suboptimal projects to be funded. Originality/value - The underestimation of costs at the front-end is grossly neglected in the literature compared with whether costs comply with the budget. While cost overruns are an indication of failure in terms of the project's tactical performance, the contention is that the up-front underestimation of costs might result in an inferior project being selected and thus affect the strategic performance of the project.","[Andersen, Bjorn] NTNU, IPK, Trondheim, Norway; [Samset, Knut; Welde, Morten] NTNU, BAT, Trondheim, Norway","Andersen, B (corresponding author), NTNU, IPK, Trondheim, Norway.",bjorn.andersen@ntnu.no,,,,,,50,15,15,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

The conceptual part is based on a literature review and the empirical part is primarily based on a questionnaire to project managers. The framework has a descriptive part comprising two dimensions: when, during the process, the cost overrun arose and what part of the cost function was responsible: change in the product, change in quantities of the inputs and change in price of inputs. The explanatory part is a development of Flyvbjerg's theories and identifies four possible explanations: political/strategic aspects, psychological aspects, competence-related aspects and bad luck. The result from the empirical study is that most cost overruns occur in the initiation and planning stages up to the final design and are related to design changes and increases in the amount of inputs needed because of technical and administrative problems. Of the explanatory factors, there is most support for lack of competence and optimism bias.","[Lind, Hans; Brunes, Fredrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden","Lind, H (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Real Estate & Construct Management, Stockholm, Sweden.",hans.lind@abe.kth.se,,,,,,34,23,23,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on value conflicts between local government and private sector, which are two major stakeholders in SPPP projects, and investigate exchange rules to resolve value conflicts. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed method approach, 55 semi-structured interviews were conducted for 15 stakeholders involved in a representative SPPP project. Social network analysis was then adopted to outline the value conflict network based on data drawn from focus group discussions. Finally, 24 value conflicts between local government and private sector were analyzed through another 13 semi-structured interviews in an abductive approach. Findings Results show that value conflicts between local government and private sector are dynamic and intertwined within and across three project phases, based on which six exchange rules, rationality, Altruism, power consistency, competition, group gain and reciprocity, are identified. Two sets of situational factors which potentially influence exchange rules adopted by the two parties are revealed, namely, urgency and professionality for local government and short-term interests and long-term interests for private sector. A summary of paired exchange rules is provided to predict if value conflicts between the two major stakeholders will be resolved or not. Originality/value One strength of the study is in the concentrated analysis of a single case which allows for a deep understanding of value complexity between local government and private sector in SPPP projects from a dynamic and networked perspective. A guideline is provided for both parties when a value conflict is found hard to resolve. Besides, this study is also among the first that addresses value issues in SPPP projects.","[Zhu, Fangwei; Sun, Mouxuan; Wang, Linzhuo; Sun, Xiuxia; Yu, Miao] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China","Wang, LZ (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China.",arrory@hotmail.com,"Sun, Mouxuan/AAA-9648-2020; Wang, Linzhuo/O-5664-2015","Wang, Linzhuo/0000-0002-4521-1333",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71702022],"This publication has been developed and reproduced with grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71772024); and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71702022, Youth Scholar), Copyright (2017).

The prospect value of a transportation project under traffic risk can be formulated according to the value function for gains and losses and the decision weight for gains and losses. As an extra income for investors, government subsidy is designed for highly risky aspects of BOT transportation projects: uncertain initial traffic volumes and fluctuating growth rates. Design/methodology/approach A decision-making model determining the concession period of a transportation BOT project is proposed by using the Monte-Carlo simulation method based on CPT, and the effects of risky behaviors of private investors on concession period decision making are analyzed. A subsidy method related to the internal rate-of-return (IRR) corresponding to a specific initial traffic volume and growth rate is proposed. The case of an actual BOT highway project is examined to illustrate how the method proposed can be used to determine the concession period of a transportation BOT project considering decision makers' loss-averse behavior and government subsidy. Contingency analysis is discussed to cope with possible misestimating of key factors such as initial traffic volume and cost coefficients. Sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the impact of CPT parameters on the concession period decisions. An actual BOT case which failed to attract private capital is introduced to show the practical application. The results are then interpreted to conclude this paper. Findings Based on comparisons drawn between a concession period decision-making model considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers and a model not considering them, the authors conclude that the concession period based on CPT is distinctly different from that of the loss-neutral model. The concession period based on CPT is longer than the loss-neutral concession period. That is, loss-averse private investors tend to ask for long concession periods to make up for losses they will face in the future. Government subsidies serve as extra income for investors, allowing appointed profits to be secured sooner. For the benefit side of contingency variables, the normal state of initial traffic volume, average annual traffic growth rate and bias degree and the government subsidy need to be paid close attention during the project life span. For the cost side of contingency variables, the annual operating cost variable has a significant impact on the length of predicted concession period, while the large-scale cost variable has minor impact. Originality/value With an actual BOT highway project, the determination of transportation BOT concession periods based on the psychological behaviors of decision makers is analyzed in this paper. As the psychological behaviors of decision makers heavily impact the decision-making process, the authors analyze their impacts on concession period decision making. Government subsidy is specifically designed for various states of initial traffic volume and fluctuating growth rates to cope with corresponding high risks and mitigate private investors' loss-averse behaviors. Contingency analysis and sensitivity analysis are discussed as the estimated values of parameters may not be authentic in actual situations.","[Guo, Jian; Chen, Junlin; Xie, Yujie] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chen, JL (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",txmguojian2002@126.com; chenjunlin@cufe.edu.cn; 2020211807@email.cufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72071221, 71761137004, 71871008]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing, China [17GLB036]; program for Young Talents Training in Central University of Finance and Economies","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), under grants 72071221, 71761137004 and 71871008, by the Social Science Foundation of Beijing, China, under grant 17GLB036 and by program for Young Talents Training in Central University of Finance and Economies under grant QYP2011.",,53,0,0,15,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Given the reported labor shortage, it has never been more important for the construction industry to have a qualified and motivated workforce. To do so, the industry needs to understand the current status of occupational rewards and how they are being perceived by construction workers. This paper describes research that aims to address this issue by investigating workers' perspectives of occupational rewards in the construction industry. The study utilizes responses from 176 construction workers across different states, different job responsibilities, and different work conditions. The research contributes to the construction industry by providing a unique perspective on occupational rewards through the lens of construction workers. The study identifies the rewards that are available to workers, rewards that are needed by workers, and factors that impact workers' reward satisfaction. By understanding these three aspects of occupational rewards, the industry will have a better chance of attracting and retaining the right workers for the job and motivating the available workforce for the allocated tasks. The study also contributes to the body of knowledge by facilitating a new and holistic view of rewards and the factors influencing rewards in construction. Findings from the research indicate that workers in general, are satisfied with the rewards that they are receiving, where job responsibility was found to be the reward that is received the most. However, workers' needs showed a commonality of financial importance. Furthermore, reward satisfaction was found to be influenced by 11 factors, 8 of which are occupational, and 3 sociodemographic factors.","[Azeez, Mohammed] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 208 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Gambatese, John; Hernandez, Salvador] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Azeez, M (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 208 Owen Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",azeezm@oregonstate.edu; john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu; sal.hernandez@oregonstate.edu,"Azeez, Mohammed/AAY-5145-2020","Hernandez, Salvador/0000-0001-8160-5949; Azeez, Mohammed/0000-0002-9068-1633",,,,79,12,12,4,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Data to workforce, equipment, and the overall site safety performance are currently observed, measured, and evaluated almost always manually. Such resulting performance information is likely assessed infrequently and due to subjective human interpretation or error. Research in lagging and leading safety indicators shows further that safety knowledge is hardly ever shared among relevant project stakeholders in time to prevent accidents. Since a large number of all construction fatalities are related to struck-by events - for example, workers-on-foot being too close to construction equipment and to other restricted or geo-referenced hazard areas - a novel framework around real-time location tracking technology was designed and tested to collect and study near miss data. The objectives of this article are to automatically identify the areas of static and dynamic hazards on a construction site and to automatically gather and analyze the spatial-temporal conflicts between workers-on-foot and the identified hazards. Automated conversion of raw sensor location data collected to the operation of workers, equipment, and geo-referenced hazard areas into meaningful proximity-related safety information is introduced. Field experiments validate the research based on an a priori created safe site layout information model. Results are in particular useful for practitioners or researchers who would like to enhance their quantitative and visual understanding of operational construction resource activity monitoring and analysis, and in the specific domain of detecting and mapping spatial-temporal proximity relationships of near miss events. Applications of the resulting knowledge are explained in the context of empowering construction safety engineers, managers, and the workforce by enhancing decision making in safe site layout design and planning and providing additional interactive tools in safety education and training.

The dynamic nature of construction sites has heightened the awareness of the need for improved monitoring of individual workers on sites. Although several studies indicated promising results in automated motion and activity recognition using wearable motion sensors, their technical and practical feasibility was not properly validated at actual job sites. Motion recognition models have to be evaluated in actual conditions because the motion sensor data collected in controlled conditions, and actual conditions can have different characteristics. This study proposes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for recognizing construction workers' motions. The LSTM networks were validated through case studies in one bridge construction site and two road pavement sites. The LSTM networks indicated classification accuracies of 97.6%, 95.93%, and 97.36% from three different field test sites, respectively. Through the case studies, the technical and practical feasibility of the LSTM networks was properly investigated.

As the attention paid to the impact of social influences and norms on worker behavior grows, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) emerges as a research tool for studying workers' group behavior. With ABMS, researchers can uncover the underlying process of group behavior emerging from individuals' interactions in an organization. However, validating agent-based simulation with real data is the greatest challenge in using ABMS for organizational behavior research. With this background in mind, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology for creating an empirically supported agent-based model for studying workers' behavior influenced by social norms. The proposed methodology suggests that empirical data collected by a questionnaire can be used for ABMS in three steps: (1) testing the agent behavior rules used in an agent-based model (i. e., testing the modeling assumptions), (2) demonstrating the model behavior's qualitative agreement with real workers' behavior (i. e., testing the simulation results against real data in a qualitative manner), and (3) creating a specific agent-based model with the model parameters that correspond to a specific empirical case. A specific agent-based model created in this way can then be seen as a scenario generator that corresponds to a specific reality and can be used to answer what if questions. Therefore, the model can be used to develop policies/interventions to improve workers' behavior in a given situation. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a study on construction workers' absenteeism that was conducted by the authors. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge of workforce management in construction; the proposed methodology provides a means of simulating workers' group behavior and developing policies/interventions to improve worker behavior at the group level in construction.

To remain safe, workers must be able to effectively identify, value, and respond to dangers in their work environment. The sense of comfort or discomfort associated with a hazard (i.e., risk tolerance) can play a significant role in the propensity to engage in an unsafe behavior. However, it remains unclear if, and to what extent, risk tolerance in personal life is associated with risk tolerance at work or with the propensity to break safety rules at work. To address this knowledge gap, this research tested the hypotheses that personal risk tolerance influences both work-related risk tolerance and the propensity to break safety rules. These hypotheses were tested using linear mixed-effects models with data from a survey administered to 11,811 workers from 19 countries. Results indicated that personal risk-tolerance is positively associated with both work-related risk tolerance and risk-taking behavior. However, when controlling for demographic dimensions, the relationship between personal risk tolerance and risk-taking behavior was no longer significant. Practically, these results suggest that holistic training programs for reducing or calibrating safety risk tolerance should focus on personal life in addition to work, and the demographics and social interactions of the workers also should be considered when studying safety behavior.

Significant work has been done on improving and assessing productivity and activity at task, project, or industry levels. Task level productivity and activity analysis are used extensively within the construction industry for various purposes, including cost estimating, claim evaluation, and day-to-day project management. The assessment is mostly performed through visual observations and after-the-fact analyses even though previous studies show automatic translation of operations data into productivity information and provide spatial information of resources for specific construction operations. An original approach is presented that automatically assesses labor activity. Using data fusion of spatio-temporal and workers' thoracic posture data, a framework was developed for identifying and understanding the worker's activity type over time. This information is used to perform automatic work sampling that is expected to facilitate real-time productivity assessment.

Off-the-shelf wearable sensors capable of assessing multiple parameters are available. However, using numerous variables in the fatigue prediction model can elicit data issues. This study aimed at identifying the most relevant variables for measuring occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers by using common wearable sensor technologies, such as electrocardiogram and actigraphy sensors. Design/methodology/approach Twenty-two individuals were assigned different task workloads in repeated sessions. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the most parsimonious fatigue prediction model. Heart rate variability measurements, standard deviation of NN intervals and power in the low-frequency range (LF) were considered for fatigue prediction. Fast Fourier transform and autoregressive (AR) analysis were employed as frequency domain analysis methods. Findings The log-transformed LF obtained using AR analysis is preferred for daily fatigue management, whereas the standard deviation of normal-to-normal NN is useful in weekly fatigue management. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted with entry-level construction workers who are involved in manual material handling activities. The findings of this study are applicable to this group. Originality/value This is the first study to investigate all major measures obtainable through electrocardiogram and actigraphy among current mainstream wearables for monitoring occupational fatigue in the construction industry. It contributes knowledge on the use of wearable technology for managing occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers engaged in material handling activities.","[Lee, Wonil] Washington State Dept Lab & Ind, Safety & Hlth Assessment & Res Prevent SHARP Prog, Olympia, WA 98504 USA; [Lin, Ken-Yu] Univ Washington, Dept Construct Management, Coll Built Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, Peter W.; Seto, Edmund Y.

Although effective utilization of analyzed image data requires accurate and timely detection of workers in complex, continuously changing working environments, the previous methods that detect construction workers still require improvement because of the poor detection performance. This study proposes the use of very deep residual networks to accurately and rapidly detect construction workers under varying poses and against changing backgrounds in image sequences. The architecture of construction worker detection in this study is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method is divided into two stages: extracting feature maps via very deep residual networks (ResNet-152) and bounding box regression and labeling from the original image via Faster regions with CNN features (R-CNN). The experiments were conducted at actual construction sites by acquiring 1.3-megapixel and 3.1-megapixel images from a movable digital camera to verify the proposed method for images from fixed and moving cameras. Faster R-CNN with ResNet-152 had accuracy, precision, and recall rates of 94.3%, 96.03%, and 98.13% for 3241 images, respectively. The proposed method processed 0.2 s per frame (i.e., 5 frames per second) on average. The results show that it is possible to accurately and rapidly detect multiple workers in construction site images by employing very deep residual networks without relying on limited assumptions about workers' postures, appearance, and background.","[Son, Hyojoo; Choi, Hyunchul; Seong, Hyeonwoo; Kim, Changwan] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 06974, South Korea","Kim, C (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",changwan@cau.ac.kr,"Son, Hyojoo/AAL-2182-2021; Kim, Changwan/X-6753-2018","Son, Hyojoo/0000-0002-5338-9799; Kim, Changwan/0000-0002-7342-0829",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2018R1D1A1B07049846],This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1D1A1B07049846).,,65,44,45,2,55,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

These studies mainly used predefined keywords to filter disaster- and damage-related social media data. However, many tweets containing predefined keywords (e.g., Hurricane Matthew) do not describe disaster events or their impacts. Meanwhile, previous sentiment analysis has not considered users' tweet frequencies, which can bring in data bias. These studies also lacked a baseline to reflect disaster impacts on the public's sentiment. Therefore, this research proposes to use supervised machine-learning approach to identify the damage-related social media data. It also analyzes users' tweet frequencies and introduces the annual average sentiment as the baseline to calculate the normalized sentiment. Compared with previous research, the authors' method has identified more damage-related tweets and demonstrated higher precision and recall. Correlation analysis is conducted between the social media index and the insurance claim data in Hurricane Matthew. The results show a strong and positive correlation between the DARR and claim data. A strong and negative correlation is found between sentiment and claim data. The adjusted R2 of the final regression model between damage and social media index demonstrates the feasibility of mining social media data for rapid damage assessment. The results can benefit crisis response managers in collecting real-time information and understanding timely situations during disasters.

Batch plant managers must consider both time and order factors in order to set an RMC truck dispatch schedule that successfully balances batch plant (supplier) and construction site (customer) priorities. This paper develops an optimization framework that integrates discrete event simulation (DES) and multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) to determine the solutions for RMC truck dispatch scheduling. The model takes into consideration uncertainties as well as unexpected situations such as truck breakdowns during delivery. In addition, the chaotic initialized opposition multiobjective differential evolution (COMODE) algorithm is used to optimize the dispatching schedule, which minimizes the total waiting duration both of RMC trucks at construction sites and of construction sites for trucks. A batch plant case study is used to illustrate the capability of the new DES-COMODE algorithm, with results showing that DES-COMODE-generated nondominated solutions can assist batch plant managers to set efficient truck dispatch schedules in a timely manner, a task both difficult and time-consuming using current methods. Results demonstrate that DES-COMODE is superior to four currently used algorithms, including the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), the multiple objective differential evolution (MODE), and the multiple objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Work sampling is a widely used method for this task, while suffers from low efficiency as only one worker is selected for each observation. Attentional selection asymmetry can also bias its uniform object selection assumption. Existing vision-based methods are primarily oriented towards recognizing single, separated activities involving few workers or equipment. In this paper, we introduce an activity recognition method, which receives surveillance videos as input and produces diverse and continuous activity labels of individual workers in the field of view. Convolutional networks are used to recognize activities, which are encoded in spatial and temporal streams. A new fusion strategy is developed to combine the recognition results of the two streams. The experimental results show that our activity recognition method has achieved an average accuracy of 80.5%, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art of activity recognition in the computer vision community, given the severe camera motion and low resolution of site surveillance videos and the marginal inter-class difference and significant infra-class variation of workers' activities. We also demonstrate that our method can underpin the implementation of efficient and objective work sampling.

The body of empirical evidence compiled so far suggests a negative answer to this question. Many explanations have been proposed, the most common being that current collaborative technologies do not yet have enough sophistication, or do not yet provide enough media richness, to enable knowledge sharing. This paper presents evidence that not only suggests that this explanation is wrong, but also that simple collaborative technologies can have a positive effect on knowledge sharing in organizations. This paper shows that, when combined with appropriate social processes, collaborative technologies may foster knowledge sharing. It does so by focusing on process improvement as a group process, and showing that: 1) process improvement is a catalyst to knowledge sharing and 2) a lean communication medium, namely e-mail conferencing, has a positive impact on knowledge sharing when used to support process improvement initiatives.","Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, ECollaborat Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Syst, Kowloon, Peoples R China","Kock, N (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Coll Business & Econ, ECollaborat Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",,"Davison, Robert M/E-4383-2013","Davison, Robert M/0000-0002-7243-3521",,,,80,30,30,1,18,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In this paper, qualitative data collected from a selection of retrospective UK-based construction projects of between approximately $2,000,000 and $8,000,000 show that the occurrence and effect of dysfunctional conflicts in projects remain a cause for concern despite changes in project management organization design. This paper provides a brief review of the more important mechanisms leading to dysfunctional conflict within these projects and illustrates the important role of people rather than procedures or systems in this process. In a later section of the paper, examples are drawn from one case in particular where interorganizational team building was included as a component of project organization design. The outcome of this case is consistent with the hypothesis that interorganizational team building, whether acknowledged as part of a formal partnering arrangement or not, can be used at the start of small-and medium-sized construction projects to reduce conditions of latent conflict and help engender a culture of cooperation and conflict resolution between the client, designers, utilities, and construction organizations.","Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Mech & Chem Engn, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland","Gardiner, PD (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Management, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,18,34,34,1,23,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",0742-597X,,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

A methodology for live capture and reuse of project knowledge was developed for the purpose and encapsulated into a software tool. A study was conducted of a medium-sized UK-based construction sector firm to investigate the use the software tool as the central strand of its knowledge management (KM) framework. The tool was subsequently designed to integrate with a staff profile system and an e-forum. The new system was intended to bridge the communication gap between the company's geographically dispersed offices by connecting the people together and, hence, facilitating the timely sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. Top management's commitment was found vital in the successful implementation of knowledge management and the nurturing of the desired supportive knowledge-sharing culture. To get the most through the implementation of knowledge management, the various knowledge management practices and relevant information systems of a construction organization need to be strategically integrated to improve the location, capture, and sharing of critical knowledge.

These big data potentially could assist in obtaining valuable administrative information and even explore new social phenomena. Traditional ways of collecting data, such as questionnaire surveys, are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, the use of social media affords the opportunity to extract information that might be of benefit to the construction industry in a responsive and inexpensive manner. To this end, this paper explores whether information and knowledge that would be valuable in the construction domain can be generated by analyzing social media data. Twitter was selected for an initial trial analysis because of its wide usage in the United States. Because they represent a majority of the construction users in Twitter, the following four user clusters were selected and analyzed: construction workers, construction companies, construction unions, and construction media. For each user identified in the four clusters, the 3,200 most recent Twitter messages were collected, which were analyzed from the following aspects: sentiment analysis, topic modeling, link analysis, geolocation analysis, and timeline analysis. Different data-analysis methods were used for the specific themes, such as Stanford Natural Language Processing (StanfordNLP) for sentiment analysis. The detailed findings, benefits, and barriers to incorporating social media data analytics in the construction industry, as well as future research directions, are discussed in this paper. For example, the sentiment analysis results indicated that construction workers tend to have a higher proportion of negative messages compared to the other clusters, which may prompt more attention to emotional guidance and understanding by construction companies and the public. This paper benefits academia by testing an alternative way of studying the construction population, which could help decision makers gain a better understanding of real-world situations in the construction industry.

Research has recently been carried out aimed at incorporating the effect of weather in project planning; but these studies have focussed on either a narrow set of weather variables, or a very limited range of construction activities or projects. A method for processing a country's historical weather data into a set of weather delay maps for some representative standard construction activities is proposed. Namely, sine curves are used to associate daily combinations of weather variables to delay and provide coefficients for expected productivity losses. A complete case study comprising the construction of these maps and the associated sine waves for the UK is presented along with an example of their use in building construction planning. Findings of this study indicate that UK weather extends project durations by an average of 21%. However, using climatological data derived from weather observations when planning could lead to average reductions in project durations of 16%, with proportional reductions in indirect and overhead costs.","[Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Smith, Stefan Thor; Lloyd-Papworth, Josephine Gwen; Cooke, Peter] Sch Built Environm, Reading, Berks, England","Ballesteros-Perez, P (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",p.ballesteros-perez@lboro.ac.uk,"Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo/I-6002-2015","Ballesteros-Perez, Pablo/0000-0002-4629-9664; Smith, Stefan/0000-0002-5053-4639",CIOB Bowen Jenkins Legacy Research Fund [BLJ2016/BJL.01]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/R008876/1],This work was supported by the CIOB Bowen Jenkins Legacy Research Fund under [Grant number BLJ2016/BJL.01]; and NERC with the Environmental Risks to Infrastructure Innovation Programme under [Grant number NE/R008876/1].,,51,20,20,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Prevalence rates for the infection in the South African construction industry exceed those of most other sectors. Little is known about the testing status of different categories of construction workers. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Bivariate tests of association and bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to explore demographic determinants of testing. The results indicate that (1) age, gender, employment type, and firm predict testing status, with older workers, females, permanent workers, and workers employed by firms with proactive intervention management more likely to have been tested than their counterparts; (2) education and race are not determinants of testing status; (3) workers aged 30 years and younger are the least likely to have been tested, particularly those 20 years and younger; (4) female construction workers are five times more likely to have been tested than males; (5) permanent employees are twice as likely to have been tested than temporary workers; and (6) workers employed by firms with comparatively more proactive HIV/AIDS intervention management are more likely to have been tested. This research identifies key variables that increase or decrease the probability of construction workers being tested at sites where VCT services are offered. Consequently, it confirms that the provision of VCT services is not in itself sufficient to address worker HIV incidence and prevalence rates. Rather, constructions firms need to be much more focused on the design of these services to ensure better targeting of subpopulations that are least likely to test. The identification of these key demographic variables highlights the value of shifting away from relatively standardized VCT services in the industry to those that are company- and perhaps even site-specific. This requires a degree of innovation in VCT services that not only is grounded in the construction sector but learns and adapts knowledge and practice from other sectors of society.

Colliery Spoil (CS) (minestone), a by-product of coal mining, is abundant in most parts of the world. It has potential as a construction material but it has not been fully appreciated. This is partly because colliery spoil is not easy to utilize, due a number of drawbacks. The major problems identified in attempts to utilize CS in construction include excessive wear, expansive behaviour, leaching of heavy metals and even radioactivity. Thus, to date, the bulk of the CS utilization is limited to isolated cases of highway embankments, backfilling of mines, quarries and other surface tips, or in extreme cases subjected to marine and other disposal. This paper reports on the scope of technological benefits of utilizing colliery spoil (CS) in low to medium strength concrete. There has been intermittent pursuance of the benefits of utilizing colliery spoil in the United Kingdom. However, there is still no well-accepted and/or positive feedback on any colliery-based technology and/or construction material, apart from that relating its use for bulk fill. This research was triggered by proximity of large supplies of both CS and stag in South Wales, UK, as well as the authors' interest in advances in sustainable construction. Two fractions of colliery spoil were mixed in equal proportions and used for concrete where the binder was PC, or novel binders comprising of either Wastepaper Sludge Ash (WSA) or WSA combined in equal proportions with Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), themselves industrial wastes or by-product materials. Compressive strength of compacted cube specimens was monitored for a period of up to 56 days of curing. Results indicate that the performance of systems incorporating CS and WSA were of very poor workability, but the resultant strength was within the low to medium category usable for blinding concrete and or for use in bound granular fill or foundations.","[Kinuthia, John; Snelson, David] Univ Glamorgan, Fac Adv Technol, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, M Glam, Wales; [Gailius, Albinas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania","Kinuthia, J (corresponding author), Univ Glamorgan, Fac Adv Technol, Llantwit Rd, Pontypridd CF37 1DL, M Glam, Wales.",jmkinuth@glam.ac.uk; dgsnelso@glam.ac.uk; albinas.gailius@st.vgtu.lt,,"Kinuthia, John/0000-0002-3273-846X",,,,17,21,22,2,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

None of the available standards explain the fundamental principle of applying RM to the situations that SMEs find themselves in. This difficulty is further exacerbated by a lack of management skills and knowledge in the adoption of RM tools or techniques to identify and analyse the business' risks.

However, research on the links between cultural factors and innovation in construction remains limited. The aim is to examine the underlying relationships between cultural factors and innovation propensity in small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in the construction sector. Innovation propensity is the degree to which an organization is inclined to achieve a state of innovativeness by design. In contrast, cultural factors manifest through the beliefs and values related to the various organizational aspects. The theoretical model and, subsequently, the survey instrument were developed from a review of the literature. The model was tested using survey data from SMEs in a regional area of Australia. The partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed to test the model. The results suggest that cultural factors account for 41% of the variance in innovation propensity. Specifically, market orientation focused on dealing with competitors had the strongest influence on innovation propensity. Other factors include business relationships based on trust and workforce capacity acquired through regular technology development for solving problems. However, the role of leadership, especially concerning championing projects, does not have a statistically significant impact on innovation propensity. A large proportion of construction SMEs, specifically in regional areas, will have a relatively small number of employees (up to four) and a flat organizational structure that reflects a short-term business orientation. In this context, the cultural notion of leadership does not have a significant direct relationship on innovation propensity. Therefore, policies encouraging market orientation, building relationship networks, and expanding workforce capabilities might be more effective in improving innovation propensity in construction SMEs than policies directly and solely focused on developing leadership skills.","[Lijauco, Fred] Tasmanian Bldg & Construct Ind Training Board, 2 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia; [Gajendran, Thayaparan; Brewer, Graham] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Rasoolimanesh, S.

A first step towards strengthening resilience at a human scale involves appreciating, caring for and repairing the longstanding ecological relationships that have supported life over the millennia. The capacity to appreciate these relationships has, however, been diminished by a utilitarian positioning of natural environments by economic science. Ecologists have gone further in capturing the interdependence of economies and ecologies with the concept of socio-ecological resilience. Of concern, however, is the persistence of a vision of an economy ordered by market determinations in which there is no role for ethical negotiation between humans and with the non-human world. This paper reframes economy-ecology relations, resituating humans within ecological communities and resituating non-humans in ethical terms.

The current study focussed on assessing the level of thermal stress both in and outdoors towards finding measures to reduce overheating in spaces within the Savannah climatic region of Ghana through a four-stage approach. Design/methodology/approach - A four-stage approach has been used for the study; thus, a thermal comfort analysis based on physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), overheating assessment, a subjective thermal responses/evaluation of residents and a simulation effort to improve comfort. Findings - There was an indication of moderate cold stress to slight cold stress on the coolest day (28th December). On the warmest day (12th April), however, the indoor environment had exceedance and severity of overheating of at least 56% and 38-degree hours. The acceptable comfort range and comfort temperatures of occupants of buildings in the study area have been determined to be 25.5-33 degrees C by the thermal sensation survey. Meanwhile, the simulation showed that a 200% increase in thermal mass, exterior wall insulation and roof extension and insulation has the potential to generate a reduction of 18% in overheated hours. Originality/value - The paper unearths the flagrant disregard for thermal comfort in an attempt of copying blindly architecture from Southern Ghana by the affluent within the Savannah Region. Again, data provided prove that indeed human activities have worsened the plight of inhabitants through materials as well as construction methods.","[Koranteng, Christian] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Architecture, Kumasi, Ghana; [Simons, Barbara] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Manu, Frederick Wireko] Bldg & Rd Res Inst, Kumasi, Ghana","Simons, B (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",christiankoranteng@yahoo.co.uk; nanaakuaayebea@yahoo.co.uk; fwirekomanu@gmail.com,,,,,,65,0,0,1,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework to evaluate the seismic resilience of an integrated system consisting of the community and its civil infrastructure systems is proposed. Specifically, an agent-based model of the recovery process of civil infrastructure systems is incorporated into a previously developed compositional supply/demand seismic-resilience quantification framework. The proposed model represents the behavior of the operators of civil infrastructure systems as they strive to recover their functionality in the aftermath of an earthquake as well as their mutual interactions and interactions with the community to which they provide services. A case study of the seismic resilience of a virtual system consisting of electric power supply system, transportation system, and the community (EPSS-TS-community system) is conducted using the proposed framework. A parametric investigation is carried out to examine the effect of different earthquake magnitude scenarios as well as different behaviors of the involved agents and their interaction on the seismic resilience of the EPSS-TS-community system. It was demonstrated that the proposed agent-based modeling approach is effective in representing the interactions among different participants in the recovery process. It was also revealed that timely and well-planned intervention in the recovery process can be very effective in alleviating the postearthquake lack of resilience resulting from the insufficient supply of civil infrastructure services to meet the community's demands. Therefore, the proposed framework could be employed to formulate the recovery trajectory of the intertwined sociotechnical system subjected to different earthquake scenarios. The interplay among different agents, as well as the interdependence among civil infrastructure systems, is found to profoundly shape the recovery path for this integrated EPSS-TS-community system.","[Sun, Li] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Creat Machines Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Stojadinovic, Bozidar] Eidgenoss Tech Hsch Zurich, Inst Struct Engn, Chair Struct Dynam & Earthquake Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sansavini, Giovanni] Eidgenoss Tech Hsch Zurich, Inst Energy Technol, Lab Reliabil & Risk Engn, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Sun, L (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Creat Machines Lab, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ls3522@columbia.edu; stojadinovic@ibk.baug.ethz.ch; sansavig@ethz.ch,"Sansavini, Giovanni/F-1508-2015","Sansavini, Giovanni/0000-0002-8801-9667; Stojadinovic, Bozidar/0000-0002-1713-1977",China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) ZurichETH Zurich; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission,"The financial support provided by China Scholarship Council (CSC), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, and Swiss National Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.",,42,10,10,3,50,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Eco-feedback systems are taking advantage of data streams from advanced metering infrastructure and are being widely implemented with the goal of increasing engagement in more sustainable behavior. However, the effectiveness of eco-feedback systems at an urban scale largely depends on how the information is communicated to and visualized by various communities. Advanced visualization technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), have proven to be efficient tools in information communication and visualization in diverse fields and present a promising opportunity in information representation for eco-feedback studies at scales larger than a single building. This paper examines the effectiveness of a VR-integrated community-scale eco-feedback system deployed across 54 buildings on Georgia Tech's campus by integrating 15-min increment energy consumption data into an interactive VR platform of the campus and conducting a user testing experiment on visualization characteristics, such as immersion, presence, involvement, and simulator sickness, along with system usefulness, that play a decisive role in users' preference and perceived energy-saving motivation toward the two systems. Yet, participants indicated polarized preferences for the two types of systems. This finding suggests that to increase the effectiveness of energy feedback at the urban scale as open urban energy data become more available, eco-feedback systems need to incorporate the specific preferences of the communities receiving feedback or be designed capable of displaying energy feedback that meets users' diverse preferences. In doing so, we may capitalize on the increasing data richness of energy consumption information in cities to more effectively encourage energy-saving behavior and meet the sustainability targets set by city governments.","[Xu, Lei; Francisco, Abigail; Taylor, John E.; Mohammadi, Neda] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Taylor, JE (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",xulei_1215@gatech.edu; afrancisco8@gatech.edu; jet@gatech.edu; nedam@gatech.edu,,,China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201806260269]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1837021],"This material is based on work supported by the China Scholarship Council (No. 201806260269) and the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1837021.

Practice and Social Learning theories are used as a lens through which to explore the available redundancy in housing and home environments to help prevent performance failure through unexpected circumstances or in response to varying user needs. Findings from an in depth UK housing case study show how redundancy is linked with the capacity to share resources and to learn both individually and collectively as a community. Such learning in relation to resilient low-carbon living is shown to be co-produced effectively through participatory action research. The benefits of introducing extra redundancy in housing design and community development to accommodate varied user's understanding and preferences are discussed in relation to future proofing, value and scalar issues. Recommendations include better understanding of the design, time and monetary contribution needed to implement social or technical redundancy. These costs should be evaluated in context of savings made through greater resilience achieved.","[Stevenson, Fionn] Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Baborska-Narozny, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Ul B Prusa 53-55, PL-50317 Wroclaw, Poland; [Chatterton, Paul] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Stevenson, F (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",f.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk; magdalena.baborska-narozny@pwr.edu.pl; P.Chatterton@leeds.ac.uk,"Baborska-Narozny, Magdalena/AAL-2453-2021","Baborska-Narozny, Magdalena/0000-0001-6860-5186; Stevenson, Fionn/0000-0002-8374-9687",Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme through the BuPESA project [PIEF-GA-2012-329258],This research was supported by a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme through the BuPESA project [grant number PIEF-GA-2012-329258].,,62,12,13,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The importance of communities as project stakeholders is widely recognized in the project management literature, but there is little empirical research to help project managers understand how to effectively engage with communities to prevent protests developing and escalating. Contributing to the emerging 'Relationship Approach' in project management theory which focusses on communities as legitimate stakeholders in projects, this paper draws on theories of collective identity and social capital to present an ethnographic analysis of community action against a large-scale and highly controversial construction project in Australia. The results show that dealing with community protest is a complex and dynamic challenge for project managers due to the anarchic and self-organising properties of community-based protest groups. It is concluded that effective community engagement strategies require project managers to adopt trust-building strategies early in projects and an intimate understanding of community concerns and social structures.

We posed the question Why would busy, dispersed, knowledgeable professionals want to join and participate in a deliberately organised CoP? Our 2-year collaborative action study allowed us to observe the CoP and its membership at close range.

With rising importance of the RMAA sector in many developed societies, safety of RMAA works has begun to draw attention. Many RMAA contracting companies are small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that do not have comprehensive safety management systems. Existing safety legislation and regulations for new construction sites are not fully applicable to RMAA works. Instead of relying on explicit and well-established safety systems, tacit safety knowledge plays an extremely important role in RMAA projects. To improve safety of RMAA works, safety knowledge should be better managed. However, safety knowledge is difficult to capture in RMAA works. This study aims to examine safety management practices of RMAA contracting companies to see how safety knowledge of RMAA projects is managed. Findings show that RMAA contracting companies undertaking large-scale RMAA projects have more initiatives of safety management. Safety management of small-scale RMAA works relies heavily on the motivation of site supervisors and self-regulation of workers. Better tacit knowledge management improves safety performance. To enhance safety capability of RMAA contracting companies, a knowledge sharing culture should be cultivated. The government should provide assistance to SMEs to implement proper safety management practices in small-sized projects. Potentials of applying computer software technology in RMAA projects to capture, store, and retrieve safety information should be explored. Employees should be motivated to share safety knowledge by giving proper recognition to those who are willing to share. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","[Hon, Carol. K.

Among the life cycle costs of wind farms, operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts for 25-30%, and an efficient strategy for management of turbines can significantly reduce the O&M cost. Wind turbines are subject to fatigue-induced degradation and need periodic inspections and repairs, which are usually performed through semiannual scheduled maintenance. However, better maintenance can be achieved by flexible policies based on prior knowledge of the degradation process and on data collected in the field by sensors and visual inspections. Traditional methods to model the O&M process, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), have limitations that do not allow the model to properly include the knowledge available and that may result in nonoptimal strategies for management of the farm. Specifically, the conditional probabilities for modeling the degradation process and the precision of the observations are usually affected by epistemic uncertainty. Although MDPs and POMDPs are formulated for fixed transition and emission probabilities, the Bayes-adaptive POMDP (BA-POMDP) framework treats those conditional probabilities as random variables and is therefore suitable for including epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, a novel learning and planning method is proposed, called planning and learning in uncertain dynamic systems (PLUS), within the BA-POMDP framework that can learn from the environment, update the distributions of model parameters, and select the optimal strategy considering the uncertainty related to the model. Validating with synthetic data, the total management cost of a wind farm using PLUS is shown to be significantly less than costs achieved by a fixed policy or through the POMDP framework. The preliminary results show the promise of the proposed methodology for optimal management of wind farms.

Building upon these, a cash flow calculation methodology for projects including activities with fuzzy durations and/or costs is proposed in this paper. According to the proposed approach, the project cash flow is represented by an S-surface (as opposed to the traditional S-curve) ensuing by connecting S-curves at different risk possibility levels. The methodology is exemplified by estimating the working capital requirements in a real world road construction project. Furthermore, the benefits of the methodology and its subsequent computerization are discussed. It is believed that the proposed approach may also be useful for both evaluating project proposals during feasibility studies and for performing earned value analysis for project monitoring and control.

We argue that organizations have different degrees of temporariness depending on the following five TO dimensions: temporal duration, nature of the task, team composition, hierarchy, and coordination. Considering the TO dimensions and varying degrees of temporariness, we propose a person-environment (P-E) fit model. The model comprises three levels - organizational-, group-, and job-oriented - and relates personal attributes to the TO dimensions. We contribute to theory by developing a set of propositions on the relationships between personal attributes and organizational-, group-, and job-oriented factors of the work environment in TOs. In doing so, we also extend research on P-E fit to temporary work environments. The model provides a theoretical basis for future empirical research on human resource management in TOs as well as criteria for practitioners involved in decisions on the staffing of temporary teams.","[Goetz, Nicolas; Freisinger, Elena] EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, Burgstr 5, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany; [Wald, Andreas] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Postboks 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway","Goetz, N (corresponding author), EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, Burgstr 5, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",nicolas.goetz@gmx.net; andreas.wald@uia.no; elena.freisinger@ebs.edu,,,,,,98,0,0,15,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0263-7863,1873-4634,,INT J PROJ MANAG,Int.

Specifically, it analyses environmental parameters and contrasts participants' self-reported answers to cross-sectional and retrospective questionnaires. To this end, data were collected for one day in winter and one day in summer, in eighteen office buildings in the cities of Concepcion and Santiago. The results show that the average operative temperatures are 22.2 degrees C in winter and 23.5 degrees C in summer. 80.5% of the occupants declared their productivity to be normal on the cross-sectional survey. However, on the retrospective survey, 82.7% said that their productivity is affected by the thermal environment. To reveal the interrelationships between perceived productivity and the thermal environment, a categorical principal components analysis was carried out. It demonstrated that there is only a relationship between cross-sectional and retrospective productivity in winter. Subsequently, a good-fitting structural equation model was created, which showed that different relationships exist between the variables. These findings could enable organizations and design professionals to better understand occupants' perceived productivity in relation to thermal conditions in office buildings.","[Soto Munoz, Jaime] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Bldg Sci, Concepcion, Chile; [Trebilcock Kelly, Maureen] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Architectural Theory & Design, Concepcion, Chile; [Flores-Ales, Vicente] Univ Seville, Architectural Bldg 2, Seville, Spain; [Ramirez-Vielma, Raul] Univ Concepcion, Dept Psychol, Concepcion, Chile","Munoz, JS (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Bldg Sci, Concepcion, Chile.",jsotom@ubiobio.cl,"; Trebilcock, Maureen/C-7148-2011; Ramirez-Vielma, Raul/P-8721-2014; FLORES-ALES, VICENTE/G-4860-2017","Soto Munoz, Jaime/0000-0002-5767-6189; Trebilcock, Maureen/0000-0002-1984-0259; Ramirez-Vielma, Raul/0000-0001-9231-4944; FLORES-ALES, VICENTE/0000-0003-4329-0020","Chilean Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1171497, 1201456]","This work was supported by the Chilean Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYT [grant numbers 1171497 and 1201456].",,86,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

It is conducted frequently during the time of plant construction, maintenance shutdown and new equipment installation. To find a safe and cost effective way of lifting, a team works for weeks or even months doing site investigation, planning and evaluations. This paper considers the lifting path planning problem for terrain cranes in complex environments. The lifting path planning problem takes inputs such as the plant environment, crane mechanical data, crane position, start and end lifting configurations to generate the optimal lifting path by evaluating costs and safety risks, We formulate the crane lifting path planning as a multi-objective nonlinear integer optimization problem with implicit constraints. It aims to optimize the energy cost, time cost and human operation conformity of the lifting path under constraints of collision avoidance and operational limitations. To solve the optimization problem, we design a Master-Slave Parallel Genetic Algorithm and implement the algorithm on Graphics Processing Units using CUDA programming. In order to handle complex plants, we propose a collision detection strategy using hybrid configuration spaces based on an image-based collision detection algorithm. The results show that the method can efficiently generate high quality lifting paths in complex environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates how organizational support cascades down to cultivate a group-level safety climate at two time points over a 2-year period through a relationship with an organization-level safety climate, supervisory safety-specific transformation leadership, and coworker support in a large US-based construction contractor. Structural equation modeling analysis on data from an online survey among 284 construction professionals shows, unlike prior research, that organizational support at one point in time does not directly predict a subsequent group-level safety climate. Instead, it affects the group-level safety climate through the mediation effect of supervisory safety-specific transformational leadership and organization-level safety climate and its moderating effect on the relationship between coworker support and group-level safety climate. Importantly, the results also suggest that safety-specific transformational leadership may be an even more important predictor of group-level safety climate than organization-level safety climate and coworker support. These results imply that organizational support could focus on empowering leaders to demonstrate safety-specific transformational leadership behaviors for the sake of promoting a group-level safety climate.","[Cheung, Clara Man] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, George Begg Bldg, Manchester M1 3BB, Lancs, England; [Zhang, Rita Peihua] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia","Cheung, CM (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, George Begg Bldg, Manchester M1 3BB, Lancs, England.",clara.cheung@manchester.ac.uk; rita.zhang@rmit.edu.au,"Cheung, Clara/ABH-8488-2020; Cheung, Clara Man/U-3827-2017","Cheung, Clara/0000-0002-8996-7351; Cheung, Clara Man/0000-0002-8996-7351",,,,70,4,4,5,21,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

The analysis of incidents is highly dependent on the quality of records. Problems in recording and the heterogeneity of incident data may create conflicts while analyzing the relationship between attributes. The objective of the study was to develop a novel model to predict the outcomes of construction incidents using Latent Class Clustering Analysis (LCCA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and determine necessary preventative actions. ANN has been used for many years to investigate the nonlinear relation between attributes and generate a logic between them. Herein, ANN was used to perform severity analyses of incidents utilizing real data, which were collected from various construction sites anonymously. Many factors affect the performance of ANN, including the size of the input and the heterogeneity of data. LCCA was used to seek out better performance and accuracy in ANN applications by reducing the heterogeneity of the incidents. By applying LCCA, attributes that possess different probabilities were clustered together and put into the ANN model. Then, the study concluded by providing a necessary preventative measure according to the result of incidents forecasted in advance. The research has two significant contributions. First, the hybrid model revealed promising results as the performance of the ANN-based predictive model was enhanced by addressing the heterogeneity of data. Second, the study presented professionals with practical preventative actions to avoid construction incidents according to the results of prediction.","[Ayhan, Bilal Umut; Tokdemir, Onur Behzat] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Ayhan, Bilal Umut] Harran Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-63510 Sanliurfa, Turkey","Tokdemir, OB (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",ayhan.umut@metu.edu.tr; tokdemir@metu.edu.tr,"Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/O-4718-2016","Tokdemir, Onur Behzat/0000-0002-4101-8560",,,,56,16,16,9,54,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In addressing this gap in research, a comparative safety climate survey of 515 construction operatives and managers in Australia, Indonesia, and China is presented using a standardized tool. The results highlight interesting similarities and differences between safety climate in each country and question taken-for-granted assumptions that safety climate in countries with relatively mature regulatory structures like Australia are more positive than in less developed countries like Indonesia and China. Results also highlight the intermediating effects of factors such as management commitment and cultural differences in shaping safety climate. Highlighting the potential value of theories of new institutionalism and cultural and ethical relativism, the paper concludes by raising important new practical, theoretical, and methodological questions about the merits and challenges of making international comparisons of safety climate, even when using standardized measurement tools.

However, the amount of knowledge on these evaluations is large, and the historical data of deep foundation engineering is imbalanced. Some adverse factors influence the quality and efficiency of evaluations using traditional manual evaluation tools. Machine learning guarantees the quality of imbalanced data classifications. In this study, three strategies are proposed to improve the classification accuracy of imbalanced data sets. First, data set information redundancy is reduced using a binary particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, a classification algorithm is modified using an Adaboost-enhanced support vector machine classifier. Finally, a new classification evaluation standard, namely, the area under the ROC curve, is adopted to ensure the classifier to be impartial to the minority. A transverse comparison experiment using multiple classification algorithms shows that the proposed integrated classification algorithm can overcome difficulties associated with correctly classifying minority samples in imbalanced data sets. The algorithm can also improve construction safety management evaluations, relieve the pressure from the lack of experienced experts accompanying rapid infrastructure construction, and facilitate knowledge reuse in the field of architecture, engineering, and construction.","[Gong, Peisong; Huang, Yuanyue; Guo, Shengyu] China Univ Geosci WUHAN, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Haixiang] China Univ Geosci WUHAN, Mineral Resource Strategy & Policy Res Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Guo, HX (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci WUHAN, Mineral Resource Strategy & Policy Res Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",15101286@qq.com,,"Guo, Shengyu/0000-0001-9075-6511", [71801197];  [71573237];  [71874165],This work was supported by the < The National Natural Science Foundation of China > under Grant [number [71801197]; < The National Natural Science Foundation of China > under Grant [71573237]; and < The National Natural Science Foundation of China > under Grant [71874165].,,57,1,1,5,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Appropriate safety stocks can cope with uncertainty in both demand and supply yield, and improve the construction cost and productivity significantly. But the safety stock is usually determined by planner's experience or rough evaluation in management practice, which results in overstock or understock situations frequently. For changing this situation, this paper focuses on analysis of the stochastic inventory control problem of construction material, and develops a general safety-stock determination approach under nonstationary stochastic demand and random supply yield. Based on the linear-order release rule and modified base-stock definition, the inventory balance equation is developed. Then, a coverage random variable, which incorporates the complete information of outstanding orders, is defined to represent the outflows and inflows to stock over risk periods. Meanwhile, the fixed-point iteration method is adopted to calculate the time-varying safety-stock level under predefined service-level (nonstockout probability) constraint. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the relative performance of the proposed safety-stock approach and days of supply rule. The result demonstrates a considerable service improvement and inventory decrease of the safety-stock approach.","[Lu, Hui; Wang, Hongwei; Xie, Yong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, HW (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",luhuiwh@163.com; hwwang@hust.edu.cn; xyhust@163.com; heng.li@polyu.edu.hk,"wang, hongwei/G-3843-2013; Li, Heng/B-2821-2015","wang, hongwei/0000-0002-6206-7353; Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71390524, 71125001, 61174147]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71390524, Grant 71125001, and Grant 61174147.

Such an attempt is presented here for the specific challenge of cost prediction when undertaking seismic retrofitting of existing structures. Using multilinear regression analysis, 14 independent variables were analyzed to develop parametric models for predicting the retrofit net construction cost (RNCC). Half of these variables have never previously been studied in the literature. The required data for this study were collected from 158 earthquake-prone public schools in Iran, each having a framed structure. The backward elimination (BE) regression technique was used to identify any variables that made a statistically significant contribution to the RNCC. The suitability of the BE technique for this identification was examined and demonstrated using a number of model-selection criteria. Rather surprisingly, building age and compliance with the earliest practiced seismic design code were found to be insignificant predictors of the RNCC. As reflected by the BE technique, the significant predictors were building total plan area, number of stories, structural type, seismicity, soil type, weight, and plan irregularity. The causal analysis performed between the RNCC and these variables showed that the first two variables have the greatest influence on the determination of the RNCC. The primary contribution to the construction industry is the introduction of a simple double-log cost-area model for predicting seismic retrofit construction cost. The introduced model enables engineering consultants, managers, and policy makers to simply predict this cost at the early planning and budgeting stage of seismic retrofit projects.","[Jafarzadeh, R.; Wilkinson, S.; Gonzalez, V.; Ingham, J.

It attempts to understand the Quantity Surveyors' (QS) estimation accuracy in relation to public projects. This study analyses 83 projects of estimates and tender bids. The analysis includes three (3) estimating targets i.e. lowest bid, accepted bid and mean of the bids. To broaden the study, 344 QS involved in the procurement answered the questionnaires. Linear multiple regression analysis on project characteristics shows that project size, number of bidders, location and type of schools affect the bias. Contract period affects the consistency. The use of mean of the bids is the best-fit target to explain the bias in terms of adjusted R-2. The accuracy may improve if sufficient design information is available, proper cost planning and improving the application of historical cost data. As an alternative, the phenomenon of overestimation is resulted from government directive instruction, which could challenge the rational of accurate estimate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Currently, existing buildings and laboratories are the main sources for collecting occupancy related data. However, using such data for predicting the energy consumption of future buildings can create a considerable amount of uncertainties. Recent studies show that Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs) have the potential to generate design and context sensitive occupant-related data. However, extended observations (longitudinal data covering relevant spatial and temporal events) which are necessary for developing quantitative predictive models are impractical using conventional IVEs. To that end, the authors propose a Spatial-Temporal Event-Driven (STED) modeling approach to enable IVEs for longitudinal studies. Using a single occupant office as case study, two sets of occupancy and lighting data, from IVEs and a comparable physical environment (in-situ), were collected. The occupancy/lighting data was organized in form of state transitions at six events (i.e., arrival in the morning, leaving for and returning from a short leave, leaving for and returning from a long leave, and leaving at the end of a day). It was hypothesized that the probabilities of the occupancy/lighting state transitions in a given event across the two experimental environments (i.e. NE vs. in-situ) are not statistically different. Results revealed similar patterns at four of the six events (alpha = 0.05), except at the short leave events. Thereby, STED modeling enabled the potential viability of IVEs for extended observations and generating data to support predictive models. Clearly, more basic research is needed to make data collection using IVEs more effective including a better understanding of virtual cue design and participant's physiological and psychological conditions at the time of experiments.","[Saeidi, Sanaz; Chokwitthaya, Chanachok; Zhu, Yimin] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Sun, Ming] Nottingham Trent Univ, Res Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England","Saeidi, S (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",ssaeid1@lsu.edu; cchokw1@lsu.edu; yiminzhu@lsu.edu; ming.sun@ntu.ac.uk,,"Sun, Ming/0000-0002-7463-0246",Louisiana Board of Regents Award [LEQSF (2016-17)-RD-C-07]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1805914],"This research was supported by the Louisiana Board of Regents Award No. LEQSF (2016-17)-RD-C-07 and NSF grant CBET-1805914.

Compared with Lidar-based SLAM, the main concern with visual SLAM (vSLAM) is its effectiveness and robustness in challenging environments. As a major type of vSLAM algorithm, feature-based methods, including the state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM, rely on rich image features and a robust descriptor for matching feature correspondences across different image frames, which suffers from performance loss in environments with low-texture, low-structure areas (e.g., building corridors) or motion blur that are pretty common in practical applications. Regardless of being traditionally handcrafted or learned from recent data-driven methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), previous methods try to obtain an optimal fixed feature transform that works for any scenes. With the aim of improving tracking robustness in challenging environments, as opposed to such fixed feature presentation, this research proposes and explores a learning-based dynamic feature transform that is self-adaptive towards recently observed scenes, which we termed as Deep SAFT. This paper also presents the design details of an implementation of Deep SAFT working with ORB-SLAM and evaluates the modified algorithm on fifteen popular public dataset sequences. The valuation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of SAFT for improving the matching performance of learning-based descriptors. The proposed SAFT can be integrated with existing feature-based vSLAM algorithms to provide more robust locating service for applications either in the built environment (such as facility management) or on construction sites (such as construction site safety, construction progress monitoring, and infrastructure inspection).","[Xu, Lichao; Kamat, Vineet R.; Menassa, Carol C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Feng, Chen] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, New York, NY 10012 USA","Xu, LC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lichaox@umich.edu; cfeng@nyu.edu; vkamat@umich.edu; menassa@umich.edu,,"Feng, Chen/0000-0003-3211-1576",,,,85,4,4,8,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

However, successful implementation of such approaches largely depends on the ability to integrate and share disparate data and software resources distributed across different departments and, possibly, organizations. The development of integrated information models and software environments in various infrastructure domains, the key enablers for realizing the desired integration, are currently becoming the focus of many research efforts. This paper describes the development of integrated municipal information models, based on ISO spatial data standards, to support efficient data integration, sharing, and management. It also presents a federated multi-tier reference architecture to facilitate the development and deployment of integrated infrastructure management environments (IIME). Implementation of a prototype IIME that integrates heterogeneous data sources and applications into an open, coherent, and interoperable environment is also discussed. The prototype environment integrated a number of distributed data sources and applications to support several processes typically conducted within municipal sewer and water departments.

It examines the perceptions of practitioners about internship and explores the relevance of internships for professional careers in the sector. Design/methodology/approach - The research methods used were questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. The study focussed on careers such as architects, civil engineers, facility managers, project managers and quantity surveyors. Findings - It was found that quantity surveyors and civil engineers value internship the most and are more likely to hire those who interned with them. Project managers also value internships but to a lesser extent. Facility managers and architects value internship the least and are also least likely to offer positions to their ex-interns. It is not conclusive whether internships are absolutely necessary to increase undergraduates' employability upon their graduation. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to only five professions and focused on the perceptions of professionals and not the interns or academic supervisors. Practical implications - Recommendations are made to improve internship programmes in the BE sector. These include making internships compulsory for students who intend to pursue civil engineering and quantity surveying careers and extending the duration of internships to six months. Originality/value - The views of professionals in the BE sector are uncovered. Tertiary institutions can use the findings to improve their internship programmes and their students' employability upon graduation.","[Lian, Jonathan K.

With increasing applications being developed for domestic service robots, recent research emphasis has shifted to autonomous indoor robots. Route planning (determining optimal routes to visit multiple locations) and task allocation (optimally dividing the tasks assigned among a group of robots) are two of the critical aspects that have to be accomplished by single and multiple autonomous robotic systems. Previous studies have attempted to adapt existing algorithms used in outdoor logistics applications and modify them with context-specific assumptions, often leading to inefficient or suboptimal solutions. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a generalized framework to solve the route-planning and task-allocation problems for centrally located service robots charged with spatiotemporal tasks in complex built environments. A scenario analysis is conducted to compare the performance of existing algorithms with the developed approach for route planning in building-monitoring robots. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in a range of applications involving constraints on both the environment (e.g., path obstructions) and robot capabilities (e.g., maximum travel distance on single charge).

To fill the knowledge gap, this research was conducted to identify important influencing factors on fire safety on construction sites, as well as their relationships, through a questionnaire administered to 1,492 fire officers in South Korea. The authors divided the questions into three factors (building, fire, and human) to distinguish factors affecting construction site fire safety. For the majority of the factors, there was high agreement on the importance level of factors affecting fire safety during construction between administrative and field firefighters. However, perception disparity did exist. The authors identified the interrelationships between factors through path analysis and structural equation modeling. The paths of factors showed the highest direct relation between building and fire factors, and the human factor played a mediator role between human and fire factors. The study contributes to the overall body of knowledge by providing officers' insights into the factors contributing to fire safety on construction sites, as well as the quantification of the interrelationship among the factors, which will serve as the basis to develop effective safety measures, such as policies and regulations at both the project level and industry level, to address fire safety on construction sites.

A Stress-Strain Model (SS Model) has been developed based on the 'Four Cornerstones of Resilience', which can be used to characterize and assess the 'Resilience' of the management system by monitoring the relationship of demands or challenge events and the adaptive capacity of the organization to respond. 'Risk Management System (RMS)' is one of the key elements for construction safety. However, facing with the constantly changing site conditions, the existing RMS in fact cannot effectively prevent accidents. This is because the existing RMS is based on the assumption of static situations, some unforeseeable potential hazards which cannot be assessed by the risk assessment might happen later during work processes. To dealing with the dynamic nature of construction site, a dynamic system should be developed. By adopting the SS Model as the prototype, with modification based on the construction scenarios, a conceptual model, a risk SS Model has been developed.","[Fung, Ivan W.

Hazards that remain unrecognized, and as a result unmanaged, can potentially result in catastrophic and unexpected injuries. Therefore, proper hazard recognition is foundational to the success of any safety program. However, recent research has revealed that a large proportion of construction hazards remain unrecognized in construction projects. To improve hazard recognition performance, employers provide their workers with safety and hazard recognition training. Despite these efforts, desirable levels of hazard recognition have not been achieved, and the anticipated return on investment (ROI) from training has not been attained. Such failures in training efforts are partly because knowledge acquired through training programs is often not transferred or applied in the workplace. Subsequently, training efforts do not alter work practices or behavior once workers return to the field. Other reasons for training failure include improper training delivery and the adoption of low-engagement training methods. To advance theory and practice in hazard recognition, training transfer, and training delivery, the objectives of this study were to (1)identify training transfer elements that maximize the transfer of safety training, (2)evaluate the relative effectiveness of the identified training transfer elements in transferring safety knowledge gained through training programs, and (3)assess the interaction effect between training method (i.e.,high-engagement versus low-engagement training) and training transfer levels on hazard recognition performance. The objectives of the study were accomplished by gathering input from construction industry experts through interviews, questionnaire surveys, and the analysis of empirical data gathered from 51 case projects in the United States. The results of the study revealed that training efforts may be undermined if training transfer elements are not synergistically adopted. Specifically, the findings suggest that safety training is necessary, but is not sufficient to maximize training outcomes such as hazard recognition. To maximize safety training outcomes, employers must adopt training transfer elements along with high-engagement training methods. This study represents the first formal attempt to evaluate the role of training transfer elements in the construction context.","[Namian, Mostafa; Albert, Alex; Zuluaga, Carlos M.; Jaselskis, Edward J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA","Albert, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.",mnamian@ncsu.edu; alex_albert@ncsu.edu; cmzuluag@ncsu.edu; ejjasels@ncsu.edu,,"Namian, Mostafa/0000-0003-1375-8761; Zuluaga, Carlos M./0000-0001-8927-2819",,,,54,38,38,1,56,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The safety inspection process, however, suffers from several drawbacks that hinder the efficiency, effectiveness, and analytical learning capacity of the process. Dedicated tools for user-centered information and communications technology could significantly reduce such drawbacks. This paper discusses the use of an original two-step user-centered design approach to develop and evaluate an iPad application that aims to address such drawbacks and improve the day-to-day practices and management of safety inspections. Evaluation results indicate the usefulness and practicality of the application and identify innovative uses not previously envisioned. Furthermore, the developed tool allows consistent data collection that can eventually be used to aid the development of advanced safety and health data analysis techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Subsequently, by classifying claims in different cases, the most important ones are ranked in order to achieve a better understanding of claim management in each project. In this regard, a new index is defined, being able to be applied in a variety of projects with different time and cost values, to calculate the amount of possible claims in each project along with related ratios with respect to the cost and time of each claim. This study introduces a new model to predict the frequency of claims in construction projects. By using the proposed model, the rate of possible claims in each project can be obtained.

The scholarly literature largely assumes that networks of project activities are acyclical. PD projects are iterative, however, and the time-cost implications of managerial actions, such as activity crashing and overlapping, differ in this context. We build a rich model that accounts for activity overlapping, crashing, and iteration in the project's activity network. Using a bank of thousands of artificial but realistic test problems, we test the performance of several alternative work policies-managerial rules about when to start work and rework, and when to allow crashing and overlapping-and compare their time-cost implications. We find that the time-cost benefits of crashing and overlapping increase with increasing iteration. However, whereas crashing works well in combination with an aggressive work policy that does not seek to minimize iteration and rework, overlapping ironically works better with a work policy that defers rework. No single work policy dominates in all situations, although an aggressive policy that precipitates rework may often be worth its added cost. We distill our findings into a set of propositions that pave the way for further theory development in this area. Our results also illuminate useful heuristics for managers of PD projects.","[Meier, Christoph; Walter, Ulrich] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Aeronaut, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Browning, Tyson R.] Texas Christian Univ, Neeley Sch Business, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Yassine, Ali A.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Engn Management, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon","Meier, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Aeronaut, D-85748 Munich, Germany.",meier@combinatic.com; t.browning@tcu.edu; ali.yassine@aub.edu.lb; wal-ter@tum.de,"Browning, Tyson R/I-1430-2012",,"Neeley Summer Research Award Program from the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University; U.S. Navy, Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0739]; University Research Board Program at the American University of Beirut","The work of T.

Connected vehicle offers the possibility to exchange data with vehicles and infrastructure in an effort to improve safety. The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to evaluate the potential safety benefits of deploying a connected vehicle system on a traffic network in the presence of a work zone. The modeled connected vehicle system in the research reported in this paper uses vehicle-to-vehicle (VTV) communication to share information about work zone links and link travel times. Vehicles which receive work zone information will also modify their driving behavior by increasing awareness and decreasing aggressiveness. This paper also proposes a decaying average travel time dynamic route guidance algorithm which exhibits weighted information decay. Traffic microsimulation software is used to model the network and a C plugin is developed to implement connected vehicle in the simulation. The surrogate safety measure improved time to collision (TTC) is used to assess the safety of the network. Various market penetrations of connected vehicles were utilized along with three different behavior models to account for the uncertainty in driver response to connected vehicle information. The results show that network safety is strongly correlated with the behavior model used; conservative models yield conservative changes in network safety. The results also show that market penetrations of connected vehicles under 40% contribute to a safer traffic network, while market penetrations above 40% decrease network safety. The findings of the research reported in this paper indicate connected vehicle technology can have unintended consequences, as seen in decreased safety at high market penetrations, requiring researchers to develop additional applications to mitigate these effects.

Higher education is challenged to develop innovative strategies to help college students develop career-specific competency and accelerate the transition from novice to expert. Technology innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) have been successfully integrated into learning and training programs to create authentic learning experiences within simulated virtual learning environments to facilitate tacit knowledge acquisition and workplace expertise development, which traditionally takes years of empirical experience and apprenticeship training. This study aims to explore potential VR and MR interventions in construction education and workforce development. It is directed at enhancing understanding of key differences between novices and experts and how VR and MR may facilitate tacit knowledge acquisition and expertise development to address the current skills gap in the construction industry. A simulation of accessibility design review and assessment for a tiny house was conducted via VR and MR mock-ups with the participation of both student novices and professional experts to collect behavioral and perceptual data using instruments that included a think-aloud protocol, a pair of pre- and postsurvey questionnaires, and audio/video recordings. Comparative analyses were conducted, and the results indicated that student novices, despite their lack of expertise, demonstrated comparable patterns of behaviors and achieved design review outcomes similar to those of professional experts with the VR and MR mock-ups. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge by providing preliminary evidence of learning affordances of VR and MR in bridging experience-related gaps and suggesting opportunities for accelerating workplace expertise development among college students via technology intervention. These findings also have the potential to inform instructional design and pedagogical approaches that integrate VR and MR technology in undergraduate construction and engineering curricula.

Extensive empirical research in applied psychology has confirmed this relationship. However, rare efforts have been made to investigate the factors contributing to a favorable safety climate in construction research. As an initial effort to address the knowledge gap, this paper examines factors contributing to a psychological safety climate, an operationalization of a safety climate at the individual level, and, hence, the basic element of a safety climate at higher levels. A multiperspective framework of contributors to a psychological safety climate is estimated by a structural equation modeling technique using individual questionnaire responses from a random sample of construction project personnel. The results inform management of three routes to psychological safety climate: a client's proactive involvement in safety management, a workforce-friendly workplace created by the project team, and transformational supervisors' communication about safety matters with the workforce. This paper contributes to the field of construction engineering and management by highlighting a broader contextual influence in a systematic formation of psychological safety climate perceptions.

This paper proposes a model capable of computing an overall index that realistically reflects the safety level on any individual site due to the operation of tower cranes. The model integrates four modules: (1) nonsite-specific relative weights of safety factors, (2) measurement of the magnitude of each safety factor actually present on site, (3) scales to convert each measured magnitude into a value representing the potential risk generated by each factor present on site, and (4) multiplying factors to convert the cumulative risk generated by all factors into actual risk. The model was computerized and tested on two construction sites and the user interface for company and site data gathering was validated. The development of the model builds on expert judgment and as such, its potential application in other construction cultures would require due adjustments, which are made possible by its modular architecture and content transparency.

Tower cranes hoist and transport a variety of loads near and above people, working under crowded conditions, occasionally with overlapping work zones, and often under time, budget, and labor constraints. This work regime further increases the safety risk on sites that are inherently hazardous workplaces. This paper presents the results of a study that identified the major factors affecting safety in tower-crane environments and evaluated the degree to which each factor influences ongoing safety on site. Use of statistical data on accidents was ruled out as a source of information due to the countless number of incidents that go unreported, the common inability of statistics to provide root causes, and the questionability of statistics as a predictor of accidents. The research methodology was therefore based on comprehensive questioning of an expert team that included the safety managers and equipment managers of leading construction companies. With the limited resources available for safety improvement and accident prevention, greater attention must be paid by all parties involved to those factors evaluated as highly affecting site safety due to tower-crane work.","[Shapira, Aviad; Lyachin, Beny] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Lyachin, Beny] Siemens Transportat Turnkey Syst Ltd, IL-67021 Tel Aviv, Israel","Shapira, A (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",avishap@technion.ac.il,,,"Manof Fund for Safety and Hygiene at the Workplace, National Insurance Institute of Israel","The writers gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the equipment managers, safety managers, and project managers, whose experience and expertise played an indispensable role in the success of this study.

The productivity requirements dictate the need for efficient algorithms for mapping, exploration, and collision-free motion planning. While a large portion of the grit-blasting operation can be automated, a tele-operation is essential to deal with some difficult to access sections such as edges, complex corners, and surfaces which can only be approached through hole. A 3-dimensional virtual force field (3D-VF2) method is developed for capturing the relationship between the robot and its environment. A novel haptic force generation method and a workspace mapping algorithm allow intuitive interaction between the operator and the robot through haptic feedback. The strategies presented are verified in extensive simulations and experiments conducted on a steel bridge with a prototype grit-blasting robot. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It takes the example of road and rail and investigates their impact on South Korean manufacturing industries. To assess the cost structure and efficiency of investments in infrastructure, economies of scale, effects of infrastructure on variable cost and output, investment condition for infrastructure, and substitution and price elasticities are calculated. The divergence of infrastructure stocks from their static equilibrium levels influences production efficiency. Overall, investments in road and rail have positive effects on the manufacturing industries in Korea. This study expands the scope of existing studies by decomposing the internal rate of return (IRR) and the present value of benefit (B(PV)) into variable cost reduction, investment cost reduction, and rent. It was found that B(PV) checks only the magnitude of benefit, whereas IRR indicates the existence of efficiency by investigating total cost reduction and rent. Finally, by analyzing investment efficiency and changing benefit with respect to road and rail through the investment efficiency methodology that compares IRR with market interest rate, retrospective benefit-cost analysis is conducted.

The bibliometric analysis used as the method, compared to conventional literature reviews, reduces the likelihood of subjective judgments. The methodology used is based on a set of five research questions. To answer these, bibliographic coupling is used to analyze the publications datasets, specifically, co-citation networks, co-authorship networks, and the co-occurrence map of keywords. This review contributes to the field in raising awareness of the knowledge composition of BIM, GIS, and Web integration in the last decade, dominant research topics, the most recent trends, and the most pressing issues and use cases analyzed in the current studies related to BIM, GIS, and Web integration, thus identifying gaps and defining future research areas on the topic. The research shows that the number of developments focusing on BIM, GIS and Web integration has been continuously growing with a sudden increase after 2016. The study also revealed that the research work in this area consists of disjointed and fragmented research studies and has been conducted mainly in isolated clusters.

However, the lack of reality from miniature scenes has interfered with better scene imagination. The 3D representation and AR (Augmented Reality) representation can be considered as alternatives to address the limitation of the conventional method in scene imagination. However, their different features lead to two main issues: size difference and angular difference in orientation. The objective of this study is to address the question of an appropriate representation method that best supports the scene imagination. The experimental results showed that the AR representation was better than the 3D representation with respect to the accuracy of the scene imagination. Even though there may be still technical issues regarding time and task load to be addressed, the AR representation is a promising method for the scene imagination. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The monolithic behavior of concrete, differences in the geometric representation of structural members during the analysis and design stages, and design code requirements throughout the process add new dimensions to the problem. Additionally, especially in large projects, reinforced concrete structures are designed and detailed by several engineers simultaneously. These complexities can be resolved and the overall quality of the design can be improved by identifying information requirements for managing the design information between the design and detailing tasks and thus between structural engineers. In this paper, requirements for managing information for multiuser design and detailing of reinforced concrete frames are identified and a prototype information model has been implemented based on existing literature. The means of performing design computations on a standard basis and the requirements of a multiuser design have also been integrated into the abstraction of objects in the library.

However, traditional on-site safety inspection cannot fully address all challenges, particularly those with behavior-based safety (BBS) risks. To deal with these challenges, this study describes the novel use of the proactive construction management system (PCMS) with a third-party safety inspection program. The definition, abstraction and implementation processes of the PCMS-aided third-party inspection program are demonstrated and tested through a case study of the Shanghai Central Loop Pudong highway construction project with multi-section sites. Based on a before and after comparative study, quantitative and qualitative data are triangulated to evaluate variations in the effectiveness of third-party inspection programs with and without the PCMS aided at the macro, meso, and micro levels. Results indicate the usefulness of the novel idea that applies the PCMS as a part of a third-party inspection program to improve BBS risk control on certain risky sites and incorporates its feedback into third-party inspection on all section sites to strengthen the overall safety training, safety inspection, and timely safety risk responses. These results not only provide an increased understanding of the role of PCMS in the safety management of highway megaprojects and the guidelines required for its future application but also serve as a precursor to future research into megaproject safety management.","[Li, Yongkui; Hu, Yi] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Xia, Bo; Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Hu, Y (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",yi_hu@tongji.edu.cn,"Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012; Xia, Bo/J-1355-2012","Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; Xia, Bo/0000-0001-7694-4743; li, yongkui/0000-0001-7883-9269","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71501142, 71471136, 71390523, 71390524/71390520]; Shanghai Pujiang ProgramShanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC101]; Shanghai Pudong Road and Bridge Construction Corporation; Shanghai Pudong New Area Construction and Transportation Commission","The research described in the paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71501142, 71471136, 71390523 and 71390524/71390520), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (Grant No. 17PJC101) and the Shanghai Pudong Road and Bridge Construction Corporation.

This study identifies various directly or indirectly related determinants and their effects on safety performance of construction projects. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), this study empirically examines the effect of safety climate (SC), hazard management (HM), safety budget (SB), safety rules and regulations (SR), and safe work behavior (WB) of employees and workers on safety performance (SP) of projects. The unit of analysis of this study is a construction project. A questionnaire survey was conducted, and 230 responses were collected from different types of construction projects across India. The results provide evidence that safety climate, safety budget, and hazard management positively influence safe work behavior of employees and the safety performance of the project. Conversely, the SEM findings demonstrate that implementation of safety rules and regulations are positively but weakly related to safe work behavior of employees, although they positively and more strongly influence the safety performance of the project. On the basis of these empirical results, the study advocates allocating a sufficient safety budget to Indian construction projects. It also recommends considering the effects of the safety rules and regulations on safe work behavior of employees and workers while framing and revising them.","[Patel, D.

Systems thinking gives a unique opportunity to seek a balance between FPSO technical performance(s), with whole-cost; stakeholder decision-making is charged to align different fit-for-use design specification options' that address technical-motion(s), with respective life-cycle cost analyses (LCCA). Soft system methodology allows situation based analyses over set periods-of-time by diagnosing the problem-at-hand; namely, assessing the antecedents of life-cycle cost relative to FPSO subcomponent design alternatives. Alternative mooring-component comparisons for either new-build hulls or refurbished hulls represent an initial necessary consideration to facilitate extraction, production and storage of deep-water oil reserves. Coupled dynamic analysis has been performed to generate FPSO motion in six degrees of freedom using SESAM DeepC, while life-cycle cost analysis (LCAA) studies give net-present-value comparisons reflective of market conditions. A parametric study has been conducted by varying wave heights from 4 - 8 m to understand FPSO motion behavior in the presence of wind and current, as well as comparing the motions of turreted versus spread mooring design alternatives. LCCA data has been generated to compare the cost of such different mooring options/hull conditions over 10 and 25-year periods. Systems thinking has been used to explain the interaction of problem variables; resultantly this paper is able to identify explicit factors affecting the choice of FPSO configurations in terms of motion and whole-cost, toward assisting significantly with the front-end engineering design (FEED) phase of fit-for-purpose configured FPSOs, in waters off Malaysia and Australia.","[Nishanth, Rini; Kurian, V.

No evidence has been found in the literature of research about transaction costs in industrial construction engineering projects. The objective of this paper is to identify ex-ante and ex-post transaction costs in industrial engineering construction projects. To accomplish this, empirical research with 4 case studies was conducted with a large engineering firm in Brazil. This research not only identified transaction costs already found by others, dividing them into ex-ante and ex-post, but also identified that travel, RFP clarification, support to strategic decisions of the owner and knowledge transfer are transaction costs not previously identified in the researched literature but that are very relevant to the respective subject. 'therefore, this research confirms that transaction costs should be considered ex-ante and ex-post by owners and contractors in industrial construction engineering projects and enlightens academics and practitioners on ways to achieve the reduction of such costs.","[da Fonseca, Fabio Bellotti] Univ Nove Julho, Rua Vergueiro 235-249, BR-01504000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Vanalle, Rosangda Maria] Univ Nove Julho, Dept Ind Engn, Rua Vergueiro 235-249, BR-01504000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Camarotto, Joao Alberto] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ind Engn, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Vanalle, RM (corresponding author), Univ Nove Julho, Dept Ind Engn, Rua Vergueiro 235-249, BR-01504000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",rvanalle@uni9.pro.br,,"Vanalle, Rosangela Maria/0000-0001-8265-0231",Universidade Nove de Julho,The authors would like to thank Universidade Nove de Julho and the surveyed company for providing the required support needed for this research.,,46,4,4,1,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Crashing cost function was either assumed without much justification, or came from historical data of some real projects. As a result the conclusions of the papers can hardly be used to guide allocations of labor and equipment resources respectively. The authors believe Cobb-Douglas function provides a much-needed piece to modeling the cost functions in the construction time-cost tradeoff problem during the crashing process. We believe this new perspective fills a gap of existing time-cost tradeoff research by considering project duration, labor and equipment cost as parameters of the CobbDouglas production function. A case study was presented to show how the proposed framework works. Our conclusion is that introducing Cobb-Douglas function into time-cost tradeoff problem provides us extra capacity to further identify the optimal allocations of labor and equipment resources during crashing.","[Shen, Zhigang] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 MetroTech Ctr,RH408, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Shen, Zhigang; Hassani, Ashkan] Univ Nebraska, Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, 113 NH, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Shi, Qian] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Siping Rd 1239, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Shen, ZG (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 MetroTech Ctr,RH408, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.; Shen, ZG (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, 113 NH, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",shen@unl.edu,,,,,,54,4,4,1,16,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

Even though many countries' fire codes are not clear in spelling out the necessity for refuge floors, it is accepted within construction that such floors are essential in resisting fire, allowing users a means of escape and allowing emergency services a means of access to stricken buildings. This paper discusses the reasons behind providing refuge floors, while also considering related fire safety provisions, such as their enclosure behind fire-resistant construction or the protection of their openings behind a water curtain. Our discussion takes a tall building with balconies as a test example of refuge floors, running a hazard assessment based on Computational Fluid Dynamics assuming a fire of the broadly accepted level of 2 MW. The paper concludes that the design of the building's facade finally determines whether or not a refuge floor and associated fire safety provisions, such as a water curtain, can be waived. As the flat modelled used to store a high amount of combustibles up to 1135 MJm(-2), the breaking of large area of glass window could lead to a major conflagration. The consequences of a scenario with a fire of 25 MW are also discussed.","[Chow, Cheuk Lun] Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, Martin Ctr Architectural & Urban Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Chow, Wan Ki] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Ctr Fire Engn, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chow, CL (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Architecture, Martin Ctr Architectural & Urban Studies, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",bewkchow@poly.edu.hk,,"Chow, Wan Ki/0000-0001-8398-3126; CHOW, Cheuk Lun/0000-0001-5748-4331",,,,42,34,34,0,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

By identifying current utility locations and correlating utility-related information between ongoing and upcoming projects, UMSs can reduce the occurrence of unexpected delays and cost overruns resulting from unforeseen utility conflicts found during construction. This paper presents an analysis of a two-part survey of local agency professionals in the transportation industry, regarding perceptions of UMS cost and time benefits and implications associated with implementation. The paper evaluates two hypotheses regarding local agencies' perception on two key areas: (1) impact of UMS cost and time implementation requirements on implementation decisions; and (2) difference in cost and time benefits and implications for different types of local agencies. The study finds that despite its obvious potential benefits, UMSs are not being widely implemented at the local level because the cost to adopt them is perceived to be high. Additionally, this study found opportunities for improvement that may considerably advance UMS practices.

Consequently, several research studies have focused on this subject, and thus multiple models have been developed. Notwithstanding the conflicting findings of its predictive veracity, the 45-year-old time-cost model of Bromilow remains the baseline, to which the outcomes of most developed models are compared. However, the applicability of the original time-cost model to the construction industry in the State of Kuwait is yet to be determined. The objectives of this case study, therefore, are to examine the validity, and hence the applicability, of the time-cost model to estimate contract durations for building construction in the State, and to propose an alternative model, taking into consideration other potentially influential project scope variables on time performance. To this end, relevant data for 113 residential and 74 office buildings, which were completed during the period 2004-2010, were collected by a questionnaire survey and subsequently analyzed using both the time-cost model and a multiple linear regression model comprising the project construction area as well as the number of floors above and below ground. While the results obtained further affirm the predictive ability of Bromilow's time-cost model, a comparison between the outcomes of both models tested demonstrates that, on average, the multifactor model proposed is associated with an enhanced prediction accuracy of 16 and 14% for residential and office buildings, respectively, and therefore can be deemed more suitable for forecasting local construction duration for the building types investigated.

In the UK as in a number of other countries, there is a real danger that responses in anticipation of global warming and climate change - including growing reliance on air-conditioning - will increase energy demand and CO2 emissions even further. This is an appropriate moment to reflect on the history and future of comfort, both as an idea and as a material reality. Based on interviews and discussions with UK policy makers and building practitioners involved in specifying and constructing what will become the indoor environments of the future, four possible scenarios are identified each with different implications for energy and resource consumption. By actively promoting debate about the indoor environment and associated ways of life, it may yet be possible to avoid becoming locked into social and technical trajectories that are ultimately unsustainable. The aim of this paper is to inspire and initiate just such a discussion through demonstrating that comfort is a highly negotiable socio-cultural construct.","Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England","Chappells, H (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster LA1 4YD, England.",heather.chappells@tiscali.co.uk; e.shove@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Shove, Elizabeth Anne/0000-0002-4792-5479",,,,34,244,245,1,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Originality/value The system can operate with more accuracy or less cost, and CBR can be used to better understand the effects of factor interaction and variation during the developed system's process.","[Hyung, Won-Gil; Jo, Jung-Kyu] Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea; [Kim, Sangyong] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Architecture, Gyongsan, South Korea","Hyung, WG (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Gyongsan, South Korea.",beda@yu.ac.kr; sangyong@yu.ac.kr; jkjo@ynu.ac.kr,,,Yeungnam University Research Grant,This work was supported by the 2015 Yeungnam University Research Grant.,,62,4,4,5,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In addition, manufacturing a curve-shaped mold is difficult and requires a lot of labor. To solve this problem, a technology to manufacture molds made of phase-changing materials (PCMs) that can be semipermanently reused to produce various types of curved shapes was developed. However, because of the characteristics of the PCM mold materials, crystallization occurs within the mold, which increases cooling times and causes deformation in the mold due to shrinkage. This paper describe the development of a composite phase-changing material mold for quality production of free-form concrete panels, and this composite is used to solve the problems mentioned previously. The composite PCM mold developed herein does not induce crystallization, which reduces the cooling energy and cooling time by 50% or more, and improves the solidification shrinkage rate to 95% or better. The composite described in this paper will help increase the productivity of free-form concrete members and reduce production costs.

Identification of project performance influencing factors is important for selecting a project delivery method. The measurement of project performance is typically attributed to the cost, schedule, and quality dimensions, where the cost growth typically plays a substantial role. The cost growth in a project is influenced by multiple project characteristics, including project size, project complexity, project type, delivery risks, and other variables. This study identifies multiple directly or indirectly related determinants and their effects on the cost growth of a DB project. A total of 118 DB highway projects across the US were examined. An empirical investigation was conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the effect of project complexity, delivery risk, project types, and facility types on project cost growth. An exploratory factor analysis was initially conducted to identify the critical risk factors related to DB construction projects. Results of the SEM analysis indicated that project complexity had a statistically significant direct effect on the cost growth of a DB project. Other factors, including delivery risks, facility type, and project type, demonstrated an indirect effect on the project cost growth. The findings contribute to the project delivery body of knowledge by identifying both direct and indirect factors affecting cost growth of DB highway projects. The results of this study may help practitioners create more accurate estimates and better manage risk for DB projects by identifying the critical risk factors and including the required contingency funds for the project.","[Mathew, Sharon A.; Nguyen, Phuong H.

Grey relational analysis (GRA) is applied twice to address the challenges associated with many variables. Finally, a case study is conducted to validate the reliability of the proposed method.

Whereas ergonomic interventions are suggested to be an effective approach to mitigate such routine exertion, these ergonomic interventions should be task specific because of the unique characteristics of each trade (such as rebar work; a construction trade with a high prevalence rate of MSDs). Despite numerous potential interventions available for rebar workers, none of them has been widely adopted, especially in the Asian market. After considering various reasons impeding their broad usage, the authors coined a simple ergonomic solution by attaching a low height domestic stool to the pants of rebar workers. This would allow them to sit and work instead of squatting, which is the most preferred posture in Asian cultures for working at ground level. The novel intervention was tested against squatting for various physical outcomes (i.e., muscle activity, neuromuscular fatigue, trunk kinematics and lower extremity blood circulation) and self-perceived discomfort, using a simulated rebar tying task in a laboratory. These findings demonstrate that the intervention has beneficial effects on both physical and subjective outcomes, and has a great potential in reducing workrelated MSDs among Asian rebar workers. Additionally, the current study highlights that ergonomic interventions in the construction industry should be derived based on both the characteristics of specific construction trades and culture of workers.

Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist.

This study proposes the use of an artificial intelligence approach, the Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM), to improve cost estimation accuracy. The advantages inherent in Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks are incorporated into the EFNIM, making this model highly applicable to identifying optimal solutions for complex problems. Furthermore, this paper presents Evolutionary Web-based Conceptual Cost Estimators (EWCCE) obtained by integrating EFNIM, WWW, and historical construction data to assist in project management.

While the predominant prevention strategy relies on passive approaches (e.g.,guardrails), research on proactive measures is lacking, which may reduce the incidence of FAs in high-risk construction trades. Literature suggests that rebar work is one of the foremost FA-prone construction trades. Since rebar workers spend hours in rebar tying postures with periodic postural transitions, they hypothetically are at risk of posttask loss of balance. While recent research showed that a sitting stool could significantly alleviate physical discomfort during rebar tying, the current study aimed to investigate temporal changes in standing balance (using a force plate) after simulated rebar tying in squatting, stooping, and stool-sitting while the respective postural load during rebar tying was quantified by electromyography and oximeters. Results demonstrated that stool-sitting resulted significantly better posttask standing balance than squatting or stooping, which might be attributed to differential postural loadings. Overall, the findings reported herein underpin the importance of using safety informatics to proactively analyze task-specific fall hazards, to monitor workers' balance, and to implement proper prevention strategies for workers at risk of falls.","[Umer, Waleed] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZN1002, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Heng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Room ZS734, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Grace Pui Yuk] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Rehabil Sci, Room ST505, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Arnold Y.

This paper aims to understand how construction personnel perceive safety risks in China as compared with those in Australia. Postal questionnaire surveys were used to collect data on safety risk perceptions from the two nations. The safety risk factors were assessed using a risk significance index based on the likelihood of occurrences and the impacts on safety performance. The survey results revealed that in China the main perception of safety risks came from human-and/or procedure-related issues, with low/no safety education paramount, followed by inadequate fire prevention and electrical prevention procedures, etc. In contrast, the major safety risks perceived in Australia were related to the environment and physical site conditions with contamination of land, water and air ranked first, followed by unforeseen excavation of soil, etc. To minimize construction safety risks in China, this paper suggests that the government should develop collective legislation and safety protection procedures, and enforce safety education and training to all site participants. Risks related to environmental and site conditions were generally realized by the Australia construction industry, which were not highly acknowledged in China. This may also bring imminent attention in this regard to the Chinese government.","[Zhang, Guomin] RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Zou, Patrick X.

Nineteen senior construction equipment and safety experts were interviewed and led through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to provide their assessments on the relative importance of safety factors obtained in an earlier study. The results accentuate the dominance of the crane operator and general superintendent on the site safety scene and play down the contribution of classic site hazards such as power lines. Quantitative measuring of safety, such as reflected in the weights obtained in this study, is important in communicating safety requirements and focusing the limited resources available for safety improvements. These factor weights are also deemed to be a vital component in the development of a comprehensive model that will allow the computation of safety indices for individual construction sites employing tower cranes. It is expected that the methodology can then be adopted for addressing other site safety issues as well.","[Shapira, Aviad; Simcha, Meir] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Simcha, Meir] Plaza Ctr Hungary, H-1062 Budapest, Hungary; [Simcha, Meir] Plaza Ctr Serbia & Balkans, Belgrade, Serbia","Shapira, A (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",avishap@technion.ac.il,,,Manof Fund for Safety and Hygiene at the Workplace; National Insurance Institute of Israel,"The writers gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the equipment and safety professionals, whose experience and expertise played an indispensable role in the success of this study.

Pavement maintenance activities, such as resurfacing, account for millions of tons of the GHG emissions annually in the United States. Optimizing pavement resurfacing activities allows for the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of pavement maintenance. A framework is proposed for estimating the relationship between GHG emissions from pavement resurfacing activities and pavement cracking-threshold policies, where cracking is the trigger distress. Cracking threshold is the maximum percentage cracking level a pavement is allowed to reach before an asphalt overlay is applied. The data set used in the case study was obtained from the Washington State Department of Transportation. The results show that for a planning horizon of 10 years, the optimal cracking thresholds for minimizing costs and GHG emissions are very close to each other.","[Ogwang, Allan; Horvath, Arpad] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Madanat, Samer] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Ogwang, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ogwang@berkeley.edu; samer.madanat@nyu.edu; horvath@ce.berkeley.edu,,,University of California Transportation Center (UCTC) faculty research grant,"This research was funded by a University of California Transportation Center (UCTC) faculty research grant to the second and third authors.

The problem manifests itself as the optimization of total costs of construction projects that consist of indirect project costs and individual activity costs. The trade-off occurs as project duration and, as a result, indirect project costs decrease with reduced individual activity duration. This reduction in individual activity duration is achieved by increasing resource allocation to individual activities, which increases their costs to completion. Historically, metaheuristic solutions have been applied to small-scale problems due to computational complexities and requirements of larger networks. Findings in this article demonstrate that the metaheuristic approach is highly effective for solving large-scale construction TCT problems. A custom genetic algorithm (GA) is developed and used to solve large benchmark networks of up to 630 variables with high levels of accuracy (<3% deviation) consistently using computational power of a personal computer in less than 10 min. The same method can also be used to solve larger networks of up to 6,300 variables with reasonable accuracy (similar to 7% deviation) at the expense of longer processing times. A number of simple, yet effective, techniques that improve GA performance for TCT problems are demonstrated, the most effective of which is a novel problem encoding, based on weighted graphs, that enables the critical path problem to be partially solved for all candidate solutions a priori, thus significantly increasing fitness evaluation. Other improvements include parallel fitness evaluations, optimal algorithm parameters, and the addition of a stagnation criteria. This article also presents some guidelines of optimal algorithm parameter selection through a comprehensive parameter sweep and a computational demand profile analysis. Moreover, the methods proposed in this article are based on open source development projects that enable scalable solutions without significant development efforts. This information will be beneficial for other researchers in improving computational efficiency of their solution in addressing TCT problems.

Proactive safety measures such as safety perception and safety detection capability of employees play an important role in improving the safety performance. This study was initiated by three research questions related to (1) the measurement indicators of employees' cognitive load in recognizing safety hazards; (2) site condition factors (e.g., brightness) that can affect subjects' cognitive load; and (3) the quantification of the effects of these site factors on cognitive load. An eye-tracking experimental approach was adopted by recruiting a total of 55 students from construction management or other civil engineering disciplines to visually search hazards in 20 given site scenes. These site scenes were defined by a combination of three different categories, namely distinctiveness of hazards, site brightness, and tidiness. Quantitative measurements of experimental participants' visual search patterns were obtained from data captured by the eye-tracking apparatus. Based on metrics related to experimental participants' fixation, visual search track, and attention map, these measurements were computed to evaluate participants' cognitive load in detecting hazards. Descriptive statistical comparisons analyzed these metrics under predefined categories of site conditions, i.e., distinctness versus obscurity/blurriness, brightness versus darkness, and tidiness versus messiness. The findings revealed that distinct site conditions reduced participants' time in saccades to search hazards but did not improve the accuracy rate of first fixation; messy sites with disorganized items increased participants' cognitive load in detecting hazards in terms of all five measurement items (i.e., accuracy rate of first fixation, fixation count, intersection coefficient, fixation duration, and fixation count in the attention center); the effect of increased brightness on-site needs further studies to determine the optimal balance of brightness level and allocation. Recommendations based on the findings were provided to enhance safety education in terms of site hazard distinctiveness, brightness, and housekeeping best practice. This study extended a few prior studies of adopting eye-tracking technology for safety monitoring by evaluating the impacts of site conditions on participants' cognitive load, which was linked to their hazard detection performance. The study provided insights for evaluating construction employees' hazard detection capabilities to enhance safety education. Future work is proposed to evaluate employees' safety hazard detection pattern under dynamic construction scenarios.","[Han, Yu; Yin, Zhenzhen; Zhang, Jingjie] Jiangsu Univ, Fac Civil Engn & Mech, 301 Xuefu Rd, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jin, Ruoyu] London South Bank Univ, Sch Built Environm & Architecture, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 0AA, England; [Yang, Tong] Middlesex Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, London NW4 4BT, England","Jin, RY (corresponding author), London South Bank Univ, Sch Built Environm & Architecture, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 0AA, England.",hanyu85@yeah.net; 735963289@qq.com; ujszjj1991@163.com; jinr@lsbu.ac.uk; t.yang@mdx.ac.uk,"Yang, Tong/K-1547-2016; Jin, Ruoyu/A-8520-2017","Yang, Tong/0000-0002-1254-5628; Jin, Ruoyu/0000-0003-0360-6967",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [20YJAZH034]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51408266]; 16th Talent Summit Program of Six Major Fields in Jiangsu Province [SZCY-014]; Foundation of Jiangsu University [14JDG012],"This research is supported by MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 20YJAZH034), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51408266), the 16th Talent Summit Program of Six Major Fields in Jiangsu Province (Grant No. SZCY-014), and the Foundation of Jiangsu University (Grant No. 14JDG012).",,57,5,5,21,75,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

While safety looks to the construction workers need to work in a safe environment, productivity affects the project's profitability and is of a paramount importance from the project owner's view. The different perspective to the safety and productivity from these two major players in construction projects poses a potential for the conflict between the two. This problem can be fundamentally addressed by methods concurrently improving project safety and productivity. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach To this aim, a discrete event simulation (DES) based framework applicable was proposed for complex and hazardous operations. The utility of the framework was tested using a case study of an eight-story residential building in the north-east part of Tehran, Iran. The excavation and stabilization operation was identified as the most hazardous and critical operation in this case. The framework could improve safety and productivity of this operation by 38 and 4 percent, respectively. Findings This framework is a complement to the conventional construction project safety and productivity planning methods. Its main application is in complex and hazardous construction operations. Originality/value For the first time, a comprehensive framework for concurrently improving safety and productivity of an entire project was proposed in this research. DES was used as the main modeling tool in the framework to provide an ex-ante evaluation foundation applicable to a wide range of construction projects.","[Baniassadi, Farshid] Sharif Univ Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Alvanchi, Amin] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mostafavi, Ali] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA","Alvanchi, A (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",alvanchi@sharif.edu,,,,,,49,7,7,2,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The next step, retrieving useful properties (e.g. crack width, length, and orientation) from the crack points, has not yet been adequately investigated. This paper presents a novel method of retrieving crack properties. In the method, crack points are first located through state-of-the-art crack detection techniques. Then, the skeleton configurations of the points are identified using image thinning. The configurations are integrated into the distance field of crack points calculated through a distance transform. This way, crack width, length, and orientation can be automatically retrieved. The method was implemented using Microsoft Visual Studio and its effectiveness was tested on real crack images collected from Haiti.

However, existing studies primarily focused on static scheduling, and few of them addressed dynamic rescheduling problems subject to disruptions from individual products without considering constraints in the practical environment. In this paper, a hybrid rescheduling optimization model for precast production is proposed to minimize rescheduling costs and ensure on-time delivery under disruptions of machine breakdown. The rescheduling was first optimized based on the genetic algorithm considering the idle time of multiple production lines, time intervals, and operation characteristics in precast production. Subsequently, the feasibility of potential reschedules was further verified via simulating production uncertainties in a real-world environment to achieve a trade-off between a high service level and profit maximization. Finally, a case study with different realistic scenarios was conducted to prove the superiority of the model in comparison with other methods. This methodology will increase the applicability of rescheduling methods in practice and reduce production costs of components in precast construction.","[Wang, Zhaojing; Liu, Yisheng] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Hu, Hao; Dai, Lei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Transportat Shipping & Logist, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Hu, Hao; Dai, Lei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Dai, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Transportat Shipping & Logist, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Dai, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",wangzj@bjtu.edu.cn; yshliu1@bjtu.edu.cn; hhu@sjtu.edu.cn; dailei1989@sjtu.edu.cn,,"wang, zhaojing/0000-0001-6705-6082",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71901020]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M650475],This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71901020) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M650475).,,43,0,0,4,4,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

The correlation measurement in the CM framework is used to construct basic probability assignments (BPAs) within different risk states of input factors. An improved combination rule that incorporates the Dempster' rule and the weighted mean rule is used to deal with multi source evidence with conflicts. The MC technique is used to simulate the input observation by using probability distribution in order to describe and reduce underlying uncertainty during the characterization and measurement of input factors. A multi-layer information fusion framework is proposed for the safety risk perception, with both hard data and soft data taken into account Four buildings adjacent to the excavation of one tunnel section in Wuhan metro system in China are utilized as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that the developed approach is capable of (i) synthesizing multi-source information to achieve a more accurate result for safety risk perception, and (ii) identifying global sensitivities of input factors under uncertainty. Reliability of safety risk perception results is further tested under different scenarios with different bias levels in the measurement of input factors, and the developed approach proves to have a strong robustness and fault-tolerant capacity. This approach can be used by practitioners in the industry as a decision tool to perceive and anticipate the potential safety risks in tunneling projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is not surprising given the fragmented nature of this industry and the involvement of multiple stakeholders in a project. Poor communication on health and safety (H&S) related issues has been identified as a major cause of incidents/accidents and is recognized as a key challenge to construction practitioners. Such communication typically gets diluted as it goes down the chain of command from top management to the project team. The aim of this paper is to report on the actual implementation and administration of H&S communication of a Malaysian construction company targeted at both internal and external stakeholders.

Data required by these methods are dispersed across departments, necessitating the development or redesign of data warehouses. This research proposes a simulation-based analytics approach to enhance safety management system (SMS) decision making using distributed simulation to overcome limitations associated with previous approaches. This distributed simulation approach is used to (1) integrate historical data without modifying data-warehouse structures (i.e., data fusion component), (2) link data to an artificial neural network-based analysis component for determining the influence of safety-related measures on incident levels, (3) connect data and analysis components to existing simulation components, and (4) combine the outputs, resulting in a comprehensive safety performance evaluation system to examine incident levels. Results demonstrate that this approach successfully fuses and integrates data from several sources with analysis and simulation components in a cost-, labor-, and time-efficient manner. A distributed simulation-based analytics approach represents a considerable opportunity for industrial construction companies to more effectively use historical data, analysis tools, and simulation models.","[Pereira, Estacio; Ali, Mostafa; Wu, Lingzi; Abourizk, Simaan] Univ Alberta, Markin Canadian Nat Resources Ltd 5 080, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Nat Resources Engn Facil, 9105 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada","Abourizk, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Markin Canadian Nat Resources Ltd 5 080, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Nat Resources Engn Facil, 9105 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 2W2, Canada.",estacio@ualberta.ca; mostafaali@ualberta.ca; Lingzi1@ualberta.ca; abourizk@ualberta.ca,"Pereira, Estacio/S-9092-2017; , 叶叶叶/ABE-1619-2020","Pereira, Estacio/0000-0002-1654-1827; Wu, Lingzi/0000-0003-1220-541X; , Mostafa/0000-0003-3571-3070; AbouRizk, Simaan/0000-0002-4788-9121",PCL Industrial Management Inc.; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [CRDPJ 492657],"The authors are thankful for the support of PCL Industrial Management Inc.

After the expiration of investments made within the framework of public economic recovery plans, the availability of public funds for infrastructure investments will be subject to severe constraints. These conditions require that scarce available funds be spent in an efficient and effective manner. Evaluation methods to select and prioritize infrastructure projects of an investment package often presuppose that infrastructure projects are independent of one another. However, it is inherent in the nature of transport networks that links are interdependent and that changes in one link will affect other parts of the network. Some infrastructure projects might be characterized by substitutive interdependence, while others might interact in a synergistic context. Thus, the cost and benefits of a project are strongly dependent on the realization of other projects. This paper confronts this issue by comprehensively addressing the nature of the problem to derive an optimal set of investment projects. The approach utilizes a dynamic mixed integer algorithm, and the complexity of the combinatorial problem is reduced by elaborating on a heuristic method. Under application of these requisites, this paper develops a framework for integrating the interdependence between infrastructure projects in cost-benefit analysis. Results obtained from an example application related to investments made in the Trans-European Network (TEN-T) emphasize the importance and relevance of considering interdependence for evaluating the investment potential of infrastructure projects.

Previous studies have described very well the structures of construction project supply chains. Moreover, one of strategies that have been considered by construction companies for gaining a competitive advantage is to reduce the cost of their supply chains. The research's objective is to identify the cost structure of construction supply chains in Indonesia and factors that could influence it. By knowing these factors, construction companies are expected to be able to determine strategic efforts needed for reducing cost of their construction supply chains. Two construction projects operated by a large construction company were explored as case-studies. Rebar material was chosen for this supply chains study. It was found that the cost of purchasing was very significant. Meanwhile, costs of transportation and inventory were insignificant. It can be concluded that efforts to reduce supply chains cost by reducing costs of inventory and transportation would not be effective. Therefore, factors that could influence the cost of supply chains are related to management of supply chains, such as procurement policy, material requirement planning, supplier qualification, selection process, contract, and supplier development.","[Abduh, Muhamad; Soemardi, Biemo W.; Wirahadikusumah, Reini D.] Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Bandung, Indonesia","Abduh, M (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Jln Ganesha 10, Bandung, Indonesia.",abduh@si.itb.ac.id; b_soemardi@si.itb.ac.id; wirahadi@si.itb.ac.id,"Soemardi, Biemo/O-1033-2019; Abduh, Muhamad/ABF-6790-2020; Soemardi, Biemo/ABE-4116-2020","Soemardi, Biemo/0000-0002-8076-2966; Abduh, Muhamad/0000-0001-6926-6665; ",,,,20,6,7,2,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The efficacy of a passive solar (PS) housing system in reducing home energy consumption and expenses in colonias has been evaluated using empirical data. The system is implemented in the Tierra Madre colonia in southern New Mexico and consists of PS housing design (orientation and windows), PS water heater, straw bale exterior walls, foundation insulation, and careful construction inspection for energy efficiency. Statistical and economic analyses of two years worth of monthly electricity and liquid propane gas bills (January 2005 to February 2007) from Tierra Madre and a directly adjacent conventional colonia (Sunland Park) showed that this system can be effective in reducing home energy consumption and cost. On average, a Tierra Madre house saves 5.868 million Btus every year compared to a Sunland Park house (representing 25% reduction in home energy consumption and a saving of $194.28 per house per year).

When unforeseen existing conditions are not properly examined, unexpected costs and/or schedule impacts can adversely affect the successful completion of a renovation project. This paper examines whether the cost impact of change orders due to unforeseen existing conditions is significant compared with the cost impacts of all other change orders, and quantifies the impact on the total project costs and the construction trade. Statistical analyses such ast-test and ANOVA were conducted, using information on 517 change orders obtained from 27 building renovation projects. The results show that change orders due to unforeseen existing conditions have significant impacts compared with change orders caused by other reasons, and that the calculated mean cost is higher for change orders stemming from unforeseen existing conditions. The results also show that the concrete trade is most impacted by change orders from unforeseen existing conditions, while the trade with the highest cost impact is heating, ventilating, and air conditioning. This paper investigates the effect of unforeseen existing conditions on the costs associated with change orders. The paper also identifies those construction trades that are more impacted than others and, therefore, require special attention.

A cross-sectional sample approach was deployed, involving pilot and survey questionnaires, and results verification through real world cases. Data were sought from construction professionals in management, design and operations (i.e. project managers, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, and procurement officers). TCs were measured using time-spent conducting procurement-related activities as a surrogate for cost. Professionals evaluate their time-spent in procurement activities using a Likert scale 1-5, comparing the Traditional and Design-Build delivery systems. Data were triangulated with real world cases to test and explain the developed model. The test included validity and reliability, path analysis, regression analysis, factor analysis, and structural equation modelling (SEM). The primary analytical technique used was SEM to yield information on goodness-of-fit, model development and comparison, and confirmatory strategies. SPSS Amos 21 statistical software was used for data analysis and model development. Findings - The results suggest that procurement systems have indirect impact on TCs. The relationship between procurement systemand TCs is fully mediated by costs of information, procurement, administration, and enforcement. Applying the developed models (the Traditional and Design-Build) to real world cases, it was found that TCs in the Traditional system amounts to 18.5 percent of the annual salary cost of a project manager (as an indicator quantum), while in the Design-Build system, it amounts to 14.5 percent of the annual salary cost of a project manager. TCs were calculated using regression equations based on factor loadings in the Traditional and Design-Build models. Practical implications - This study applies new theoretical model for the link between procurement system and TCs, investigating and empirically demonstrating the influence of procurement system on TCs in construction. It also offers a new plausible explanation for the factors influencing TCs in procurement. The study emphasizes in-house TCs from the perspective of the professionals. The findings have practical implications on construction business practice due to their robust empirical nature and theoretical framework, which might enhance the performance of the construction industry. Originality/value - This study contributes to the procurement selection in construction, by introducing a new conceptual model for the link between procurement system and TCs. It has extended the current practices for procurement selection by estimating TCs for the Traditional and Design-Build systems for comparison.","[Rajeh, Mohammed; Tookey, John E.; Rotimi, James Olabode Bamidele] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn, Auckland, New Zealand","Rajeh, M (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",mrajeh@aut.ac.nz,"Rotimi, James Olabode Bamidele/AAA-7286-2019","Rotimi, James Olabode Bamidele/0000-0001-6744-4683",,,,81,18,19,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Although the TCO problem has been extensively examined, many research studies only focused on minimizing the total cost for an early completion. This does not necessarily convey any reward to the contractor. However, with the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are more concerned about the combined benefits and opportunities of early completion as well as cost savings. In this paper, a genetic algorithms (GAs)-driven multiobjective model for TCO is proposed. The model integrates the adaptive weight to balance the priority of each objective according to the performance of the previous generation. In addition, the model incorporates Pareto ranking as a selection criterion and the niche formation techniques to improve popularity diversity. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype system has been developed in Microsoft Project for testing with a medium-sized project. The results indicate that greater robustness can be attained by the introduction of adaptive weight approach, Pareto ranking, and niche formation to the GA-based multiobjective TCO model.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ng, ST (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cemzheng@hkusua.hku.hk; tstng@hkucc.hku.hk; mohan@hkucc.hku.hk,"Ng, S.

Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to improving the safety conditions within the construction industry. Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to evaluate hazards through neural time-frequency analysis. The experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for a wearable electro-encephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the collection of the neural information required as input for the measurement approach.

Multi-national workforces are also brought together through joint ventures, as companies from different countries collaborate and share their expertise to construct large and complex construction projects. A multi-national joint venture in the UK provides the case study for an examination of the safety management challenges found on such projects. Whilst language and communication issues amongst workers are typically primary concerns, here they have not been prioritized. Instead, findings are presented that illuminate more nuanced and unquantifiable problems that faced the safety management team. An ethnographically informed approach was mobilized, with the lead researcher spending three years on the site with the safety team gathering data. Analysis revealed several challenges: problems with non-UK company compliance with UK legislation and standards; differences in working practices amongst both non-UK workers and their managers; differences associated with national cultures; and problems of poor worker welfare. It is suggested that awareness of these challenges should inform both the way in which such projects are initially contracted, as well as the development of more sophisticated safety management systems that better support multi-national construction projects in practice.","[Oswald, David] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Ctr Construct Work Hlth & Safety Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sherratt, Fred] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Chelmsford Campus, Chelmsford, Essex, England; [Smith, Simon D.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hallowell, Matthew R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Sherratt, F (corresponding author), Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Engn & Built Environm, Chelmsford Campus, Chelmsford, Essex, England.",Fred.sherratt@anglia.ac.uk,"Sherratt, Fred/ABH-3272-2020","Oswald, David/0000-0002-3013-5681",,,,67,20,20,4,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

This paper presents the safety risk identification system (SRIS) for metro construction based on construction drawings, which can be applied to the pre-construction risk assessment process to identify potential safety hazards, identify risks automatically and provide a basis for dynamic risk early warning and control. This paper summarizes the safety risks and risk factors of the metro construction, interprets the acquisition process of risk identification rules, and the production of rule-extensions and the storage of rule structures, on which the knowledge database of risk identification is based. It also develops the overall risk identification process and a group-retrieval matching algorithm based on meta-rules and certainty factors. Four recognition algorithms for typical graphic elements are proposed as a result of considering the features of metro construction drawings. The unique characteristic of SRIS is that, with the automatic identification of construction drawings by computer, the engineering parameters and relations between the construction drawings and the risk identification knowledge database can be quickly obtained. As a result, safety risks in metro construction can be automatically identified from the knowledge database. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ding, L. Y.; Yu, H. L.; Zhou, C.; Wu, X.

BIM can be regarded as both a digital representation of a building and a store of data with which to facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information throughout the lifecycle of a structure. Buildings sustain economic losses during their lifecycle due to ordinary maintenance operations and unpredictable events. These events reduce the structural performance of a building and highlight the need for financial investment. The costs of maintenance operations are usually accurately defined, but other expenditure is not as easy to evaluate when events are uncertain. A lifecycle cost (LCC) analysis of buildings exposed to seismic risk is a critical issue in structural engineering. Expected losses, including initial and post-earthquake repair costs, are an important parameter in structural design. Herein, a simplified method based on a semi-probabilistic approach is implemented in a BIM model to evaluate the economic performance, and economic losses, of a building exposed to seismic risk. A BIM procedure is implemented in a case study to improve the feasibility of this process and to deal with the large amount of data concerning the damage to and cost analysis of the components that constitute the facility. Furthermore, this specific BIM tool for the economic loss assessment has been embraced in a wider methodology aimed at optimizing the seismic retrofit strategy, taking into account both safety and economic features.","[Vitiello, U.; Ciotta, V; Salzano, A.; Asprone, D.; Manfredi, G.; Cosenza, E.] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Struct Engn & Architecture, Via Claudio 21, I-80125 Naples, Italy","Ciotta, V (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Struct Engn & Architecture, Via Claudio 21, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",umberto.vitiello@unina.it; vittoria.ciotta@unina.it,,"Ciotta, Vittoria/0000-0001-7952-3194",,,,24,11,12,5,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

TDA is similar to observational ergonomic methods-it does not produce estimates of probabilities of incidents, but it quantifies the task demand of actual operations based on characteristics of the activity and independent of the workers' capabilities. The task demand reflects the difficulty to perform the activity safely. It is based on (1) the exposure to a hazard and (2) the presence and level of observable task demand factors-that is, risk factors that can increase the potential for an accident. The paper presents the findings from the initial implementation of TDA and demonstrates its feasibility and applicability on two different operations: a roofing activity and a concrete paving operation. Furthermore, the paving case illustrates how the TDA method can compare different production scenarios and measure the effect of production variables on the accident potential. The findings indicate that the method can be applied on activities of varying complexity and can account for several risks and task demand factors as required by the user. The selection of task demand factors is a key issue for the validity of the method and requires input from the crew and safety management. The limitations of the methodology and the need for further research are discussed.

But, given that the government budget is, in most if not all cases, not unlimited, there must be a selection of BOT/PPP projects posing proposals for seeking government guarantees. This paper presents a project selection methodology under the chance-constrained goal-programming framework in the context of the Indonesian BOT/PPP infrastructure industry. The ultimate objective of the selection is to result in a portfolio of guaranteed projects that brings maximum welfare gain to the economy as a whole, maximum total net change in financial net present value but, at the same time, puts the government at the lowest fiscal risk for a given budget constraint. The proposed methodology allows the government to examine relationships among the expected total payment, budget-at-risk allocated, and a desired confidence interval of actual payment not exceeding the budget-at-risk. The government can also compare two or more alternative scenarios and choose the optimal one that delivers the highest value for the money. To illustrate the model application, without sacrificing the generality of the proposed methodology, a much-simplified hypothetical case is presented, examined, and discussed.

The use of product families allows firms to meet these needs in a cost-competitive manner. The determination of which components to share and which should be unique is very important to the development of product families. Commonality metrics are presented with the goal of assessing (at the early stages of development) the ability of the product family to reduce costs. The methodology of process-based cost modeling is used to project product development, fabrication, and assembly costs in both the standalone and shared situations. A case study of two automotive instrument panel beams is analyzed. Linear-regression analysis shows that when compared to total cost savings, a simple piece commonality metric and a fabrication-investment-weighted metric have higher R-2 than a mass-or piece-cost-weighted metric. When correlated to fixed cost savings, the fabrication-investment-weighted metric has the highest R-2 (0.62) and is significant at the 0.025 level. Fixed cost savings are proposed as the desired quantity when assessing product family efficiency.","[Johnson, Michael DeShawn] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Engn Technol & Ind Distribut, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kirchain, Randolph] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kirchain, Randolph] MIT, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Engn Technol & Ind Distribut, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mdjohnson@tamu.edu; kirchain@mit.edu,"Johnson, Michael DeShawn/B-8203-2009","Johnson, Michael DeShawn/0000-0001-5328-8763; Kirchain, Randolph/0000-0002-4019-8598",,,,68,24,24,1,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Although the built environment accounts for a large proportion of global fossil fuel use, it may be argued that the energy and buildings agenda is not being addressed at the depth or scale needed to meet global and national CO2 emission-reduction targets. Most actions to reduce energy use in the built environment have mainly used a top-down' decision-making approach, from government and industry, with little end-user engagement. Greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets will not be met without providing the technological and socio-economic pathways for achieving them. The paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, it discusses the need to reduce fossil fuel use and the apparent failure to transition policy goals and aims into practice. Secondly, top-down and bottom-up approaches are reviewed, advocating a greater emphasis on a 'whole-system' bottom-up approach in delivering multiple benefit solutions. Thirdly, the concept of 'smart' is considered in relation to bottom up with its implementation at a regional scale.","[Jones, Phil] Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales","Jones, P (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",jonesp@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Jones, Phillip/0000-0003-1559-8984",,,,60,5,5,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the critical elements of complexity-risk interdependency for cost-chaos in the construction management domain by utilizing a multi-criteria decision model. Design/methodology/approach A total of 12 complexity and 60 risk attributes are initially identified from the literature and using expert's judgements. For the development of a structured hierarchy of key complexity and risk drivers, a real-time Delphi process is adopted for recording and evaluating the responses from experts. Afterwards, a pair-wise comparison using analytical network processing is performed to measure complexity-risk interdependencies against cost alternatives. Findings The findings of the integrated priority decision index (IPDI) suggest that uncertainties related to contingency and escalation costs are the main sources of cost overrun in project drift, along with the key elements such as the use of innovative technology, multiple contracts, low advance payment, change in design, unclear specifications and the lack of experience appear to be more significant to chaos in complexity-risk interdependency network. Originality/value This research addresses the importance of cost overruns as a source of project chaos in dynamic systems where projects reach the edge of chaos and progress stops.

An approach was developed to create low-energy buildings without additional construction costs such that it yielded innovation in building technology and integration by the market. A case study of the implementation of this method is presented to provide a data point that ZEBs can be built with zero cost increase. Documenting cost-control best practices and packaging those strategies for adoption by the commercial building sector will help make the business case for ZEBs for mainstream construction and promote market uptake of the innovative technologies and design approaches needed. The holistic implementation of cost-control strategies will enable ZEBs to be designed and constructed on a typical budget. The current state of ZEB economics is evaluated and a path forward is proposed for greater market penetration of ZEBs. By demonstrating how to combine ZEB technologies and design approaches into an overall efficiency package that can be implemented at minimal (zero, in certain cases) incremental capital cost, the domain of ZEB design and construction can be expanded from a niche market to the commercial construction mainstream.","[Torcellini, Paul; Pless, Shanti; Leach, Matt] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA","Torcellini, P (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",paul.torcellini@nrel.gov; Shanti.Pless@nrel.gov,,,US Government [DE-AC36-08GO28308],"The submitted manuscript has been offered by an employee of the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (Alliance), a contractor of the US Government under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

There has been a strong call for applying target cost contracts to align the interest of owners and contractors together. By doing so, it aims to achieve a win-win situation under a partnering arrangement within the construction industry. Even though a multitude of research studies have been undertaken on target cost contracts (TCC) or guaranteed maximum price (GM P) contracts, not many of them have focused on the risk management and analysis of these procurement strategies. This paper aims to identify, rank and compare the key risk factors encountered with these forms of procurement based on an empirical questionnaire survey geared towards the clients, contractors and consultants in Hong Kong. Despite the limited number of completed TCC and GM P (TCC/GMP) construction projects in Hong Kong, the chosen sample was perceived to be truly representative of the survey population. A four-level data analysis framework was applied in this paper, including descriptive statistics, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney U test. The research findings showed that the client group, contractor group and consultant group are in general agreement on the impact of individual risks. The identification of the key risk factors and their relative significance is important in the risk management of target cost contracts and guaranteed maximum price projects, which, if properly done, would enhance the value for money throughout the whole procurement process. This research study also helps various key project stakeholders to be equipped with better knowledge and understanding of TCC/GMP scheme by paying close attention to those high-risk factors and then the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation measures in a proactive manner.

However, transportation projects have historically experienced significant construction cost overruns from the time the decision to build has been taken by the owner. This paper addresses the problem of why highway projects overrun their predicted costs. It identifies the owner risk variables that contribute to significant cost overrun and then uses factor analysis, expert elicitation, and the nominal group technique to establish groups of importance ranked owner risks. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis is also used to investigate any correlation of the percentage of cost overrun with risks, together with attributes such as highway project type, indexed cost, geographic location, and project delivery method. The research results indicate a correlation between the reciprocal of project budget size and percentage cost overrun. This can be useful for owners in determining more realistic decision-to-build highway budget estimates by taking into account the economies of scale associated with larger projects.","[Wong, Johnny K.

Nevertheless, the measurement of workers' behavior has not been actively applied in practice, due to the difficulties in observing workers on jobsites. In an effort to provide a robust and automated means for worker observation, this paper proposes a framework of vision-based unsafe action detection for behavior monitoring. The framework consists of (1) the identification of critical unsafe behavior, (2) the collection of relevant motion templates and site videos, (3) the 3D skeleton extraction from the videos, and (4) the detection of unsafe actions using the motion templates and skeleton models. For a proof of concept, experimental studies are undertaken to detect unsafe actions during ladder climbing (i.e., reaching far to a side) in motion datasets extracted from videos. The result indicates that the proposed framework can potentially perform well at detecting predefined unsafe actions in videos. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Most cities rely on route preferences (e.g., common school routes) or visual checks to prioritize pavement conditions on bicycle facilities. We used 31 bike path sections with a representative range of pavement surface conditions to collect acceleration data, GPS location data, bicycle steering angle, surface displacement data, and mean texture depth (MTD) data. We also recruited cyclists to complete a post-ride survey on ride quality. Using these data, we specified two ordered logit regression models to separately examine the relationships between bicycle ride quality and traditional pavement roughness measurement (or surface defect density on trajectories) while holding other parameters (e.g., bicycle accelerations and steering angle) constant. Our study shows that a surface defect index can replace the MTD test for bicycle facilities and can produce better performance in predicting ride quality, especially when pavement condition needs moderate repair to avoid becoming much worse. We also examine ride quality, specifically the vertical acceleration effect on ride experience, for different types of bicycles (e.g., a mountain bike with a suspension system versus a touring bike).","[Qian, Xiaodong] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Moore, Jason K.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Niemeier, Deb] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil Engn, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Niemeier, D (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Civil Engn, 1173 Glenn Martin Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xdqian@ucdavis.edu; jasonmoore@ucdavis.edu; niemeier@umd.edu,,"Moore, Jason/0000-0002-8698-6143; niemeier, deb/0000-0002-8937-7159; Qian, Xiaodong/0000-0002-7245-3362",,,,21,0,0,6,15,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

Working capital requirement (WCR) has been recognized as a key factor for releasing tied up cash in companies. However, in literatures related to lot-sizing problem, WCR has only been studied in the single-level supply chain context. In this paper, we initially adopt WCR model for a multi-level case. A two-level (supplier-customer) model is established on the basis of the classic multi-level lot-sizing model integrated with WCR financing cost. To tackle this problem, we propose sequential and centralized approaches to solve the two-level case with a serial chain structure. The ZIO (Zero Inventory Ordering) property is further confirmed valid in both cases. This property allows us to establish a dynamic programming-based algorithm, which solves the problem in O(T-4). Finally, numerical tests show differences in optimal plans obtained by both approaches and the influence of varying delays in payment on the WCR of both actors.","[Bian, Yuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lemoine, David; Yeung, Thomas G.] IMT Atlantique, LS2N UMR CNRS 6004, F-44300 Nantes, France; [Bostel, Nathalie] Univ Nantes, LS2N UMR CNRS 6004, F-44606 St Nazaire, France","Bian, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",bianyuan@ucas.ac.cn,,,,,,35,1,1,0,6,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

This work develops a new model to calculate conceptual costs of building projects for effective cost control. The proposed model integrates four mathematical techniques (sub-models), namely, (1) the component ratios sub-model, fuzzy adaptive learning control network (FALCON) and fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA) based sub-model, (2) regression sub-model, and (4) multi-factor evaluation sub-model. While the FALCON- and fmGA-based sub-model trains the historical cost data, three other sub-models assess the inputs systematically to estimate the cost of a new project. This study also closely examines the behavior of the proposed model by evaluating two modified models without considering fmGA and undertaking sensitivity analysis. Evaluation results indicate that, with the ability to more thoroughly respond to the project characteristics, the proposed model has a high probability of increasing estimation accuracies more than the three conventional methods, i.e., average unit cost, component ratios, and linear regression methods.","[Wang, Wei-Chih; Bilozerov, Tymur; Dzeng, Ren-Jye; Hsiao, Fan-Yi; Wang, Kun-Chi] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Wang, WC (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",weichih@mail.nctu.edu.tw,,"Dzeng, Ren Jye/0000-0003-1351-7001","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2221-E-009-137MY3]",The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan for financially supporting this research (under Contract No. NSC101-2221-E-009-137MY3).

Conventional drainage systems were built to mimic natural drainage patterns to prevent the occurrence of waterlogging in developed sites. These drainage systems consist of two major components: 1) a stormwater conduit system, and 2) a runoff storage system. Runoff storage systems contain retention basins and drywells that are used to store and percolate runoff, whereas conduit systems are combination of catch basins and conduit pipes used to collect and transport runoff. The construction of these drainage systems is costly and may cause significant environmental disturbance. In this study, low impact development (LID) methods that consist of extensive green roofs (GRs) and permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICPs) are applied in real-world construction projects. Construction project documents were reviewed, and related cost information was gathered through the accepted bidding proposals and interviews of specialty contractors in the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. Results indicate that the application of both LID methods to existing projects can save an average of 27.2% in life cycle costs (LCC) for a 50-year service life and 18.7% in LCC for a 25-year service life on the proposed drainage system, respectively.","[Zhang, Pengfei; Ariaratnam, Samuel T.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Ariaratnam, ST (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",ariaratnam@asu.edu,,,,,,16,3,3,3,13,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

However, due to the risky and competitive nature of construction contracting, conflicting objectives among the different parties involved in a contract are bound to occur. In many instances this leads to expensive claims and litigation. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has adopted an approach called ''partnering'' to define its relationship with its contractors in an attempt to reduce or eliminate claims and litigation. The partnering approach relies on the fact that the best conflict-resolution strategy is one that prevents conflicts from occurring. Therefore, the main objective of partnering is to encourage all parties of a contract to change their relationships from adversarial to cooperative, by building a friendly environment with all parties acting as members of one team. This change in relationships requires changes in attitudes to achieve mutual trust, respect, and open communication among all parties involved.

However, information collected using such labor-intensive methods is unreliable and ineffective when managing inspection results. Moreover, inputting, retrieving, analyzing and disseminating the result data instantaneously require a significant amount of time and effort. Therefore, an automated and user-friendly quality management system is necessary. This study proposes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based quality management system, which functions as a platform for gathering, filtering, managing, monitoring and sharing quality data. The integration of promising information technologies such as RFID technology, mobile devices (PDAs) and web portals can help enhance the effectiveness and flexibility of information flow in material test management. Radio frequency identification is suited to various construction applications and generates cost savings via increased speed and accuracy of data entry. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of an RFID-based quality management application called the RFID-based Quality Inspection and Management (RFID-QIM) System for concrete specimen inspection and management to enhance automated data collection and information management in a quality test lab. This study focuses mainly on evaluating the potential for utilizing RFID-based techniques to accumulate, manage, monitor and distribute data related to quality. Additionally, the RFID-QIM system is then applied to a case study in a test lab (construction division) in Taiwan to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in information management for concrete specimen quality testing. A generic system architecture is also proposed, and its implementation is described. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, building system commissioning has been recognized as a cost-effective measure to cut energy consumption, but in practice commissioning quality can deliver less-than-satisfactory outcomes. Regulation needs to better support commissioning outcomes. A five-grade commissioning scale is developed to assess the quality of commissioning and propose a common language to assist with regulation setting. Using this scale, building regulation and polices related to new and refurbished building commissioning were analysed in comparative case studies between jurisdictions England and California. This study finds that Californian regulations mandate a higher quality of commissioning and regulations that are more enforceable. The crucial elements to support better-commissioned buildings were identified as: outputs-focused regulation (not input based); regulation and process clarity; commissioning agents and building official training; as well as acknowledging the financial burden of upholding more complex building regulations. For the full benefit of commissioning to be realized, policy and regulations for existing buildings will be required.","[Lord, Sue-Fay; Tennant, Mike G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, 14 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Noye, Sarah; Fisk, David J.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Syst Engn & Innovat, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ure, Jim] Allied PC, 4 Merivale, Fleet GU51 4EW, Hants, England","Lord, SF; Tennant, MG (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, 14 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England.; Noye, S; Fisk, DJ (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Syst Engn & Innovat, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.; Ure, J (corresponding author), Allied PC, 4 Merivale, Fleet GU51 4EW, Hants, England.",suefaylau@gmail.com; s.noye11@imperial.ac.uk; jimure@alliedpc.co.uk; m.tennant@imperial.ac.uk; d.fisk@imperial.ac.uk,,"Noye, Sarah/0000-0002-5687-6840; Fisk, David/0000-0003-3335-5695",,,,32,10,10,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

This study provides insight into how the fruit industry in a developing country perceives intellectual capital and demonstrates the use of developed models from other industries in the food industry. The novelty of this approach was the dimension reduction of intellectual capital factors into two distinct directions, namely, customer quality' and stakeholder quality', confirming quality as a dominant basis for both customers and stakeholders. Micro companies and non-certified companies are focused on customers, while medium-sized and certified companies are focused on satisfying requirements from all stakeholders.

Nighttime paving operations are often seen as a viable solution to reduce traffic disruptions due to maintenance and construction activities. However, state highway agencies (SHAs) are uncertain as to whether the quality of nighttime paving is at the same level of daytime paving. Although percent within limits (PWL) has shown great promise as a quality-based pay factor tool, limited empirical research exists that focuses on using this process as a postconstruction pay tool.

It was found that nighttime projects were awarded more rideability bonus payouts while daytime projects were awarded more 100% rideability payouts. This study fills a gap in knowledge and practices by providing relevant information required to use PWL as a tool for measuring, enhancing, and optimizing quality or asphalt pavement. SHAs should consider including PWL in highway contracts as a tool for assessing the quality of projects.

To test the prerequisites of fresh SCC, three tests (slump flow [SF], V-Funnel [VF], and J-Ring [JR]) were prescribed to be performed on every truck. The acceptance condition for the supplied concrete was to meet the specified requirements for all three tests. This procedure seems adequate to derive reliable data about filling ability, resistance to segregation, deformation capacity, viscosity, and passing ability. The correlation between slump-flow and J-ring results suggests that these two tests could be associated by defining a proper reduced J-ring diameter and by checking the difference in height between the concrete inside and outside the ring. In general, it seems that a continuous control should be applied only on specific structures, such as structures with highly congested reinforcement, whereas when the stability of the supplies is achieved, a reduced testing control could be applied for ordinary structures. However, whatever the type of construction, in extreme weather conditions (very hot/cold) special care should be taken, and it could be necessary to increase the number of controls because under these conditions a higher probability of nonconformance to the guidelines was observed.

However, the current diffusion of responsibilities in England between central government and healthcare trusts has created gaps and weaknesses in the evidence base, knowledge, skills and tools for creating and assessing healthcare building design quality. How can a national healthcare building design quality improvement strategy be created? This question is explored in relation to policy, strategy and organizational issues. Four evaluation studies and four action research studies indicate the complexity and responsibilities in defining a design quality improvement strategy. It is found that the interdisciplinary development of national standards and tools requires centralized investment to facilitate nationwide learning and improvements in evidence and outcomes. In addition, the inevitable health policy changes made by successive governments require a sustainable and strategic response. The creation and maintenance of capacity and capabilities will require a dedicated team of professionals and a wide interdisciplinary network of long-term contributors who are motivated by a long-term desire to improve healthcare building design quality.","[Mills, Grant R.

To assist local authorities in their client role, a new Architectural Design Quality Evaluation Tool was developed. The aim was to improve the quality of design in residential sheltered housing, procured through the PFI. The tool was developed for and applied to a programme that will see the replacement of a local authority's entire sheltered housing stock. The tool has two functions: (1) to inform the client's assessment process and assist with the selection of the preferred bidding consortium through a series of stages in the PFI process; and (2) to improve the quality of all the submitted designs through an iterative process. Although several existing mechanisms are available for evaluating the performance attributes of buildings, few also tackle the less tangible amenity attributes, which are vital to the feeling of home. The new tool emphasizes the amenity attributes without neglecting performance.","[Giddings, Bob; Sharma, Monika; Jones, Paul] Northumbria Univ, Dept Architecture Engn & Construct, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Jensen, Phil] North Tyneside Homes, North Tyneside NE27 0BY, England","Giddings, B (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ, Dept Architecture Engn & Construct, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",bob.giddings@northumbria.ac.uk; monika.sharma@northumbria.ac.uk; p.jones@northumbria.ac.uk; phil.jensen@northtyneside.gov.uk,,"Giddings, Bob/0000-0003-1794-0894",Technology Strategy Board; Arts and Humanities Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC); North Tyneside Council,"The authors acknowledge funding from the Technology Strategy Board, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and North Tyneside Council through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership that permitted the engagement of the Researcher as a KTP Associate.

However, the performance implications of such offshoring efforts are often ambiguous vis-a-vis those that are executed within country boundaries. Further, little is known about project execution capabilities that may be central to improving the performance of offshore technology projects. This study attempts to shed light on the above issues using data from technology projects distributed within and across country boundaries. The study findings are twofold. First, a comparative analysis of project performance across 702 technology projects reveals that projects executed offshore realize significantly lower performance related to quality and technical goals compared with projects executed within country boundaries. Second, a subsequent in-depth analysis of the offshore technology projects in the sample highlights the enabling but differential performance effects of project execution capabilities. Specifically, we find that while risk management planning capability is central to improving project adherence to schedule and budgetary goals, agile project management capability is central to improving project adherence to quality and technical goals in technology projects executed offshore. The study concludes with a discussion of the findings, implications for technology research and practice, limitations, and directions for future research.","[Mishra, Anant] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Sinha, Kingshuk K.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Thirumalai, Sriram] Texas Christian Univ, Neeley Sch Business, Informat Syst & Supply Chain Dept, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA","Mishra, A (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",amishra6@gmu.edu; ksinha@umn.edu; s.thirumalai@tcu.edu,,,,,,81,8,8,0,22,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Such grading is needed both for funding and resource allocation purposes and for personnel decisions. In grading journals, objective information, such as the impact factors (the most commonly used journal citation information provided by Journal Citation Reports) and/or subjective information, such as experts' judgments about the journals, are used. Grading of journals is typically done by a committee. Most of the existing approaches only consider either the subjective or the objective information. While such approaches work in many cases, they may not work in many others. Complaints about politics, inconsistencies, and unfairness are common in many situations. This paper presents a methodology that integrates both types of information, providing a comprehensive method for assessing the quality of journals. The method employs a fuzzy set approach that also deals with the imprecise and missing information frequently inherited in the evaluation process. The proposed evaluation model is implemented in a Web-based system.

The current practice for compaction quality control primarily relies on the monitoring of rolling parameters such as rolling passes, speed and vibration of rollers, and lift thickness. Soil samples are randomly collected to evaluate the compactness. This practice is subject to two main limitations. First, the compaction monitoring and measurement are not always comprehensive since limited samples are manually collected. Second, compaction information cannot be disseminated to owners, supervisors, contractors, and operators in timely fashion. In this study, intelligent compaction (IC) technology is leveraged to monitor and control highway compaction quality. Anew measure of compaction quality, compaction power per unit volume (E), is created and used with other IC measurement values such as compaction meter value (CMV) to achieve more reliable monitoring and assessment. Field experiments were conducted. The results demonstrated that the integration of CMV and E in the regression model leads to a higher coefficient of determination than that of using only CMV or E. A real-time monitoring system is developed, which not only evaluates the compaction quality of the entire area, but also synchronizes the compaction information among owners, supervisors, contractors, and operators in real-time. As such, this system cultivates an integrated operator-contractor-supervisor-owner quality control mechanism, which can improve the current highway compaction practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The most significant advantage of the road impact factor is that low-cost sensors distributed in smartphones and connected vehicles generate the measurements directly. Standardizing the sample rate of inertial sensors in vehicles will provide consistent measures at any speed. This study characterizes the impact of sample rate and traversal volume on measurement consistency, and conducts case studies to validate the theories developed for a recommended standard at 64Hz.

During the service delivery, the health care organization attempts to answer the reasonable expectations of patients. The expectations relate to many service dimensions, among them the phone system, appointment availability, and waiting times. The research questions of this study are: can the implementation of quality initiatives improve patient satisfaction with the phone system, appointment availability, and waiting times and do patients from diverse cultural backgrounds exhibit different levels of satisfaction? The study was undertaken in a public clinic, with a culturally diverse clientele, including 194 patients. The authors use a combination of the longitudinal and cross-sectional research design to test the propositional model. The findings show that the implementation of the quality initiative significantly improved patient satisfaction with the appointment availability and waiting time. On the other hand, the implementation of the quality initiative did not improve patient satisfaction with the phone system. Some culturally diverse patients exhibited different levels of expectations of the care provider and quality in terms of patient satisfaction with the appointment availability.","Portland State Univ, Engn Management Program, Portland, OR 97207 USA; I2 Technol, Redwood City, CA 94065 USA","Milosevic, D (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Engn Management Program, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",,,,,,,63,3,3,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The resultant supply chain that supports these projects is extremely broad and deep, creating unique challenges with managing a network of hundreds and even thousands of independent contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers that often span the globe. It is a continual challenge to ensure that the project equipment, products, and materials that are produced are not in need of rework. This article summarizes findings from the literature of diverse approaches for SQM in the construction industry, and from other industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, and food and restaurant. The aim is to identify approaches that could be beneficial to the construction industry such as supplier partnerships, category captain management, and product life cycle management and to determine how these approaches might be adapted to the construction industry. Engineering managers are challenged to improve SQM within an environment of limited resources. By investigating effective practices of SQM inside and outside the construction industry, the engineering manager can leverage and apply these practices. The contribution of this article includes examining and identifying diverse practices for assuring supplier quality. These practices can be applied by engineering practitioners to improve the current management systems so that poor quality problems can be prevented.","[AlMaian, Rufaidah Yousef] Kuwait Univ, Ind & Management Syst Engn Dept, Safat 13060, Kuwait; [Needy, Kim LaScola] Univ Arkansas, Grad Sch & Int Educ, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Walsh, Kenneth D.] San Diego State Univ, JR Filanc Construct Engn & Management Dept, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Alves, Thais da C.

The state-of-the-art research proposes semi-automated detection methods for tracking of construction workers and equipment. Considering the number of active equipment and workers on jobsites and their frequency of appearance in a camera's field of view, application of semi-automated techniques can be time-consuming. To address this limitation, a new algorithm based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Colors (HOG + C) is proposed. Our proposed detector uses a single sliding window at multiple scales to identify the potential candidates for the location of equipment and workers in 2D. Each detection window is first divided into small spatial regions and then the gradient orientations and hue-saturation colors are locally histogrammed and concatenated to form the HOG + C descriptors. Tiling the sliding detection window with a dense and overlapping grid of formed descriptors and using a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each resource enables automated 20 detection of workers and equipment. A new comprehensive benchmark dataset containing over 8000 annotated video frames including equipment and workers from different construction projects is introduced. This dataset contains a large range of pose, scale, background, illumination, and occlusion variation. Our preliminary results on detection of standing workers, excavators and dump trucks with an average accuracy of 98.83%, 82.10%, and 84.88% respectively indicate the applicability of the proposed method for automated activity analysis of workers and equipment from single video cameras. Unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms in automated resource tracking, this method particularly detects idle resources and does not need manual or semi-automated initialization of the resource locations in 2D video frames. The experimental results and the perceived benefits of the proposed method are discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The main problems with conventional methods, such as the critical path method and program evaluation and review technique, are the lack of precision in predicting time due to the dynamics of the construction process. One solution is to combine planning models with discrete event simulation (DES) and BIM to simulate the dynamic environment to reduce uncertainties. Likewise, DES is used to implement just in time (JIT). A problem with JIT implementation using DES in the construction industry is a lack of accurate measurement of the optimum time for each process. Meanwhile, takt time, one of the main techniques in JIT, was used in this research to achieve the optimal time of each process and was combined with DES to solve this problem. First, a 4D BIM model was developed to extract data. Then, takt time was used to achieve optimal time for each activity, and eventually, a DES was performed. The results of this study indicate that the proposed framework using takt time and its combination with DES to integrate BIM with JIT will lead to realistic and optimal planning.

However, principles for determining training-schedule design for efficient utilization of these systems are not well established. The present research compared performance of two groups, one adopting a mixed practice schedule (with high contextual interference) and the other employing a blocked practice schedule (presumably with lower contextual interference) for learning construction excavator control skills in a computer-based virtual environment. No significant difference was found with regard to achieved skill level and skill consistency. A possible reason is that the complexity of the training task created a degree of intra-task interference in the blocked practice schedule comparable to the interference created by the mixed practice schedule. This result implies a need to further assay construction equipment operation to critically isolate influences on operator skill development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional scheduling methods include first-in-first-serve (FIFS), shortest-job-first (SJF), nearest-neighbor-first (NNF), and Traveling salesman problem (TSP). A new optimization model to optimize crane setup location, hook movement sequences and servicing schedules serving all supply and demand locations is proposed. Proposed model is able to model homogeneous and non-homogeneous material supply. Initial hook location can be given as input for optimization. Fixed material supply and demand location pairs are relaxed as model variables. Maximum crane lifting capacity is considered and multiple hook movement trips between material supply and demand locations are modeled if requested material weights exceed this maximum crane lifting capacity. Users may place urgent material demand requests and the proposed optimization model can optimize a servicing sequence to prioritize all urgent requests. The problem is formulated as a Binary-Mixed Integer-Linear-Program (BMILP) which is solved by standard branch-and-bound techniques.

Using a multiwave survey conducted in the Philippines, this paper investigated the interactive effects of construction workers' perceptions of supportive leadership and top management teams' charismatic vision on their job satisfaction, retention intentions, and actual retention. The results revealed that workers are more satisfied with their jobs when they perceive their supervisors as supportive. Job satisfaction, in turn, increased their retention intentions and actual retention behavior. Top management teams' charismatic vision further enhanced these mediated relationships. Thus, to maintain a stable workforce, construction organizations are advised to invest resources (e.g.,establishing education and mentoring programs) in developing supervisors' supportive leadership skills, ensure the top management team communicates clear organizational vision, and regularly monitor construction workers' job satisfaction. This research adds to the literature focusing on the antecedents of construction workers' behavioral and performance outcomes by empirically examining the effect of supervisors' supportive leadership as well as the critical role of top management team charismatic vision.","[Chih, Ying-Yi; Cheng, David; Emamirad, Ehsan; Restubog, Simon Lloyd] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Res Sch Management, 26 Kingsley St, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kiazad, Kohyar] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Management, Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia","Chih, YY (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Res Sch Management, 26 Kingsley St, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",ying-yi.chih@anu.edu.au; kohyar.kiazad@monash.edu; david.cheng@anu.edu.au; ehsan.emamirad@anu.edu.au; simon.restubog@anu.edu.au,,"Restubog, Simon/0000-0003-1602-2530",,,,59,5,5,2,47,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Many previous studies relied on interviews and/or questionnaire to assess physical fatigue in construction workers. However, these traditional methods are not only time-consuming but also limited by recall bias. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have used physiological metrics (e.g., heart rate, heart-rate variability, skin temperature, electromyographic activity, and jerk metrics) to measure real-time physical fatigue. Although physiological metrics have shown promising results for real-time assessments of physical fatigue, no state-of-the-art review has been conducted to summarize various physiological metrics in measuring physical fatigue among construction workers. Therefore, the current state-of-the art review aims to summarize existing evidence regarding the use of physiological metrics to measure physical fatigue of construction workers in real-time. This review used systematic searches to identify relevant studies and critically appraised the application of physiological metrics in measuring physical fatigue of construction workers. First, it summarizes the application of various physiological metrics for real-time measurement of physical fatigue in construction workers. Second, various wearable sensing technologies for measuring physiological metrics are identified. Third, this review discusses the potential challenges for applying physiological metrics to measure physical fatigue. Finally, future research directions to advance the development and adoption of various physiological metrics to monitor and mitigate physical fatigue in construction workers are discussed.

Avoiding exposure of workers to the modules that generate high sound power during maintenance activities can significantly mitigate the noise impact on human health and safety. Noise simulation and noise mapping methodologies can be used to evaluate and quantify the noise impact on offshore platforms. However, limited digital information of offshore platforms makes noise simulation setup challenging as modules on topsides have a high level of details. In addition, current noise mapping studies are usually conducted in a 3D static manner, which only reflects noise impact at a certain time. Building information modeling (BIM) provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of a facility that can be applied to support the noise simulation on offshore platforms. In this study, attempts have been made to develop a BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach to mitigating the noise impact on maintenance workers of offshore platforms. BIM is utilized to automatically provide required information to facilitate noise simulation setup. 4D acoustics simulation approach is used to obtain the spatio-temporary sound pressure level (SPL) distribution of the noise generated by the functional modules on offshore platforms. Acoustic diffusion equation (ADE) is selected as noise SPL prediction model. To evaluate noise impact on maintenance workers, an equation based on daily noise dose is then newly derived to quantify the noise impact. Optimization algorithm is used to determine the maintenance schedule with the minimum daily noise dose. Finally, optimized maintenance schedule that has considered noise impact is used to update the daily maintenance plan on offshore platforms. An example of a fixed offshore platform with maintenance daily activity information is used to illustrate the proposed BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach. The results show that the developed approach can well mitigate noise impact on maintenance workers on offshore platforms, resulting in health and safety management improvement.","[Tan, Yi; Gan, Vincent J.

Using extensive craft certification and skills data, the writers apply correlation and cluster analyses to identify actual patterns of multiskilling among craft workers using two separate data sources. The results of the cluster analysis indicate that current craft skills aggregate into four groups: civil, mechanical, electrical, and general support. It is also observed that acquiring mutually supporting skill set pairs significantly drives multiskilling strategies in practice, thus diminishing the relative impact that duration on project has on driving multiskilling practice, despite its importance in previous literature. Still, comparing the observed multiskilling patterns obtained from the skill affinity analyses with multiskilling strategies proposed by previous studies generally reinforces the potential efficacy of those strategies.","[Wang, Yinggang; Goodrum, Paul M.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Civil Engn, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Haas, Carl T.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 31, Canada; [Glover, Robert W.] Univ Texas Austin, Ray Marshall Ctr Study Human Resources, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78703 USA","Goodrum, PM (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Civil Engn, C151C Raymond Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",pgoodrum@engr.uky.edu,,,,,,23,8,8,0,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In this article, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by R&D activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms.","[Xiang, Dong] Shandong Normal Univ, Business Sch, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuming] Shandong Univ, Sch Management, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Worthington, Andrew C.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Zhang, YM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Management, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China.",donxiang@gmail.com; yumingzhang2008@163.com; a.worthington@griffth.edu.au,,,,,,77,1,1,14,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Sustainability standards can enable an organisation to evidence a benchmarked level of performance against a particular issue. To date, research on standards has largely focused on the operational and administrative aspects of their enactment, rather than how they might affect - and be appropriated by - organisational actors. The purpose of this paper is to examine how capacity for learning can affect the success of implementing standards within two construction SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - Taking an organisational learning and absorptive capacity (ACAP) perspective, this research uses the case study approach and abductive logic to understand what role learning plays with regard to sustainability standard implementation. Findings - The results reveal that strong communication channels and commitment to training programmes increase the capacity for implementing standards, but that SMEs tend only to approach standards if they see immediate financial benefits stemming from their implementation. Practical implications - SMEs provide a challenging context for the implementation of sustainability standards unless there are significant external levers and extrinsic motivation for them to be embraced. Care should be taken in incorporating these aspects into the future design of standards that are more aligned with SME needs. Social implications - Stakeholders should seek to apply pressure to firms to positively influence engagement with sustainability standards. Originality/value - The role and importance of ACAP is an underdeveloped debate in the certification field. This study is the first that links the process of implementing a standard with the ACAP of an organisation.","[Upstill-Goddard, James; Nicholson, Ian] Responsible Solut Ltd, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Glass, Jacqui] Univ Loughborough, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Architectural & Sustainable Construct, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Glass, Jacqui] Univ Loughborough, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Enterprise, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Dainty, Andrew] Univ Loughborough, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Construct Sociol, Loughborough, Leics, England","Upstill-Goddard, J (corresponding author), Responsible Solut Ltd, Loughborough, Leics, England.",,,,"Responsible Solutions Ltd; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G037272/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/H048030/1, 1104296] Funding Source: researchfish","This research forms part of an Engineering Doctorate (EngD) programme, sponsored by Responsible Solutions Ltd and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC; grant number EP/G037272/1), which is managed through the Centre for Innovative and Collaborative Construction Engineering (CICE), based at the School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University.

Given a conceptualization of business strategy through Miles and Snow's typology (prospectors, analyzers, and defenders), the aim of this research is threefold. First, one seeks to identify the performance outcomes of strategic alignment in terms of the productivity and profitability of medium-sized enterprises (ME). Second, this research aims to verify if these outcomes are valid for all strategic types or only for some. Third, to find out what manufacturing strategy is the most appropriate for each business strategy type. A research model and hypothesis are tested with survey data obtained from 150 Canadian MEs. Significant performance outcomes of alignment are found, thus validating the research model and confirming the main research proposition. Differences between strategic types are also found in terms of performance outcomes. Results indicate that each type of business strategy deploys advanced manufacturing systems (AMS) differently by assimilating and integrating various types of manufacturing technologies. Results suggest that ME owner-managers must assess their firm's level of AMS assimilation in light of their strategic objectives.","[Raymond, Louis] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Gest, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Croteau, Anne-Marie] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada","Raymond, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Gest, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada.",louis.raymond@uqtr.ca; anne-marie.croteau@concordia.ca,,,Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation,This work was supported in part by the Canada Research Chairs Program. and in part by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.,,69,33,35,1,31,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Vulnerability is as important a cause of disasters as the physical events that trigger them. Poor people's vulnerability is often increased when development goes wrong. Thus, development is a contributing factor in the occurrence and scale of disasters. At the same time, disasters, when they happen, cause serious setbacks to development. To get out of the vicious circle, more attention will have to be paid to mitigation and tackling the causes of vulnerability. Formal approaches to mitigation, initiated mainly by the public sector, have often been inefficient and at times have left people more vulnerable. A successful alternative approach, community-based disaster mitigation, can reduce vulnerability by engaging popular approaches, local knowledge and social capital, whilst addressing their weaknesses. Some examples of community-based mitigation are derived as lessons: learn from the past, build relations with communities, encourage participation, involve local builders and artisans, build local capacity, document and share lessons, and influence formal education.","Schumacher Ctr Technol & Dev, Intermediate Technol Dev Grp, Rugby CV23 9QZ, England","Schilderman, T (corresponding author), Schumacher Ctr Technol & Dev, Intermediate Technol Dev Grp, Rugby CV23 9QZ, England.",theos@itdg.org.uk,,,,,,23,43,44,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.","[Yang, Maolin; Jiang, Pingyu] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China","Jiang, PY (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",maolin@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; pjiang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571142],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71571142.,,66,1,1,2,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

If successful, these COPs form rich, knowledge sharing networks; they mobilize a company's global knowledge base, allowing expertise to be applied when and where it is needed with relatively little managerial oversight. Conversely, geographic and cultural silos within COPs may form due to homophily, the social tendency of individuals to connect with similar others. These silos limit knowledge flows and curb the strategic advantage of a global workforce. Through empirical analysis of social network questionnaires and semistructured interviews, the research reported in this paper analyzed network patterns within three COPs to determine if geographic and cultural silos exist, identify structural patterns that defy homophilous trends, and explore why these network-level patterns exist. The research reported in this paper found that, in the absence of intentional organizational structuring and strategic control, silos induced by homophilious behavior were standard for global communities of practice. To encourage knowledge exchange across geographic and cultural boundaries, managers can create mutual task requirements, provide opportunities for connection through integrated training and learning experiences, and encourage workforce mobility among different geographic and cultural locations.

Utility-scale energy prices from solar installations are now comparable to all other forms of generation, and the cost of residential system installation has dropped on average by 70%, before incentives. However, the factors explaining this trend extend beyond falling prices. This paper presents a data-centric framework, grounded in machine-learning theory, to estimate solar installations as a function of social, economic, and demographic factors. By doing so, the authors seek to identify the key influencing factors of a community's adoption of renewable energy. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed data-centric framework, the state of California was selected as a case study. Results indicate that differences in population-adjusted adoption rates can be largely explained by variations in key factors such as income, race, political leaning, average electric power consumption, and solar radiation. By analyzing these differences, decision makers can devise effective incentive mechanisms to nudge homeowners toward improved access to renewable technology.","[Bennett, Jackson; Baker, Aidan; Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, 315 Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Johncox, Emily] Purdue Univ, Div Environm & Ecol Engn, 500 Cent Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Bennett, J (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, 315 Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",benne105@purdue.edu; baker339@purdue.edu; ejohncox@purdue.edu; rnateghi@purdue.edu,,,,,,50,6,6,1,22,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

This study validates the accuracy of an interactive method to investigate daylight brightness perception in IVEs, through comparing collective perception visualizations (introduced as Perceptual Light Maps) across reality and an identical IVE based on real-time rendering in a game engine software. The results show strong consistency between perceptions in reality and IVE. The findings accentuate the adequacy of the proposed method as a surrogate to real environments in investigating brightness perception in daylit spaces.

Despite a lot of research conducted on the enhancement of safety training and removal of hazardous areas, falling accidents remain a major threat for steeplejacks. According to NOISH FACE reports, 75.1% of the fall from height decedents didn't use the Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS), which shows insufficient supervision of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by steeplejacks. Few scholars consider PFAS an important measure to prevent falls and the existing studies on PPE inspections showed that they were unsuitable for the scenarios faced by steeplejacks. This paper proposes an automated inspection method to check PPEs' usage by steeplejacks who are ready for aerial work beside exterior walls. An aerial operation scenario understanding method is proposed, which makes the inspection a preventative control measure and highly robust to noise. A deep-learning based occlusion mitigation method for PPE checking is introduced. We tested the performance of our method under various conditions and the experimental results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of our method to inspect falling prevention measures for steeplejacks and can help facilitate safety supervision.","[Fang, Qi; Ding, Lieyun; Luo, Hanbin; Li, Chengqian] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fang, Qi; Li, Heng; Luo, Xiaochun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Li, H (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bshengli@polyu.edu.hk,"LUO, Xiaochun/AAX-7943-2020; li, chengqian/AAH-7343-2019; Li, Heng/B-2821-2015; Hanbin, Luo/AAH-7441-2019","LUO, Xiaochun/0000-0002-2497-848X; Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Ding, Lieyun/0000-0002-9873-3776",National 12th Five-Year Plan Major Scientific and Technological Issues (NFYPMSTI) [2015BAK33B04]; Research Grants Council of Hong KongHong Kong Research Grants Council [PolyU 152093/14E]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51678265],We are thankful for the financial support of 1) the National 12th Five-Year Plan Major Scientific and Technological Issues (NFYPMSTI) through Grant 2015BAK33B04; 2) The Research Grants Council of Hong Kong grant entitled Proactively Monitoring Construction Progress by Integrating 3D Laser-scanning and BIM (PolyU 152093/14E); and 3) National Science Foundation of China (grant no.51678265).,,66,41,41,5,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

However, there are uncertainties regarding their potential adverse health effects and the extent to which they are currently used. A desk study and interviews with those working across the construction, demolition and product manufacture sectors (n = 59) identified the current state of knowledge regarding nanomaterial use within the built environment. Some nanomaterials are potentially toxic, particularly those based on fibres; others are much less problematic but the evidence base is incomplete. Very little is known regarding the potential for exposure for those working with nano-enabled construction materials. Identifying which construction products contain nanomaterials, and which nanomaterials these might be, is very difficult due to inadequate labelling by product manufacturers. Consequently, those working with nano-enabled products typically have very limited knowledge or awareness of this. Further research is required regarding the toxicology of nanomaterials and the potential for exposure during construction and demolition. Better sharing of the information which is already available is also required through the construction, demolition and manufacture/supply chains.

Currently, QTO is mostly done using manual or 2D method, and practitioners are considering the use of BIM quantity takeoff as an effective alternative to the traditional 2D software takeoff. However, the existing literature does not have adequate studies to confirm that the use of BIM-based QTO is better than the 2D method. Therefore, this paper aims to expand and improve the existing literature into a more detailed analysis of each element to investigate that BIM is indeed a better option of the two QTO methods. Design/methodology/approach A total of 19 factors in four broad categories, i.e. timely decision making, accuracy, collaboration, and level of details were identified to draw a significant comparison between the two procedures, i.e. BIM-based quantity takeoff and traditional 2D takeoff. Surveys and case study are used to collect data for analysis to achieve the research goals. Findings The questionnaire survey showed that using BIM for the QTO process has significant benefits in achieving higher productivity on takeoff, accuracy, clarity and collaboration among the team members. The case study results also showed improvement in BIM-based QTO by achieving higher accuracy and productivity. Originality/value Understanding the difference between the two QTO processes is a challenging task; therefore, this paper contributes to drawing a comparison line between the two processes by introducing the factors that affect the QTO process.","[Wahab, Abdul; Wang, Jun] Mississippi State Univ, Richard A Rula Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Starkville, MS 39762 USA","Wahab, A (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Richard A Rula Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",aw3050@msstate.edu; jwang@cee.msstate.edu,,,,,,29,1,1,8,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews -in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies- with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of 'BIM for FM' processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies. Some additional requirements for BIM for FM processes were also identified during the verification sessions with industry and are proposed for future research.","[Patacas, Joao; Dawood, Nashwan] Teesside Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Digital Technol, Ctr Sustainable Engn, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Kassem, Mohamad] Northumbria Univ Newcastle, Dept Mech & Construct Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England","Patacas, J (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Digital Technol, Ctr Sustainable Engn, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England.; Kassem, M (corresponding author), Northumbria Univ Newcastle, Dept Mech & Construct Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",j.patacas@tees.ac.uk; n.n.dawood@tees.ac.uk; mohamad.kassem@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,,68,7,7,11,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Understanding the factors that influence the AEC's adoption of BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study provides empirical evidence for the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of Chinese construction industry. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach. Findings - The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more likely to adopt BIM. Originality/value - One of the first to apply the TOE framework to integrate three groups of factors that may explain BIM adoption in China. Such a comprehensive framework provides a much broader perspective of BIM adoption to evaluate the impacts of different antecedent factors. The authors conducted an empirical study based on survey data collected from two different types of companies, i.e., engineering consulting firms and construction firms, representing the two parties in the principal-agent relationship of a construction project.

The fuzzy fault tree analysis method was used to build a reliability analysis model and reveal the failure probabilities of factors in the safety organization management subsystem. Through a questionnaire survey conducted in Wuhan, China, the pivotal importance degrees and average occurrence probabilities of basic factors are figured out. On the basis of that, nine critical factors of the safety organization management subsystem are identified and corresponding improvement measurements are proposed.

This research developed a framework for real-time pro-active safety assistance for mobile crane lifting operations. First, crane poses are reconstructed in real-time based on the critical motions of crane parts captured by a sensor system. Second, as-is lift site conditions are automatically modeled and updated based on point cloud data. Lastly, the risk of colliding the crane parts and lifted load into nearby obstructions is pro-actively analyzed and warnings are provided to the operator through a graphical user interface. A prototype system was developed based on the framework and deployed on a mobile crane.

It is addressed to professionals dealing with the restoration or structural rehabilitation of historical constructions, who need to assess the safety of masonry arches under assigned load distributions. By using it, they can easily produce estimates of the carrying capacity of curved masonry members, and specifically arches of arbitrary shape. A CAD environment, which is very popular among professionals, can be employed to provide a nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS) representation of arch geometry. On the basis of this representation, it is possible to perform both an elastic isogeometric analysis and a limit analysis of the structure up to the collapse load. Moreover, the developed tool is devised for handling the presence of fiber-reinforced polymers reinforcement strips at the extrados and/or intrados. This allows for the design of properly dimensioned reinforcement and its verification according to current building codes. The entire procedure relies upon a sound theoretical background. ArchNURBS is going to be freely distributed as an open-source project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/archnurbs/).

Extracting knowledge from data on near hits (aka. close calls) might warrant better understanding on the root causes that lead to such incidents and eliminate them early in the risk mitigation process. While a close call is a subtle event where workers are in close proximity to a hazard, its frequency depends-among other factors-on poor site layout, a worker's willingness to take risks, limited safety education, and pure coincidence. For these reasons, pioneering organizations have recognized the potential of gathering and analyzing leading indicator data on close calls. However, mostly manual approaches are infrequently performed, subjective due to situational assessment, imprecise in level of detail, and importantly, reactive or inconsistent in effective or timely follow-ups by management. While existing predictive analytics research targets change at strategic levels in the hierarchy of organizations, personalized feedback to strengthen an individual worker's hazard recognition and avoidance skill set is yet missing. This study tackles the bottom of Heinrich's safety pyramid by providing an in-depth quantitative analysis of close calls. Modern positioning technology records trajectory data, whereas computational algorithms automatically generate previously unavailable details to close call events. The derived information is embedded in simplified geometric information models that users on a construction site can retrieve, easily understand, and adapt in existing preventative hazard recognition and control processes. Results from scientific and field experiments demonstrate that the developed system works successfully under the constraints of currently available positioning technology.","[Golovina, Olga; Perschewski, Manuel; Teizer, Jochen; Koenig, Markus] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany","Teizer, J (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",olga.golovina@rub.de; manuel.perschewski@rub.de; jochen.teizer@rub.de; koenig@inf.bi.rub.de,"Teizer, Jochen/AAS-1814-2020","Teizer, Jochen/0000-0001-8071-895X; Konig, Markus/0000-0002-2729-7743","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Innovations for Tomorrow's Production, Services, and Work Program; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF)","This research is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Innovations for Tomorrow's Production, Services, and Work Program as well as by the European Social Fund (ESF).

Construction workers' perceptions of safety climate can form at different levels and vary between subunits. A multilevel safety climate measurement tool was proposed, which identified five important safety agents, i.e. client, principal contractor, supervisor, co-workers, and individual workers. Surveys were conducted at three construction projects commissioned by Fonterra Co-operative Group. A total of 356 participants completed the survey. The data was subject to scale reliability analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that all scales achieved satisfactory internal consistency and the multilevel factorial structure was generally supported. At the organizational level, the tool measures clients' overall safety priority and safety actions, and principal contractors' general commitment to safety. At the group level, the tool measures supervisors' safety actions and safety expectations, and co-workers' general safety values and practices. The tool also measures individual safety responses reflected by safety compliance and safety participation. The measurement tool would help construction organizations to diagnose potential weaknesses in their safety management practices for safety improvement and also help to develop a social and cultural work environment that is supportive of safety at all levels.","[Zhang, Rita Peihua; Lingard, Helen] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Nevin, Steve] Fonterra Cooperat Grp Ltd, POB 33, Temuka 7948, Clandeboye, New Zealand","Zhang, RP (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",rita.zhang@rmit.edu.au,,"Zhang, Rita Peihua/0000-0001-9907-6491; Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390",Fonterra Co-operative Group and Australian Research Council under Linkage Project Grant [LP120200440],This research was jointly supported by the Fonterra Co-operative Group and Australian Research Council under Linkage Project Grant (LP120200440).,,62,31,31,0,89,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The existence and dimensions of a construction project's available locations and site facilities can be varied across the construction stages. Without proper planning, unnecessary facility relocations may be required in each construction stage, resulting in a higher construction cost and longer construction time due to the need to dismantle and set up site facilities. Site layout plans should be optimised using a multiple-stage model to avoid unnecessary changes to facility settings across construction stages, improving efficiency. The proposed site layout problem with multiple construction stages is formulated as a binary-mixed-integer-linear programme, which can be solved by a standard branch-and-bound algorithm using the commercial software package LINGO. The mathematical objective function established in the solution process aims to minimise the total cost, which consists of the material transportation cost between the relevant site facilities and the dismantling, setup and relocation costs for all of the involved site facilities in each construction stage. Numerical examples using the proposed mathematical model to optimise different site layout settings for a construction site are given, including (1) a reference site layout plan using the conventional static single-stage approach, (2) a multiple-stage construction site layout plan and (3) a multiple-stage site layout plan with additional safety design considerations.

However, these relationships have been explored solely using bivariate statistical analysis and thus require more intermediate factors to emphasize the need for monitoring and controlling human error by improving the workplace environment. Moreover, prevalent studies rely heavily on expert experience, which is subjective and creates potential estimation noise. In this study, the mechanism whereby environmental factors influence behavior and its associate factors is learned with an algorithm using a Bayesian network structure. Rather than being simply data-driven, the algorithm initiates learning from prior knowledge, the theoretical causal chain in the cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM), and revises the learning approach against safety inspection data if necessary. The learned Bayesian network shows that human error and incorrect sequencing result from a combination of limited cognitive functions and improper spatial/workmanship arrangements caused by equipment defects, improper design, and management problems. Bridging the gaps in previous studies, the action interface revealed by this study is useful for on-site quality control.

Results identified that of the six components of resilience, students scored highest on building networks, staying healthy, interacting cooperatively and living authentically, and lowest in maintaining perspective. Experience, university policy and the interaction between the university, work and home environments was found to contribute to student resilience. Results also identified that resilience is an antecedent of student wellbeing. A conceptual model of resilience and student wellbeing is presented which draws on the ecological systems model. Universities can actively support student wellbeing by fostering resilience. Resilience can be developed by embedding resilience-building strategies within course structures, learning activities and assessment tasks.

Unsafe conditions and behaviors are considered as the major causes of construction accidents. The current safety inspection of conditions and behaviors heavily rely on human efforts which are limited onsite. To improve the safety performance of the industry, a more efficient approach to identify the unsafe conditions on site is required to supplement the current manual inspection practice. A promising way to supplement the current manual safety inspection is automated and intelligent monitoring/inspection through information and sensing technologies, including localization techniques, environment monitoring, image processing and etc. To assess the potential benefits of contemporary technologies for onsite safety inspection, the authors focused on real-time guardrail detection, as unprotected edges are the ones cause for workers falling from heights. In this paper, the authors developed a safety guardrail detection model based on convolutional neural network (CNN). An augmented data set is generated with the addition of background image to guardrail 3D models and used as training set. Transfer learning is utilized and the Visual Geometry Group architecture with 16 layers (VGG-16) model is adopted to construct the basic features extraction for the neural network. In the CNN implementation, 4000 augmented images were used to train the proposed model, while another 2000 images collected from real construction jobsites and 2000 images from Google were used to validate the proposed model. The proposed CNN-based guardrail detection model obtained a high accuracy of 96.5%. In addition, this study indicates that the synthetic images generated by augment technology can be used to create a large training dataset, and CNN-based image detection algorithm is a promising approach in construction jobsite safety monitoring.","[Kolar, Zdenek; Chen, Hainan; Luo, Xiaowei] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Luo, XW (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xiaowluo@cityu.edu.hk,"luo, xiaowei/AAA-7673-2020; CHEN, Hainan/L-9003-2019","luo, xiaowei/0000-0002-9360-7308; Chen, Hainan/0000-0002-6864-6268",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51408519]; Research Grant CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [21206415]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Funding Programs [JCYJ20150902162946055],"This work was jointly supported by National Science Foundation of China Grant # 51408519, Research Grant Council Grant # 21206415 and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Funding Programs (JCYJ20150902162946055).

The design is therefore restricted to well-known techniques, especially for small constructions. In this paper, the usual stakeholder constraints and possible developments in design practice are considered through the use of real product databases and vocational tools to calculate construction costs. In the first stage, which takes into account cost and energy demand, an integrated approach to building envelope design is detailed, including a semantic system to automate the process. Then an optimization method (a genetic algorithm) is proposed to assess energy performance and the cost of the building envelope. This process is illustrated as a case study for a single family house. The results highlight various optimal solution domains specific to the case study, which can be further managed through a decision support system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The development process follows a four-step method: conceptualization, operationalization, indicator generation, and validation and revision. A pressure-state-practice (PSP) model is developed as an overall framework for developing safety leading indicators. The safety level of a construction project is conceptualized as a high-level abstract construct that can be assessed by state indicators, pressure indicators, and practice indicators. Criterion validity (i. e., concurrent validity and predictive validity), practicability, and cost-effectiveness of the leading indicators were qualitatively tested and supported by the empirical evidence collected from three construction projects. This paper adds to the literature on the development of safety leading indicators for the construction industry. The safety leading indicators developed in this paper provide the construction industry a promising tool to proactively measure safety performance and facilitate safety assessments.

These high-quality 3D meshes have attracted notice from both academicians and industry practitioners in developing virtual environments and simulations. However, photogrammetric generated point clouds and meshes do not allow both user-level and system-level interaction because they do not contain the semantic information to distinguish between objects. Thus, segmenting generated point clouds and meshes and extracting the associated object information is a necessary step. A framework for point cloud and mesh classification and segmentation is presented in this paper. The proposed framework was designed considering photogrammetric data-quality issues and provides a novel way of extracting object information, including (1) individual tree locations and related features and (2) building footprints. Experiments were conducted to rank different point descriptors and evaluate supervised machine-learning algorithms for segmenting photogrammetric generated point clouds. The proposed framework was validated using data collected at the University of Southern California (USC) and the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MUTC).","[Chen, Meida; Soibelman, Lucio] Univ Southern Calif, Sonny Astani Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3620 S Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Feng, Andrew] Univ Southern Calif, Inst Creat Technol, 12015 E Waterfront Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90094 USA; [McAlinden, Ryan] Univ Southern Calif, Inst Creat Technol, Modeling Simulat & Training, 12015 E Waterfront Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90094 USA","Chen, MD (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Sonny Astani Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3620 S Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",meidache@usc.edu; feng@ict.usc.edu; mcalinden@ict.usc.edu; soibelman@usc.edu,,,US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL) [W911NF-14-D-0005],"The project, effort, or work depicted here was or is sponsored by the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) under Contract No. W911NF-14-D-0005.

In the proposed approach, safety scenarios predicted by the simulation model are compared with historical cases within a database to assess safety performance. Then, the simulation model, which combines discrete and continuous simulation to replicate the life cycle of the project, is used to update safety-related measures at specified time intervals. This integrated approach was applied in practice to predict how resource allocation and safety policies of a construction project could affect safety performance and was found capable of assisting managers with the proactive development of strategies designed to improve safety performance.","[Pereira, Estacio; AbouRizk, Simaan] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-203 Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn,9211 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada; [Han, SangUk] Hanyang Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea","AbouRizk, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-203 Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn,9211 116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",estacio@ualherta.ca; sanguk@hanyang.ac.kr; abourizk@ualberta.ca,"Pereira, Estacio/S-9092-2017","Pereira, Estacio/0000-0002-1654-1827; AbouRizk, Simaan/0000-0002-4788-9121",Collaborative Research and Development Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [CRDPJ 492657],"The authors are thankful for the support of our industrial partner.

A correlational research study was designed to achieve the research aim. Data were collected using multiple techniques from 47 completed building projects in Singapore. The curves for describing the relationships between voluntary safety investment, total accident costs, accident frequency rate, and total controllable safety costs were developed using regression techniques. The optimization of voluntary safety investment was conducted using the extreme-value theorem with the objective of finding the minimum level of total controllable safety costs. The results show that the financially minimum voluntary safety investment varies with different levels of safety culture and project hazard. The models developed in this study can be used to estimate the minimum voluntary safety investment for building projects at different safety culture and project hazard levels.

A temporary precast facility was constructed to produce the wall-linings for the tunnels. The facility is operated 24 h a day from Monday to Friday and 12 h on Saturday with 100 workers. To enhance the safety performance within the facility, an experiential learning safety program referred to as See the Difference was implemented in conjunction with other safety interventions, although the program was the glue that held all initiatives together. This paper describes the safety program and examines its effectiveness and contribution it made toward reducing incidents and engendering teamwork within the temporary precast facility. It was observed that the See the Difference program had a positive influence on changing the mindset of the workforce from a fixed one to one of growth, which was developed through a process of coaching. The paper draws on actual practice and presents a novel approach to improving safety through the introduction of an experiential safety program.

This paper presents an approach to quantify such uncertainty, and to rationally incorporate them into estimates of cost contingency. Contrary to the conventional approaches that rely on individual expert's opinion or data from past projects, the proposed approach allows site-specific assessments of the intrinsic geotechnical variability through geostatistical techniques. Such uncertainty can be reduced through geotechnical investigation, and spatial tessellation techniques are proposed to facilitate determination of the optimal locations of new boreholes. Cost-effectiveness of the boreholes can be evaluated based on the corresponding reductions In geotechnical uncertainty and their influence on the budget. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical excavation scenario, where the project costs are affected by uncertainty in the subsurface strata, particularly the rockhead level across the site. Under the specific site conditions, a Pareto frontier is developed to reveal the relationship between the number of boreholes to be drilled and potential savings in contingency budget. Through this approach, the study promotes better utilization of geotechnical information and rational assessments of project risks associated with their variability, which may lead to improved project planning and resource allocation.","[Leung, Yat Fai; Liu, Wenfei; Lei, Yangxue; Hsu, Shu-Chien] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Leung, YF (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",andy.yf.leung@polyu.edu.hk,,"LEUNG, Andy Yat Fai/0000-0002-5995-4218; Hsu, Shu-Chien/0000-0002-7232-9839",Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative RegionHong Kong Research Grants Council [25201214],"The work presented in this paper is financially supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (project no. 25201214).

Prior research has shown that fusing actual and expected 3D spatiothermal models provide valuable information for analyzing performance gaps. Until now, these methods have primarily focused on detecting and localizing potential performance problems without analyzing their associated cost. A reliable assessment of the cost provides an opportunity to conduct cost-benefit analysis for various retrofit alternatives. It also improves current thermographic inspection which relies on visual detection and qualitative interpretation of thermal irregularities. To this end, this paper presents a new 3D thermography-based method for cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency building envelope retrofits. The method builds on energy performance augmented reality (EPAR) modeling which generates and fuses actual and expected 3D spatiothermal models using collections of thermal and digital images. In the resulting EPAR models, first detect and calculate the building areas associated with potential thermal degradations, and then explore the as-is thermal conditions of the associated building assemblies at 3D vertex-level. Next, using the historical climatic data and the recommended R-values, the amount of the unnecessary heat transfer through the detected areas and the monetary benefits from their retrofit are estimated. Finally, the expected energy cost savings were balanced against the cost of implementing insulation retrofit alternatives. Experimental results on two real-world buildings and four hypothetical cases with different geographical conditions show potential of the proposed method in reliably estimating the return on investment from retrofitting thermal performance problems.

We analyze such investment decisions by accounting for both multiple sources of uncertainty and the time-to-build aspect. The latter feature arises in the energy and transportation sectors, because investors can decide the rate at which the project is completed. Furthermore, two explicit sources of uncertainty represent the discounted cash inflows and outflows of the completed project. We use a finite-difference scheme to solve numerically the option value and the optimal investment threshold. Somewhat counter-intuitively, with a relatively long time to build, a reduction in the growth rate of the discounted operating cost may actually lower the investment threshold. This is contrary to the outcome when the stepwise aspect is ignored in a model with uncertain price and cost. Hence, research and development efforts to enhance emerging technologies may be more relevant for infrastructure projects with long lead times.","[Kauppinen, Lauri; Salo, Ahti] Aalto Univ, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada","Siddiqui, AS (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England.",ljikaupp@gmail.com; afzal.siddiqui@ucl.ac.uk; ahti.salo@aalto.fi,"Salo, Ahti/G-2412-2013","Salo, Ahti/0000-0003-1526-7923; Siddiqui, Afzal/0000-0003-1841-1310",project Platform Value Now - Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland [293446]; HEC Montreal,"This work was supported by the project Platform Value Now, funded by the Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland under Grant 293446.

However, existing enabling technologies still suffer from a lack of economic feasibility, as well as technological compatibility with equipment fleets that are outdated or that consist of diverse manufacturers' models. In this context, this paper examines the feasibility of measuring the operational efficiency of equipment using low-cost accelerometers. Acceleration data in three axes were collected from a real-world operation of excavators that performed various duty cycles. Multiple features were calculated from acceleration data, and several classifiers using these features were tested to classify equipment operation into engine-off, idling, and working modes. An accuracy of over 93% was obtained in the classification of excavators' operation. This result has demonstrated that the application of low-cost accelerometers has the potential to provide a robust system to automatically measure the operational efficiency of construction equipment without any connection to its legacy engine system.","[Ahn, Changbum R.] Univ Nebraska, Charles Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, Construct Engn & Management Div, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Lee, SangHyun] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pena-Mora, Feniosky] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Ahn, CR (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Charles Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, Construct Engn & Management Div, 113 Nebraska Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",cahn2@unl.edu; shdpm@umich.edu; feniosky@columbia.edu,"Ahn, Changbum R/R-6837-2017; Ahn, Changbum Ryan/AAG-6251-2019","Ahn, Changbum R/0000-0002-6733-2216; Ahn, Changbum Ryan/0000-0002-6733-2216; Lee, SangHyun/0000-0002-2246-7440",,,,30,24,24,1,25,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

Through analyzing the existing standards and the IFC standard, the problems of using the IFC standard are identified and the solutions are explored. An information requirement model for construction cost estimating for tendering in China was established, which includes seven aspects of information entities. Then each aspect of the information was expressed by using the IFC standard to verify the completeness of the IFC standard and to establish the IFC-based information model. As a conclusion, the IFC standard can be used to express the information for the construction cost estimating for tendering in China as a whole, but some extensions in the form of proxy elements and property sets are needed. The established information model can be applied to the development of a construction cost estimating software. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As light rail transit construction projects have typically been promoted as Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) projects, the private companies involved need to perform economic feasibility analysis by estimating life cycle cost (LCC) quickly and accurately. The success of a project greatly depends on the accurate analysis of the initial investment cost from the stages of design through construction, operating cost for the stages of operation and maintenance, and profits from operation. While such an LCC analysis requires a variety of experience with construction projects, a significant base of performance data and related expertise, Korean companies have no experience in the field of light rail transit construction, and the operating data is meager. With a lack of experience and data, the parties involved with light rail transit construction projects have come up with diverse costs estimates based on highly inaccurate data. Accordingly, it is urgent that there is a method to support the parties involved with light rail transit projects, particularly the private companies taking responsibility for investment in and operation of the light rail transit. This research aims to estimate the approximate construction cost of light rail transit structures (e.g. bridge, tunnel, etc.) and to develop an economic feasibility analysis system for light rail transit structures taking LCC into account based on the already calculated cost in order to support a reasonable decision-making process in relation with light rail transit construction projects. To estimate construction cost, major factors that have a great influence on the construction cost of the structure were first selected, and then a database for each unit cost was built. Using the system, a user can automatically calculate the construction cost by selecting the structure type and the engineering technique. For the LCC analysis, research of the literature was conducted, and based on the research an LCC analysis procedure and model was determined. In addition, by reviewing the uncertainty factors and the cost classification system appropriate for the construction of a light rail transit structure, the LCC analysis algorithm was written. Using the algorithm, LCC analysis of a bridge for a light rail transit was conducted to verify the feasibility of the algorithm that can provide information used for major decision-making, based on which private companies can determine whether or not to participate in a light rail transit construction project. This research has its own significance, both as a system to estimate construction cost for a light rail transit project based on diverse information, and as a system to analyze economic feasibility for LCC prediction.

A construction worker has a probability of 1-in-200 of dying on the job during a 45-year career, mainly due to fires, falls, and being struck by or caught between objects. Hence, employers must ensure their workers wear personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular hardhats, if they are at risk of falling, being struck by falling objects, hitting their heads on static objects, or coming in proximity to electrical hazards. However, monitoring the presence and proper use of hardhats becomes inefficient when safety officers must survey large areas and a considerable number of workers. Using images captured from indoor jobsites, this paper evaluates existing computer vision techniques, namely object detection and color-based segmentation tools, used to rapidly detect if workers are wearing hardhats. Experiments are conducted and the results highlight the potential of cascade classifiers, in particular, to accurately, precisely, and rapidly detect hardhats under different scenarios and for repetitive runs, and the potential of color-based segmentation to eliminate false detections.","[Mneymneh, Bahaa Eddine; Abbas, Mohamad; Khoury, Hiam] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon","Khoury, H (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",hiam.khoury@aub.edu.lb,,,AUB's University Research Board (URB),"The presented work was supported by AUB's University Research Board (URB).

Their emergence is attributable to many economic and social factors, but governmental support and the availability of funding are two indispensable ones if startups want to scale up their operations. While information and communication technologies form the core of the innovative products and services, the built environment sector has also experienced a good share of benefits although the construction and real-estate industries have been rather conservative. Due to the inherent characteristics of the two pillar industries of the current economy, startups meet with joys and tears in their growth. The joys come from their discovery of the large and challenging scope startups can contribute throughout the life cycle of construction projects. Tears are shed when startups encounter barriers, such as institutionalized practices giving rise to problems an inexperienced startup must tackle. This study aims to identify the characteristics of the built environment sector and barriers as they relate to startup growth. In an exploratory study carried out in Hong Kong, the semistructured interviewing technique was used to collect views and data on the status quo of eight startups, the collective activities of which span the whole spectrum of the built environment sector. The interview findings reflect the features of the sector well with additional insight worth the attention of policy makers and construction managers whose work will increasingly involve startups.","[Lam, Patrick T.

BIM focuses on micro-level representation of buildings themselves, and GIS provide macro-level representation of the external environments of buildings. Moreover, their combination can establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, BIM leads and GIS supports, GIS leads and BIM supports, and BIM and GIS are equally involved, are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve its systematic integration and application to the urban built environment. This review can serve as a roadmap for researchers who focus on studies of BIM-GIS integration in the sustainable built environment.","[Wang, Hao; Pan, Yisha] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiaochun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wang, H (corresponding author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",holy.wong@connect.polyu.hk; eric.xiaochun.luo@polyu.edu.hk,"LUO, Xiaochun/AAX-7943-2020","LUO, Xiaochun/0000-0002-2497-848X; Wang, Hao/0000-0003-1421-5953","Beijing Social Science Foundation [17GLB030]; Youth Talents Programme of the Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP1711]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [QL18012]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [19C10034038]","The authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to the Beijing Social Science Foundation (17GLB030), the Youth Talents Programme of the Central University of Finance and Economics (QYP1711), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (QL18012), and the Humanities and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (19C10034038) for funding support for the research project on which this paper is based.",,82,45,47,22,223,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

While a centralized programme structure is often assumed both in literature and in practice, we argue that programme structure should be a strategic decision contingent upon programme environment. Following the structural contingency theory, we characterise programme environment by two dimensions of the programme environment as programme authority over the participating organizations and homogeneity of the business processes among the participating organizations. Based on these two dimensions, we develop an authority-homogeneity matrix. Given a programme of low authority and low homogeneity, the programme should adopt a matching decentralized structure supported by standard process and data interfaces. By comparing two programme cases, we demonstrate how a decentralized approach can work for a LSMS IS-based change programme while a centralized programme structure fails. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study proposes that risk allocation in the contract between the client and contractor will impact the conflict negotiation costs and managerial controls of the client will moderate this relationship. Hypotheses were tested with a sample of 226 projects collected from Chinese construction firms. The results show that conflict negotiation costs will increase with more risks allocated to the contractor. Moreover, behavior control of the client strengthens this positive relationship but outcome control weakens it. These findings offer a nuanced understanding of how conflict negotiation costs occur and contribute to the project governance literature by exploring how ex-post governance (managerial control) aligns with exante governance (risk allocation). Practitioners can benefit from this study by understanding how to formulate risk allocation strategies and exercise different managerial controls.","[Tang, Yinqiu; Chen, Yongqiang] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Hua, Yuanyuan] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Econ & Management Engn, 1 Zhanlanguan Rd, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yongcheng] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St East, Manchester M13 9SS, Lancs, England","Hua, YY (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Econ & Management Engn, 1 Zhanlanguan Rd, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",tangyinqiu@tju.edu.cn; symbolpmc@vip.sina.com; huayuanyuan@bucea.edu.cn; tjufyc@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71871154, 71572124]","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants No. 71871154 and 71572124.

Multiunit projects constitute a special case of repetitive projects. They consist in the realization of many different, when it comes to size, types of residential, commercial, industrial buildings or engineering structures. Due to the specific character of construction works, actual schedules of such projects should not only take into account real costs of construction, but also be subject to specific restrictions, e.g. deadlines for the completion of units imposed by the investor. To solve the NP-hard problem of choosing the order of units' construction there was metaheuristic algorithm of simulated annealing used. The objective function in the presented optimization model was the total value of the project cost determined on the basis of the mathematical programming model, taking into account direct and indirect costs, costs of missing deadlines and costs of work group discontinuities. In the article, an experimental analysis of the proposed method of solving the optimization task was carried out in a model that showed high efficiency in obtaining suboptimal solutions. In addition, the operation of the proposed model has been presented on a calculation example. The results obtained in it are fully satisfying.","[Podolski, Michal] Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Wroclaw, Poland; [Sroka, Bartlomiej] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Krakow, Poland","Podolski, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Wroclaw, Poland.",michal.podolski@pwr.edu.pl,"Podolski, Michal/AAU-2825-2021","Podolski, Michal/0000-0003-3795-5823; Sroka, Bartlomiej/0000-0001-8845-2789",,,,26,5,5,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The purpose of this paper is to present a framework to estimate and minimize the carbon emissions of the concrete placing operation through identifying the optimal number of pumps and the inter-arrival time of truck mixers. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework integrates discrete event simulation and multi-objective optimization to estimate and minimize the carbon emission, costs and production rate of the concrete placing operation. An actual construction project is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the sensitivity of the results to variations in modeling parameters including the ratio of idle to non-idle emission rates of equipment and the activity duration distributions. Findings The results of the case study highlight that variations in the number of pumps and inter-arrival time of truck mixers significantly affect the carbon emissions, cost and production rate of the concrete placing operation. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis show that variations in the ratio of idle to non-idle emission rates for pumps and truck mixers have little effects on the selected setting for the project. This is contrary to the effect of uncertainty in the activity duration distributions, which was found to be significant. Originality/value Results of this study provide an insight into the trade-off between carbon emissions, cost and production rate of the concrete placing operation.","[Nadoushani, Zahra Sadat Moussavi; Rey, David] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Akbarnezhad, Ali] Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Akbarnezhad, A (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Civil Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Ali.Nezhad@sydney.edu.au,"Rey, David/AAW-8123-2020","Rey, David/0000-0002-1577-3845; akbarnezhad, ali/0000-0003-4327-6587; Akbar Nezhad, Ali/0000-0002-9793-3215",,,,36,1,1,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

As this transfers a major opportunity to determine the component's production cost to the development supplier, the manufacturer has to ensure that the supplier makes an effort to keep production costs low. During the production phase, the development supplier is not necessarily the source of supply, since there may be other suppliers who can produce the component at a lower cost. The challenge for the manufacturer is to choose a sourcing strategy that allows to profit from the cost advantage of these suppliers while making sure that the cost reduction potential during component development is exploited as well. Building on an analytical model of the supply chain, we compare various sourcing and contracting strategies with respect to their ability to resolve this tradeoff. The results suggest that dual sourcing with a combined wholesale price and licensing agreement or single sourcing with subcontracting dominate various other strategies. We reflect our findings in view of several real-world development and supply agreements.","[Mensendiek, Arne; Mitri, Rabab] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany","Mensendiek, A (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",amensendiek@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de; rabab.mitri@gmail.com,,,,,,46,2,2,0,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Initially, the approach worked well. The effort fell into disfavor after a succession of mission failures between 1999 and 2002. Following those failures, NASA officials returned to a more traditional systems management approach for the next set of projects in the low-cost line. Based on an analysis of thirty-one projects with launch dates between 1992 and 2008, this article provides a history of NASA's experience with low-cost innovation. It suggests that both the initial team-based approach and the systems management approach have merit so long as managers pay close attention to the requirements each approach imposes. Analysis further suggests that the troubled projects suffered from a misapplication of management techniques developed for the team-based approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

To prevent environmental problems effectively, megaprojects require proactive environmental initiatives based on individual, voluntary, and discretionary behaviors, which are also known as organizational citizenship behaviors for the environment (OCBEs). The OCBEs (e.g., sharing knowledge to prevent pollution, making suggestions to minimize waste) play an important role in improving megaproject environmental performance. However, this line of research is still in its infancy and the institutional-psychological mechanism leading megaproject practitioners to engage in OCBEs is largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an individual-level analysis that investigates how institutional pressures impact project practitioners' OCBEs according to the survey data collected from China's megaprojects. The results obtained by partial least-squares analysis indicate that both mimetic and normative pressures have a significant impact on OCBEs, and such relationships are partially mediated by organizational support. Nevertheless, this paper did not find evidence for a significant impact from coercive pressures. These findings provide a new insight into making use of institutional forces to stimulate the emergence of OCBEs, improving the environmental performance in megaprojects.","[Wang, Ge] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, 1 Shizishan St, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [He, Qinghua] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Res Inst Complex Engn & Management, 1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Xia, Bo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Meng, Xianhai] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, David Keir Bldg,Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wu, Peng] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","He, QH (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Res Inst Complex Engn & Management, 1500 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",ge_wang@yeah.net; heqinghua@263.net; paul.xia@qut.edu.au; x.meng@qub.ac.uk; peng.wu@curtin.edu.au,"Wang, Ge/AAY-5473-2021; Xia, Bo/J-1355-2012","Xia, Bo/0000-0001-7694-4743; Wang, Ge/0000-0001-5417-6819; wu, peng/0000-0002-3793-0653","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571137, 71471136, 71390523]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662018QD006]","This paper is based on an earlier paper presented at the EPOC-MW 2017 Conference, Fallen Leaf Lake, California.

A contractor's competitive strategy thus determines its success or failure in different competitive environments. This study aims to explore the contingency relationships between the competitive environments, business strategies adopted and contractors' subsequent performance in the construction industry. The study was based on Porter's competitive-force framework to analyse competitive environments in the construction industry, together with the modified version of Porter's generic strategies of cost leadership and differentiation. The performance measure was based on the profit margin on turnover. Five hypotheses were developed and tested by comparing the resultant performances of two generic strategies with five competitive forces. Questionnaires were used to collect data to test the five hypotheses. Significant interactions were found between three industrial competitive forces (the threat of new entrants, the intensity of rivalry among competitors, and the bargaining power of clients) and two business strategies (the low-cost strategy and the differentiation strategy). The main effects were found to be significant for the remaining two competitive forces (the threat of a substitute and the bargaining power of subcontractors and suppliers). In general, these results confirm the proposition made by this study that contingency relationships exist among three industrial competitive forces, low-cost and differentiation strategies, and contractors' performance.

Since buildings account for approximately 40% of UK energy demand, energy use in buildings will need to be transformed if ambitious climate policy objectives are to be met. In the context of wider energy system change, the needs are for greater efficiency, greater use of electric technologies such as heat pumps as electricity become cleaner, and the use of renewable heat such as biomass. At the same time, the introduction of smart technology offers new opportunities to measure and evaluate changes in demand patterns and the impact of policy interventions. The paper notes that the technical and social dimensions of radical decarbonisation are intimately intertwined. Therefore, social and economic research has a vital role to play in supporting the design and implementation of effective policy, taking advantage of new data-collection opportunities. Drawing on lessons from other policy domains, the paper explores the role that rigorous policy evaluation techniques, little used in the energy domain, could play. It identifies a range of concerns, relating to the political sphere, policy delivery and consumer acceptance, that would need to be addressed.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 2AZ, England","Skea, J (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, S Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",j.skea@ic.ac.uk,,,Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G007748/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K00154X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This paper was written while the author was Research Director of the UK Energy Research Centre, supported by the Natural Environment Research Council under Award NE/G007748/1.",,37,20,20,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

To evaluate the applicability of this approach, 89 participants' lighting preferences, performance (reading speed and comprehension), personality traits, and environmental views were collected in IVEs. BPS tools were used to translate participants' lighting preferences into quantitative lux distributions, which were then used to evaluate alternative designs and make user-centered design decisions. The results of the experimental study show that participants preferred to have maximum simulated daylighting compared to electric lighting. Additionally, participants with some or maximum levels of simulated daylighting performed significantly better on the assigned reading and comprehension tasks than those that did not have any simulated daylighting available. Lastly, by collecting participant personality traits, it was observed that extroverts are significantly more likely to prefer maximum lighting (maximum electric lighting and simulated daylighting) compared to other people. To demonstrate how the collected data and results could be used during the design phase of buildings, as one example, a design case study is presented, in which the design of the same office space (as the experiment) is improved to meet participants' lighting preferences and increase the available simulated daylighting.","[Heydarian, Arsalan; Pantazis, Evangelos; Becerik-Gerber, Burcin] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Wang, Alan] Univ Southern Calif, Sch Architecture, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Gerber, David] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn Courtesy Joint, Sch Architecture, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Gerber, D (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn Courtesy Joint, Sch Architecture, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",heydaria@usc.edu; epantazi@usc.edu; alanwang@usc.edu; dgerber@usc.edu; becerik@usc.edu,"Becerik-Gerber, Burcin/D-6897-2013","Becerik-Gerber, Burcin/0000-0001-8648-0989",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1231001]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1231001] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1231001.

Data were collected through ethnographic studies on the practice of managing heat stress on thirty-six construction sites in Hong Kong and Chonqing in mainland China. Two core concepts, institutions and institutional logics, are generated and defined to explain why safety rules do not necessarily produce safety behaviours. At society level, we explicated two pairs of institutional logics: the religion logics (Confucianism vs. pragmatism) and the market logics (rational market vs. individualism). At project organizational level, two logics of processing safety in production are explicated: a protection logic in the Chongqing context and a production logic in the Hong Kong context. The concepts and sub-concepts are compared to existing business literature for clarification of scopes. Empirical findings of the study suggest safety intervention needs to redirect its focus from promoting safety alone to addressing the institutional logics of the entire organization and its societal context practised by multiple levels of actors. We conclude that safety research would benefit from redirecting its focus of analysis from discourses, interviews or surveys to authenticated cases reconstructed through triangulation of actors' discourses at multiple levels of an organization, third-party observation, physiological data and objective measurement of the work environment. Methodologically, this paper provides a detailed guidance for conducting grounded theory research with a focus of conceptualization.","[Jia, Andrea Yunyan] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Rowlinson, Steve] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rowlinson, Steve; Xu, Mengnan; Li, Baizhan] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Loosemore, Martin] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Xu, Mengnan; Li, Baizhan] Chongqing Univ, Coll Urban Construct & Environm Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Gibb, Alistair] Loughborough Univ, Sch Civil & Bldg Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England","Jia, AY (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Perth, WA, Australia.",yunyanbright@gmail.com,,"Rowlinson, Steve/0000-0001-5682-8710; Loosemore, Martin/0000-0002-3189-4655",,,,94,21,21,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Although considerable attention has been paid to developing and using new types of safety performance indicators, contractor safety has traditionally been measured and managed through lagging indicators. Alternatively, risk mitigation measures can be used to predict safety performance as leading indicators. Several research studies have been performed on safety leading indicators; however, no research has empirically validated the predictive validity of candidate indicators. To address this knowledge gap, empirical data were used to measure both potential safety leading and lagging indicators in an effort to test the hypothesis that variability in candidate safety leading indicators predicts variability in lagging indicators of safety performance. A total of 261 contractors were included in the study, with more than 60,000 data points. Using principal factor analysis, model building, and regression, factors with predictive power were identified. The predicted total recordable incident rate (TRIR) and severity rate (SR) provided strong correlation with the actual TRIR and SR, with coefficients of 0.7251 and 0.5338, respectively. The models of predictive TRIR and SR were validated and suggest a good fit when applied to new contractor safety data set. The models can be used as new safety leading indicators that provide warning signs for weakness in contractor safety performance. Consequently, clients can use the results to implement adaptive risk mitigation, reduce incidents, and continuously improve contractor safety performance. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by empirically identifying safety leading indicators, testing their efficacy, and validating the resulting models. This research set a foundation for establishing quantitative safety leading indicators in the construction industry in the future for other forms of project outcomes.","[Salas, Rico] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Laing ORourke Ctr Construct Engn & Technol, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Hallowell, Matthew] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Construct Engn, 428 UCB,1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Salas, R (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Laing ORourke Ctr Construct Engn & Technol, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",rs796@cam.ac.uk; matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu,"Hallowell, Matthew R/G-7918-2016","Salas, Rico/0000-0002-4692-8416",University of Cambridge Engineering Department,"The authors would like to thank participating oil and gas companies and University of Cambridge Engineering Department for providing guidance and support for this research.

Planners often are overly optimistic about the chance of success while underestimating risks. The purpose of this paper is to examine the hypothesis that these biases are from the difficulties most decision makers face when interpreting probabilistic information. Design/methodology/approach Three behavioral experiments were conducted to test the theoretical fitness of the paradigms proposed by the description-experience gap literature, namely, the sampling errors effect, the recency effect and statistical information format. College students were recruited to participate in a series of estimating tasks. And their estimating results were compared given different levels of information completeness. Findings It was found that the existing paradigms could predict risk decision making in the risk-averse estimating scenarios where test subjects were required to give a relatively conservative estimate, but they seemed to be less effective in predicting decisions in the risk-seeking estimating scenario, where test subjects were asked to give a relatively aggressive estimate. Originality/value Based on these findings, an integrative model is proposed to explain the observations pertaining to aggressive planning in capital projects. Two dimensions are deemed to be relevant: including risk-taking intentions, and an information uncertainty continuum that ranges from an implicit experience-based information representation to an explicit description-based information representation.","[Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wang, Qi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Shi, Qian] Tongji Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",eric.du@essie.ufl.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1761459, 1761950]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71771178]","This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grants 1761459 and 1761950, and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) under Grant 71771178.

Because of this, different methodologies for creating an accurate estimate have been studied over decades. Many methodologies produce accurate results, when used properly. However, software projects still suffer from inaccurate estimates. The disparity may result from organisational hindrances. This paper focuses on top management support (TMS) for software cost estimation (SCE). The purpose of this paper is to identify current practices and attitudes of top management involvement in SCE, and to analyse the relationship between these two and project success. Design/methodology/approach - A list of 16 TMS practices for SCE has been developed. A survey was conducted to capture the frequency of use and the experienced importance of support practices. Data has been collected from 114 software professionals in Finland. Correlations between the frequency of use, attitudes and project success were analysed. Findings - Top management invests a significant amount of attention in SCE. The extent of use and experienced importance do not correlate strongly with each other or project success. Research limitations/implications - The results may lack generalisability. Researchers are encouraged to validate the results with further studies. Practical implications - Software professionals invite senior managers to participate in SCE. A list of practices for participating is provided. Originality/value - This paper suggests a list of 16 TMS practices for SCE. The paper also reports on the extent of use and experienced importance of practices, and the correlations between these two and project success.","[Rahikkala, Jurka] Vaadin Ltd, Turku, Finland; [Leppanen, Ville; Ruohonen, Jukka; Holvitie, Johannes] Univ Turku, Dept Informat Technol, Turku, Finland","Rahikkala, J (corresponding author), Vaadin Ltd, Turku, Finland.",jurka.rahikkala@gmail.com,,"Leppanen, Ville/0000-0001-5296-677X; Ruohonen, Jukka/0000-0001-5147-3084",,,,31,7,7,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8378,1753-8386,,INT J MANAG PROJ BUS,Int.

Research led by Flyvbjerg has suggested that misrepresentation and optimism bias are primary causes for overruns. While Flyvbjerg's research has made a significant contribution to ameliorating understanding as to why economic infrastructure projects experience overruns, it does not adequately explain why this is the case for such social infrastructure. In addressing this shortcoming, case studies are used to determine the intermediary events and actions that contributed to project cost overruns. The pathogens, events, and actions that contributed to overruns are identified and analyzed. The analysis of the cases' findings led to the propagation of a nomological framework for social infrastructure project overruns. Acknowledgment of the systemic pathogenic influences has enabled the establishment of an orthodoxy, which provides an impetus for addressing the issues needed to improve the performance of social infrastructure projects.","[Love, Peter E.

To have realistic and useful cost estimates based on historical production rates, such production rate data should be augmented with historical contextual information that depict conditions under which activity production rates were achieved in past projects. This information is needed in determining which production rate to use among alternates for a similar activity existing in a new bid. Estimators need contextual information especially when they are unfamiliar with the work being estimated. Hence, such information items need to be identified, collected, and stored for estimators' use in new projects. This paper details a construction-method specific and an extensible approach that is developed for enabling cost estimators to define contextual information items that need to be collected on job sites and stored as part of project histories. Based on this approach, the writers implemented a prototype system, called as ContextGen, and performed user-tests with estimators with different experience levels. Results showed that the developed approach captures method-specific information needs of estimators and is extensible to incorporate new contextual information items that can have different data representations. The developed approach is also precise in retrieving contextual information items specific to a construction method from a set of predefined contextual information items available in a library.","[Kiziltas, Semiha; Akinci, Burcu] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kiziltas, Semiha] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey","Akinci, B (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",semiha@metu.edu.tr; bakinci@cmu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0448170],"The project is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, Grant No. 0448170.

Safety has always been advocated by many construction companies, and they have been working hard to make sure their employees are protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training and evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of technical features and types that could be implemented in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated, while significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and identification, safety training and education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works. It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating the research and practice frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the latest VR/AR applications.","[Li, Xiao; Chi, Hung-Lin; Chan, Albert P.

However, the challenge has been translating social equity concerns into metrics that are usable in engineering analyses. In this case study, the authors aim to identify such metrics that can be subsequently used by engineers who seek to make equity-informed infrastructure construction, replacement, and rehabilitation decisions. Combining geospatial and statistical techniques on publicly available data sources, this research proposes a quantitative framework for how to incorporate social equity metrics into infrastructure analyses. The feasibility of this framework is analyzed in the case of Pennsylvania's bridge system. This feasibility study finds that selection effects (i.e., factors that drive bridge siting) are stronger than treatment effects (i.e., changes that occur after bridge construction) of bridges on social equity. Consistent variables are also identified as correlated with such effects (e.g., demographic and, to a lesser degree, family variables). Overall, this research proposes measures and an approach that helps local government transportation agencies better incorporate social equity into infrastructure construction, replacement and rehabilitation.

Through a three-stage review process, relevant papers were selected and examined based on the benefits analysis methods and the results produced. The findings show that nine benefit analysis methods are used to measure the benefits of IT which could be tangible benefits or intangible benefits. The results indicate that the benchmarking and weighted scoring models are the most popular analytical method used to produce quantifiable results of benefits measured. The shortfalls of the benefit analysis methods are discussed, and future research agenda is recommended to ensure comprehensive results from benefit measurements, Further, a conceptual integration model is developed to guide future research when addressing the shortfalls of the respective benefit analysis methods through the stages of implementation of IT.","[Yevu, Sitsofe Kwame] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Bldg & Real Estate Dept, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Ann T.

Current fuzzy approaches to risk assessment in such projects specifically require improvements in the reliability and aggregation process of experts' judgments as well as the incorporation of project phase-based risk assessment to comprehend the sources of the risks and their corresponding effects on cost overruns. In response, this study proposes a modified fuzzy group decision-making approach (FGDMA) and assesses cost overrun risks considering different project phases [(1)design and procurement, and (2)construction and commissioning] of the power plant projects of varying types, sizes/capacities, and contracts. The proposed methodology is applied to 10 different project scenarios to better understand the context of project risks and their profile and identify the critical cost overrun risks involved. This study will aid the comprehensive assessment of risks and increase the accuracy of project budgeting and contingency allocation decisions.","[Islam, Muhammad Saiful; Nepal, Madhav P.; Skitmore, Martin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia","Nepal, MP (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",muhammadsaiful.islam@hdr.qut.edu.au; madhav.nepal@qut.edu.au; rm.skitmore@qut.edu.au,"Islam, Muhammad Saiful/ABE-4103-2020; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012; saiful'mridha, the/ABF-8549-2020; Nepal, Madhav/AAW-9947-2020","Islam, Muhammad Saiful/0000-0002-6414-1211; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; Nepal, Madhav/0000-0001-8465-8886",,,,59,10,10,7,22,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

In order to help provide the construction industry with an additional incentive to adopt more automation, an investigation was undertaken to assess the effects of digital fabrication (dfab) on productivity by analyzing the cost and time required for the construction of a robotically-fabricated complex concrete wall onsite. After defining the different tasks for the conventional and robotically fabricated concrete wall, data was collected from different sources and used in a simulation to describe the distribution of time and cost for the different construction scenarios. In the example, it was found that productivity is higher when the robotic construction method is used for complex walls, indicating that it is possible to obtain significant economic benefit from the use of additive dfab to construct complex structures. Further research is required to assess the social impacts of using dfab.","[de Soto, Borja Garcia] New York Univ Abu Dhabi NYUAD, Div Engn, Saadiyat Isl, Expt Res Bldg,POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [de Soto, Borja Garcia] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, 6 MetroTech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Agusti-Juan, Isolda; Habert, Guillaume; Adey, Bryan T.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hunhevicz, Jens; Joss, Samuel; Graser, Konrad] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, NCCR Digital Fabricat, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","de Soto, BG (corresponding author), New York Univ Abu Dhabi NYUAD, Div Engn, Saadiyat Isl, Expt Res Bldg,POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",garcia.de.soto@nyu.edu,"de Soto, Borja Garcia/AAA-1348-2019; , Habert/Q-3853-2019","de Soto, Borja Garcia/0000-0002-9613-8105; , Habert/0000-0003-3533-7896; Agusti Juan, Isolda/0000-0002-2385-6210; Adey, Bryan Tyrone/0000-0002-4932-5901; Hunhevicz, Jens Juri/0000-0002-1296-2384","National Centre of Competence in Research, NCCR Digital Fabrication - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40_141853]","This research was supported by the National Centre of Competence in Research, NCCR Digital Fabrication, which was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (project number 51NF40_141853).

In this paper, two concepts of time-cost trade-off and resource leveling and allocation have been embedded in a stochastic multiobjective optimization model which minimizes the total project time, cost, and resource moments. In the proposed time-cost-resource utilization optimization (TCRO) model, time and cost variables are considered to be fuzzy, to increase the flexibility for decision makers when using the model outputs. Application of fuzzy set theory in this study helps managers/planners to take these uncertainties into account and provide an optimal balance of time, cost, and resource utilization during the project execution. The fuzzy variables are discretized to represent different options for each activity. Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has been used to solve the optimization problem. Results of the TCRO model for two different case studies of construction projects are presented in the paper. Total time and costs of the two case studies in the Pareto front solutions of the TCRO model cover more than 85% of the ranges of total time and costs of solutions of the biobjective time-cost optimization (TCO) model. The results show that adding the resource leveling capability to the previously developed TCO models provides more practical solutions in terms of resource allocation and utilization, which makes this research relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers.","[Zahraie, Banafsheh] Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Excellence Infrastruct Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Tavakolan, Mehdi] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA","Zahraie, B (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Excellence Infrastruct Engn, Tehran, Iran.",bzahraie@ut.ac.ir; mt2568@columbia.edu,"Tavakolan, Mehdi/O-6945-2018; Zahraie, Banafsheh/D-9265-2017","Tavakolan, Mehdi/0000-0002-2227-8009; Zahraie, Banafsheh/0000-0003-3557-9254",,,,20,55,57,2,23,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, no detailed information is available concerning the type of PD that improves their performance. In addition, it is still uncertain how much changes in institutional dimensions influence the effectiveness of PD. Therefore, the aim is to resolve this issue by establishing a model that shows the extent of this influence. Design/methodology/approach The generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator is used to model the PD strategies of 86 LCFs in Malaysia over 14 years (2003-2016) and its impact on productivity and profitability performance. Findings Unrelated diversification (UD) decreased firm performance in 2003-2016, while related diversification (RD) had a positive impact during the more liberal 2010-2016 phase. The models show that the impact of PD is highly dependent on changes in institutional dimensions. Practical implications Firstly, managers may adjust the type of PD and its level of diversification to improve firm performance. Secondly, they may devise PD strategies based on changes in institutional dimensions to maximise their effectiveness. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by determining the optimal amount of PD (including RD and UD) and its impact on performance. Secondly, the study is the first to investigate the moderating relationship of the institutional dimensions of economic and regulatory institutions on PD-firm performance. Thirdly, the study is the first to explore the components of technical-scale-scope economies (movement towards and around the production frontier), this being crucial to the strategy that was only conjectured in previous studies.","[Azman, Mohd Azrai] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Architecture Planning & Surveying, Sarawak Branch, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [Hon, Carol K.

The study presents three types of design engineers each, exhibiting particular tendencies when faced with health and safety considerations during design. The discovery of these tendencies pose important implications for education and professional institutions and practical measures are suggested to help design engineers manage their tendencies to be more conducive to ensuring improved health and safety performance. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory design method was used - grounded theory, to include 13, in-depth, one-to-one interviews with design engineers, representing junior staff, middle and senior management. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how designers think and behave when asked to consider health and safety issues during the design process. It identifies three group types of designers: doers, receivers and givers, who will exhibit their particular tendencies based on how they view and understand the term health and safety. Research limitations/implications - The data obtained were from design engineers only, and therefore the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for those involved in the creation and development of designers e.g., educators and professional bodies. The data forms the basis for helping designers to manage their perceptions towards the term health and safety and thus, their tendencies exhibited in their behaviour. Originality/value - This paper contributes to new understanding of designers' behaviour and considers the significance of how designers' views of health and safety will influence their behaviour.","[Morrow, Susan; Hare, Billy; Cameron, Iain] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland","Morrow, S (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",susan.morrow@virgin.net,"Hare, Billy/W-8558-2019","Hare, Billy/0000-0002-1079-6343",,,,37,7,7,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

It specifically focuses on the use of video games as an enabling technology in construction higher education. As such, it investigates whether task complexity has any influence on an individual's preferred learning style while learning through virtual reality (VR) technology. To answer this question and address relevant issues, an educational experiment has been designed and conducted. An experimental virtual learning environment, the Situation Engine, was set up as a virtual construction site for undergraduate construction students to experience construction work in progress. The design and development of the Situation Engine has drawn on powerful pedagogical theories such as situated and experiential learning. 253 undergraduate students participated in the educational experiment. Three tasks of different complexity levels were designed as the experimental environments; with level of complexity being the independent variable. The hypothesis that students would adopt different learning styles when engaged in learning tasks of different complexities was rejected. No significant difference in the preferred learning styles was identified among the three experimental groups. It was concluded, therefore, that when using virtual reality technology for construction education there is no evidence to suggest the level of task complexity has significant influence on how people learn. The study presented in this paper is the first empirical study in the construction higher education field that reveals the relationship between the task complexity and students learning styles when Virtual Learning Environments are engaged.","[Wang, Rui; Kocaturk, Tuba] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [Lowe, Russell] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2033, Australia; [Newton, Sidney] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Wang, R (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.",rui.wang@deakin.edu.au; russell.lowe@unsw.edu.au; sidney.newton@uts.edu.au; tuba.kocaturk@deakin.edu.au,"; Newton, Sidney/K-9677-2018","Wang, Rui/0000-0002-6600-6937; Newton, Sidney/0000-0001-8334-1916",,,,50,6,6,3,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Although various methods have been proposed to solve the technical issues of interoperability, such as data sharing and data consistency; organizational issues, including data ownership and data privacy, remain unresolved to date. These organizational issues prevent different stakeholders from sharing their data due to concerns regarding losing control of the data. This study proposes a multi-server information-sharing approach on a private cloud after analyzing the requirements for cross-party collaboration to address the aforementioned issues and prepare for massive data handling in the near future. This approach adopts a global controller to track the location, ownership and privacy of the data, which are stored in different servers that are controlled by different parties. Furthermore, data consistency conventions, parallel sub-model extraction, and sub-model integration with model verification are investigated in depth to support information sharing in a distributed environment and to maintain data consistency. Thus, with this approach, the ownership and privacy of the data can be controlled by its owner while still enabling certain required data to be shared with other parties. Application of the multi-server approach for information interoperability and cross-party collaboration is illustrated using a real construction project of an airport terminal. Validation shows that the proposed approach is feasible for maintaining the ownership and privacy of the data while supporting cross-party data sharing and collaboration at the same time, thus avoiding possible legal problems regarding data copyrights or other legal issues.","[Zhang, Jianping; Liu, Qiang; Hu, Zhenzhong; Lin, Jiarui; Yu, Fangqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Lin, JR (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lin611@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Hu, Zhen-Zhong/AAI-9454-2020; Lin, Jia-Rui/L-7191-2019; Lin, Jia-Rui/E-9923-2019; Jeong, Yongwook/N-7413-2016; Lin, Jia-Rui/D-5238-2012","Hu, Zhen-Zhong/0000-0001-9653-0097; Lin, Jia-Rui/0000-0003-2195-8675; Lin, Jia-Rui/0000-0003-2195-8675; Lin, Jia-Rui/0000-0003-2195-8675","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51278274, 51478249]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project [Z151100002115054]; Tsinghua-Glodon Joint Research Center for Building Information Model (RCBIM)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51278274, No. 51478249), the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project (No. Z151100002115054), and the Tsinghua-Glodon Joint Research Center for Building Information Model (RCBIM).

In these early phases, despite the fact that initial estimates are highly sensitive to changes in project scope, owners require accurate forecasts which reflect their supplying information. Thus, cost estimators need reliable estimation strategies. In practice, parametric cost estimation, which utilizes historical cost data, is the most commonly used method in these initial phases. Therefore, compilation of historical data pertaining to appropriate cost variance governing parameters is a prime requirement. However, data mining (data preprocessing) for denoising internal errors or abnormal values must be performed before this compilation. To address this issue, this research proposes a statistical methodology for data preprocessing. Moreover, a statistically preprocessed data-based parametric (SPBP) cost model is developed based on multiple regression equations.

The objective of this model is to compare alternative bridge deck designs from a sustainability perspective that accounts for total life-cycle costs including agency, user, and environmental costs. A conventional concrete bridge deck and an alternative engineered cementitious composite link slab design are examined. Despite higher initial costs and greater material-related environmental impacts on a per mass basis, the link slab design results in lower life-cycle costs and reduced environmental impacts when evaluated over the entire life cycle. Traffic delay caused by construction comprises 91% of total costs for both designs. Costs to the funding agency comprise less than 3% of total costs, and environmental costs are less than 0.5%. These results show life-cycle modeling is an important decision-making tool since initial costs and agency costs are not illustrative of total life-cycle costs. Additionally, accounting for construction-related traffic delay is vital to assessing the total economic cost and environmental impact of infrastructure design decisions.","[Kendall, Alissa; Keoleian, Gregory A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ctr Sustainable Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kendall, Alissa] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Keoleian, GA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ctr Sustainable Syst, 440 Church St,Dana Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",gregak@umich.edu,"Kendall, Alissa/E-5562-2012","Kendall, Alissa/0000-0003-1964-9080","NSF MUSES Biocomplexity ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [CMS-0223971, CMS-0329416]","This research was funded through a NSF MUSES Biocomplexity Program Grant (Grant Nos.

To achieve this, data were collected via in-depth oral interviews. Phenomenological type of qualitative research and snowball type of non-probability sampling technique was adopted respectively. MAXQDA 2018 with the support of thematic analysis was employed to analyze the three themes generated, and five major cities in Nigeria were covered. The study found that rural-urban migration, unemployment, high cost of the rental fee, inability to access housing loan and shortages of LCH were the reasons people engaged in squatting. From the findings, weak institutional framework, corruption, inadequate LCH policy, political will, and absence of national housing database emerged as the major hindrances to the implementation of LCH programmes that could have mitigated squatting. Nigerian Government should strengthen public housing institutions via a strong institutional framework for the sustainability of LCH programmes and tackle corruption head-on. This can be achieved if the government sees LCH provision as one of the major pillars and synergy with other constructs of welfare.","[Ebekozien, Andrew; Abdul-Aziz, Abdul-Rashid; Jaafar, Mastura] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town, Malaysia","Ebekozien, A (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Housing Bldg & Planning, George Town, Malaysia.",ebekoandy45@yahoo.com,"jaafar, mastura/A-1747-2012; Ebekozien, Andrew/Y-8994-2018","jaafar, mastura/0000-0003-3981-600X; Ebekozien, Andrew/0000-0002-4663-5592",Universiti Sains MalaysiaUniversiti Sains Malaysia [1001/PPBGN/816296],Authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Universiti Sains Malaysia via research grant number 1001/PPBGN/816296.,,57,13,13,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

This case study introduces a comparison process based on lifecycle costing (LCC) between two design alternatives in an irrigation project, the Seyhan River Yedigoze Imamoglu Irrigation Project, being implemented in the southern region of Turkey. Decisions related to irrigation projects in Turkey are important because of their effect on the agricultural development and because of the high amounts allocated from the national budget for their implementation. In this regard, comparing the design alternatives properly during the design development stage is critical to exploring the superior design. The aim of this case study is to show how considering only the facility initial construction costs, while ignoring LCC, may lead to wrong decisions, through the example case of an irrigation project undertaken in Turkey. Comparison of two different design alternatives has revealed that Design Alternative 2 (pipe network and concrete covered open main channel of 15.812 km) is superior to Design Alternative 1 (pipe network and concrete covered open main channel of 57.562 km) from the perspective of LCC and such technical criteria as constructability, operation easiness, and water saving.

SmartSite puts major emphasis on sensing and communication technologies that integrate real-time automated information exchange in the supply chain of road construction. As part of the larger SmartSite project, this article introduces a novel real-time path planning system for compactors and presents the results of several simulation and field realistic experiments conducted to evaluate the system in a sophisticated simulation and harsh construction environment, respectively. The system operates based on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) software agents and real-time sensory inputs. The newly developed integrated and information rich process benefits asphalt compactor operators, as they are now capable to control their Machinery and react to changing environmental, material-related and process-related disturbances or changes. This improves the quality of the delivery and laying of asphalt material, prevents compactors from over-compacting certain road segments, increases the road's pavement longevity during the operational life cycle phase; refocuses the work tasks of the site managers, and reduces the construction budget and schedule. The system's ability to maneuver an asphalt roller during real word operation also makes it an important step towards a fully automated asphalt compactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Confidence in these initial estimates is low, primarily due to the limited availability of suitable data, which leads the construction projects to frequently end up over budget. This paper investigated the efficacy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) methodologies in overcoming cost estimation problems in the early phases of the building design process. Design/methodology/approach Cost and design data from 104 projects constructed over the past five years in Jordan were used to develop, train and test ANN models. At the detailed design stage, 53 design factors were utilized to develop the first ANN model; then the factors were reduced to 41 and were utilized to develop the second predictive model at the schematic design stage. Finally, 27 design factors available at the concept design stage were utilized for the third ANN model. Findings The models achieved average cost estimation accuracy of 98, 98 and 97% in the detailed, schematic and concept design stages, respectively. Research limitations/implications This paper formulated the aims and objectives to be applicable only in Jordan using historical data of building projects. Originality/value The ANN approach introduced as a management tool is expected to provide the stakeholders in the engineering business with an indispensable tool for predicting the cost with limited data at the early stages of construction projects.","[Al-Tawal, Dareen Ryied; Sweis, Ghaleb Jalil] Univ Jordan, Dept Civil Engn, Amman, Jordan; [Arafah, Mazen] Univ Jordan, Dept Ind Engn, Amman, Jordan","Al-Tawal, DR (corresponding author), Univ Jordan, Dept Civil Engn, Amman, Jordan.",dareentwall@hotmail.com; hfmazin@gmail.com; gsweis@ju.edu.jo,,"Sweis, Ghaleb/0000-0001-6979-6420; , Dareen/0000-0001-7422-1808",,,,36,1,1,11,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This paper presents a new model to simulate the interactions between mobile cranes and associated work crews onsite. The model considers crane type and position, the sequence of components transported, and the number and size of crews at the demand point. A novel hybrid multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is utilized to identify optimal crane and crew configurations that minimize construction cost and duration. The proposed method is demonstrated on an example problem involving the installation of curtain wall panels for a mid-rise office building. The results indicate that considering crane and crew decisions in parallel reduces installation cost by 19.5% and duration by 1.7% compared to considering these decisions sequentially. Furthermore, the number of crews used and the number of crane stops had the most significant impact on project cost and schedule, respectively.","[Peng, Bo; Flager, Forest Lee; Wu, Jiaao] Stanford Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Peng, B (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bpeng@stanford.edu,,"Flager, Forest/0000-0003-0137-0401",Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) at Stanford UniversityStanford University,"The authors would like to thank Patrick Tierney, Abhijit Oak and their colleagues at Autodesk for their assistance with the implementation of this method.

The predominant focus on individual contracts is of limited use for public agencies that need to allocate their resources efficiently at the level of the entire asset network. This study therefore adopts an asset management perspective on the issue of contract duration in public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. In so doing, this research aims to add to the understanding of asset network level effects of important contractual parameters such as contract duration. Empirical material from the Netherlands illustrates that public professionals tend to think about contract duration in terms of a network cost-network control trade-off.

The results show that the number of benchmark provinces every year is between five and seven. The gap between the best-performing and underperforming province was relatively small in 2012 and big in 2014. Beijing, Qinghai, Hainan, Fujian, Chongqing, and Tianjin can be utilized as role models for the provinces that need to improve their performance in construction safety.

The theoretical discourse on governance, in the context of projects and programmes, is not fully mature, although is now sufficiently well developed to warrant an increased scholarly focus on practice. This paper aims to contribute to the empirical literature through a study of assurance routines in the UK Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). Design/methodology/approach A framework analysis approach to the evaluation of a subset of GMPP database generates original insights into (1) the framing of assurance review recommendations, (2) the treatment of assurance review data and (3) the subsequent tracking of the implementation of actions arising from the assurance review process. Findings The analysis reveals that the delivery confidence of the major projects and programmes included in this study improves during the time that they are assured on the GMPP. This would suggest that enhanced governance routines are desirable in programmes and projects that exhibit high degrees of complexity and scale.

As DfMA is based on the principles of optimization of materials and coordination. The optimization and coordination achieved through DfMA at the early design stage can significantly contribute best practices, reduce time and delays and improve safety, and thereby enhance the overall productivity of the prefabricated construction project. However, the literature on DfMA is limited in prefabricated construction. This paper presents an updated and comprehensive review of DfMA approaches and their applications in manufacturing and prefabrication. The review is based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with a slight modification. Scopus database was used to obtain relevant articles from the literature, and three search attempts were taken to ensure that the identified publications thoroughly cover the focus of this review. Prefabrication and manufacturing processes are compared and discussed with examples. The findings of this paper show practical analogies between prefabrication and manufacturing. Finally, the review is concluded with recommendations for future works and the potential opportunities for the application of DfMA in construction.","[Wasim, Muhammad; Ngo, Tuan Duc] Univ Melbourne, Sch Engn, Infrastruct Dept, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Vaz Serra, Paulo] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ngo, Tuan Duc] Adv Protect Technol & Engn Serv APTES, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Wasim, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Engn, Infrastruct Dept, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",mwasim@unimelb.edu.au,"Vaz-Serra, Paulo/L-9650-2015","Vaz-Serra, Paulo/0000-0001-5286-0801","Department of Industry, Innovation and Science and Richstone Group AustraliaAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science [ICG000391-392]","The project was funded by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science and Richstone Group Australia.

Two challenges are identified and tackled with the proposed method: intercorrelation among project parameters and the joint impacts of multiple project parameters on the final cost, or interaction terms. Specifically, an independent component analysis method is proposed to convert intercorrelated project parameters into independent parameters, and the Sobol's global sensitivity analysis is used to calculate total sensitivity indices that capture the joint impacts of interaction terms.

The limitation may contribute to discrepancies between simulated and actual building performance. In a previous study, the authors discussed a framework using an artificial neural network (ANN)-based greedy algorithm which combines context-aware design-specific data obtained from immersive virtual environments (IVEs) with an existing BPM to enhance the simulations of human-building interactions in new designs. Although the framework has revealed the potential to improve simulations, it cannot determine the appropriate combination between context-aware design-specific data and the existing BPM. In this paper, the authors present a new computational framework (the GAN-based framework) to determine an appropriate combination based on a given performance target to achieve. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to combine data of an existing BPM and context-aware design-specific data using a performance target as a guide to produce an augmented BPM. The effectiveness and the reliability of the GAN-based framework were validated using an IVE of a single occupancy office. Thirty people participated in an experiment on the simulation of artificial lighting switch uses using the IVE. Their light switch uses data under different work area illuminance were collected and analyzed. The building performance models (BPMs) proposed by Hunt and Da Silva were selected as the existing BPM and the performance target respectively. The data of each participant was used to generate an augmented BPM using the GAN-based framework and an updated BPM using the previous framework (i.e., ANN-based greedy algorithm framework). The thirty pairs of the augmented and updated BPMs were compared. Specifically, the errors measured between the updated BPMs and the performance target (E-1) and the errors measured between the augmented BPMs and the performance target (E-2) were analyzed using t-tests (alpha = 0.05). In 22 out of 30 cases, the performance of the augmented BPMs was significantly better than the updated BPMs, and in four cases, the performance of the two was similar. Only in four other cases, the performance of the updated BPMs was better. The results confirmed the efficacy of the framework. However, future research is needed to study the performance target and uncertainties associated with IVE experiments to better understand and control the reliability of the framework.","[Chokwitthaya, Chanachok; Zhu, Yimin] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mukhopadhyay, Supratik; Collier, Edward] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Chokwitthaya, C (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",cchokw1@lsu.edu; yiminzhu@lsu.edu; supratik@csc.lsu.edu; ecoll28@lsu.edu,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1640818],"This paper was partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation Award #1640818.

Numerous research efforts have been made to estimate the risk level of tunnel collapse by multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods considering a variety of risk factors, aiming to provide a decision basis for risk management. However, the uncertainty of fuzziness and randomness existing in evaluation factors gradation are usually neglected. The information fusion method based on extension theory (ET) is an effective tool for uncertain information reasoning. Nevertheless, the potential contribution of each piece of evidence to the fusion result has not been given enough attention. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper presents a novel hybrid reasoning approach to perceive the risk level of mountain tunnel collapse under uncertainty by integrating the extended cloud model (ECM) and improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory at the construction stage. ET and cloud model (CM) are merged to construct the basic probability assignments (BPAs) of the influenceable variables corresponding to different risk states under uncertainty, i.e., the randomness and fuzziness. The overall risk level is derived from a fusion of all the influenceable factors using the improved D-S theory developed in this paper. Specifically, the weight of each piece of evidence is assessed considering its importance to risk perception results and used to improve the evidence source by the discounting method before evidence fusion. Evidence conflicts are resolved through a weighted-average fusion process based on the evidence distance. Besides, a confidence indicator is introduced to assess the reliability of the fusion results. Finally, a case study in Canglongxia Tunnel is employed to verify the validity of the developed approach. The method proposed in this paper has the potential to reduce the deviation of risk assessment results for tunnel collapse in mountain tunnel construction induced by the uncertainty of risk factors.","[Cai, Qijie] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qijun; Ma, Guoli] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China","Hu, QJ (corresponding author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.",caiqijieswjt@my.swjtu.edu.cn; huqijunswpu@163.com; 1006807821@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51574201]; Excellent Youth Foundation of Sichuan Scientific Committee [2019JDJQ0037],This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51574201) and Excellent Youth Foundation of Sichuan Scientific Committee (2019JDJQ0037).,,55,0,0,13,13,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

To achieve this objective, a deductive approach is adopted using a questionnaire survey of 107 construction professionals. A total of 39 barriers were identified through an intensive literature review, and were grouped into six categories: management, financial, educational, governmental, technical and human attitudinal. Data were analysed using the simple but widely used effect index (EI). The strongest barriers to implementing LC techniques for improving safety in the Gaza Strip are lack of LC concept understanding, lack of government support for applying innovative strategies in construction projects, and lack of knowledge on how to apply LC techniques for safety improvement. Regular training should be provided to all construction practitioners to provide them with the most appropriate LC techniques for improving construction safety. This paper will be valuable for stakeholders in the construction industry to focus their attention and resources on the significant barriers and to identify strategies to address these barriers and facilitate the application of LC techniques to improve safety in local construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed stacking ensemble model was developed by combining three distinct base predictive models automatically and optimally: linear regression, support vector machine and artificial neural network models using gradient boosting algorithm as meta-regressor. Findings The findings reveal that the proposed model predicted the final project cost with a very small prediction error value. This implies that the difference between predicted and actual cost was quite small. A comparison of the results of the models revealed that in all performance metrics, the stacking ensemble model outperforms the sole ones. The stacking ensemble cost model produces 86.8, 87.8 and 5.6 percent more accurate results than linear regression, vector machine support, and neural network models, respectively, based on the root mean square error values. Research limitations/implications The study shows how stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm applies to predict the cost of construction projects. The estimators or practitioners can use the new model as an effectual and reliable tool for predicting the cost of Ethiopian highway construction projects at the preliminary stage.

Absent from existing research are defined metrics of design coordination-how much it costs to perform depending on project variables, and the true costs of field conflicts that are eliminated by coordination. This research was performed to explore the costs of design coordination in concert with the benefits of eliminating coordination conflicts that arise in the field. A standard method to measure costs of coordination is developed for case study projects. Potential variables that affect this cost are evaluated, and the negative impacts of field conflicts are measured. Project variables that have strong relationships with coordination costs are identified to be MEP density [MEP cost/square foot (SF)], and plenum height, and exploratory models to predict coordination costs using these variables are presented. Three distinct types of coordination conflicts are identified with measurable increasing impacts and cost. These results help to quantify the level of effort needed to coordinate building systems, and help to provide a basis for detecting projects that are likely to have problematic MEP coordination processes.","Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Gilbane Bldg Co, Laurel, MD 20707 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Riley, DR (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 104 Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",driley@engr.psu.edu; hrt@psu.edu,,,,,,7,41,41,2,18,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Therefore, it is in the interest of all project parties to assign proper contractual safety responsibilities before the execution of the contract. Despite the increased popularity of design-build (DB) contracts, there is a scarcity of research work that addresses DB contracts in general and the contractual safety aspects in particular. This research study fills this critical knowledge gap by providing contractual safety guidelines in relation to the parties' rights and responsibilities and the tort liability/negligence under national DB standard forms of contract. To achieve that, the authors used a multistep methodology. First, the authors analyzed and compared the safety-related provisions as stipulated by national DB standard forms of contracts. Second, the authors presented law case studies to provide practical perspectives on the different aspects of the safety-related provisions and their relation to tort liability/negligence. Third, the authors developed the advantages and disadvantages for each of the studied contracts. Fourth, the authors developed a checklist to enable contract administrators to avoid poor or unclear contract language and to better draft new contracts in terms of safety-related issues. The outcomes of this research work will enable contract administrators to clearly assign safety responsibilities between the different parties of the project. Clear assignment of safety responsibilities in contracts will enhance the overall safety performance of projects and minimize claims, conflicts, and disputes related to safety injuries in the construction industry.","[Abdul Nabi, Mohamad] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 218 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Engn & Management, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Civil Engn, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [El-adaway, Islam H.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Missouri Consortium Construct Innovat, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Fayek, Sara; Howell, Cabot] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA; [Gambatese, John] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Construct Engn & Management, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.; El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Civil Engn, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.; El-adaway, IH (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Missouri Consortium Construct Innovat, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 228 Butler Carlton Hall,1401 N Pine St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",mah59@mst.edu; eladaway@mst.edu; sfgbd@mst.edu; ch3h7@mst.edu; john.gambatese@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,46,5,5,2,19,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Finally, a new risk assessment method adapted to building works is proposed, called Level of Preventive Action, by means of a new mathematical formula which encompasses Safety at Work, Industrial Hygiene, Ergonomic and Psychosociological factors. It is based upon the development of the William T. Fine method, adapting it to construction works, with the incorporation of six parameters to explain the degree of correction. It consolidates and connects environment parameters to determine the preventive action level of the construction work, with the objective of establishing the levels of preventive control required to achieve an optimum prevention situation. The results of comparison between the environments in the implementation of the new risk assessment methodology during the construction process in a real building work are shown.","[Jose Carpio, Antonio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Mecan Aplicada & Ingn Proyectos, Escuela Ingn Ind & Aerosp Toledo, Toledo, Spain; [de las Nieves Gonzalez, Maria; Martinez, Inmaculada] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Construcc Arquitecton & Control, Escuela Tecn Super Edificac, Madrid, Spain; [Isabel Prieto, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Tecnol Edificac, Escuela Tecn Super Edificac, Madrid, Spain","Gonzalez, MD (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Construcc Arquitecton & Control, Escuela Tecn Super Edificac, Madrid, Spain.",mariadelasnieves.gonzalez@upm.es,"de las Nieves Gonzalez Garcia, Maria/L-1261-2014","de las Nieves Gonzalez Garcia, Maria/0000-0002-0299-0840; Carpio de los Pinos, Antonio Jose/0000-0002-2626-9361",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [VAGI19MNGG],This work was supported by the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [grant number VAGI19MNGG].,,63,2,2,0,0,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

In response, several studies have attempted to develop new approaches and state-of-the-art technology for conducting autonomous safety surveillance of construction work zones such as vision-based monitoring. The current and proposed methods including human inspection, however, are limited to consistent and real-time monitoring and rapid event recognition of construction safety issues. In addition, the health and safety risks inherent in construction projects make it challenging for construction workers to be aware of possible safety risks and hazards according to daily planned work activities. To address the urgent demand of the industry to improve worker safety, this study involves the development of an audio-based event detection system to provide daily safety issues to laborers and through the rapid identification of construction accidents. As an evidence-driven approach, the proposed framework incorporates the occupational injury and illness manual data, consisting of historical construction accident data classified by types of sources and events, into an audio-based safety event detection framework. This evidence-driven framework integrated with a daily project schedule can automatically provide construction workers with prenotifications regarding safety hazards at a pertinent work zone as well as consistently contribute to enhanced construction safety monitoring by audio-based event detection. By using a machine learning algorithm, the framework can clearly categorize the narrowed-down sound training data according to a daily project schedule and dynamically restrict sound classification types in advance. The proposed framework is expected to contribute to an emerging knowledge base for integrating an automated safety surveillance system into occupational accident data, significantly improving the accuracy of audio-based event detection.","[Lee, Yong-Cheol; Shariatfar, Moeid] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Rashidi, Abbas] Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Lee, Hyun Woo] Univ Washington, Dept Construct Management, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Lee, YC (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Construct Management, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",yclee@lsu.edu,"Rashidi, Abbas/AAQ-3762-2021","Lee, Yongcheol/0000-0002-0040-0894; Lee, Hyun Woo/0000-0003-1994-2850",,,,58,9,9,8,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Safety risk control requires a comprehensive analysis of instrumentation data integrated with other safety related data. Based on a multidimensional data model, a safety-oriented geotechnical instrumentation data warehouse is established to integrate all the data from heterogeneous data sources, not only for quick retrieval of information on site, but also for further analysis. As one of the most important safety indicators, ground settlement is analyzed to take advantage of the data warehouse. A double Gaussian model is proposed to represent the settlement trough over twin tunnels. Moreover, a revised trough width parameter is proposed to represent the scope of safety risk areas. The ground loss is found to grow in a pattern that can be represented by a logistic curve. The first derivative of ground loss is applied to represent the evolution of safety risk.

Previous studies, however, have implemented a double loop procedure, which performs optimization in the outer loop and simulation in the inner loop. The double loop procedure is ponderous because it requires an unacceptably long computation time (taking hours or days), even for a small to medium project. The present study proposes an integrated system that converts the double loop to single loops,thereby dramatically reducing computation time. This is done by incorporating a support vector regression model to obtain a decision function, which will be used to replace the time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the objective function values for individual solutions. With the objective function values, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to search for the Pareto front composed of nondominated solutions. It has been empirically shown that the proposed system significantly outperforms the conventional double loop procedure because the former can consistently generate a better Pareto front (with a larger hyperarea ratio) hundreds of times faster by using much less computation time. The Student's t test is performed to validate the superiority of the proposed system. The contribution of the proposed system is multifold. First, improved computational efficiency is essential for the widespread acceptance of the stochastic time-cost trade-off analysis in practical applications. Second, with less computation time spent in simulation, efforts can be focused on the search for much better nondominated solutions. Third, the proposed system can incorporate the risk attitudes of the decision makers into the analysis by allowing them to specify the probability that they can tolerate for project duration (cost) to exceed a certain limit.","[Yang, I-Tung] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Cheng] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Lee, Hsin-Yun] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Ilan 260, Taiwan","Yang, IT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Engn, 43 Sect 4 Keelung Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",ityang@mail.ntust.edu.tw; yclin@ntut.edu.tw; hylee@niu.edu.tw,,,,,,47,7,8,2,17,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Under this prevailing assumption, owners are often excluded and exempted from construction safety issues. However, a growing number of construction safety researchers and practitioners recognize that the owner's engagement in construction safety plays a vital role in safety performance improvement. Although some research efforts were made, the owner's role in construction safety is still heavily under-researched. Operational excellence (OE) is a concept successfully applied for performance improvement in numerous industries. The essence of the OE philosophy is that desirable results stem from predictable behaviors. Operational excellence is defined as doing the right thing, the right way, every time, even when no one is watching. Based on OE, efforts were made to establish an effective model to quantitatively measure and improve owner's impacts on construction safety. This model, entitled the Owner's Role Rating Model, contained six elements that are vital to the owner's engagement in jobsite safety, called critical to safety (CTS). It was unreasonable to assume that all six CTS elements are equally important to the owner's safety role. Therefore, the analytical hierarchy process was applied to determine relative weights for each of the six CTSs through an extensive questionnaire survey. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is to weight and present a practical and effective model for owners and other construction practitioners, to evaluate the performance of the owner's role in safety, and identify opportunities for improvement.

It is an appropriate tool to deal with the selection of a project delivery method. Project delivery selection involves the assessment of tradeoffs between numerous risks and uncertainties, complex relationships among variables, and multiple decision alternatives. In fact, the number of variables involved in project delivery decisions creates CIA models that are extremely complex, and few researchers have attempted to apply them. This paper presents a hybrid CIA approach to project delivery decisions in highway design and construction. It provides for the evaluation of project cost with projects in three fundamental delivery methods: design-bid-build (DBB), design-build (DB), and construction manager/general contractor (CMGC). The paper discusses in detail how the cross-impact concepts support the selection of an appropriate delivery method in highway projects. The hybrid CIA approach integrates the results from the factor analysis of 31 delivery risk factors, which were evaluated by 137 practitioners, to determine the interaction between variables in the cross-impact matrix. These data allowed the researchers to reduce the number of required judgments in the CIA model approximately from more than 3,000 to fewer than 300. A case project from the Florida Department of Transportation demonstrates the approach. The hybrid CIA approach provides a defensible and repeatable process for highway agencies to quantitatively select an appropriate delivery method for their projects. More fundamentally, the findings from this paper contribute to theory by providing a new method to apply the CIA technique. It is expected that researchers can use this hybrid CIA approach for other areas in construction engineering and management research.

The purpose of this paper is to develop, test and validate ANN models for predicting the costs of electrical services components. Design/Methodology/Approach - The research is based on data mining of over 200 building projects in the office of a medium size electrical contractor. Of the over 200 projects examined, 71 usable data were found and used for the ANN modeling. Regression models were also explored using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics Software 21, for the purpose of comparison with the ANN models. Findings - The findings show that the cost forecasting models based on ANN algorithm are more viable alternative to regression models for predicting the costs of light wiring, power wiring and cable pathways. The ANN prediction errors achieved are 6.4, 4.5 and 4.5 per cent for the three models developed whereas the regression models were insignificant. They did not fit any of the known regression distributions. Practical implications - The validated ANN models were converted to a desktop application (user interface) package - Intelligent Estimator. The application is important because it can be used by construction professionals to reliably and quickly forecast the costs of power wiring, light wiring and cable pathways using building variables that are readily available or measurable during design stage, i.e. fully enclosed covered area, unenclosed covered area, internal perimeter length and number of floors. Originality/value - Previous studies have concluded that the methods of estimating the budget for building structure and fabric work are inappropriate for use with mechanical and electrical services. Thus, this study is unique because it applied the ANN modeling technique, for the first time, to cost modeling of electrical services components for building using real world data. The analysis shows that ANN is a better alternative to regression models for predicting cost of services elements because the relationship between cost and the cost drivers are non-linear and distribution types are unknown.","[Aibinu, Ajibade A.; Chan, Toong-Khuan; Thangaraj, Ram] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dassanayake, Dharma] Charles Stuart Univ, Int Ctr Water, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia","Aibinu, AA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",aaibinu@unimelb.edu.au,"Ajibade, Aibinu/D-2635-2017; Chan, Toong Khuan/G-8611-2015","Ajibade, Aibinu/0000-0001-6896-1682; Chan, Toong Khuan/0000-0002-1985-6592",,,,30,10,10,2,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

To make complex project-level AMSs computationally applicable to all assets in a network, this paper presents a methodology to replace the time-consuming simulation modules of optimization algorithms with a trained machine learning model estimating life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) results. Deep neural network (DNN) models were trained on LCCA results of more than 1.4 million semisynthesized bridges based on the US National Bridge Inventory considering different intervention actions and uncertainties about condition ratings, hazards, and costs. Our findings show that the trained DNN models can accurately estimate the complex LCCA results five order of magnitudes faster than simulation techniques.

The present study aims to test the hypothesis that the quantity and intensity of energy observable prior to an incident predicts the severity of the incident. The hypothesis is built upon the theory that energy is translated to an injury through uncontrolled release of the energy, transfer of the energy to the human body and the vulnerability of the body and associated protective equipment. To test the hypothesis, a multi-phase experiment was conducted. First, over 500 injury reports were gathered from national databases and private companies. For each report, the leading information describing the work operations and environment and the lagging information describing the injury were extracted, separated and isolated. Second, the magnitude of the energy was estimated using only leading information. Once energy magnitude was quantified, the distribution was compared across injury severity levels using analysis of variance tests. As hypothesized, energy magnitude is a strong predictor of injury severity. Although computationally intensive, energy intensity, defined as the magnitude of energy divided by the area of contact between an object and the human body, showed strong predictive validity.

To address this gap, a survey investigated the impact of client characteristics on the time and cost efficiency of collaborative infrastructure projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The survey of experienced senior practitioners of Australian collaborative infrastructure projects yielded 320 valid responses. Cluster analysis, one-way between group ANOVA tests and independent sample t-tests were used to confirm that three client characteristics are critical to time and cost performance: client sector (public/private); client experience with asset procurement; and client approach to price competition. Findings - Projects procured by experienced private sector clients were found to meet targeted levels of performance, regardless of their approach to team selection. Among projects procured by experienced public sector clients, groups of relatively low and high performing projects could be distinguished, regardless of their approach to team selection. Projects run by teams selected competitively on non-price criteria prior to the pricing stage exhibited significantly better performance than those run by teams that competed on the price of the project to win the work. Research limitations/implications - This study focussed only on analysis of three client characteristics. Future research may consider a broader range of contextual variables. Results are based on perceptual data rather than objective data. Practical implications - The findings show collaborative infrastructure clients in the construction sector should be less concerned about inexperience than they might have been, and more interested in single-team selection approaches than they might have been. Originality/value - The results indicate significant performance differences between client types. In particular, experienced public sector clients had more polarized performance outcomes, compared to the private sector.","[Manley, Karen; Chen, Le] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Chen, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",le.chen@qut.edu.au,"Chen, Le/B-4574-2013","Chen, Le/0000-0001-9761-0021; Manley, Karen/0000-0003-1796-3244",Alliancing Association of Australasia; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [110200110],"This study is supported by the Alliancing Association of Australasia and the Australian Research Council (Linkage Project 110200110).

The design team and other stakeholders in the construction industry face the challenges posed by the ever-increasing complexity of construction facilities, and the demands of clients to meet their needs within a given budget. In addition, the trend of information technology in construction demands that all activities including cost optimization be automated and digitalized for better proficiency of the construction professionals and effectiveness of job delivery. This article presents a conceptual framework for the automated resource model (ARM) for on-site construction cost control. The concept of ARM is based on the use of mobile technology, integrating it with a back-office central system for real-time data capturing, monitoring, and control to keep expenditure within a predetermined budget. The scope covered includes Automated Real-Time Data (ARTiD) collection, Construction Progress Monitoring and Evaluation, and Construction Activity Monitoring. The ARM concept can enable the construction stakeholders to obtain information on cost implications of all activities simultaneously. It can also enable quick detection of any source of cost and time overrun and propose quick remedial action.","[Igwe, Uchenna Sampson; Mohamed, Sarajul Fikri; Dzahir, Mohd Azwarie Mat; Yusof, Zakaria Mohd] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Quant Surveying, Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Igwe, Uchenna Sampson] Fed Univ Technol Owerri, Dept Quant Surveying, Owerri, Nigeria; [Khiyon, Noor Azeyah] Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Southport, Qld, Australia","Igwe, US (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Quant Surveying, Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.; Igwe, US (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Owerri, Dept Quant Surveying, Owerri, Nigeria.",usigwe@graduate.utm.my,"Igwe, Uchenna Sampson/Q-5186-2018","Igwe, Uchenna Sampson/0000-0002-6687-745X",Federal Government of Nigeria; Tertiary Education Fund (TETfund); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),The authors wish to appreciate the Federal Government of Nigeria for granting the Tertiary Education Fund (TETfund) and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for granting the International Doctoral Fellowship which made this work possible.,,47,0,0,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

Project planners face complicated multivariate, time-cost-resource optimization (TCRO) problems, which require simultaneous minimization of total project duration and total project cost, while considering issues related to optimal resource allocation and leveling. The authors present a shuffled frog-leaping model to solve complex TCRO problems in construction project planning. The proposed model is different from existing optimization models in construction project planning. The proposed shuffled frog-leaping model considers the simultaneous optimization of three important objective functions in project planning: (1) minimizing total project duration, (2) total project cost, and (3) total variation of resource allocation. This model finds optimal Pareto fronts of project planning solutions in the three-dimensional space of total project duration, total project cost, and total variation of resource allocation. The proposed model is flexible to allow for activity splitting in project planning. Project activities can be interrupted and project resources can be reallocated to find more appropriate project planning solutions. The shuffled frog-leaping model is applied to solve two optimization problems, which are found in the construction project planning literature. It is shown that the proposed shuffled frog-leaping model is superior to the existing optimization algorithms to find better project planning solutions with less total project duration, less total project cost, and less total variation of resource allocation.

Re-planning collision-free optimal lifting paths in near real-time is an essential feature for a robotized crane operating in a construction environment that is changing with time. The primary focus of the present research work is to develop a re-planning module for the CALP system designed at Nanyang Technological University. The CALP system employs GPU-based parallelization approach for discrete and continuous collision detection as well as for path planning. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is utilized in the system, and a Single-level Depth Map (SDM) representation is implemented to reduce the huge data set of BIM models for usage in discrete and continuous collision detection. The proposed re-planning module constitutes of a Decision Support System (DSS) and a Path Re-planner (PRP). A novel re-planning decision making algorithm using multi-level Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) is formulated for the DSS. A path re-planning strategy via updating the start configuration for the local path is devised for the PRP. Two case studies are carried out with real-world models of a building and a specific tower crane to validate the effective performance of the re-planning module. The results show excellent decision accuracy and near real-time re-planning with high optimality.","[Dutta, Souravik] Nanyang Technol Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637371, Singapore; [Dutta, Souravik; Cai, Yiyu; Huang, Lihui] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Dutta, Souravik; Cai, Yiyu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Energy Res Inst NTU, 50 Nanyang Dr,Res Techno Plaza, Singapore 637553, Singapore; [Zheng, Jianmin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore","Cai, YY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",SOURAVIK001@e.ntu.edu.sg; MYYCAI@ntu.edu.sg; LHHUANG@ntu.edu.sg; ASJMZheng@ntu.edu.sg,"Cai, Yiyu/A-3816-2011","Cai, Yiyu/0000-0002-8406-9536; DUTTA, SOURAVIK/0000-0001-9412-3092","Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Nanyang Technological University, SingaporeNanyang Technological University; Energy Research Institute @ NTU of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","The authors would like to express their thanks to the Housing and Development Board of Singapore, for providing the BIM model of the residential building for the case studies.

Operators and contractors are confronted with an array of challenges that hinder the cost-effective and safe completion of decommissioning projects. The costing and technological challenges that confront the oil and gas industry are identified using a series of semistructured interviews. One of the most prominent challenges identified was the inability to reliably estimate the volume and cost of work to be undertaken. This is exacerbated by a supply chain with limited capacity and experience in executing decommissioning projects in this fledgling sector in the oil and gas industry. As a result of the analysis that is undertaken, it is recommended that an industrywide decommissioning forum be established to facilitate the sharing of experience and knowledge, particularly with regard to cost information so that operators and contractors can ameliorate the planning and management of the decommissioning process.

In determining the concession period, it is predominantly the toll revenue and construction costs that affect how long the concessionaire needs to be in operation after the completion of the project. This paper presents a stochastic revenue and cost model to determine a concession period under multiple constraints in planning a BOT infrastructure project. In the study, the stochastic process is converted into an equivalent discrete form, and its parameters are estimated using historical data. Based on the process, a principle-agent problem is addressed as a solution to the conflict between the owner and the concessionaire. This methodology incorporates these stakeholders' interests in terms of (1)incentive constraints, and (2)participation constraints. In a case study, a numerical simulation is carried out to assess the risk of toll revenue and construction costs when applied in practice and to demonstrate the applicability of the stochastic revenue and cost model.","[Xu, Jiang-wei] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Management, Chongqing 400037, Peoples R China; [Moon, Sungwoo] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pusan 609735, South Korea","Moon, S (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Construction Engn Bldg,Room 509, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",jiangwei-xu@hotmail.com; sngwmoon@pusan.ac.kr,,,China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [2007U23067]; Brain Korea 21 Plus Project in the Division of Creative Low Impact Development and Management for Ocean Port City Infrastructures,The first author appreciates financial support from the China Scholarship Council Grant #2007U23067.

The overarching goal of the research presented in this paper is to explore ways to prevent unsafe acts of workers and reduce the likelihood of construction accidents occurring. The study specifically aims to (1)understand the relationships between human behavior related and working condition related risk factors, (2)identify the significant behavior and condition factors and their impacts on accident types (e.g.,struck by/against, caught in/between, falling, shock, inhalation/ingestion/absorption, or respiratory failure) and injury severity (e.g.,fatality, hospitalized, or nonhospitalized), and (3)analyze the fundamental accident-injury relationship on how each accident type contributes to the injury severity. The study reviewed 9,358 accidents that occurred in the U.S. construction industry between 2002 and 2011. The large number of accident samples supported reliable statistical analyses. The analysis identified a total of 17 significant correlations between behavior and condition factors and distinguished key risk factors that highly impacted on the determination of accident types and injury severity. The research outcomes will assist safety managers to control specific unsafe acts of workers by eliminating the associated unsafe working conditions and vice versa. They also can prioritize risk factors and pay more attention to controlling them to achieve a safer working environment.

Traditional processing techniques for monitored data, such as historical charts, in-site photos, and result maps of measured values in computer-aided drafting (CAD) programs, fail to provide information concerning the spatial aspects of monitored objects. In the past few decades the geographic information system (GIS) and analysis has provided a platform for data analysis because of its strong capabilities in spatial visualization. In this study, a monitoring system that can be applied to hydropower projects is developed on the basis of the powerful spatial visualization and analysis characteristics of GIS. The main tasks of the system are (1) to model instruments and measuring points distinctively according to different perspectives on the basis of the implementation of a set of spatial data modeling tools; (2) to visualize and query spatial data based on their spatial positions; and (3) to display data using three analytical modules. Because of the visual limitations of each of the different modules, the measured values are shown in different ways. In addition, spatial analysis, including interpolation and surface analysis, can be conducted in each module. The proposed system promotes the spatial aspect of hydropower monitoring analysis and is expected to be an efficient tool for improving and maintaining the safety standard for the construction of hydropower stations.

The construction industry, greatly impacted by accidents, is accountable for more than 1,000 fatalities in each of the past 14 years. The human factors analysis classification system (HFACS) is a general human error framework originally developed and tested as a tool for investigating and analyzing the human causes of accidents with applications to rail, air, and offshore environments. This paper introduces the concept of HFACS along with the framework of human error awareness training (HEAT) and their potential contribution to the construction industry. Based on the HEAT approach, this paper proposes a new error analysis educational and classification tool for safety within the construction industry. The primary difference between HFACS and HEAT is found in the structure, content, and presentation of the information allowing for higher effectiveness in incident investigation and safety education and training in construction.","[Teizer, Jochen] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Garrett, J.

Current safety monitoring of foundation pits is often achieved through manual onsite measurements with complex equipment and relies on complicated methods, which are labour intensive, time consuming, and tend to ignore the risk of accidental collapses caused by serious local deformation. To address this issue, this study develops a rapid safety monitoring and analysis method for foundation pit construction using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. The safe inclination angle of the foundation pit slope was proposed as the safety-monitoring index.

Measurements were made between April of 2016 and October of 2017. The environmental tests performed on scaffoldings were focused mainly on the sound level. The parameters on which we base our analysis are the value of C-weighted peak sound levels and daily noise exposure level. The noise that affects construction workers on scaffolding may influence the behaviour of workers and increase the risk of accidents. And at the same time, noise exposure laws facilitate identification of high noise-emitting activities and provide effective preventive measures that reduce noise pollution and improve work environments. The analyses carried out confirmed the qualitatively expected dependencies, and allowed us to quantify the impact of noise to which scaffolding workers are exposed. In summary, noise measurements on scaffoldings can be a valuable aid in improving working conditions. The analysis of research results allows understanding hazards related to noise in an accessible way.

Real-time safety and risk management during urban metro construction has become extremely important but is very difficult, time-consuming and unreliable due to the lack of information and experienced managers. This paper presents the development and application of a web-based system for safety risk early warning in urban metro construction. A hybrid data fusion model based on multisource information (monitoring measurements, calculated predictions, and visual inspections) is employed to imitate human experts to give safety risk assessment and early warnings automatically. In addition, it has significantly improved information collection, sharing and communication by establishing a collaborative platform instead of traditional manual management. The system has been successfully applied to several metro construction projects and has perfected the safety management performance in the cities of Wuhan, Shenyang, Zhengzhou and Kunming in China.

In addition, the shortage of skilled workers that has emerged over the past three decades in various countries have forced project managers, at least in some regions or periods of time, to execute projects with less skilled or experienced workers. There has been increasing attention from researchers and practitioners on fatal injury preventive solutions. However, the industry still suffers from a relatively high and substantial disproportion in fatal injuries compared to other industries. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by elucidating the fatality rate fluctuations in the different age groups of craft workers and empirically examining the interaction of adverse impact of higher age and preventive influence of higher educational attainment and skill and experience level of craft workers on fatal injuries in construction projects. A total of 6,326 accidents were analyzed, which occurred in construction projects in the province of Tehran, Iran between 2011 and 2017. The study found the higher experience and educational attainment of craft workers significantly mitigates the severity of accidents from fatal injuries to nonfatal ones in young and middle-aged craft workers. However, the effectiveness of both factors decreases gradually when craft workers get older. Both factors' strength will be dominated by the adverse impact of age on the older workers, which results in a high fatality rate between the age of 65 and 75.","[Karimi, Hossein] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 424 Hafez Ave, Tehran 1591634311, Iran; [Taghaddos, Hosein] Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Coll Engn, 16 Azar Ave,POB 11155-4563, Tehran 1417613131, Iran","Taghaddos, H (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Civil Engn, Coll Engn, 16 Azar Ave,POB 11155-4563, Tehran 1417613131, Iran.",hossein.karimi@aut.ac.ir; htaghaddos@ut.ac.ir,"Karimi, Hossein/A-1131-2016","Karimi, Hossein/0000-0001-7290-7822",National Elites Foundation of Iran; Tecnosa R&D center at the University of Tehran,The authors would like to thank the National Elites Foundation of Iran for the financial support of this research.

Until the last few decades, there is very limited research on construction WP in HHWCs. Nevertheless, these studies have sparked interests on seeking for the most appropriate methods to assess the impact of HHWCs on construction workers. Design/methodology/approach This paper begins by reviewing the current measuring methods on WP in HHWCs, follows by presenting the potential impact of HHWCs on WP. The paper highlights the methodological deficiencies, which consequently provides a platform for scholars and practitioners to direct future research to resolve the significant productivity loss due to global warming. This paper highlights the need to identify the limitations and advantages of the current methods to formulate a framework of new approaches to measure the WP in HHWCs. Findings Results show that the methods used in providing real-time response on the effects of HHWCs on WP in construction at project, task and crew levels are limited. An integration of nonintrusive real-time monitoring system and local weather measurement with real-time data synchronisation and analysis is required to produce suitable information to determine worker health- and safety-related decisions in HHWCs. Originality/value The comprehensive literature review makes an original contribution to WP measurements filed in HHWCs in the construction industry. Results of this review provide researchers and practitioners with an insight into challenges associated with the measurements methods and solving practical site measurements issues. The findings will also enable the researchers and practitioners to bridge the identified research gaps in this research field and enhance the ability to provide accurate measures in HHWCs. The proposed research framework may promote potential improvements in the productivity measurements methods, which support researchers and practitioners in developing new innovative methods in HHWCs with the integration of the most recent monitoring technologies.","[Moohialdin, Ammar Saeed Mohammed; Lamari, Fiona; Miska, Marc] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Trigunarsyah, Bambang] RMIT Univ, Coll Design & Social Context, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Moohialdin, ASM (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",g201306030@kfupm.edu.sa; fiona.lamari@qut.edu.au; marc.miska@qut.edu.au; btriguna@gmail.com,"Trigunarsyah, Bambang/G-4177-2012","Trigunarsyah, Bambang/0000-0001-6799-4781; Moohialdin, Ammar/0000-0002-9055-9558",Queensland University of Technology,The author would like to thank the Queensland University of Technology for providing financial support in form of PhD scholarship to facilitate this research.,,75,5,5,1,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Most existing studies use either a vision-based or radio-based approach to automatically track construction entities, which, however, are bounded by the limitations of the applied technology. Vision-based tracking can achieve high localization accuracy but suffers from identity (ID) switch and fragmentation errors when multiple workers are in close proximity or occluded. In contrast, radio-based tracking is reliable in object detection and identification but less accurate in localization. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses results obtained from vision-based tracking and radio-based identification and localization for the 3D tracking of multiple construction workers. Compared to traditional fusion approaches that directly fuse locations extracted from these two approaches, the proposed method treats vision-based tracking as the main source to extract the object trajectory. Radio-based identification and localization results are used as a supplementary source to augment anonymous visual tracks with identity information and correct errors (e.g., false positives) in vision-based object detection, resulting in ID-linked 3D trajectories. In addition, a searching algorithm is introduced to recover possible missed detections in one camera view from the corresponding observations in the other view by applying a sliding window to search for regions with the most similar appearance along epipolar line. The newly created method has been validated using two indoor experiments. The results show that the new approach for fusing vision- and radio-based results increases the overall accuracy from 88% and 87% to 95% and 90%, compared to using a vision-based approach alone. The integration of radio-based identification is much more robust than using a vision system alone, as it allows the recovery of the same entity ID after the trajectory is fragmented and results in fewer fragmentations that last longer than 0.2 s.

Data were collected from 128 construction professionals and workers over five consecutive working days using the experience-sampling method. The hierarchical linear modeling results indicated that in construction professionals and workers, the daily experience of self-efficacy was positively associated with daily work engagement, which in turn negatively influenced daily deviance behavior at work. The results also revealed the cross-level moderating effect; job control strengthened the within-person suppressing impact of work engagement on deviance behavior. This study provides episodic evidence for the impact of self-efficacy on work engagement and deviance behavior in the workplace. These findings contribute to the positive psychology knowledge in construction projects by unveiling the psychosocial mechanism of construction professionals and workers through the daily diary survey method to capture the daily fluctuation of beliefs, engagement, and deviance behavior and by revealing the resource accumulation corollary of the COR theory and the motivation process of the JD-R model to highlight the facilitating function of personal and job resources.","[Zheng, Junwei] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Management, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenduo] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Wu, Guangdong; Liu, Bingsheng] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xia, Nini] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China","Xia, NN (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",zjwkmust@163.com; 17b910059@stu.hit.edu.cn; gd198410@163.com; yyang@polyu.edu.hk; ninixia@seu.edu.cn; bluesea_boy_1979@163.com,"Guang-dong, Wu/J-6979-2017; Zheng, Junwei/R-7647-2017","Guang-dong, Wu/0000-0002-2600-0493; Zheng, Junwei/0000-0002-1621-8210","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701083, 71761021, 71972018, 71722004]; Yunnan Province Basic Research Planning Project [2019FB084]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71701083, 71761021, 71972018, and 71722004) and Yunnan Province Basic Research Planning Project (Grant No. 2019FB084).

Because of this, the Hispanic construction workforce represents a crucial segment of the US construction workforce. Unfortunately, the safety performance of Hispanic workers has been documented as an area requiring special attention due to the higher rates of fatalities and nonfatal injuries among Hispanic workers. Active cultural differences (ACDs) have been identified as one of the causes that negatively influence the performance of diverse construction crews. Therefore, the construction industry strives to adopt novel management techniques to better manage diverse crews. Accordingly, this study illustrates a training module that provides the knowledge to help construction firms overcome the undesirable influences of ACDs and strengthen their desirable effects. The findings strongly suggest that the proposed training is accepted by construction personnel.

Depending on the application requirement, GPS data may be collected and post-processed or collected and processed in real time. In either case, there are questions about availability, quality, and reliability of GPS data in engineering applications. To date, despite available techniques for realizing, and to some extent improving, a certain level of GPS accuracy, there is no integrated, coherent approach or technique that would provide users with solutions that combine GPS availability, quality, and reliability. To that end, we propose quality of service (QoS) assurance for GPS. With GPS QoS, users and applications would be provided with the means for predicting GPS solutions in advance meeting the requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have developed a framework for the proposed GPS QoS called GPSLoc. In this paper, we discuss the requirements, methodologies, models, and algorithms for the GPSLoc framework and the experimentation with one of the GPS QoS parameters (visibility).","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Informat Sci & Telecommun, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Concordia Univ, Inst Informat Syst Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1T7, Canada","Karimi, HA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Informat Sci & Telecommun, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,"Liu, Xiong/O-3480-2019; Liu, Xiong/A-7144-2010","Liu, Xiong/0000-0003-4522-7228; ",,,,17,8,8,0,1,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0887-3801,1943-5487,,J COMPUT CIVIL ENG,J.

In this article, we draw on rich ethnographic data on their everyday experiences of working construction and living in Singapore, and we espouse the distinctive qualities and mission of ethnographically-informed methodologies to enact change in this space. The methods include in-depth interviews with 11 Tamil labourers, and the subsequent use of worker photo diaries, known as auto-photography, with a total of 108 photographs taken. All the participants either worked construction, were on medical leave, or were seeking compensation after workplace injury. The analysis of the interview data develops themes around precarity and discrimination on construction sites (precarity of work), and the exclusory social practices experienced by workers in their offsite world (precarity of place). Following the goals of decolonized research, our innovative methods have enabled Tamil construction workers to present their lives through their own lens. By involving migrant construction workers, we identify new sites of inquiry and knowledge in examining the inequalities and injustices they face.","[Hamid, Wajihah] Macquarie Univ, Sociol, Bldg W6A,Level 8, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Tutt, Dylan] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England","Hamid, W (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sociol, Bldg W6A,Level 8, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",wajihah.hamid@gmail.com,,"Tutt, Dylan/0000-0001-9216-8617",,,,96,9,9,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

The research used the content analysis of 75 DB requests for proposals located in 35 states with an aggregate contract value of over $700 million with the mean price per project at roughly $15 million. The projects came from seven federal agencies as well as several state agencies. It found public owners are not availing themselves of the opportunity to evaluate design-builder design quality management plans and are primarily relying on the qualifications evaluation process to ensure design quality requirements will be met. Additionally, virtually all of the public owners in the sample neglected to require constructability reviews as a design quality management requirement in spite of the published benefits of this type of review. Finally, the paper concludes this area is one where a great deal of improvement for practitioners remains and the reason for a lack of focus on design quality in DB projects is due to a failure to shift the owner's procurement culture from traditional project delivery to DB.","[Gransberg, Douglas D.] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Windel, Elizabeth] Oklahoma Property Management Inc, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA","Gransberg, DD (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",bethdecorso@gmail.com,"Gransberg, Douglas/W-1731-2019","Gransberg, Douglas/0000-0002-5588-5024",,,,10,17,17,0,14,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Much of the variability can be explained by their experience in using different information formats and differences in individual spatial cognition. Traditional delivery of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) designs rely on two-dimensional isometric drawings. Advancements in three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD), augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D printing have provided new format options for delivering engineering information; however, providing them to crafts for use at the construction workface remains relatively rare. The objective of this research is to understand how eye-gaze patterns of construction craft workers is influenced by information formats and spatial cognition when building a complex spatial task. A series of field trials with MEP workers was conducted to examine the influence of information format and spatial cognition on their eye-gaze patterns in building a scale-model pipe assembly. Participants were provided eye-tracking glasses along with one of three information formats: two-dimensional (2D) isometric drawings, 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 3D image of the assembly, and 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 3D physical model of the assembly. Card rotation and cube comparison tests were administered to measure spatial cognition. The results of this paper reveal that the information format and spatial cognition significantly influenced workers' eye-gaze patterns; there are different gaze patterns for different information formats, and these differences in gaze patterns were associated with differences in spatial cognition abilities. Additionally, the improvement in performance when using different engineering information formats is associated with different eye-gaze patterns.","[Alruwaythi, Omar] Taibah Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Madinah 42353, Saudi Arabia; [Goodrum, Paul] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Construct Engn & Management, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Alruwaythi, O (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Madinah 42353, Saudi Arabia.",oruwaythi@taibahu.edu.sa; paul.goodrum@colorado.edu,,,,,,21,3,3,4,34,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings.","[Altomonte, Sergio; Kent, Michael G.] Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham, England; [Schiavon, Stefano; Brager, Gail] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Altomonte, Sergio] Catholic Univ Louvain, Architecture & Climat, Pl Levant 1, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Altomonte, S (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham, England.; Altomonte, S (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Architecture & Climat, Pl Levant 1, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",sergio.altomonte@uclouvain.be,"Schiavon, Stefano/AAS-9673-2020; Altomonte, Sergio/M-6420-2015","Schiavon, Stefano/0000-0003-1285-5682; Altomonte, Sergio/0000-0002-2518-0234",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N50970X/1]; University of Nottingham; Industrial Partners of the Center for the Built Environment,This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/N50970X/1]; the University of Nottingham [International Collaboration Fund] and the Industrial Partners of the Center for the Built Environment.,,123,41,43,3,348,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

Large quantities of concrete and time are wasted during building construction due to management procedures, construction processes and reworks. Besides, the final construction quality cannot fully meet customer requirements. This paper explores practical solutions for construction process and quality improvement by using prefabricated composite structure (PCS) based on Six Sigma method. The D-M-A-I-C model of Six Sigma has been applied to conduct the analysis of the construction process, to discover essential factors to improve and thus to achieve higher customer satisfaction. This research finds out what influences construction process, construction quality and then adopts design and technique correction measures. It improves the construction process, quality resistance to various performances and proposes the best mix proportion. These improvement measures help to overcome and reduce considerably concrete cracking and slippage in building construction. Based on Design for Six Sigma model (Define, Characterize, Optimize and Validate: DCOV) and using the finite element analysis model (ANSYS), this study develops for scientific and economical use in construction industry a composite steel-concrete model. The proposed approach falls into three phases. Based on measurement and construction process analysis from Six Sigma black belt consultant, construction managers, Engineers, clients, architects, the model helps to find and eliminate critical defects and failure before they occur.","[Tchidi, Megan Florent] Tianjin Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [He, Zhen] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan Bo] Tianjin Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan Bo] Tianjin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Tchidi, MF (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",ftchidi@yahoo.fr; zhhe0321@163.com; liyanbo_tj@sina.com,,,,,,49,22,22,0,65,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This has been blamed for the incessant structural failure reported in Nigeria. This study appraised TQM implementation in the Nigerian construction industry, with a view to mitigating structural failure rate of construction projects. To achieve this aim, the study aims to assess the practice level of TQM and the factors hindering TQM implementation on construction projects. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized a well-structured questionnaire and convenient sampling method in the gathering and sampling of data among construction professionals in Imo state, Nigeria. Data analyses were done using, frequency, percentage, mean analytics and Pareto analysis. Findings The study revealed that major practice of TQM principles with respect to structural failure rate are purchasing: ensuring the procurement of materials of the specified quality standard, ensuring the use of a quality improvement construction process of the organization, site management responsibility: this entails ensuring quality supervision by the project management leadership and monitoring and control of quality during the construction to guarantee firm observance quality standards. Also, the major factors hindering TQM implementation on construction projects are: inadequacy of the necessary machineries, equipment, tools and facilities for the effective execution of work on construction site; breakdown in communication and information exchange between the management and supervisory teams on site; poor attitudes and strategies toward maintenance of equipment, tools and machines; and absence of prompt salary and incentive payment. It was recommended that construction firms must require the suppliers of construction materials to strictly comply with quality specification evidence in quality certification of delivered materials to mitigate structural failure. Research limitations/implications This study appraised TQM implementation in the construction industry of Nigeria, with emphasis on Imo state. The study underscores the practice level of TQM and the key factors hindering TQM implementation on construction projects. Following the localized geographical limitation of the study area, a similar research in other part/states of Nigeria or even in other developing countries of African is necessary. Practical implications The practices level of TQM and the factors hindering TQM implementation were identified. This will be useful in guiding construction firms, other industry's key stakeholders and regulatory agencies in bringing about a sustainable quality management system for improve profit and value maximization and avoiding incessant structural failure. Originality/value This is one of the few studies that have assessed the practice level of TQM and the factors hindering TQM implementation on construction projects in Nigeria.

Using the ASHRAE database of field studies in which acceptability votes were obtained from occupants, it is shown that within the thresholds the acceptability is indistinguishable. Therefore, there is little gain from conditioning spaces to an 'optimum' air temperature, a practice that involves significant energy cost. However, beyond the thresholds there is a significant drop-off in acceptability. Ideally, air-conditioning would be used only when the environmental conditions are beyond the thresholds. The use of ceiling fans or personal environmental control systems broadens the threshold range. Thresholds are determined for both air-conditioned and ventilation-cooled buildings in the database. The equally acceptable range between the thresholds is 8-10 K in both types of buildings. It is possible that a perception of reduced air quality in warm environments could impose an upper temperature threshold. Perceived air quality is examined in two laboratory studies with air temperatures ranging from 18 to 30 degrees C. Perceived air quality is seen to be closely correlated to thermal comfort rather than to temperature; as long as thermal comfort is maintained by air movement, perceived air quality will be acceptable. Relationships between temperature thresholds and productivity, operating set-points, and energy use are also discussed. Les seuils de temperature de l'air sont etudies et proposes pour un confort acceptable dans les immeubles climatises. En utilisant les etudes de terrain figurant dans la base de donnees de la Societe americaine des Ingenieurs en Chauffage, Refrigeration et Climatisation (ASHRAE), dans lesquelles il a ete obtenu de la part des occupants des reponses relatives a l'acceptabilite, il est montre que, dans la limite des seuils, l'acceptabilite n'est pas discernable. Il y a par consequent peu de benefice a climatiser des espaces a une temperature << optimale >> de l'air ce qui entraine des frais significatifs. Cependant, au-dela des seuils, l'on constate une baisse sensible de l'acceptabilite. Dans l'ideal, la climatisation ne serait utilisee que lorsque les conditions environnementales depassent les seuils. L'utilisation de ventilateurs de plafond ou de systemes de controle individuel de l'environnement elargit la plage des seuils. Les seuils sont definis a la fois pour les immeubles climatises et les immeubles refroidis par ventilation figurant dans la base de donnees. La plage offrant une egale acceptabilite entre les seuils se situe a 8-10 K dans les deux types d'immeubles. Il est possible que la perception d'une reduction de la qualite de l'air dans des environnements chauds puisse imposer un seuil de temperature superieur. La qualite de l'air percue est examinee dans deux etudes de laboratoire pour des temperatures de l'air allant de 18 degrees C a 30 degrees C. Il apparait que la qualite de l'air percue est etroitement correlee au confort thermique plutot qu'a la temperature; tant que le confort thermique est maintenu par la circulation d'air, la qualite de l'air percue sera acceptable.

The goal of new building construction is to maximize value and minimize cost while staying on time and within budget. Translating customer requirements into engineering terms for new construction design is vital for a construction project to be successful. Quality function deployment has been successfully used in product development to capture the voice of the customer and translate it into engineering characteristics. Quality function deployment then carries these parameters into production and service to ensure the voice of the customer is being met with the final product. The house of quality, a tool within quality function deployment, can provide a means for comparison of owner's project requirements and the proposed design, along with identifying how the design decisions impact meeting customer requirements and green building requirements. Quality function deployment can effectively link the project phases through design and construction and into operations and maintenance to ensure the owner's project requirements are met with the final building. This research identifies and categorizes studies of quality function deployment applications in construction. The research method used is a systematic literature review from databases related to quality function deployment in the construction industry published in the periodicals through 2016. The principal findings of implementations, practices, and integrated approaches are then summarized.

However, there is a lack of well-accepted standard as to what IC parameters should be used and how they should be interpreted during the compaction. In this study, by analyzing IC parameters in six asphalt resurfacing projects in Tennessee, the feasibility of adopting IC parameters in IC specifications for the asphalt compaction quality was evaluated. Comprehensive laboratory tests were performed on the field cores, including bulk specific gravity, permeability, and indirect tensile (IDT) strength. Results indicated that there is linear relationship among the laboratory test results. Although there were no significant relationships between the final compaction meter value (CMV) and the core results, the difference in 1/CMV between two passes in one project showed significant correlations with the laboratory results. Other IC parameters, especially the starting surface temperature of the breakdown roller, also had a strong correlation with the core density. Based on the results from this study, it is recommended that three IC parameters-the difference in 1/CMV, the starting surface temperature of compaction (> 110 degrees C), and the total number of passes (> 2 passes)-be adopted for evaluating the compaction quality of the resurfacing asphalt.

This has greatly improved engineers' ability to assess and manage pavements, but the equipment is costly, and not all agencies can afford to purchase it. Recently, researchers have developed smartphone applications to address this data collection problem, but most of this work focused on a restricted setup, or calibration. This paper presented a methodology to estimate a ride quality index (RQI) from crowdsourced smartphone measurements and validated this approach with the use of statistical methods. This investigation was divided into three phases. First, a mechanical model to assess ride quality was developed. Second, the Monte Carlo method and the probabilistic point estimate were adopted to simulate RQI measurement responses to different longitudinal profiles from different vehicle traffic spectra. Third, the effects of wander and multilane effects in estimating the minimum required sample size for RQI measurements to converge were evaluated. Once the mechanical model was developed, the results from the Monte Carlos simulations showed that in 83% of cases, the RQI measurements showed no statistical significance. The results from the effect of multilane and wandering effects showed that the sample size for RQI measurements to converge adopting a coefficient of variation of 2% is 400 samples considering a single lane and wander, and 435 samples considering two lanes and wander. The use of the Monte Carlo method successfully validated the crowdsourced smartphone-based RQI measurements as an alternative method to evaluate pavement condition. This approach has the potential to save transportation agencies millions of dollars in pavement condition surveys and to give a better sense of pavement condition in real time.","[Medina, Jose R.; Noorvand, Hossein; Kaloush, Kamil] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Ira A Fulton Sch Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Underwood, B.

The profitability, productivity and market share of North American and European firms have been adversely affected by many factors, including raw material price increases, a failure to understand customers and markets, domestic wage increases, a shorter work week, and poor use of capital. A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) provides a good means to improve this situation. Nevertheless, an FMS implementation usually costs an organization millions of dollars and the long payback period for an FMS may hinder management from adopting this new technology. It is therefore necessary that both financial and strategic benefits produced from the acquisition of an FMS be evaluated on a long-term basis. Flexible manufacturing systems are widely claimed to positively impact productivity and quality. From an extensive search and analysis of empirical studies, propositions regarding issues of flexibility, productivity, and quality are presented. Major findings support FMS investment leading to reduced labor costs, increased output, decreased manufacturing costs, increased flexibility, and reduced production lead time. There was a moderate, yet weaker, relationship between FMS investment and decreased work-in-process inventories and improved quality. There was no accurate return-on-investment justification reflecting discounted cash flow or net present value analysis on specific projects. A few projects reported project payback, the payback ranging from two to six years.","UNIV MISSOURI,COLL BUSINESS & PUBL ADM,DEPT MANAGEMENT,COLUMBIA,MO 64211; CATERPILLAR INC,CORP TECH SUPPORT GRP,PEORIA,IL 61656; BRADLEY UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN,PEORIA,IL 61625","CHEN, FF (corresponding author), CATERPILLAR INC,CTR TECH,PROCESS & MAT RES DEPT,POB 1875,PEORIA,IL 61656, USA.",,,,,,,59,61,61,1,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Four hypotheses are developed and tested with data collected in a worldwide survey of manufacturing plants. In order to provide a relevant context for both CCP and the theory of performance frontiers, we focus on two sets of countries: more recently industrialized economies in Asia (China, Taiwan, South Korea), and long-standing industrialized economies in Western Europe (Germany, Finland, Italy, Sweden). We analyze the effectiveness of quality management in these two groups in terms of their impact on perceived and actual quality performance, and offer explanations for the difficulties that exist in global quality management. Our findings stress the importance of having a common understanding of what defines good quality across plants globally.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be fine-tuned and evaluated in future research.

In situ density measurements from sand cone testing are highly operator-dependent; in addition, the test procedure is tedious and time-consuming. In this study, a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) was used to perform quality control (QC) of earthworks by measuring penetration resistance in compacted soil. DCP tests were performed on three test pads specially constructed using different soil typesclayey sand with gravel, clayey sand, and silty sand. The test results were expressed in terms of a dynamic penetration index (DPI), defined as the depth of penetration of the cone per hammer blow. Correlations are developed between DPI and compacted density for the three soil types considered. In order to meet the criterion of compacted density equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum density from a laboratory standard Proctor test, DPI values are found to range from 5 to 8mm/blow, corresponding to 250mm penetration of cone on tested soil types. The effect of the fall height of the hammer on the measured DPI is also studied by performing DCP tests for two fall heights, 575 and 450mm. DPI values are found to increase by 11-26% when the height of the fall increases from 450 to 575mm, for the highest energy level considered in the study. It is also found that DPI is very sensitive to the moisture content and in situ density of compacted layers. The DCP device provided quick test results and was simple to operate on any subgrade layer; hence, the frequency of QC tests can be increased, leading to an improvement in the overall quality of compaction of earthworks.","[Chennarapu, Hariprasad] Vardhaman Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Hyderabad 501218, Telangana, India; [Chennarapu, Hariprasad] IIT Hyderabad, Dept Civil Engn, Sangareddy 502285, Telangana, India; [Garala, Thejesh Kumar; Balunaini, Umashankar] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Civil Engn, Sangareddy 502285, Telangana, India; [Chennareddy, Rajasekhar; Reddy, G.

The purpose of this paper is to see if service quality impacts on customer satisfaction during construction, despite the apparent conflict in expectations. Design/methodology/approach - A detailed single case study methodology is used, focusing on the aforementioned customer as the unit of measure. A longitudinal design is employed by measuring customer satisfaction and service quality gap scores at four stages during construction, using a survey instrument adapted from the consumer research literature. This is coupled with qualitative interview data coded into a linked set of definable service incidents. Findings - The study finds that irrespective of having price and product oriented pre-purchase expectations, customer satisfaction is closely related to perceptions of service quality during onsite construction. This only occurs for a selective set of active service quality dimensions-especially responsiveness and reliability dimensions. These dimensions appear to be driven by the customer's underlying level of exposure to both positive and negative service incidents, and the ratio between the two appears to direct the strength and direction of gap scores. Once the physical end product materialises, the customer gradually focuses more on the objectivity and realisation this offers, and less on service quality. Originality/value - The paper facilitates theory development in terms of generating testable variables effecting the dynamic relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction, during construction. The approach enables an increased ability to identify and explain how contextual variables, linked to specific customer types, impact on the relationship.

The motivation was to analyze how the level and amplitude of inspection in different stages of a supply chain (from fabrication to mechanical completion) affect the resulting quality of products as measured by the number of nonconformances (NCs) found in its different stages. Quantitative data were collected using an instrument used by CII member organizations to submit data on actual purchase orders and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney (M-W) test on the nonparametric set of data obtained. Following the statistical analysis, interviews with subject matter experts, face-to-face presentations, and sharing of reports with the research team were used to clarify questions, interpret the data, and validate conclusions. The results provide insights regarding where inspection is most needed and indicate that some of the following supplier quality surveillance (SQS) practices are correlated with improved supplier quality: observation and inspection in the supplier's facility; development and use of a quality control or inspection and testing (QC/IT) plan; planning in concert with suppliers; increased communication before and during execution; and post-project completion assessments (PPCAs) of supplier performance. Results also showed that registered or certified suppliers do not show a statistically significant relationship to improved quality. Finally, the study contributes to explaining how process inspections are directly linked to the number of resulting product nonconformances, identifying which practices used by suppliers and owners/contractors are more effective in reducing the number of nonconformances in a product, and identifying potential indicators that can be collected during the execution of purchase orders and associated with the final quality of products.

Findings From the research, it showed that all clusters (construction company, construction worker, construction media and construction union) shared similar trends on follower-following ratios and sentiment analysis in both social media platforms. The biggest difference between the two countries is that public accounts (e.g. company, media and union) on Twitter posted more on public interests, including safety and energy. Research limitations/implications The research contributes to knowledge about an alternative method of data collection for both academia and industry practitioners. Statistical bias can be introduced by only using social media platform data. The analyzed four clusters can be further divided to reflect more fine-grained groups of construction industries. The results can be integrated into other analyses based on traditional methodologies of data collection such as questionnaire surveys or interviews.

The purposes of this paper are to identify the key dimensions/criteria in the CoPs, to use fuzzy logic method to analyze the relative importance of each criterion, and to rank the criteria so that proper resources can be allocated while managing the CoPs. Through interviews with experts, four strategy alternatives and 16 criteria along four dimensions are generated. A survey of the CoPs practitioners is then conducted to compare the results of each criterion. The results will not only help organizations that intend to initiate changes via the CoPs activities to decide the ranking of their appraisal criteria, but it can also assist them in guiding the behavior of their staff while effectively monitoring and improving the performances of the CoPs.","Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; La Trobe Univ, Sch Business, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; Kainan Univ, Coll Management, Dept Business Adm, Tao Yuan 338, Taiwan; La Trobe Univ, Sch Business, Business Syst & Knowledge Modeling Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia","Chu, MT (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Management Technol, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",debbiechu@itri.org.tw,"Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/B-2775-2009","Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/0000-0003-1856-7497",,,,44,18,18,1,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Design/methodology/approach - This research identified and refined 14 influencing factors through literature review and academic expert discussions. Questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data about the influencing factors and project cost performance. Then those factors were reduced to four components by factor analysis. Logistic regression analysis is used to investigate the relationship between four principal components and project cost performance. Findings - The results indicate that the significant influencing factors of project cost performance of DBB projects and DB projects are different. For DBB projects, owner abilities, such as owner team ability, owner experience, and owner finance, are important influencing factors causing cost overruns, while for DB projects cost performance is more sensitive to the contractor abilities, namely, contractor team ability, contractor finance, contractor experience, etc. Research limitations/implications - The results of the paper are mainly derived by quantitative research method based on the survey of 144 samples, so the results may need validation by qualitative studies. Further research could apply case study or interview to validate the findings in this research. In addition, project type and location are not considered as control variables due to the limited number of samples, future research could be conducted to investigate their relationship with project performance. Practical implications - The findings of this research not only help practitioners have a better understanding of the factors influencing project cost performance, but also provide some guidelines for practitioners to pay attention to different factors to better control the cost performance within different delivery systems. Originality/value - Owner ability and contractor ability are found to be of different importance in influencing cost performance of DBB and DB projects. This research extends previous research on cost management by considering different significant factors in influencing project cost performance within DBB and DB projects.","[Lu, Wenxue] Tianjin Univ, Sch Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Hua, YuanYuan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, SuJuan] Tianjin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Zhang, SJ (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",yyzhangsujuan@163.com,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71172147, 71231006]",The authors are very grateful to the support from the National Science Foundation of China funded projects (Project Number 71172147 and 71231006) and also help from respondents for participating in the questionnaires.,,72,8,8,2,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

The concern of reducing the duration of these projects is one of the important issues among various aspects; thus, our aim is to fulfill the requirements by using the game theory approach. In this study, a mixed-integer programming model consisting of game theory and project scheduling is developed to reduce the duration of projects with a minimum increase in costs. In this model, two contractors in successive periods are entered into a step-by-step competition by the employer during dynamic games, considering an exchange in their limited resources. The optimum solution of the game in each stage are selected as the strategy, and the resources during the game are considered to be renewable and limited. The strategy of each contractor can be described as follows: 1) share their resources with the other contractor and 2) not share the resources with the other contractor. This model can act dynamically in all circumstances during project implementation. If a player chooses a non-optimum strategy, then this strategy can immediately update itself at the succeeding time period. The proposed model is solved using the exact Benders decomposition method, which is coded in GAMS software. The results suggest the implementation of four step-by-step games between the contractors. Then, the results of our model are compared with those of the conventional models. The projects' duration in our model is reduced by 22.2%. The nominal revenue of both contractors has also reached a significant value of 46078 units compared with the relative value of zero units in the original model. Moreover, we observed in both projects the decreases of 19.5%, 20.9%, and 19.7% in the total stagnation of resources of types 1, 2, and 3, respectively.","[Piri, Loghman; Ghezavati, Vahidreza; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan] Islamic Azad Univ, Sch Ind Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran 1584743311, Iran","Ghezavati, V (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sch Ind Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran 1584743311, Iran.",v_ghezavati@azad.ac.ir,"Hafezalkotob, Ashkan/AAR-8660-2020; Ghezavati, Vahidreza/AAZ-4694-2021",,,,,36,0,0,0,4,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

The generation of the attribute weights is performed by considering the presence, absence, and the positions of the attributes in the decision tree. This process and the development of the CBR simulation model are described in the paper. The model was tested by using data pertaining to the early design parameters and unit cost of the structural system of residential building projects. The CBR results indicate that the attribute weights generated by taking into account the information gain of all the attributes performed better than the attribute weights generated by considering only the appearance of attributes in the tree. The study is of benefit primarily to researchers, as it compares the impact of attribute weights generated by three different methods and, hence, highlights the fact that the prediction rate of models such as CBR largely depends on the data associated with the parameters used in the model.","[Dogan, Sevgi Zeynep; Guenaydin, H.

However, there is a lack of research efforts comparing and evaluating virtual manipulation hardware for construction tasks. Moreover, the current practice of virtual manipulation has limited functionality to guide users with the placement of objects in virtual environments. To address these issues, this paper presents 1) a detailed case study that compares three types of manipulation hardware (image-based, infrared-based, and magnetic-based) for construction applications and 2) a snap-to-fit method that improves the VM through solving limitations of the advanced virtual reality interaction metaphors. The latter enhances the placement process for manipulation by comparing two models (e.g., scan and BIM models) for proper placement in assembly scenarios. The case study results show that magnetic-based systems outperform others in construction scenarios.

The benefits of energy benchmarking are exponentially valuable for institutional building owners such as hospitals, universities, or public agencies. In light of the proliferation of building information modeling (BIM), building automation systems, and game engine technologies, campus-wide energy information can be linked through virtual three-dimensional (3D) models for interactive energy benchmarking. This paper discusses the development of a virtual campus model that integrates the theories and technologies with the process of developing workflows and implementation strategies that can be employed and adopted in campus-level building-retrofit practices. The result from a Proof of Concept project is summarized in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed virtual campus model. This paper also describes the technical requirements, system architecture, and functionality of the virtual campus model. Finally, some lessons learned and recommendations are highlighted to help develop future research and implementation.

To prevent fall from scaffolds, toe-boards and guard-rails must be installed on scaffold work platforms according to relevant safety regulations. Traditionally, the checking of safety regulation conformity relies on manual observation, which is inefficient and inaccurate. To address the limitations of manual checking, this study proposes a technique to automatically check whether scaffold work platforms conform to the safety regulations based on 3D point cloud data. The proposed technique first detects the location of scaffolds from the point cloud data by finding the vertical scaffold components, known as uprights. Then, scaffold work platforms, which are planar and horizontal components, are detected based on the histogram of the Z values of the point cloud data. Once the work platforms are extracted, the toe-boards and guard-rails are detected along all the four sides of each work platform. Then, the detected toe-boards and guard-rails are checked to identify any violation of safety regulations. Validation experiments were conducted on a point cloud dataset acquired from a construction site in Singapore. The experimental results show that the proposed technique could successfully detect scaffolds and work platforms from point cloud data, and extract toe-boards and guard-rails for safety regulation checking. All the violations of safety regulations in the point cloud data were successfully identified using the proposed technique.","[Wang, Qian] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore","Wang, Q (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore.",bdgwang@nus.edu.sg,"Wang, Qian/N-8410-2017","Wang, Qian/0000-0003-3175-334X",,,,51,8,8,3,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Concrete formwork is a representative temporary structure, and frequently fails during construction due to unexpected external factors. Therefore, safety managers should constantly monitor structural behavior to determine whether the formwork is performing safely. Information on structural behavior provides knowledge on the characteristics of actual temporary structures and can help ensure safe concrete placement. The objective of this study is to present a guideline for safe concrete placement based on an understanding of the structural behavior of concrete formwork. Using ubiquitous sensor network devices, an indoor test bed was built to test the structural behavior of concrete formwork. Eight scenarios were investigated, representing typical safety conditions that occur for concrete formwork. Finite-element analysis was conducted for these scenarios to provide a guideline for safe concrete placement. Laboratory loading tests conducted on the test bed validated that the safety guideline provided a suitable procedure to cope with abnormal behaviors on concrete formwork and can be applied to ensure safe concrete placement.

The current law has fundamental differences from the previous one, Law No. 2886, in that the current law's main objective is to increase the effective use of public resources. Although the current law was enacted nine years ago, no in-depth research has been undertaken related to the extent of public savings. Thus, the aim of this research is to analyze the performance of public investments for construction with respect to their success in achieving on time and within budget completion. Additionally, a comparison between the completion duration and budget of construction projects undertaken under the current and the previous law is presented. To achieve these goals, historical contract documents addressing 878 and 575 public construction projects undertaken under two laws, respectively, were analyzed. In this context, the data mining method, including decision trees, artificial neural network, and support vector machines, was applied to predict the duration and cost deviations of the construction projects during the tender process, and the results were compared. It was demonstrated that the current law has contributed substantially towards the completion of the projects within estimated or envisaged durations and costs. The findings of this research can be generalized to countries with similar economical and organizational structures with Turkey.","Mustafa Kemal Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Turkey","Erdis, E (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, TR-31200 Iskenderun, Turkey.",eerdis@mku.edu.tr,,,,,,56,11,11,0,31,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

To address these challenges, a new holistic temporary housing planning framework is proposed to offer customized housing plans tailored to the specific social, economic, and psychological needs of displaced families while controlling expenditures. This paper presents the theoretical formulation and implementation details of the community-based housing response pool, which is a comprehensive framework that aims at (1)quantifying the specific needs and preferences of each displaced family, (2)evaluating the ability of housing alternatives to meet those needs, (3)computing temporary housing life cycle costs, and (4)optimizing housing decisions accordingly.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how risk cost influences risk allocation. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was used to collect data. The questionnaire included nine sub-categories of risks. To quantify the influence of risk cost on risk allocation, a dependency risk matrix was employed. Heat maps techniques were used to visualise the results of the survey. Findings The findings show which risks within the endogenous or exogenous groups are to be allocated to the public sector, the private sector, or to be shared. The finding from this research provides a baseline for the PPP stakeholders in developing guidelines for estimating the value of risk costs in the risks register as well as serving as a mechanism for risk allocation. Research limitations/implications - The context of the study may limit the generalisability of the results. Practical implications - The study provides practical guidance to PPP stakeholders on risk allocation appetite. Originality/value This study extends the processes and methods by which PPP project's risk is allocated to create a better value for all the stakeholders.","[Almarri, Khalid; Boussabaine, Halim] British Univ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Alzahrani, Saleh] Natl Pan Kingdom, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Almarri, K (corresponding author), British Univ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",khalid.almarri@buid.ac.ae,"almarri, khalid/AAQ-6246-2020; Almarri, Khalid/ABA-1368-2020","almarri, khalid/0000-0001-8234-1789; ",,,,47,2,2,11,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Case Study of KM-Enabled Engineering Problem Solving,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Knowledge management; Problem solving; Quantitative benefits; Engineering consulting,CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE,"Managers of construction organizations have long been faced with the essential question of whether the knowledge management system (KMS) is truly cost effective. Very few empirical studies have been conducted to measure the effective benefits of implementing knowledge management initiatives. A lack of quantitative measurement models, the difficulty of differentiating knowledge management (KM) from non-KM activities, the difficulty of evaluating the resultant KM activity values, and an unwillingness of organizations to reveal insights (aimed at shielding these insights from their competitors) are critical reasons for their absence from empirical reports. This paper reveals a five-year comprehensive benefit survey on the implementation of a specialized KMS, KM-enabled problem solver, at a major engineering consulting firm. In total, 868 emergency problem-solving scenarios recorded in the KMS were analyzed. Three that were most concerned with benefit indexes (time, cost, and staff hours) selected by the KM managers were measured. Results showed timeliness to be the most remarkable tangible benefit. Both staff hours and cost benefits were negative. Qualitative benefits were identified and addressed through focus group meetings with the KM managers. The KM approach was not suited to solving all types of engineering problems. Strategies should be taken to facilitate engineering problem solving, including development of a more proactive approach.

This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between design-stage elemental cost plan and final tender sum (contract sum) in traditionally procured commercial building projects. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant ones during design development. Project data from New Zealand were obtained through online questionnaire and interview surveys to determine the construction consultants' perspectives. Responses to the survey were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk, coefficient of variation, and Kendall's coefficient of concordance. A ranking of mean scores of the survey responses enabled the most significant risk factors to be determined. Interviews were analyzed by using thematic and documentary methods to complement survey responses on risk identification. Thus, interview survey prioritized five from the top 10 risk factors obtained by using quantitative approach. The primary contribution of this study is to provide quantitative confirmation of the more general statements made in the literature from around the world and therefore add to and consolidate existing knowledge. Moreover, as risk elements are inherent in construction project developments globally, these findings have important ramifications for all construction projects in expanding and clarifying existing knowledge on what is needed for reasonable budgetary performance and successful delivery of construction projects.","[Adafin, Johnson; Wilkinson, Suzanne] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 20 Symonds St, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Rotimi, James O.

Previous research outside the construction industry has involved the use of a psychology perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ) to measure occupational stress, resulting in the identification of one stressor, demand, and three sub-dimensional emotional reactions in terms of worry, tension and joy. The PSQ is translated into Chinese with a back translation technique and used in a survey of young construction cost professionals in China. Principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are used to test the divisibility of occupational stress, little mentioned in previous research on stress in the construction context. In addition, structural equation modelling is used to assess nomological validity by testing the effects of the three dimensions on organizational commitment, the main finding of which is that lack of joy has the sole significant effect. The three-dimensional measurement framework facilitates the standardizing measurement of occupational stress. Further research will establish whether the findings are also applicable in other settings and explore the relations between stress dimensions and other managerial concepts.","[Xiong, Bo; Skitmore, Martin; Xia, Bo] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Xiong, B (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",peterxiongbo@gmail.com,"Xia, Bo/J-1355-2012; Skitmore, Martin/I-9743-2012","Xia, Bo/0000-0001-7694-4743; Skitmore, Martin/0000-0001-7135-1201; Xiong, Bo/0000-0002-0388-2067","QUT HDR Sponsorship from the research project 'Hosting, Maintenance and Further Development of the BER - Cost Analysis Model' - Commonwealth of Australia","The first author is financially supported by a QUT HDR Sponsorship from the research project 'Hosting, Maintenance and Further Development of the BER - Cost Analysis Model' funded by the Commonwealth of Australia represented by the Department of Education.",,60,9,9,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Most project managers are dissatisfied with the information produced by PMIS. Based on a survey among 101 project managers the interactions between six factors related to PMIS information quality and usage and their effect on decision making are examined in a multi project environment. Using structural equation modeling, new insights were gained in these complex relationships. Results indicate that the use of a project management information system is advantageous to project managers, while no adverse effects were observed due to project and information overload. PMIS information quality is positively related to quality of the decisions, satisfaction of project managers with PMTS and use of PMIS information. Simultaneous handling of multiple projects causes project managers to extend conclusions about the information quality for one project to all projects at hand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. PMA and IPMA.

Despite significant technological advances in the last few decades, people with physical disabilities who rely on wheeled mobility devices continue to face significant challenges when independently navigating inside complex indoor environments. Several technological solutions have been explored to address this issue in previous work. Specifically, vision-based techniques that utilize fiducial markers as visual cues for assisted navigation have received particular attention because of their cost-effectiveness, reconfigurability, and ease of installation. Although such previous work addressed indoor localization for assisted navigation, it did not adequately address the fundamental aspects of indoor path planning, particularly in the context of considering human preferences or physical constraints present in the built environment. This paper addresses these key research gaps by developing fundamental rules for creating an indoor attribute-loaded graph network and a marker network map, developing a generic algorithm for determining optimal paths (instead of shortest paths only) from attribute-loaded networks, and integrating the findings within an interactive user interface (UI). As a precursor to eventual studies with people with mobility impairments, a scenario analysis followed by a preliminary usability study in a real physical environment involving 10 participants without disabilities was conducted to evaluate the navigation interface. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed navigation system and provide design insights for improving the usability and performance of the current user interface.

The design-coordination productivity and information-exchange patterns are analysed for a unique case where two towers, A and B, of a hospital project deployed two different design coordination strategies in a 2D and BIM mixed-construction environment. The tower A strategy coordinated designs using drawings as the main source of information and confirmed them using BIM (BIM-assisted coordination), whereas the tower B strategy coordinated designs using BIM and confirmed them using drawings (BIM-led coordination). The coordination productivity was 228% faster for tower B than for tower A. The frequency of design changes was much lower for tower B (0.42 times/drawing) than for tower A (2.13 times/drawing). As the result, the design coordination for tower A was delayed by 9.3 months, whereas tower B was completed rapidly and without any delay. A social network analysis revealed that the BIM-led coordination was supported by the relatively even distribution of information, the reduced control of an mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) engineer over a project, and higher accessibility to the information for every project participant.","[Park, Jae Hyuk] GS Engn & Construct, Bldg Projects Operat Div, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Ghang] Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, G (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",glee@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Park, Jae Hyuk/0000-0002-6238-7920; Lee, Ghang/0000-0002-3522-2733","Architecture & Urban Development Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government [17RTRP-B104237-03]","This research was supported by a grant [number 17RTRP-B104237-03] from the Architecture & Urban Development Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government.",,35,14,14,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

In the design process of a building, the use of a lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and validated on two design options. The application of the actual building project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second alternative by 4.6%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by 35.4%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4% within the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin, designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in its life cycle according to the proposed indices.","[Rad, Mohammad Amin Hamedi; Golpour, Ashkan] Iran Univ Sci & Technol IUST, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Jalaei, Farzad] Natl Res Council Canada, Construct Res Ctr, 1200 Montreal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada; [Varzande, S.

This is often due to a lack of essential learning from projects because of insufficient communication and working experience. One of the key reasons why this occurs is that managers are unaware of what knowledge needs to be retained. In contrast with knowledge management research, which mostly focuses on the systems and processes for capturing, storing, and retrieval of knowledge, this paper investigates the nature of project communication and learning and their role on project time and cost control. Design/methodology/approach A stratified proportional purposive sampling approach was adopted in choosing the interview participants for the study. They are experienced industry practitioners working on building construction projects in Malaysia. Content analysis was then performed on the interview data. The identified variables were further validated by 11 industry experts from the three primary construction stakeholders. Findings The results of a series of 12 in-depth interviews with industry practitioners are provided to reveal the effective communication tools for sharing and learning in a project-based environment, the learning inducing situations involved, and the use of reusable project experiences to improve project time and cost control.

This paper develops a switching regression model of acquisition cost to simultaneously predict the probability of whether a parcel will go to condemnation rather than be acquired through negotiation and the corresponding acquisition costs under these two regimes. The error terms of the selection equation and the two cost equations follow a trivariate normal distribution to reflect codependence on unobserved factors (such as a land owner's tenacity or a site's view value). When applied to the properties acquired across the state of Texas for transportation probjects between 2008 and 2011, the results of this switching regression model suggest that R/W appraisers and staff should pay special attention to parcels in commercial use involving a partial taking with a relatively small remainder and located in more urbanized areas. Comparison of cost estimates between the two regimes (condemnation versus negotiation) suggests that condemned parcels will have, on average, 78% higher acquisition costs and 51% greater price variation across the 1,710 acquired properties. These results suggest that it is much more costly to acquire a property and more difficult to accurately predict its costs if it cannot be acquired through negotiation. The application of model estimates to an example corridor highlights the value of simulation to capture all modeling uncertainties.

The body of knowledge, therefore, reports on different preparedness standards adopted by developed countries such as the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (USA), Canada, Japan and Australia. Other countries, however, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (in the absence of its preparedness framework), have long adapted the UK preparedness standards. This has called for this study to investigate the state of EP practices in the UAE to identify the limitations and challenges it has been facing during its preparedness phase when adopting the UK preparedness standards. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative methods of data collection and documentation with the content analysis were adopted to identify the barriers faced by the preparedness phase of emergency management (EM) in the UAE. A Pilot study was therefore conducted to validate eight key elements of the EP phase identified from the literature. The state of EP phase and the extent to which the eight key elements of EP elements were practiced and the barriers in their implementation in the UAE were explored through interviews at federal (National Crisis and Emergency Management Authority) and local levels (local team of crisis and emergency management). Findings The study identified eight key elements of the EP phase and the associated barriers related to their implementation in the UAE. The barriers were ranked based on their severity by interviewing experts at both federal and local levels. Practical implications This paper addresses the need to investigate the state of the EP phase, its key elements and the barriers faced during its implementation in the UAE. Originality/value Due to the absence of any EP frameworks or systems in the UAE, this paper aims to validate the EP elements identified by adopting a qualitative approach.","[Rashid Alteneiji, Hamdan] Sharjah Police Head Quarter, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Ahmed, Vian] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Saboor, Sara] Amer Univ Sharjah, Ind Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates","Saboor, S (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Ind Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",dr.h.altinige@gmail.com; vahmed@aus.edu; g00080300@aus.edu,,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

This study investigates the determinants of timely decision-making from the perspective of collaboration network dynamics. From the archival data recordings of the decision-making meetings of Program N, a national water transfer program, the meeting-based collaboration relationships of the decision makers were identified. Cox regression was employed to explore the effects of collaboration network dynamics on the time needed to reach a decision. The results suggest that stronger previous collaboration relationships and more centralized social capital distribution in decisions groups contribute to more timely decision-making. These findings substantiate social network theories in a real-world collaborative decision-making setting and reveal the facilitators of timely project decisions.

In order to prevent reoccurrence of defects, a data feedback mechanism is required. However, most defect data are stored in unstructured ways, resulting in the fundamental problem of data utilization. This paper proposes a novel framework by using BIM and linked data technologies for sharing defect data between heterogeneous data sources in a new way. To demonstrate, a defect ontology is developed, work context information is extracted from BIM models, extracted BIM data is converted to RDF format and SPARQL queries are implemented. The proposed approach could help BIM software applications to take into account information stemming from the defect management domain. Also, it can reduce data search time and improve the accuracy of search results as well. Therefore, this framework may enable reductions of defect occurrence and improvements in current defect management practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a new activity uncrashing heuristic with noncritical activity rescheduling method to narrow the gap between the research and practice for time-cost optimization. The uncrashing heuristic searches for new solutions by uncrashing the critical activities with the highest cost-slope. This novel feature of the proposed heuristic enables identification and elimination of the dominated solutions during the search procedure. Hence, the heuristic can determine new high-quality solutions based on the nondominated solutions. Furthermore, the proposed noncritical activity rescheduling method of the heuristic decreases the amount of scheduling calculations, and high-quality solutions are achieved within a short CPU time. Results of the computational experiments reveal that the new heuristic outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly for large-scale single-objective cost minimization and Pareto front optimization problems. Hence, the primary contribution of the paper is a new heuristic method that can successfully achieve high-quality solutions for large-scale discrete time-cost optimization problems.","[Sonmez, Rifat] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Aminbakhsh, Saman] Atilim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey; [Atan, Tankut] Bahcesehir Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34353 Istanbul, Turkey","Sonmez, R (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",rsonmez@metu.edu.tr,"Atan, Tankut/AAG-6723-2019; Aminbakhsh, Saman/S-6864-2019; Sonmez, Rifat/AAQ-4963-2020","Atan, Tankut/0000-0002-3241-4617; Sonmez, Rifat/0000-0001-6163-3264; Aminbakhsh, Saman/0000-0002-4389-1910",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [213M253],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), under Grant No. 213M253.",,34,4,4,1,12,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Previous studies adopted approaches from other domains, such as outdoor logistics, and made application-specific assumptions. This study proposes a new methodology to optimize the task-allocation and route-planning for multiple indoor robots with multiple starts and destination depots where each robot begins and ends at the same depot (referred to as a fixed destination multi-depot multiple traveling salesman problem-fMmTSP). The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with two existing outdoor-based algorithms. Results show that the proposed algorithm performs better in almost all the cases for the assumed network, which supports the need to develop algorithms specifically for indoor networks.","[Mantha, Bharadwaj R.

It requires a dedicated interdisciplinary learning environment. Creating this environment remains a challenge due to the lack of a learning tool to facilitate an interdisciplinary approach. Perhaps due to this challenge, interdisciplinarity within the context of low carbon transition (LCT) in the built environment has not been sufficiently explored. This study deals with this gap in the literature by developing a pedagogical approach founded on the combined use of Grounded Theory Method, Cognitive Mapping Technique and Meaningful Learning Activities. This paper focuses on the testing phase of this approach, which engaged researchers, postgraduate and undergraduate students. The findings promote a transformative pedagogy to explore the socio-technical dimension of the LCT. They point out the type of interdisciplinarity, which we need to integrate into traditional curricula, moving from vocabulary construction at the undergraduate level to exploration of different perspectives at the postgraduate level.

In such applications, objects of interest need to be robustly localized and documented for supporting data-driven decision-making in site inspection and resource mobilization. However, participatory sensing is inappropriate to localize a distant object due to the absence of ranging sensors in citizens' mobile devices; thus, the localization accuracy varies to a large extent. To address this issue, this study presents a novel geospatial localization method for distant objects based on participatory sensing. The proposed geospatial localization process consists of multiple computational modules a geographic coordinate conversion, mean-shift clustering, deep learning-based object detection, magnetic declination adjustment, line of sight equation formulation, and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse method to improve the localization accuracy in participatory sensing environments. The experiments were conducted in Houston and College Station in Texas to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrated a reasonable localization accuracy, recording the distance errors of 1.5 m to 27.8 m when the distance from observers to the objects of interest were 17 m to 296 m. The proposed method is expected to contribute to rapid data collection over large urban areas, thereby facilitating disaster preparedness that needs to identify locations of distant objects at risk.","[Kim, Hongjo] Univ Dayton, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Engn Mech, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Ham, Youngjib] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Ham, Y (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",hkim01@udayton.edu; yham@tamu.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) under CMMI AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1832187],"This material is in part based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under CMMI Award#1832187.

Design decisions arise as the result of social interactions and information exchanges between project actors. Interactions can be studied using social-network analysis (SNA). The patterns of social interaction that underpinned key design decisions with the potential to impact construction WHS were investigated in an Australian case-study project. SNA was applied longitudinally to capture network information for 42 sequential design decisions. Changes in network density were examined over time, and networks were compared before and after a contractor was engaged. In-depth interviews explored differences in design and WHS outcomes. The results revealed changing social networks over the study period. Furthermore, improvement in WHS-related design outcomes was observed as participants with relevant construction knowledge joined the social networks and moved to prominent positions. It is argued that understanding how social networks change and play out to produce project outcomes (e.g., WHS) can help project leadership teams to develop communication networks that are more likely to support effective decision making and performance.

Now, a business's worth and profit are taken into consideration when making technical decisions. Over 80% of the United States GDP is derived from projects that emphasize money as being an essential component involved in the process. On the other hand, all other aspects of a project are becoming more complex, such as equipment installation, the design and manufacturing process, renovation, and replacement. Thus, these factors must be emphasized when making decisions, as well. The private sector and federal institutions view projects as being the newest avenue for creating profits and keeping the economy afloat. As a result, project management should be considered to be an essential component, because it can recognize citizen-paid taxes and can avoid wasting resources. This study will begin with a discussion of how vital economics can be to the project management and the project environment.

Existing methods, such as probabilistic and statistical algorithms have been developed for project cost prediction. However, these methods are unable to produce accurate results for conceptual cost prediction due to small and unstable data samples. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms include numerous models and algorithms for supervised regression applications. Therefore, a comparative analysis for AI models is required to guide practitioners to the appropriate model. The article focuses on investigating 20 AI techniques which are conducted for conceptual cost modeling, such as fuzzy logic model, artificial neural networks, multiple regression analysis, case-based reasoning, hybrid models, such as genetic fuzzy model, and ensemble methods such as scalable boosting trees (XGBoost) and random forest. Field canals improvement projects (FCIPs) are used as an actual case study to analyze the performance of the applied ML models. Out of 20 AI techniques, the results show that the most accurate and suitable method is XGBoost with 9.091% and 0.929 based on mean absolute percentage error and adjusted R-2, respectively. Nonlinear adaptability, handling missing values and outliers, model interpretation, and uncertainty have been discussed for the 20 developed AI models. In addition, this study presents a publicly open dataset for FCIPs to be used for future models' validation and analysis.","[Elmousalami, Haytham H.] Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Giza 12613, Egypt; [Elmousalami, Haytham H.] Gen Petr Co, Cairo 11311, Egypt","Elmousalami, HH (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Giza 12613, Egypt.",haythamelmousalami2014@gmail.com,,"Elmousalami, Haytham Hesham/0000-0002-2032-0648",,,,96,4,4,5,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In this regard, heart rate (HR) is an effective physiological indicator of workers' physical demands. Currently, off-the-shelf wearable activity trackers (e.g., wristband-type) can monitor a worker's HR with its embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. However, PPG signals can be highly affected by signal noises resulted from user's movements, and thus the exact HR extraction from a wristband-type PPG may not be sufficiently accurate during intensive construction tasks. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a PPG sensor embedded in a wristband-type tracker to see if it can be used for construction. Through field data collection from seven construction workers, we conduct a comparative HR analysis between a PPG sensor and an electro-cardiography (ECG) sensor in a chest strap used as ground truth. The results show that a PPG-based HR sensor in a wristband-type activity tracker has a potential for practicable HR monitoring of construction workers with 4.79% of mean-average-percentage-error (MAPE) and 0.85 of correlation coefficient for whole datasets (4.44%, 4.52%, and 533% of MAPEs and 0.89, 0.70, and 0.61 of correlation coefficients during light works with <90 bpm of HRs, moderate works with 90-110 bpm of HRs, and heavy works with >110 bpm of HRs, respectively). Because there is still room for improvement of the accuracy, particularly during heavy works, we also investigate the factors affecting the accuracy of HR monitoring using inequality statistics. From this secondary investigation, we found the major sources of error including noises from motion artifacts. With advanced noise-cancellation techniques, it is expected that that field HR monitoring using wearable activity trackers can be used to evaluate worker's physical demands from diverse construction tasks in a non-intrusive and affordable way. As a result, our work will help manage excessive workloads (e.g., flexing work/rest plans) so that a worker can sustain his/her given tasks during working time in a safer and healthier way.

To improve the reliability of cost estimation results using CBR, a recurring issue in similarity measurement has been to accurately compute the distance among attributes and cases for the retrieval of the most similar singular or plural cases. However, these existing similarity measures have limitations in taking the covariance among attributes into consideration, and reflecting the effects of covariance in the computation of distances among attributes. To deal with this challenging issue, this research examines the weighted Mahalanobis distance based similarity measure applied to CBR cost estimation, and carries out comparative research on the existing distance measurement methods of CBR. To validate the suggested CBR cost model, simulation data test and case studies using 99 multi-family housing complexes are carried out. As a consequence, this research is expected to improve academic value and mathematical and statistical logicality of similarity measurement, especially in application to CBR cost estimation. The results can be further referenced to not only the area of construction cost estimation, but also international market selection, planning and scheduling, noise control and management, and energy management where case-based reasoning can be applied.","[Ahn, Joseph] POSTECH, GEM, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Park, Moonseo; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Song, Kwonsik] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Ahn, Sung Jin] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Dept Informat Stat, 501 Jinju Daero, Jinju 660701, Gyeongnam, South Korea; [Ji, Sae-Hyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Son, Bo-Sik] Namseoul Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Cheonan 331707, South Korea","Ji, SH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Dept Architecture & Architectural Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",josephahn@postech.ac.kr; mspark@snu.ac.kr; hyunslee@snu.ac.kr; ahnsj@gnu.ac.kr; oldclock@snu.ac.kr; woihj@snu.ac.kr; bsson@nsu.ac.kr,"Ahn, Joseph/E-8896-2018","Ahn, Joseph/0000-0003-3596-358X","Innovative Construction Cost Engineering Research Center - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Republic of Korea [R DO6CIT-A03]; Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering; Institute of Engineering Research at Seoul National University","This research was supported by a grant (R & DO6CIT-A03) from the Innovative Construction Cost Engineering Research Center funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Republic of Korea.

The model provides new capabilities that enable planners to identify an optimal/near-optimal schedule that minimizes project total cost and number of times crew work is interrupted. It is capable of identifying the optimal/near-optimal order of executing repetitive units to achieve further reduction in project time and cost. The model was developed in three main phases: (1) identifying input data such as quantities and crew productivity rates; (2) optimizing the construction schedule of repetitive units by identifying decision variables, formulating objective functions, and constraints, and executing model computations; and (3) visualizing the generated optimal/near-optimal schedule, crew interruption, project duration and cost, and order of executing repetitive units. Two case studies of 105 and 6 repetitive units were analyzed to evaluate the model performance. The model resulted in 0.13% and 4.2% additional reduction in project total cost and indirect cost, respectively, for the optimal order of repetitive units compared with the best model in the literature.

It is based on 57 samples of road, rail, bridge, and tunnel projects over the period of 1985-2015 and pursues the following two objectives: (1)it measures the characteristics of cost overruns in Hong Kong megatransport infrastructure projects using case data and statistical analysis method; and (2)it examines three independent explanatory variables (i.e.,project type, size of the project, and length of the project implementation period) and their statistical relationship with cost overruns to determine whether there exist differences between Hong Kong infrastructure projects and the worldwide findings. The results indicate that, in Hong Kong, projects on average have a cost escalation of 39.18% and the average cost overrun is 34.83% for rail, 32.52% for road projects, and 37.48% for fixed-link (i.e.,bridges and tunnels) projects. The year of the decision to build has no effect on cost escalation. The major findings concerning the dependence of cost escalations are as follows. In terms of project type, rail projects are most prone to cost increase, followed by fixed-links, whereas road projects are the least vulnerable to cost escalations. Cost overruns have no significant relationship with project size, but for road projects, smaller scale projects tend to be more prone to larger cost overruns. The cost overruns strongly depend on the length of the implementation phase; cost escalations increase 1.35% with each additional year of preconstruction period. This indicates that the preconstruction phase length can be viewed as a better indicator of cost escalations compared to the construction length. This can be an essential contribution to the existing literature on cost overruns as the stage in which the infrastructures are most prone to cost escalations is considerably narrowed down. The practical implications of this study are that decision makers should focus on this period and pay more attention to delays and longer preconstruction phases if they want to determine the causes and solutions of cost overruns.

In this study, we leverage advances in biometric sensing to measure psychophysiological responses to a variety of urban forms using highly controlled virtual, rather than costly and difficult to control, real-life settings. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that certain urban form characteristics impact human psychophysiology. To do so, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) in 35 participants exploring virtual environments that varied in building height and the presence of greenery (e.g., trees). Based on EEG metrics that are sensitive to stress, we found that urban environments with greenery and lower height buildings were associated with less stress. Overall, our results suggest that biometric measures of brain states, combined with virtual environments, can be utilized to assess the effects of urban elements on people's psychological well-being and guide the redevelopment and planning of urban environments.","[Zou, Zhengbo; Ergan, Semiha] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Fisher-Gewirtzman, Dafna] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Curtis, Clayton] NYU, Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Zou, ZB (corresponding author), NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",zz1658@nyu.edu; semiha@nyu.edu; ardafna@ar.technion.ac.il; clayton.curtis@nyu.edu,,,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [D15AP00098]; New York University Center for Urban Science and Progress,"This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Grant No. D15AP00098.

To improve safety management on sites, valid fatigue management measures for workers are urgently required. Specifically, there are construction activities requiring both physical and cognitive effort. As a critical premise for putting forward feasible fatigue management measures, correlations between physical and mental fatigue on work performance should be identified. This research explored the effects of physical fatigue on the induction of mental fatigue of construction workers, by adopting a pilot experimental method. Manual handling tasks of different intensities were firstly designed for stimulating certain expected physical fatigue statuses. A cognition-required risk identification task was then arranged for inducing mental fatigue, during which a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor was utilized for fatigue detection and measurement. Through a comprehensive data analysis method based on EEG rhythms, it was found that the high physical fatigue can significantly accelerate the induction of mental fatigue. Considering the resource allotment, more vigilant and attentional resources were required during the intensive manual handling tasks for the highly controlled limbs and the mind to steps. Thus, additional resources were invested to maintain the same level of cognitive performance in the risk identification tasks, which led to the increased mental fatigue. In practice, the heavy physical task can be regarded as one of the factors affecting the development of mental fatigue status, and therefore impairing cognitive functioning and other mental performances of the brain. The pilot study results provided a reference for fatigue management of construction workers to promote comprehensive safety management on construction sites.","[Xing, Xuejiao; Zhong, Botao; Luo, Hanbin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Dept Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xuejiao; Zhong, Botao; Luo, Hanbin] Hubei Engn Res Ctr Virtual Safe & Automated Const, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xuejiao; Li, Jue] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rose, Timothy] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Li, Jue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Dept Syst Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour] Aston Univ Birmingham, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn & Phys Sci, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England","Zhong, BT (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Mech, Dept Construct Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xing021493@163.com; dadizhong@hust.edu.cn; luohbcem@hust.edu.cn; tm.rose@qut.edu.au; lijue@hust.edu.cn; m.antwiafari@aston.ac.uk,,"Antwi-Afari, Maxwell Fordjour/0000-0002-6812-7839","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71732001, 51878311]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71732001, No. 51878311).",,71,4,4,19,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

Traditionally, state highway agencies (SHAs) have focused on maximizing the condition of a pavement network or minimizing agency costs needed to keep the network at an acceptable physical and functional level of service. However, other objectives like minimizing the road user costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are seldom factored into the M&R decision-making process. In this paper, a mixed integer program that accounts for these three objectives is presented. The proposed model is then implemented on a subset network in Texas consisting of 100 pavement sections. The results demonstrate the Pareto-optimal relationships that exist between the road condition improvements, road user costs, and GHG emissions. Notably, there is a positive relationship between condition score improvements and the observed marginal GHG emissions from the case network implementation. Furthermore, this network's results indicate that GHG emissions from materials and construction contribute to the most significant proportion of the total estimated GHG emissions. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the observed trends in the network case examined and provide valuable insights concerning the impact of variability in the budget size. The principal contribution of this study is in providing an approach for highway decision-makers to perform trade-offs in road condition improvements, road user costs, and GHG emissions of alternate pavement M&R programs or policies.","[France-Mensah, Jojo; O'Brien, William J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St,ECJ 5-412, Austin, TX 78712 USA","France-Mensah, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St,ECJ 5-412, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",francemens@utexas.edu; wjob@mail.utexas.edu,,,,,,49,19,19,6,48,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Furthermore, there is a need to explain CSFs from the short- and long-term planning horizons. This study aims to identify, rank, and examine the interdependence of the critical factors affecting construction projects in low-income economies. The study applied the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to validate subfactors identified from the literature. The hierarchical relationship between success factors and linguistic preferences is considered by using a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) methodology. The former is applied to rank the relative weights of the factors and subfactors, and the latter is used to discover the nature of their interrelationship. The results indicate that over the short term, the relationships with the clients, consultants, designers, top management, and the financial situation of the contractor are essential. However, for strategic management and long-term success, the most influential factors are the external environment and the types of projects undertaken. Therefore, the economic climate, technical and professional capabilities, and costs, funds, and resources should be the primary concerns when establishing the project goals. Furthermore, this study provides managerial and theoretical implications to guide construction projects from both short- and long-term perspectives.

The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) has seen a rapid decline in roadway serviceability within the Haynesville Shale area, presumably due to shale-gas-related traffic. The objective of this case study was to estimate roadway damage costs resulting from shale gas-related overweight trucks in Louisiana. In this study, the permit data for shale-gas-related overweight truck trips from 2006 to 2016 were extracted from DOTD's oversize/overweight database using R language. The extracted overweight truck trips were subsequently assigned to the roadway network based on the shortest path method using ArcGIS. In total, it was found out that there were approximately 9.7 million shale-gas-related overweight vehicle miles traveled on Louisiana roadways between 2008 and 2016. This can be translated into a roadway damage cost of $17 million because of the shortening of roadway serviceable lives. On average, the estimated damage cost due to a single shale gas well was approximately $5,242. The damage costs per overweight mile and per equivalent single axis load were $1.74 and $0.27, respectively. However, it was estimated that only $14.5 million was recovered through permit fees. Therefore, it may be concluded that the current permit fee schedule for overweight truck trips in Louisiana cannot fully recover the damage costs resulting from overweight truck trips related to shale gas development. In general, this case study quantified the damage costs of one specific traffic type (i.e., shale-gas-related overweight truck traffic) on the roadway network using a combination of R Language, ArcGIS version 10.41, and pavement damage estimation analysis. The adopted method can also be applied to quantify the impact of other traffic types (e.g., that related to seasonal agricultural activities) on roadways or bridges.

Real data from 183 CM school buildings in Iran were collected to establish the RNCC and its determinant variables, among which two were unprecedented in the literature: (1)mortar quality, and (2)the concrete quality of confinement elements. Parametric models were developed using the stepwise regression technique, and the leave-one-out cross-validation technique was utilized to examine the predictive performance of these models. Four variables were selected that collectively best predicted the RNCC variation: (1)total floor area, (2)seismic weight indicator, (3)floor and roof diaphragm type, and (4)mortar quality. On the basis of this selection, similarities and discrepancies between the RNCC prediction of framed and CM structures were described, with dissimilarities being postulated to arise from different seismic evaluation and strengthening approaches practiced for these structures. Finally, the importance of the total floor area for the RNCC prediction of CM buildings was highlighted, with the double-log cost-area model being recommended for making this prediction at an early design stage of seismic retrofitting.","[Jafarzadeh, R.; Ingham, J.

This paper presents a Bayesian project cost forecasting model that adaptively integrates preproject cost risk assessment and actual performance data into a range of possible project costs at a chosen confidence level. The second moment Bayesian (SMB) model brings more realism into project cost forecasting by explicitly accounting for inherent variability of cost performance, correlation between aggregated past and future performance, and the fraction of project completed at the time of forecasting. Functionally, the SMB model fully encompasses, as restrictive cases, two most commonly used index-based cost forecasting techniques in earned value management. The SMB model provides computationally efficient algebraic formulas to conduct robust probabilistic forecasting without additional burden of data collection or sophisticated statistical analysis. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the predictive efficacy and practical applicability of the SMB in real project environments.","Ohio Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Athens, OH 45701 USA","Kim, BC (corresponding author), Ohio Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",kimb@ohio.edu,,,,,,26,12,13,2,49,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

However, early cost prediction is often inaccurate because public officials are not familiar with cost engineering practices, and moreover, have limited time and insufficient information for estimating the possible range of the cost distribution. This study develops a conceptual cost prediction model by combining rough set theory, case-based reasoning, and genetic algorithms to better predict costs in the conceptual planning phase. Rough set theory and qualitative in-depth interviews are integrated to select the proper input attributes for the cost prediction model. Case-based reasoning is then applied to predict road construction costs by considering users' difficulties in the conceptual policy planning phase. A genetic algorithm is also used to assist the rough set model and case-based reasoning model to obtain optimal solutions. The result of the analysis shows that the proposed conceptual cost prediction model is reliable and robust compared to the existing cost prediction model.","[Choi, Seokjin; Han, Seung H.] Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Du Y.] Kyungil Univ, Sch Construct Engn, Gyeongbuk 712701, South Korea; [Kwak, Young Hoon] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Dept Decis Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Han, SH (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",sjchoi@yonsei.ac.kr; duyonkim@kiu.ac.kr; shh6018@yonsei.ac.kr; kwak@gwu.edu,"Han, Seung Heon/G-8862-2012; kwak, Young Hoon/A-9002-2009; HAN, SEUNGHEON/G-8641-2015","kwak, Young Hoon/0000-0003-3042-4130; ","High-tech Urban Development Program (HUDP) [11High-techUrbanG05]; Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs of the Korean governmentMinistry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, Republic of Korea","This research was supported by a grant (11High-techUrbanG05) from the High-tech Urban Development Program (HUDP) funded by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs of the Korean government.",,57,15,15,2,27,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

An important property that affects situation awareness is the limited capacity of the attentional system. To maintain situation awareness while exposed to tripping hazards, a worker needs to obtain feedforward information about hazards, detect immediate tripping hazards, and visually scan surroundings for any potential environmental hazards. Despite the importance of situation awareness, its relationship with attention remains unknown in the construction industry. To fill this theoretical knowledge gap, this study examines differences in attentional allocation between workers with low and high situation awareness levels while exposed to tripping hazards in a real construction site. Participants were exposed to tripping hazards on a real jobsite while walking along a path in the presence of other workers. Situation awareness was measured using the situation awareness rating technique, and subjects' eye movements were tracked as direct measures of attention via a wearable mobile eye tracker. Investigating the attentional distribution of subjects by examining fixation-count heat maps and scan paths revealed that as workers with higher situation awareness walked, they periodically looked down and scanned ahead to remain fully aware of the environment and its associated hazards. Furthermore, this study quantitatively compared the differences between the eye-tracking metrics of worker with different situation awareness levels (low versus high) using permutation simulation. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that subjects did not allocate their attention equally to all hazardous areas of interest, and these differences in attentional distribution were modulated by the workers' level of situation awareness. This study advances theory by presenting one of the first attempts to use mobile eye-tracking technology to examine the role of cognitive processes (i.e.,attention) in human error (i.e.,failure to identify a hazard) and occupational accidents.","[Hasanzadeh, Sogand] Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 121 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, Nguyen Engn Bldg,Suite 1405, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Dodd, Michael D.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Psychol, B82 East Stadium, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Hasanzadeh, S (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 121 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",Sogandm@vt.edu; besmaeil@gmu.edu; mdodd2@unl.edu,,"Hasanzadeh, Sogand/0000-0001-6214-3443; Esmaeili, Behzad/0000-0003-3858-1843",University of Nebraska-Lincoln through a Research Council Faculty Seed Grant,"The research team thanks the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for supporting the research reported in this paper through a Research Council Faculty Seed Grant.

This study draws from 2,572 project datapoints, addressing this research gap by plotting, analyzing, and validating high confidence performance indicators. The effects of different ACMs on project time, cost, and change performance were all evaluated and time-cost performance prediction models developed and tested. The results reveal that the use of incentives/ disincentives is preferable for reducing the duration of a project. Lump-sum contracting is an effective choice for onbudget project delivery, while cost-plus-time bidding is significantly less effective than incentives/disincentives and no-excuse bonus contracting. Notably, the results also convey that ACMs with large project sizes are more prone to schedule delays and cost overruns. The robustness of the predictive models was verified by a predicted error sum of squares validation. The findings of this study will help state transportation agencies make betterinformed decisions by providing foresight regarding the pros and cons of ACMs for aspects of project time-cost-change performance. The use of the predictive models will also assist agencies in justifying the probable time-cost impact of project change orders, enabling them to conduct more reliable risk assessments and develop more realistic contingency plans in the project scoping phase.

The attraction of flexible strategies, incorporating upgrade options that can be exercised when and if required, has been recognized for a long time. The techniques of real options allowed the benefits of flexible strategies to be quantified for the first time. A new and simplified methodology for real options analysis has been developed and implemented in software. It performs evaluation in both cost and environmental impact terms. A case study of a real highway in Spain was evaluated using the new methodology and software. Seven alternative strategies for the roadway (subgrade, base course, and surface course) were evaluated, six with upgrade options that are exercised if the traffic demand crosses specified thresholds. The rate of traffic growth, and also the discount rate for financial evaluation, were treated as uncertain variables. The highway was designed when the Spanish economy was growing strongly and a high roadway specification performed best. Before the highway was built the economy crashed and construction was canceled. Recalculation for the posteconomic shock conditions with lower traffic growth and a higher interest rate favored a lower highway specification with upgrade options. Sensitivity analysis shows how the specification choice varies with the values taken by the uncertain variables. A novel specification was proposed to maximize flexibility when there is high uncertainty about traffic growth, and evaluation showed that it performed better in many conditions. The methodology of evaluating flexible strategies could be used in many applications, including infrastructure for climate change adaptation.","[Fawcett, William] Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England; [Robles Urquijo, Ignacio] APIA XXI, Dept R&D & Transport Econ, Santander 39011, Spain; [Krieg, Hannes] Univ Stuttgart, Dept Life Cycle Engn, Dept Bldg Phys, D-70563 Stuttgart, Germany; [Hughes, Martin] Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England; [Mikalsen, Lars] Holte AS, N-0212 Oslo, Norway; [Ramos Gutierrez, Oscar Ramon] Univ Cantabria, Dept Struct & Mech Engn, Santander 39011, Spain; [Ramos Gutierrez, Oscar Ramon] APIA XXI, Santander, Spain","Fawcett, W (corresponding author), Cambridge Architectural Res Ltd, 25 Gwydir St 6, Cambridge CB1 2LG, England.",william.fawcett@carltd.com,,,European CommunityEuropean Commission [229061],"The case study was carried out as part of the collaborative CILECCTA project funded by the European Community's Program FP7/2007-2013 for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities, under EC Grant Agreement no. 229061.

Due to the fact that the resources used in projects in modern enterprises mainly belong to renewable resources, e.g. manpower resources, the general DTCTP is extended to a new multi-mode resource-constrained DTCTP model (MRC-DTCTP). The multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) was referred and the renewable resource constraints were added to the general DTCTP. By predefining the resource price, the renewable resources are related to the project costs, including direct cost and indirect cost. Every activity can be executed in the crashing way in which the project direct costs are used to shorten the activity duration. According to the characteristics of the MRC-DTCTP, an improved genetic algorithm for solving it was developed and its effectiveness was verified by compared with the exact algorithm. Finally an entire time-cost tradeoff curve for a project network was drawn through computing project deadline problem, and the advantages of the MRC-DTCTP were investigated based on computation results.

In this paper, we propose a novel automated construction of the Variable Density Network (VDN) for determining egress paths in dangerous environments. VND is used for deriving a navigable network in an indoor building environment, including a full 3D topological model. The accuracy of the proposed paths prediction tool was compared with key methods for navigable network generation, using the actual floor plan of Doha World Trade Centre.

This paper presents the results of a systematic review of 4491 publications spanning from 1998 through 2019. The review presents the viability of 3D-printed construction as a replacement for conventional construction methods, specifically in remote, isolated, or expeditionary environments, where conventional construction capability may be limited. The paper includes an analysis and characterization of the existing body of 3D-printed construction literature before evaluating seven viability factors of the method: materials, structural design, process efficiency, logistics, labor, environmental impact, and cost. In addition, the paper highlights three case studies of 3D-printed construction in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments. The paper concludes by suggesting areas of future research to ensure the viability of this technology, such as printing full-scale structures and components with locally sourced materials in uncontrolled environments, defining standards for 3D printing, automating additional construction processes, and performing both environmental impact and cost life-cycle analyses. With continued investment in research and development, 3D printing could become a more viable and accepted method of construction, transforming the way the industry is managed in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments.","[Schuldt, Steven J.; Jagoda, Jenee A.; Hoisington, Andrew J.; Delorit, Justin D.] US Air Force, Dept Syst Engn & Management, Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Hoisington, Andrew J.] Rocky Mt Reg Vet Affairs Med Ctr RMRVAMC, Rocky Mt Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr MIREC, Vet Hlth Adm, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Hoisington, Andrew J.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychiat & Neurol, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA","Schuldt, SJ (corresponding author), US Air Force, Dept Syst Engn & Management, Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",steven.schuldt.1@us.af.mil,,,Air National Guard Civil Engineering Technical Services Center [AFIT2019137ANG]; Air Force Civil Engineer Center [AFIT2019157],This work was supported by the Air National Guard Civil Engineering Technical Services Center [grant number AFIT2019137ANG] and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center [grant number AFIT2019157] .,,171,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

However, hierarchy persists. Both serve their own purpose, but entail different sets of values. This is particularly true in relation to the contribution of project management to organisational performance. The competing values framework has been used to highlight different sets of values and preferences underlying the evaluation of PMO performance and emphasizes the competing aspect. The research adopted a participatory action research approach in a university hospital where a major organisational transformation is taking place. Findings reveal the existence of paradoxes between the executives and the PMO regarding the PMO performance and show how these paradoxes evolved over time.

In an unpredictable environment, the factors influencing decision-making fluctuate constantly over time, and the effect of volatility on supply chain parameters such as cost, revenue, and working capital must be evaluated periodically. This paper seeks to develop a set of mathematical program ming models for exploring the impact of price fluctuation of raw materials on the cost of goods sold (COGS) of end products relative to targets in manufacturing companies. The mathematical programming problems proposed in this paper rationally minimize the COGS of end products while satisfying a set of constraints regarding forecasting and physical conditions. The optimal solutions of the proposed models provide guidelines on the optimal price at which to purchase all raw materials, leading to the minimum the overall COGS value for the enterprise. We also introduce a special type of sensitivity analysis, in which we explore the conditions where the optimal purchasing price of a raw material used to manufacture an end product changes within its feasibility range, and the relative effect on how much the minimum COGS of end products fluctuates. Finally, an empirical example presented in this paper illustrates the practicality and usefulness of the proposed approach in practice.","[Moheb-Alizadeh, Hadi] North Carolina State Univ, Grad Program Operat Res, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Handfield, Robert] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Business Management, Poole Coll Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Handfield, R (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Business Management, Poole Coll Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",hmoheba@ncsu.edu; robert_handfield@ncsu.edu,"Handfield, Robert B/D-3200-2015","Handfield, Robert B/0000-0003-3895-1955",,,,28,2,2,0,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The study also includes experimental testing of five concrete mixes with different types of cement in order to validate the models using safety factors. The tests included compressive strength, accelerated carbonation and air permeability. Both models are defined in a European standard as being alternative to each other, meaning that their results for the same concrete composition and the same environment should converge. The results show that both current models can scarcely constitute alternative to each other. Design lifetime results are far from similar for each concrete mix and each exposure class. The different nature of each test - accelerated carbonation and air permeability - and their different characteristic such as the scattering of results and the unrelated parameters of the modelling equations are some of the features discussed, including the possibility of using different safety factors as function of the model and definition of possible correlation between tests.","[Faustino, Pedro] Mouchel Scotland Transerv, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Goncalves, Fabio] Amey Consulting Rail & Strateg Highways, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Bras, Ana] Univ Bath, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Bath, Avon, England; [Nunes, Angela] DCDAC SECIL, SA 2900-182, Setubal, Portugal","Faustino, P (corresponding author), Mouchel Scotland Transerv, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",faustino3@gmail.com,,,,,,33,2,2,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of leadership style and communication practices of Australian construction supervisors on workgroup health and safety (H&S) climate and behaviour. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was administered to members of 20 workgroups engaged in rail construction work on the Level Crossing Removal Project and the Melbourne Metro Tunnel Project in Victoria, Australia. The survey measured components of supervisors' transformational and transactional leadership, communication practices, the group H&S climate and workers' self-reported H&S compliance and participation. Findings Supervisors' transformational and transactional leadership, as well as communication practices, were all positively and significantly correlated with group H&S climate and workers' self-reported H&S behaviours. The transformational leadership component of providing an appropriate model was the strongest predictor of H&S participation, while H&S compliance was predicted by the transactional leadership component of providing contingent reward, as well as supervisors' communication practices. H&S climate fully mediated the relationship between supervisory leadership and workers' self-reported H&S behaviour. Originality/value The research demonstrates that both transformational and transactional supervisory leadership are important in the construction context. Effective communication between supervisors and workers is also important for H&S. The findings suggest that supervisory leadership development programmes may be an effective way to improve H&S performance in predominantly subcontracted construction workgroups.","[Lingard, Helen; Zhang, Rita Peihua; Oswald, David] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Lingard, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",helen.lingard@rmit.edu.au,,"Lingard, Helen/0000-0003-3645-8390; Zhang, Rita Peihua/0000-0001-9907-6491; Oswald, David/0000-0002-3013-5681","Major Transport Infrastructure Program, Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, Victorian State Government","This research was funded by the Major Transport Infrastructure Program, Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, Victorian State Government.",,62,11,11,9,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

Based on 47 'vignettes' of uncertainty across projects in two safety critical sectors, this study provides an empirical examination of whether practices consistent with theories of high reliability organising are adopted by project managers as a response to project uncertainty. Our findings are that confronting uncertainties in safety critical projects do involve many high reliability practices. Respondents expressed a sense of balancing competing demands, and provided evidence of learning, acting mindfully, avoiding over-rigid processes, and of upholding constructive tensions, conceptual slack and close interdisciplinary working. However these practices are often fragile in nature and dependent on key individuals. There are also differences between the two sectors studied, with more widespread evidence of high reliability project organising in civil nuclear than in aerospace projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and errorprone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) realtime detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards. The results indicate that the proposed approach can assist in the construction site monitoring process and potentially improve site safety.

The main objective of this research is to assess the impact of climate change, particularly freezing and thawing cycles, on PA. Climate models predict changes in air temperature, not pavement temperature. To predict the climate change impact on pavements performance, this requires first establishing a relationship between air and road temperature and a correlation between pavement performance and FT cycles. This project focuses on the Netherlands, where PA pavement use has become mandatory, and recent severe winters have increased the discussion about the cold weather performance of porous asphalt and the potential challenges of changing winter weather patterns. When considering long-term changes in climate, the cost impacts of freeze-thaw on PA pavement are predicted to vary regionally and in most areas reach a point in the middle of the century when a reactive wait-and-see approach is more advantageous than proactive adaptation. Further research is suggested to refine the relationship between observed damage and freeze-thaw impacts on PA pavement.","[Kwiatkowski, Kyle P.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 33 Acad Way, Durham, NH 03820 USA; [Oslakovic, Irina Stipanovic; Hartmann, Andreas] Univ Twente, Dept Civil Engn, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [ter Maat, Herbert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Environm Res, Land Atmosphere Interact, POB 473, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Chinowsky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Regent Adm Ctr 37 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dewulf, G.

In the first step, a RGB-D sensor is used to capture three-dimensional (3D) point clouds of building environments. Then, by extracting planes and performing geometric analysis, the dimensional information of objects of interest is obtained from a single frame. The designed user-guidance system evaluates the completeness of the acquired data, and then provides interactive guidance for moving the sensor to acquire complete data, from which stable and accurate geometric measurements can be obtained. The proposed method has been tested on hallways, door frames, and stairs in a building environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the method offers significant promise in enabling dimensional analysis in a wide variety of real-time measurement contexts.

Previous research articles on the performance of these delivery methods include projects of different characteristics and projects from different sectors. This study examined solely US highway projects through a unique analysis of comparable projects. This study compared the project delivery methods that are frequently used in two separate cost pools, $2 million to $10 million and $10 million to $50 million. In the cost pool of $2 million to $10 million, the delivery methods of DBB and low-bid-procured DB (DB/LB) were compared. The delivery methods of DBB, CM/GC, and best-value-procured DB (DB/BV) were compared in the cost pool of $10 million to $50 million. The results show that the alternative contracting methods of CM/GC and DB are superior to the traditional DBB method for the performance metrics of project duration, project intensity, and timing of cost certainty in both cost pools. In comparing the alternative contracting methods in the $10 million to $50 million cost range, the CM/GC method was found to outperform DB/BV, which has not yet been shown in the research literature. With pressure on state transportation agencies to be efficient with funds, the alternative contracting methods are viable options for shortening project durations, establishing early cost certainty during project delivery, and delivering projects at a more intense pace. The findings presented are useful for practitioners to better understand how project delivery methods can meet their needs for US highway construction.

The proposed framework incorporates the Gaussian copula into MCS to treat statistical dependence between uncertain variables, with no restriction on the estimation process and distribution type. This paper elucidates the definition of stochastic dominance relations, based on which a decision rule is established to prescreen dominated solutions so as to alleviate computational burden. A practical project has been used to validate the proposed framework by comparisons with enumeration and NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm).

The study offers a conceptualization of the construction processes designed for the monolithic construction computer-aided system (MoCCAS) that enables a flexible approach to managing repetitive projects within a dynamically changing construction environment. The discussion deals with the art of modeling the construction process and introduces a repetitive construction process formulated as (1) a dynamic construction process model in a temporal perspective (DCPM-TP), which is a construction process representation in a three coordinate system; and (2) a managing assumed goals (mag_811) module, designed to simulate process behavior and to create execution strategies. Both models are capable of handling variability during the construction process execution and address the complexity of the relations among the production system components, including resource mutual constraints. A case study is discussed which involves the execution of construction processes by means of a slip formwork system, which exhibits a large degree of repetition and, therefore, is a particularly useful example for illustrating the effectiveness of the modeling approach proposed. The original contribution of this research lies in (i) representing construction process by acknowledging the specificity deriving from the nature of repetitive projects and technological regime; (ii) developing flexible structures (DCPM-TP and mag_811) that enable the construction process complexity to be addressed; (iii) designing a representation of the construction process within the system-model-simulator nexus developed for MoCCAS. A significant outcome of the overall study is the development of a system capable of harnessing the cyclic nature of the repetitive processes and converting the repetitiveness into a vital asset in the construction management.

With the growth of heterogeneous devices and sensor technologies in intelligent buildings,,designers are often faced with more interoperation complexities among heterogeneous systems that are data-intensive in nature. Conversely, performing decision making on these systems with a variety of building data is not efficient in terms of adapting to a changing environment. Current interoperation solutions for intelligent buildings focus on dry-contact and static rule-based systems to solve interoperability in intelligent buildings. Although static rule-based systems are efficient, the bottleneck can be in the area of the scalability of heterogeneous systems that will affect the efficient performance of interoperations. Therefore, to ensure a timely decision-making mechanism among heterogeneous systems, the performance delay and interpretation capability of systems should be improved. This paper offers a framework that improves the communication responses and the ability of automated decision support among the heterogeneous systems with a rule-based repository for the management of intelligent buildings. The implementation of the framework was performed with several systems to show their adaptation to joint interoperation. It is also interwoven with Web services to offer unified integration among heterogeneous systems. Testing of the framework was performed in a local area network (LAN) setting and proved to be reliable in solving interoperation problems for intelligent buildings.

Research suggests that worker health and safety is an integral dimension of social sustainability. The present research contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing, quantifying, and classifying occupational health and safety (OHS) risk associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance of sustainable projects across the United States construction industry and compares it with OHS risk encountered on nonsustainable counterpart projects. The researchers conducted a credit-by-credit review of the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating system to evaluate the potential positive or negative impact of green design elements and construction practices associated with the implementation of LEED credits on the OHS of construction and maintenance workers. The researchers also quantified OHS risk associated with LEED credits on 41 green projects distributed across the United States. The results show that even though a large number of LEED credits are neutral toward OHS, sustainable construction represented by LEED projects is associated with an increase in base-level safety risk. Finally, a risk model was integrated into a risk plane analysis to classify safety risk associated with each of the LEED credits. The risk classification analyses indicate that two credits are associated with unacceptable risk to OHS across the United States construction industry. It is expected that the findings from this research will benefit safety professionals, academics, designers, and all construction stakeholders by providing evidence of how their chosen sustainable designs may impact OHS on building projects.

A psychological contract of safety (PCS) describes an individual's conceptualized belief that relates to mutual safety obligations, drawn from explicit or implicit promises of associated workers or its supervisor. This study investigates safety practices on construction sites through the lens of the widely applied and researched psychological contract theory emanating from a business paradigm. Design/methodology/approach The process of validating a PCS scale within the construction industry required the collection of data from a mega-construction project in Sydney, Australia. A quantitative methodology was used to collect data from 352 construction workers through a survey instrument designed to reveal their perception of procedures, policies and practices. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to ensure data reliability and data validity of the survey findings together with goodness of fit of PCS model. Findings The findings showed the presence of a PCS in a construction safety setting examined. A two-factor model underlying aspects, namely employer and employee obligations was recommended since the four-factor model, including relational and transactional components of both parties' safety obligations, could not be validated due to the discriminant validity associated with the particular constructs. Originality/value Conceptualizing the extant PC theory as a framework from which to leverage safety management initiatives brings a new approach to construction safety studies, revealing the influential role of supervisors in interpreting safety practices. The research aimed to identify safety obligations, which are influential in the development of PSC scale, further the research provides an explanation as to how a PCS may be contextualized in the construction industry.","[Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi; Jefferies, Marcus; Davis, Peter Rex] Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Pillay, Manikam] Univ Newcastle, Sch Hlth Sci, Callaghan, NSW, Australia","Jefferies, M (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.",MohammadTanvi.Newaz@uon.edu.au; Marcus.Jefferies@newcastle.edu.au; peter.davis@newcastle.edu.au; manikam.pillay@newcastle.edu.au,"; , Manikam/H-4981-2015","Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi/0000-0003-3037-1120; , Manikam/0000-0002-7010-277X",,,,112,2,2,6,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

In particular, fire safety codes and regulations are noted to be rigid and have significant influence on the design of building layout and structures. The introduction of a performance-based approach, in which buildings are designed to meet the performance requirements rather than strictly complying with the prescribed rules, recently provides the opportunity for building designers to generate unique and daring solutions. To examine the effect of introducing such performance approach in the regulatory system, a conceptual system dynamic model has been established, with reference to the Hong Kong building control system, to explore the behavior and changes of the system. The model is conceptualized around the technical and mental factors that impact on the decisions of building control officials and various issues. To build the system dynamics model, a causal diagram showing the interrelationships of the system components is first established It can assist the. identification of attributes that affect the implementation and the performance of building design control policy. On the basis of the causal diagram, a simulation model is formulated. Some issues that may affect the implementation of performance-based fire safety design can be examined and discussed.

This management approach privileges technical knowledge over knowledge based on workers' tacit and informal ways of knowing about H&S. The aim is to investigate the potential for participatory video to: (1) identify areas in which formal policies and procedures do not reflect H&S as practised by workers; (2) encourage creative thinking and elicit workers' ideas for H&S improvements; and (3) provide an effective mechanism for capturing and sharing tacit H&S knowledge in construction organizations. Interviews were conducted in two case study organizations (CSOs) in the Australian construction industry. The results suggest reflexive participatory video enabled workers and managers to view their work practices from a different perspective. Workers identified new hazards, reflected about the practical difficulties in performing work in accordance with documented procedures and reframed their work practices and developed safer ways of working. Workers described how the participatory video capturing the way they work enabled them to have more meaningful input into H&S decision-making than they had previously experienced. Workers also expressed a strong preference for receiving H&S information in a visual format and commented that video was better suited to communicating H&S know how' than written documents.

First, the authors evaluate the life-cycle carbon emission, cost, and labor requirements of a project, which embody important environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainable building maintenance. Second, the authors develop an optimization model to identify the optimal portfolio of materials that would minimize three sustainability objectives including carbon emission, cost, and labor deployment in their respective turns one at a time. By testing the model with seven scenarios in a case study, the authors demonstrate how this typical case project could significantly improve its sustainability objectives from environmental, economic, and social perspectives. This optimization methodology is generic. It can be readily applied to other new and nonresidential projects of varying scales and in circumstances with a different set of decision criteria.

However, the development of Chinese distributed PV systems has failed to meet expectations because of their irrational profit and cost allocations. In this study, the methodology for calculating the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for PV is thoroughly discussed to address this issue. A mixed-integer linear programming model is built to determine the optimal system operation strategy with a benefit analysis. An externality-corrected mathematical model based on Shapley value is established to allocate the cost of distributed PV systems in 15 Chinese cities between the government, utility grid and residents. Results show that (i) an inverse relationship exists between the LCOEs and solar radiation levels; (ii) the government and residents gain extra benefits from the utility grid through net metering policies, and the utility grid should be the highly subsidized participant; (iii) the percentage of cost assigned to the utility grid and government should increase with the expansion of battery bank to weaken the impact of demand response on increasing theoretical subsidies; and (iv) apart from the LCOE, the local residential electricity prices remarkably impact the subsidy calculation results.","[Luo, Xi; Liu, Yanfeng; Wang, Yaxing] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Bldg Serv Sci & Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaojun] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiaping] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710055, Peoples R China","Luo, X (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Bldg Serv Sci & Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",luoxi0513@gmail.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFD1100202]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M643807XB]; Education Department of Shaanxi [19JS041],"This study was sponsored by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFD1100202), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018M643807XB), and Education Department of Shaanxi (Grant No. 19JS041).",,33,1,1,0,6,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

However, most existing BBS methods fail to look into the impact of the interactions between workers and their supervisors. To overcome this limitation, the impact of supervisor behaviors on safety climate and workers' behavioral performance is examined in this study. A supervisor-focused BBS method is proposed accordingly, which takes group-level safety climate as a mediator to encourage the supervisor behaviors to improve the workers' behavioral performance of construction projects. A case study was carried out in a construction project in Hong Kong. The statistical analysis proved that the intervention with supervisor behaviors resulted in significant improvement in the safety climate, the workers' behavioral safety performance, and the sustainability of the BBS impacts. The results demonstrated that focusing on supervisor behaviors is a viable approach for ameliorating the effectiveness and sustainability of BBS in improving the safety performance in the construction industry.

In decreasing the numbers of safety incidents, society's perception of construction workers, who are the central part of the occupational health and safety issue, can be an important learning tool for these workers in terms of self-criticism. Therefore, society's perception of the responsibility of workers for occupational health and safety is presented by means of cartoons. For this objective, seven cartoons exhibited in the International Construction Accidents Cartoon Contest held in Turkey are examined through the General Theory of Verbal Humour, a semiotic analysis method. As the main finding, construction-based occupational health and safety perceptions of countries were found not to change significantly. Consequently, these results can have a function in guiding workers and worker unions to revise and manage the general perception of society about them. Moreover, such cartoons can be used as a lingua franca for occupational health and safety training in international construction projects where multinational migrant workers are employed.","[Ulubeyli, Serdar; Arslan, Volkan] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB 67100, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Kivrak, Serkan] Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Eskisehir, Turkey","Ulubeyli, S (corresponding author), Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB 67100, Zonguldak, Turkey.",serdar.ulubeyli@karaelmas.edu.tr,"Kivrak, Serkan/P-1495-2019; Arslan, Volkan/R-5136-2016","Arslan, Volkan/0000-0002-0368-5653; Ulubeyli, Serdar/0000-0003-0871-7391; KIVRAK, SERKAN/0000-0001-7660-6488",Bulent Ecevit UniversityBulent Ecevit University; Anadolu UniversityAnadolu University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge Anadolu University for its generous permission to reproduce the cartoons used in this study.

To predict the simulated cost contingency (SCC), a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is applied. However, the use of simulation in most cases is difficult, cumbersome and rarely used in the construction industry. The objective of the current research is to develop ANN and regression based (RB) models to predict the SCC for building projects due to the variability of steel reinforcement (SR) prices. For all the adopted scenarios in dealing with the independent variables, the results revealed that on the average, ANN models are more powerful than RB models in theoretical modeling of SCC when comparing its predicted value with its actual simulated value. On the contrary, RB models outperform ANN models from practical point of view when comparing predicted SCC with its real value. Thus, contractors are advised to adopt RB models in predicting SCC for the practicality in estimating cost contingency. However, the developed models are expected to be highly beneficial for contractors in making SCC calculations easier.","[El-Kholy, Amr M.] Beni Suef Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Bani Suwayf, Egypt; [Tahwia, Ahmed M.] Mansoura Univ, Struct Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Mansoura, Egypt; [Elsayed, Mai M.] Educ Bldg Author, Dakahlia Governorate, Mansoura, Egypt","El-Kholy, AM (corresponding author), Beni Suef Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Fac Engn, Bani Suwayf, Egypt.",amrelkholy_2012@yahoo.com,"El-Kholy, Amr Metwally/AAH-8365-2020","tahwia, ahmed/0000-0001-6954-0695; El-Kholy, Amr/0000-0002-1424-7085",,,,75,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1562-3599,2331-2327,,INT J CONSTR MANAG,Int.

It is also difficult to achieve due to a high worker-to-safety-officer ratio. There is an imminent need for the development of a tool to assist in the real-time monitoring of workers, in order to reduce the number of construction accidents. The development and application of a-real time locating system (RTLS) based on the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technique is described in this paper for tracking the real-time position of workers on construction sites. Experiments and tests were carried out both on- and off-site to verify the accuracy of static and dynamic targets by the system, indicating an average error of within 1 m. Experiments were also carried out to verify the ability of the system to identify workers' unsafe behaviours. Wireless data transfer was used to simplify the deployment of the system. The system was deployed in a public residential construction project and proved to be quick and simple to use. The cost of the developed system is also reported to be reasonable (around 1800USD) in this study and is much cheaper than the cost of other RTLS. In addition, the CCS technique is shown to provide an economical solution with reasonable accuracy compared with other positioning systems, such as ultra wideband. The study verifies the potential of the CCS technique to provide an effective and economical aid in the improvement of safety management in the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This risk is considerably increased during petrochemical plant construction because the project itself is complex in terms of process, equipment, and environment. In addition, a general construction safety barrier hardly isolates and controls site hazardous energy effectively. Thus, this study proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-based building information modeling (BIM) system, which can be regarded as a new smart barrier design method for hazardous energy in petrochemical construction. In this system, BIM is used to support the identification of on-site hazardous energy, whereas IoT is used to collect the location of on-site personnel in real time. A hazardous energy isolation rule is defined to enable the system to generate a smart barrier on the web terminal window, thereby ensuring the safety of on-site person. This system has been applied to a large-scale construction project in Sinopec for one year and accumulated substantial practical data, which supported the idea about the application of sensor and BIM technology in construction. The related effects of the system on hazardous energy management are also presented in this work.","[Ding, Lieyun; Jiang, Weiguang; Zhou, Cheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ding, Lieyun; Jiang, Weiguang; Zhou, Cheng] Hubei Engn Res Ctr Virtual Safe & Automated Const, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Zhou, C (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Zhou, C (corresponding author), Hubei Engn Res Ctr Virtual Safe & Automated Const, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",chengzhou@hust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71732001],This research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71732001).,,42,0,0,7,7,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

Challenges in multiple construction worker tracking include miss detection and mismatch due to occlusion and identity switches. To the best knowledge of the authors, the mismatch is not reported in the literature of con-struction for image based single camera multiple worker tracking. As a result, the mismatch should be taken into account through a representative performance index such as the Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA). This work aims to improve the performance of the current multiple worker tracking through an approach composed of three stages: detection, matching and re-matching. In the detection stage, the deep learning detector, Mask R CNN, is utilized. In the matching stage, we attempt to track workers between consecutive image frames through a gradient based method with feature based comparison. Several cost means and matching methods have been experimented for model selection. Trajectories of tracking objects are derived in this stage. The best cost measurements and matching methods are recommended. Trajectories of tracking objects could be interrupted because of miss detection or mismatch. We call those broken trajectories, without matched detections, orphans. In the re-matching stage, we attempt to recover unmatched detections in the current frame with previous orphans based on extracted features. A competitive MOTA of 56.7% was obtained from the proposed approach over MOTA of 55.9% from the state-of-the-art Detect-And-Track model on a human tracking benchmark dataset. On construction job sites, we have tested the approach with 4 testing videos, resulting in a total MOTA of 81.8%, average MOTA per video of 79.0% and standard deviation of 13.0%, while the maximum and minimum MOTAs are 96.0% and 69.0%, respectively. As a result, the proposed work could potentially provide better multiple worker tracking on the construction job site. Additionally, to have a better representation of the tracking errors, this work suggests to utilize the MOTA for multiple construction worker tracking.","[Angah, Ohay; Chen, Albert Y.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Chen, AY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",r01521306@ntu.edu.tw; albertchen@ntu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Albert/0000-0001-6702-9834","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST-103-2221-E-002-125-MY3, MOST-108-2221-E-002-016]; National Taiwan University (NTU)National Taiwan UniversityNanyang Technological University [NTU-107L892501, NTU-108L892501]","The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan for grants MOST-103-2221-E-002-125-MY3 and MOST-108-2221-E-002-016, and National Taiwan University (NTU) for grants NTU-107L892501 and NTU-108L892501 for the support that has made this work possible.

A body of knowledge has established significant links between the motivational behaviours of operatives towards health and safety. Motivation is also considered as a key tool for improving operative productivity as when operatives experience safe worksites, they can carry out their work in a more productive manner. The purpose of this research is to develop a framework to examine the motivational factors that affect operative health and safety in small construction firms. Design/methodology/approach A critical review and synthesis of the body of knowledge incorporating motivational theory, health and safety literature and the factors which characterise small firms, is used to develop the framework. Findings Key components of the framework include the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic components, appropriate health and safety policies and procedures, the type of work environment, the operatives (i.e. attitude, experience and training) as well as the presence of appropriate management and supervision. The study revealed that operatives in small firms are less likely to be extrinsically motivated due to the absence of training, management commitment, policies and the wider working environment Research limitations/implications Failure of motivational support can result in increased danger and risk in exposing operatives to injury in the small firm environment. In this context, the damage caused to operative's health and safety in small construction firms is dependent mainly on the extrinsic factors. Practical implications The framework provides a basis for improving our understanding of how to motivate operatives to act safely and will help to improve the health and safety performance of small firms. It is therefore vital to emphasise enhancement efforts on these extrinsic strategies in the small firms' environment especially in the initial stages of the project (or activity), so that the health and safety of operatives in small firms can be improved. Originality/value This study proposes a contribution in developing an understanding of the motivational factors and their influence on the health and safety of operatives in small construction firms. The study revealed that operatives in small firms are less likely to be extrinsically motivated and have only intrinsically motivated elements in their workplace. The study proposes an indirect link between the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect motivation.","[Khan, Sunan Babar; Proverbs, David G.; Xiao, Hong] Birmingham City Univ, Engn & Built Environm, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Khan, SB (corresponding author), Birmingham City Univ, Engn & Built Environm, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",sunan.khan@mail.bcu.ac.uk; david.proverbs@bcu.ac.uk; hong.xiao@bcu.ac.uk,,"Proverbs, David/0000-0002-3297-2205",,,,106,1,1,7,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

For instance, while the injuries resulting in days away from work were substantially decreased, construction fatalities rose in the previous years. While previous safety fatality research work concentrated on studying how different variables could influence the number of fatalities in the construction industry, there is a lack of research efforts that studied the associations, interdependencies, and critical combinations between the different fatality causes. As such, to solve the critical fatality problem that the construction industry is facing, more advanced management methods should be applied. That said, this paper aims to address this important knowledge gap through a methodology based on data-driven computational algorithms. The data analyzed in this paper is comprised of 100 OSHA national fatal accident case files that are prepared by OSHA compliance officers. First, a reference matrix of 100 case files was constructed based on 60 causes that have shown to be the most pertinent to construction fatalities based on a previous study. Second, the spectral clustering computational algorithm was used to cluster the fatality causes based on the strength of their interconnectivities. Third, the frequent pattern data mining and Apriori algorithms were used to determine the critical combinations and associations of causes that mostly contribute to fatal accidents on construction sites. The findings indicate that the 60 fatality causes could be categorized into five clusters. Thus, the most critical combination of fatality causes was determined within each one of the identified clusters. Also, the findings reflected that while safety accidents could happen due to factors or causes that are individually critical, fatalities on construction sites could also result due to a combination of factors that might not be perceived to be critical on the individual level but rather become critical when combined with other factors. This study adds to the body of knowledge by proposing a data-driven accident causation approach to analyze construction fatality accidents, which adds a different dimension to the traditional analysis of safety accidents by factoring possible associations and combinations between different causes. That said, this paper equips safety professionals with a proactive approach that allows them to take the needed preventive actions to avoid fatalities on construction sites by identifying, in hindsight, the critical combinations and associations of fatality causes. Ultimately, the outcomes of this paper would enhance the safety performance in the construction industry and prevent construction fatalities.

Existing methods for assessing such risks are cumbersome and are unable to accurately provide the certainty required to ensure safety levels. This paper presents a novel prediction method that utilizes the support vector machine (SVM) to determine the safety risks that can materialize during the construction of deep pit foundations in subway infrastructure projects. The development of the SVM risk prediction model involves the following steps: (1) identification of risk factors from industry experts; (2) processing the sampled data; and (3) training and testing. A case study is used to demonstrate the predictive capability of the developed SVM approach. By inputting data on a daily basis, the safety risks associated with deep foundation pits can be monitored; this enables decision-makers to formulate appropriate control measures.

Towards this objective, this research investigates the work practices of high-reliability crews-that is, crews who perform high-risk work with exceptionally high productivity and safety. The objective of the research is to increase understanding of the work practices that reduce the likelihood of accidents while at the same time increase productivity. This paper presents the findings of an initial exploratory study that compares the work practices of two residential framing crews: one crew with consistently exceptional levels of safety and productivity, and one average-performing crew from the same company. The two crews did not show any difference in safety practices-both crews had high compliance with the company's safety requirements. However, the production practices of the high-reliability crew were shaped by a clear guiding principle, which is a strong focus on avoiding errors and rework, and by specific strategies that support this principle. Such strategies include actions to prevent disruptions, controlling the production pressures, matching skills with task demands, and carefully preparing and coordinating the high demand tasks. These practices prevent production errors while also reducing the likelihood of accidents. The findings provide directions for further research.","[Mitropoulos, Panagiotis; Cupido, Gerardo] Arizona State Univ, Del E Webb Sch Construct, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Mitropoulos, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Del E Webb Sch Construct, POB 870204, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",takism@asu.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); CAREER Award [0645139],"The writers would like to thank all the management and field personnel of the participating company for taking the time to explain their work and their practices.

Using an A/B testing algorithm, probabilistic differences between operator-quality performance distributions are computed to quantitatively compare their quality performance. Both visualized and quantitative decision metrics are provided for practitioners to (1) infer operator welding-quality performance for a particular weld type; (2) identify operators with exceptional quality performance; and (3) quantitatively measure differences in quality performance between operators.

We interviewed people from companies of the three sizes of SME, micro, small and medium, from a range of industries and from four countries. SMEs use project management both to manage operations, to deliver tailored or bespoke products to customers, and manage innovation and growth. We found similar project management approaches used for both purposes. The main differences occurred by size of company and country. Both Ireland and Sweden looked for more laissez-faire management styles, while people in Austria and Romania were willing to accept more autocratic styles. People in Sweden wanted more structure than people in Ireland. Also laissez-faire styles of management were more appropriate in micro and small companies, whereas more democratic or autocratic styles were needed in medium-sized companies.

This paper reports on the results of a survey of more than 400 companies in the United States and Japan using QFD, The objective of the study was to understand the key factors that result in the successful application of QFD, The research questions investigated in this study were developed both inductively from QFD case studies in the United States and Japan and deductively from the literature. Regression analysis estimates the effects of organizational characteristics, data sources, and QFD tools and techniques on QFD improvements in the product and process. The results show that QFD is most likely to have a positive impact when there is management support for QFD and new customer data specifically collected for the QFD study are used. The benefits of QFD are independent of the tools and techniques used as part of the QFD study.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA","Cristiano, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA.",,,,,,,68,94,109,2,47,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394 USA",0018-9391,,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

This research developed an intelligent control system of asphalt pavement CQ. The rolling uniformity index (RUI) and rolling standard index (RSI) are proposed to control CQ. The applicability of the two indexes was evaluated by the analysis of the correlation between the indexes and compactness and smoothness from field measurements. In addition, an advanced method of rolling color-coded map (RCM) drawing was put forward to reduce the workload for the IC data processing. The results showed that the presented system successfully can control the CQ of asphalt pavement construction in real time, and the IC data processing capacity can be reduced obviously by the newly drawn RCM. Moreover, smoothness can be reflected better by the RUI, whereas the compactness was evaluated effectively by the RSI.

On the basis of the enlarged customer concept, QFD has the potential to be developed as a quantitative approach for buildability evaluation. This paper presents the findings of a research effort to adapt House of Quality (HOQ) to meet the needs of buildable designs in the construction industry and to develop a fuzzy QFD system for buildability evaluation. In this system, the fuzzy set theory is integrated into HOQ to capture the inherent impreciseness and vagueness of design-relevant inputs and facilitate the analysis of design-relevant QFD information. An example is presented to illustrate the system, which provides a viable decision-making method for quantitative buildability evaluation at the early design phase.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the organisational culture profiles of Indonesian construction companies, and to examine the influence of the companies' organisational culture profiles on their quality management systems (based on QMS-ISO 9001: 2008) implementation. Prior to conducting the examination, there are examinations of the relationships among the quality management system (QMS) variables. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed a survey questionnaire of construction industry practitioners who have experience in building and civil engineering works. The Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument was selected due to its suitability in assessing organisation's underlying culture. Findings - Within the examination among the QMS variables, it was found that problematic issues associated with the implementation of QMS-ISO 9001: 2008 in Indonesian construction companies can affect the implementation of the QMS and contribute to the lower level of companies' business performance. It was also found that there is no significant relationship between the QMS implementation and the companies' business performance. By using the Competing Values Framework diagram, it was found that most of the construction companies' organisational culture is characterised by a Clan type which is reflected in how employees are managed, how the organisation is held together, and how the organisation's success is defined; the leadership style is Hierarchy-focused, while the organisation's strategy is Market type. It was also found that different culture profiles have different influences on the QMS implementation. Originality/value - A strong mixed Hierarchy and Market culture needs to be developed within the construction companies in Indonesia, as the driver to support proper and successful implementation of their QMS in order to enhance business performance in a quality performance-oriented Indonesian construction industry.","[Willar, Debby] Manado State Polytech, Dept Civil Engn, Manado, Indonesia; [Trigunarsyah, Bambang] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Coffey, Vaughan] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Sci & Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","Willar, D (corresponding author), Manado State Polytech, Dept Civil Engn, Manado, Indonesia.",debby_willar@yahoo.com,"Trigunarsyah, Bambang/G-4177-2012","Trigunarsyah, Bambang/0000-0001-6799-4781; Coffey, Vaughan/0000-0003-0520-2982",DIKTI Scholarships on behalf of The Ministry of National Education of The Republic of Indonesia; National Construction Services Development Board; Construction Development Agency; Ministry of Public Works of The Republic of Indonesia,"This research is funded by DIKTI Scholarships on behalf of The Ministry of National Education of The Republic of Indonesia, and supported by The National Construction Services Development Board and The Construction Development Agency, The Ministry of Public Works of The Republic of Indonesia.",,53,20,21,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

A main challenge of using IC technologies for QC/QA is that the empirical relationships between IC data and in situ measurements are not clear, which prevents transportation agencies from developing an equivalent-criteria specification for the use of IC as a QC/QA tool. This paper describes the results from an experimental research study that was conducted for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) to assess the correlations between IC data and in situ measurements of compaction quality. Instead of a specifically prepared test site, all the data were collected from a section of U.S. Highway 31 that was under construction. Two types of IC data, compaction meter value (CMV) and machine drive power (MDP), were collected along with the corresponding positions of the rollers. In situ measurements were also conducted to independently assess soil compaction, including dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), falling weight deflectometer (FWD), and lightweight deflectometer (LWD). Averages of the IC measures were obtained from the local areas of the in situ measurements for correlation analysis. The correlation results provide insights for a state highway agency (SHA) to determine how it may rely on IC for QC/QA in soil compaction. Observed correlations confirm the promise of using IC results to substitute traditional in situ measurements in acceptance tests, which can reduce the requirements for inspection staff to perform in situ tests. The results also suggest that the identification of weak areas, rather than determining acceptance, is the most readily attainable application of IC for QC/QA with soils, particularly with respect to CMV.

However, PFWD testing method is not yet proven to be reliable enough for construction quality control. In this research, a laboratory testing unit box was prepared in which unbound materials were compacted at different compaction levels. The stiffness modulus of the compacted layers were then determined under PFWD Testing. The tests were repeated several days after construction when the materials moisture content was decreased to lower values. The results indicated that acceptable correlations exist between the stiffness modulus and both compaction percentage and moisture percentage. In addition, field testing was carried out on different unbound layers in several highway construction sites in Tehran and laboratory results were used in order to control in-situ conditions. With Comparing field and laboratory testing results, it was concluded that PFWD is an appropriate testing device for quality control and compaction monitoring of pavement layers during construction phases.","[Rafiei, Kamran; Kavussi, Amir; Yasrobi, Shahaboddin] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran","Rafiei, K (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB 14115-111, Tehran, Iran.",kamran_rafiee@yahoo.com,"Kavussi, Amir/AAY-3269-2021",,,,,14,11,11,0,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

This paper discusses an approach for automating the processing of construction specifications to support inspection and quality control tasks in construction projects. The reasoning approach leverages information available in different types of product and process models to identify specifications applicable to products existing in a project and to extract the requirements imposed by the specifications applicable to each product. The automated identification of applicable specifications and the automated extraction of requirements imposed by these specifications can support and enable automation of tasks, such as inspection and defect detection, which depend on information from construction specifications. Thus, the herein presented specification reasoning approach can be seen as a stepping stone towards automated defect detection on construction sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The study integrates digital graphic information of building information modeling (BIM) with engineering and production data. Based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data standard, semantic data related to the geometry, processes, resources, production costs, construction sites, and other design information relevant for prefabricated components are assigned to a component's graphic representation. Thus, the visible geometric representation and the background engineering information are integrated into a unified database. A collection of common structural components forms a library that can be reused in prefabricated design projects. The development of a component library and its application to a more efficient design process is demonstrated through a case study of an urban viaduct project.","[Bai, Shuo; Li, Mingchao] Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Song, Lingguang] Univ Houston, Dept Construct Management, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Kong, Rui] PowerChina Northwest Engn Co Ltd, 18 Zhangba East Rd, Xian 710065, Peoples R China","Li, MC (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.",BShuo0621@tju.edu.cn; lmc@tju.edu.cn; lsong5@central.uh.edu; kongrui@nwh.cn,,"Li, Mingchao/0000-0002-3010-0892",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51879185]; Tianjin Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of China [17JCJQJC44000],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51879185) and the Tianjin Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of China (Grant No. 17JCJQJC44000).,,48,1,1,3,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Lean construction emphasizes the concept of flow as a way to understand production in construction, yet there is still no accepted metric for measurement of flow quality. This has hampered research and practice. The proposed construction flow index (CFI) is a composite measure that reflects the quality of production flow in repetitive construction projects. It incorporates measures of work continuity for crews, processing continuity for locations, production rate variation, amounts of work in progress, interference and operation sequence logic. Expert knowledge was acquired to establish weights for the CFI parameters, and its use was tested in evaluating the planned and actual production flows for a number of projects. Project managers can use the CFI to evaluate the quality of their construction plans and to measure and communicate production flow quality status to trade crews, enabling management and improvement of production flow. The CFI is also a valuable tool for construction research. The CFI challenges traditional construction management by measuring flow, where standard practice only measures transformation (earned value). It challenges lean construction practice using the Last Planner System, suggesting that the percent plan complete measure of plan reliability is insufficient.","[Sacks, Rafael] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel; [Seppanen, Olli] Aalto Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Priven, Vitaliy] Tidhar Construct Ltd, Raanana, Israel; [Savosnick, Jonathan] DPR Construct, Sacramento, CA USA","Sacks, R (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel.",cvsacks@technion.ac.il,"Sacks, Rafael/B-1431-2008; Seppanen, Olli/G-1594-2015","Sacks, Rafael/0000-0001-9427-5053; Seppanen, Olli/0000-0002-2008-5924",,,,61,21,21,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-6193,1466-433X,,CONSTR MANAG ECON,Constr.

Therefore, practitioners and researchers are eager to learn which factors affect project portfolio success and how it can be increased. However, it takes some time for changes in management practices to reveal their potential. Thus, it is interesting to know how portfolio success can be predicted and what the possible indicators of this eventual success will look like. For this purpose, we propose the concept of management quality, which allows the anticipation of project portfolio success much earlier than the time at which established success criteria become measurable. We conceptualize and empirically validate management quality as a multidimensional construct consisting of information quality, allocation quality, and cooperation quality. We demonstrate the prognostic relevance of management quality to project portfolio success on a longitudinal sample of project portfolios with multiple informants over a time period of two years. Our results show a strong positive influence and thus support the notion of a causal link between management quality and portfolio success.","[Jonas, Daniel] Campana & Schott, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Kock, Alexander; Gemuenden, Hans Georg] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Technol & Innovat Management, D-10623 Berlin, Germany","Jonas, D (corresponding author), Campana & Schott, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",daniel.jonas@campana-schott.com; alexander.kock@tim.tu-berlin.de; hans.gemuenden@tim.tu-berlin.de,"Kock, Alexander/X-6768-2019","Kock, Alexander/0000-0003-2402-0340",,,,80,54,54,1,98,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

In the development of a comprehensive Swedish environmental rating method for buildings, a number of approaches for selecting environmental aspects in a method were tested. These include basing the selection on the severity and extent of problems, on official objectives, on mandatory rules, and on current practice. Once aspects, or rather building-related health problems, are selected, possible indicators for monitoring these problems can be tested with regard to theoretical and practical criteria in order to understand better the strengths and limitations of different indicators. The analyses in the paper are limited to indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and thus cover extensive reviews of current IEQ methods, Swedish objectives, and legislation as well as the severity and extent of IEQ problems. The results show that depending on the chosen approach, different numbers of aspects turn out to be significant. The approaches for prioritizing aspects suggested here can be used, preferably in combination. An aspect can be seen as motivated for inclusion in a method if many of the approaches suggest its significance.","Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, Dept Urban Studies, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden","Malmqvist, T (corresponding author), Royal Inst Technol, Div Environm Strategies Res, Dept Urban Studies, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Drottning Kristinas Vag 30, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",tove.malmqvist@infra.kth.se,,,Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy Agency,"This study was part of a project developing an environmental rating method for buildings (Glaumann et al., 2008).

This method builds upon an extension of an image-based technique for the treatment of building data to discuss objective criteria for model grid choice and related consequences. Starting from an estimation of aerodynamic parameters, and their validation by computational fluid dynamics using an existing simulation of downtown Oklahoma Cityin the US, the method is used to evaluate improvements in the performance of an operational dispersion model. Results are applied to flow over a neighbourhood for the determination of ventilation parameters. It is suggested that the grid used for calculation of morphometric parameters provides the best agreement with data from laboratory experiments when the selection of grid size is made upon the spatial profile of building height standard deviation and maximum building height. The implication is that when a mesoscale numerical model is employed, morphometric parameters should be calculated by positioning the computational grid based on physical boundaries, while for finer resolution (namely, smaller scale) numerical models, morphometric parameters should be calculated using the street grid as external boundary, and the maximum building height criterion performs well.","[Leo, Laura S.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Buccolieri, Riccardo] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Biol Ambiental, Lecce, Italy; [Di Sabatino, Silvana] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy","Leo, LS (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",lleo1@nd.edu,"Buccolieri, Riccardo/AAE-7030-2021; Leo, Laura Sandra/J-9529-2013","Buccolieri, Riccardo/0000-0002-0102-7235; Leo, Laura Sandra/0000-0003-4103-6862; DI SABATINO, SILVANA/0000-0003-2716-9247","European Community's H2020 Programme [H2020-SC5-04-2015, 689954]","The third author (SDS) kindly aknowledges the iSCAPE (Improving Smart Control of Air Pollution in Europe) project, which is funded by the European Community's H2020 Programme (H2020-SC5-04-2015) under the Grant Agreement No. 689954.",,49,8,8,2,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0961-3218,1466-4321,,BUILD RES INF,Build.

It is felt that management's insistence on punch-list inspection creates barriers to adopting the model that fosters a culture of constant improvement embraced by total quality management (TQM). With this recognition, this research paper presents a model that extends the output-oriented process model to pursue continuous improvement along the supply chain. Extensive field observations and discussions with contractors show that the ready-mixed concrete supply and placement suffers the loss of information when concrete is delivered in truckloads and sampled for quality testing in the laboratory. Without recording the spatial boundaries of a truck volume of poured concrete, a failing quality report leads to large costs for core-drilling to find the location of the unacceptable concrete poured 28days earlier. The latter part of the paper will present the work to design and field-experiment a feedforward control method that also served as a novel electronic as-built documenter. Ruggedized radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) as the concrete flowed from the truck into the hopper of the pump. A hand-held RFID reader not only detected 14 out of the 15 embedded tags, but the tags' readability served as an indicator of the concrete's curing progress. The unique contribution of this research project can be seen in the experimental work established by the feasible evidence measured from a real-world construction context. In order to overcome the ingrained view of reactive inspection in concrete supply chains, this research offers a proposed approach whereby its workability is evaluated through first-hand examination.

For the AHP, five criteria were adopted and a number of pair-wise comparisons were performed in two stages. Finally, the weighting coefficient to approve the outsourcing was calculated at 0.606, suggesting it more reasonable to permit rather than prohibit outsourcing. Outsourcing of testing/inspection is necessary to enhance the objectivity and expert skill, despite the reduction in the sense of responsibility among the testing technicians and inspectors. However, to initiate outsourcing, it is necessary to first separate the 'quality testing and inspection' activities from the 'quality control' activities at the job site. Furthermore, the project owner should preferably make the decision to outsource testing and inspection activities and select the testing agency. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

To successfully install MEP modules on-site, performing a geometric quality inspection in prefabrication factories is required to ensure all as-produced MEP elements have accurate positions and correct dimensions. However, the traditional manual inspection process is inaccurate and time. consuming. To address the problem, this study presents an automated geometric quality inspection technique to estimate the geometric properties of MEP modules using 3D laser scanning. The proposed technique firstly extracts the steel frame of the MEP module from the scanned data and registers the scanned data with the as-designed building information modeling (BIM) model of the module. Each MEP element in the module is then detected from the scanned data with the proposed shape fitting algorithm customized for different types of elements. Lastly, the checklist items for geometric quality inspection are computed based on the extracted as built MEP elements. Experiments on two prefabricated MEP modules were conducted, which demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.","[Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Qian] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Sch Design & Environm, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Park, Jae-Hyuk] SEN Engn Grp SG Pte Ltd, 10 Hoe Chiang Rd 10-08 Keppel Towers, Singapore 089315, Singapore","Wang, Q (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Sch Design & Environm, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",bdgwang@nus.edu.sg,"Guo, Jingjing/AAG-8586-2020; Wang, Qian/N-8410-2017","Guo, Jingjing/0000-0003-2047-6703; Wang, Qian/0000-0003-3175-334X",,,,68,10,10,11,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

In the highway sector, all project quality roles and responsibilities have historically been assigned to the state highway agency (SHA), an accepted and well-understood industry practice. However, increasing use of alternative project delivery methods and reductions in SHA staffing are having an impact on traditional QAO practices. SHAs are increasingly selecting alternative QAOs, but they are making these selections in an ad hoc manner because of limited staff knowledge and experience, and a lack of guidance from the research community. Highway design and construction quality research focuses almost exclusively on inspections, observations, corporate quality, warranties, and materials testing, resulting in a gap in the research about shifts in project quality roles and responsibilities. This research extends the civil engineering quality management body of knowledge by identifying factors that influence the selection of QAOs and rating the appropriateness of the QAOs for each selection factor. Because of the complexity of the topic, scope of the decision process, and the limited project data available, structured interviews and the Delphi method were chosen to explore the selection factors. The research discovered 10 factors: project size, project complexity, project delivery method, project schedule sensitivity, availability of agency project staff, agency project staff experience, agency culture, industry ability to manage their own quality, trust between agency and industry, and amount of quality risk to shift away from the agency. The research provides the highway industry with new understanding of the effects that each selection factor has on the fundamental QAOs. This fundamental knowledge will allow SHAs to make more informed QAO selections.

These agencies use data on asset conditions to make decisions regarding the timing of maintenance activities, the type of treatment, and the resources to employ. To collect and record these data, agencies often utilize trained evaluators who assess the asset either on site or by analyzing photos and/or videos. These visual assessments are widely used to evaluate conditions of various assets, including pavement surface distresses. This paper describes a Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) to measure and improve the performance of multiple evaluators of pavement distresses by controlling for subjective judgment by the individual evaluators. The DQAIF is based on a continuous quality improvement cyclic process that is based on the following main components: (1)assessment of the consistency over timeperformed using linear regression analysis; (2)assessment of the agreement between evaluatorsperformed using inter-rater agreement analysis; and (3)implementation of management practices to improve the results shown by the assessments. A large and comprehensive case study was employed to describe, refine, and validate the framework. When the DQAIF is applied to pavement distress data collected on site by different evaluators, the results show that it is an effective method for quickly identifying and solving data collection issues. The benefit of this framework is that the analyses employed produce performance measures during the data collection process, thus minimizing the risk of subjectivity and suggesting timely corrective actions. The DQAIF can be used as part of an asset management program, or in any engineering program in which the data collected are subjected to the judgment of the individuals performing the evaluation. The process could also be adapted for assessing performance of automated distress data acquisition systems.","[Migliaccio, G.

When compared to other companies in the dataset, HECs engage in more hours of observation in suppliers' facilities, communicate more often with suppliers, put more effort and time in the planning stages of the project, use more practices related to supplier quality surveillance and supplier quality management, and find non-conformances earlier in the project.","[Alves, Thais da C.

High quality monitoring data are necessary for decision-support systems, design analysis, and research. However, little work has been done in the area of generic, automated data quality assessment and cleansing procedures. We have developed an automated, two-level data quality assessment procedure to address this deficiency. In the first level of our procedure, several different data quality assessment methods are used in a voting scheme to identify concentrations of anomalies in aggregate data. In the second level, differences between anomalies and normal data at the individual data level are identified; combined with domain knowledge, these differences can be used to identify different types of errors, such as missing data and calibration errors. In our case studies, we have been able to effectively cleanse the data using the results from our data quality assessment procedure. We have also developed a test bench to explore the sensitivity of the data quality assessment algorithms used in our approach. The test bench introduces a known error into a clean, artificial data set and then evaluates how well each assessment method identifies the error. The test bench results show that our approach is able to effectively identify anomalies, even those with small magnitudes of error.","[Buchheit, Rebecca Bari] Ab Initio, Lexington, MA USA; [Garrett, James H., Jr.; Chen, Ping] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [McNeil, Sue] Univ Illinois, Urban Transportat Ctr, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Buchheit, RB (corresponding author), Ab Initio, Lexington, MA USA.",garrett@cmu.edu; mcneil@uic.edu; pingc@cmu.edu,,"McNeil, Sue/0000-0001-5983-8623; Garrett, James/0000-0002-8408-2407","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMS-9987871]; Illinois Department of Transportation through the Metropolitan Transportation Support Initiative (METSI) at University of Illinois, Chicago","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMS-9987871 and partially supported by Illinois Department of Transportation through the Metropolitan Transportation Support Initiative (METSI) at University of Illinois, Chicago.

These attributes have been previously explored and identified within New Zealand construction sector. However, much ambiguity remains as to what are the values or preference of parties involved in construction project procurement and how the attributes are traded-off in real decision making processes. Basically how do the industry practitioners judge their relationship quality based on the four mentioned attributes. Data is collected from New Zealand industry practitioners through a conjoint full profile questionnaire technique. Via conjoint and cluster analysis a judgment model for relationship quality is extracted. The overall aggregate conjoint analysis suggests that performance satisfaction is the most important attribute in judging relationship quality in construction activities. The other three attributes also attained a relatively large importance index inferring that all are valuable attributes and contributing to relationship quality. However, by assessing the conjoint measurements and utilities generated at individual level and applying hierarchical cluster analysis different clusters of practitioners with distinct patterns of judgment are identified. The largest cluster had performance satisfaction as their main decisive attribute followed by commitment and teamwork. Conversely the second cluster had trust and teamwork as the decisive attribute with performance satisfaction as the least important and finally the smallest cluster regarded trust and performance to be more decisive. Hence, judgment criteria for relationship quality in construction procurement are not unanimous and diverse perceptions exist as to what is relationship quality; with different managerial implications.","[Jelodar, Mostafa Babaeian; Yiu, Tak Wing; Wilkinson, Suzanne] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm, Fac Engn, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand","Jelodar, MB (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm, Fac Engn, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",mjel010@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Yiu, A/Prof. Tak Wing/A-3334-2009; Wilkinson, Suzanne/AAI-1922-2020","Yiu, A/Prof. Tak Wing/0000-0002-8466-7130; Wilkinson, Suzanne/0000-0002-7146-3016; Babaeian Jelodar, Mostafa/0000-0003-1956-7384",,,,70,15,15,1,39,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

This article focuses on the quality control plan selection from the multilevel perspective and builds a multilevel algorithm. Considering a complex research and development (R&D) project involving an integrator (client, tier 1 in a supply chain) and a contractor (tier 2 in a supply chain), this study builds two models by taking two different kinds of decision sequences into account. In the first case, the client moves first (i.e., the client makes decision first) while the contractor is the first mover in the second case. Two objectives are considered: the quality improvement rate and the resource cost. The results show that it is not necessary for the client to be the first mover in the decision-making process when alternative plans show no obvious difference in both the quality improvement rate and resource cost. In addition, because of the transitivity of quality objectives and resource constraints, the component quality from lower level will take effect on upper-level quality. Moreover, we find that the client, as the first mover, has a marked impact on the total quality improvement rate of the project only when alternative plans show obvious differences in either the quality improvement rate or the resource consumption. Our study offers insights on the importance of exploring the relationship of decision sequences on quality plans for a project manager.","[Feng, Liangqing] Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Feng, Liangqing] Tianjin Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Huang, Dali] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Jin, Mingzhou] Univ Tennessee, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Knoxville, TN USA; [Li, Wenchuan] Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [He, Zhen] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Yu, Andrew J.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA","Jin, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 851 Neyland Dr, Knoxville, TN 37902 USA.",jin@utk.edu,"Yu, Andrew/AAA-1654-2019","Yu, Andrew/0000-0001-9702-3257; Feng, Liangqing/0000-0003-3129-2889; Huang, Dali/0000-0002-7976-6353",,,,63,1,1,2,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1042-9247,2377-0643,,ENG MANAG J,EMJ-Eng.

Using data from the Kauffman firm survey, for ventures in high-tech industries, relative to ventures in low-tech industries, the decline in performance is stronger for founders who founded a greater number of businesses prior to the current venture or for those who have startup experience in the current industry. The differences in survival between high-tech and low-tech ventures is negligible when founders have more start up experience in the same industry. Furthermore, ventures in high-tech sectors with high credit risk have a greater performance decline relative to those in low-tech industries with high credit risk, and ventures in low-tech sectors with higher perceived competitive advantage have higher odds of failure. The findings add to our understanding of the influence of technology regimes on the limited efficacy of entrepreneurial human capital and stronger effects of credit risk on venture survival and performance.","[Wolfe, Marcus T.] Univ Oklahoma, Price Coll Business, Norman, OK 73069 USA; [Patel, Pankaj C.] Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Wolfe, MT (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Price Coll Business, Norman, OK 73069 USA.",mtwolfe@ou.edu; pankaj.patel@villanova.edu,,,,,,90,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Bored piles installed by the dry process commonly are used for low- to medium-rise buildings in the metropolis. However, the installation of bored piles is time consuming and labor intensive, and requires skillful supervision, quality control, and the disposal of excavated spoils. The soil-cement screw pile (SCSP), a composite piling system which incorporates a soil-cement column (SCC) and a screw pile (SP), is an innovative alternative piling solution. This paper presents the ultimate load, time and cost analysis, and suggested effective design method for this piling system in soft Bangkok clay. The load capacity predictive equations for the SCSP were proposed and validated based on the field static pile load test results. These equations were used successfully for the installation of this piling system in construction projects on soft Bangkok clay. The unit cost of the SP was found to be the highest, and the unit cost of the SCSP and bored pile was found to be the lowest and almost similar. As a result, the application of the full SCSP and bored pile is more economical than the partial SCSP and SP under the same ultimate load design. However, the partial SCSP and SP have more advantages in terms of construction time and are suitable for a time-constrained project. The SCSP has higher efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness than the traditional dry-process bored pile. The outcome of this research will lead to the development of guidelines and a code of practice for SCSP in soft clay, which will be useful for the construction industry, particularly pertaining to the scheduling and cost performance of SCSPs in construction projects.
