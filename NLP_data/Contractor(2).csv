CONSTRUCTION	Construction contractors may utilize unbalanced markup bidding strategies, e.g. front-loading, to seek more beneficial cash flows, or even protect their target profits. A difference between ethical and unethical unbalanced bidding is whether the bid has been mathematically or even materially modified: the former may be allowable, but the latter should be rejected, as it fails to cover even the cost of later activities. Unbalanced bidding adds to the complexity of cash flow models and requires a new model that can calculate different scenarios accurately and efficiently. Basic new theory is explored for unbalanced bidding in cash flow models by employing the range-based class of singularity functions. First, a new synthetic balanced cash flow model that can accurately consider the time value of money (TVM) and retainage is derived to serve as the foundation; second, various unbalanced markup functions including two-phase, linear, and non-linear types are defined both cumulatively and non-cumulatively; third, the performance of the extended synthetic cash flow model for unbalanced bidding is investigated mathematically.

The objectives are to evaluate the factors influencing good working relationships, with priority placed on relationship indicators and variation in effect/priority among groups of relationships. A survey of 95 purposively sampled stakeholders resulted in 72 valid structured questionnaires. Data were analysed using mean score and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The study concludes that unitary relationships are more associated with professionals; coercive relationships more associated with contractors; while mutuality relationships are least prevalent. The influence of factors promoting/hindering good relationships do not significantly vary among the internal stakeholders (p-values = 0.665 and 0.468), while significant variation exists in the priority placed on relationship-oriented indicators (p-value = 0.015). The study recommends encouragement of mutual relationships, clear/regular communication, trust/respect for contractual conditions, cooperation/collaboration, adequate job descriptions and good job attitudes. Priority should be placed on seamless/collaborative operation, collective understanding and gain/pain-sharing, which encourage team integration.

Moreover, most of the activities belonging to this sector involve taking into account a large number of conflicting aspects, which hinder their management as a whole. Multi-criteria decision making analysis arose to model complex problems like these. This paper reviews the application of 22 different methods belonging to this discipline in various areas of the construction industry clustered in 11 categories. The most significant methods are briefly discussed, pointing out their principal strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the data gathered whilst performing the paper are statistically analysed to identify different trends concerning the use of these techniques. The review shows their usefulness in characterizing very different decision making environments, highlighting the reliability acquired by the most pragmatic and widespread methods and the emergent tendency to use some of them in combination.

Although various process-based and mathematical-model schedule delay analysis methods are available for effective schedule delay analysis, these methods require time-consuming manual operation. The use of computer-based schedule delay analysis methods seems to be a solution. However, schedule analysts still have difficulty developing computer-based schedule delay analysis methods. Therefore, this study applies information flow analysis to classify the necessary work to develop computer-based schedule delay analysis methods. In contrast to numerous studies that focus only on computerizing a process-based or a mathematical-model schedule delay analysis method, this study constructs a computer-based method that integrates two process-based schedule delay analysis methods simultaneously. In a tested case study, the delay liability for the project owner and contractor was classified successfully. Importantly, this study provides a useful reference for similar applications in project management.

Managing risks in mega defense acquisition projects: Performance, policy, and opportunities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Risk management; Department of Defense; Cost estimating; Future Combat Systems; Case study	IMPLEMENTING STRATEGY; MANAGEMENT	This research explores key aspects involved in the process of managing risk associated with acquisition projects within the US Department of Defense (DOD). First, various US Government Accountability Office reports are analyzed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the DOD's overall program management practices, as well as individual projects. Then, the evolution and progress of United States Army's Future Combat Systems project is examined in detail as a case study to substantiate the argument that insufficient risk management has contributed to project delays and cost overruns significantly. Poor risk management performance and practices are not unique to the Army, but arises from a system bred into the process of gaining approval to implement projects in the DOD. Incorporating a comprehensive risk management plan in the planning phase and filling key project management positions with personnel trained to recognize sound proposals from contractors would make significant strides toward improving overall project management practices in the DOD.

Productivity aspects of urban freeway rehabilitation with accelerated construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Over the last 5 years the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has completed three experimental long-life urban freeway rehabilitation projects by utilizing a fast-track (accelerated) construction approach of around-the-clock operations under extended closure. This paper presents the fast-track rehabilitation approaches and the as-built production rates of major rehabilitation operations monitored at the three experimental projects. The monitoring results show that the contractor's production rates varied considerably depending upon the construction logistics, material delivery and hauling methods, lane-closure tactics, and/or pavement designs being implemented. A higher production rate and a noticeable "learning-curve effect" were observed when full-width rehabilitation was compared with partial-width rehabilitation, when continuous lane reconstruction was compared with random slab replacements, and when full roadbed closures were compared with partial lane closures. Findings in this study suggest that Caltrans should evaluate project-specific conditions and constraints, which might restrict use of a preferred rehabilitation scheme, by taking production rate variances into account when establishing schedule baselines of construction staging plans and incentive/disincentive contracts for urban freeway rehabilitation projects.

Moreover, researchers generally seek innovative "knowledge mining" techniques for optimizing their research efforts within constrained time frames and with scarce resources. Meanwhile, rapid developments in the fields of computing and information technology drive the accelerated globalization process in both industry and academia. This paper explores some of the emerging technologies and associated research methodologies from an information supply chain perspective. An application in a recent Internet based two-phase questionnaire survey for design/build contractor selection provides a useful case study in the structuring of an innovative knowledge mining strategy. This experience feeds into the formulation of a "high-velocity" knowledge mining framework and a set of guidelines-to facilitate and enhance such innovative construction management research, while dealing with some initial issues/problems in the Internet based research environment. Furthermore, some critical success factors, key performance indicators, and mining strategies are consolidated for marshalling both vivid and tacit knowledge sources, such as by "exploiting" Internet resources for more creative and efficient construction management research.

Appropriate Types of Payments in Construction Contracts Based on Agency Theory Parameters	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract; Payment; Agency theory; Construction	ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; SAMPLE-SIZE; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; DELPHI; COMPENSATION; INCENTIVES; STRATEGIES; SELECTION	Choosing between different compensation strategies is one of the major concerns of owners in construction contracts. This paper is aimed at examining the choice between behavior-based and outcome-based payment types through the views of practitioners from construction projects with variables defined by agency theory. The study adopts the analysis of data through the Delphi technique supported by factor analysis and multinomial logistic regressions to test the paper hypotheses. The paper shows that in projects with a high level of contractor risk aversion, outcome uncertainty, task programmability, and information systems, cost-plus-fee payment is more attractive than lump-sum payment. Conversely, the paper shows that in projects with a high level of goal conflict and outcome measurability, lump-sum payment is more attractive than cost-plus-fee payment. The results demonstrate the practical usefulness of agency theory in the arena of construction management. The contribution of this paper lies in providing insights into choosing an appropriate contract payment type based on agency theory parameters.	[Hosseinian, S.

The extensive and systematic monitoring coverage during the first three months after construction of a circular tunnel structure delivers an important contribution to the understanding of the tunnels' behavior between the construction phase and the final stabilized shape. The observed differences of the average radius values generally show a decrease in the first week after ring erection and a stabilization of the tunnel structure during the following weeks. The results of such a systematic monitoring program allow the contractors or engineers involved to validate the theoretical models and to compare with the actual behavior of large diameter shield tunneling in soft soil. This is highly valuable, because very few measurements are available at this early stage of a tunnel construction to evaluate the performance and accuracy of such theoretical models.

A proposal based on the Analytic Network Process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder management; Stakeholder influence; Project management; Analytic Network Process	DECISION-MAKING; CONSTRUCTION; SUCCESS	In this paper we present a methodology to measure stakeholders' influences within a project from the point of view of the Project Manager. It is a novel proposal for the definition of "influence" among stakeholders based on a multiperspective approach. The concept of influence is broken down into criteria, evaluating different aspects that together define an index which measures the influence of each stakeholder with respect to the rest of the project team. This index is calculated with the Analytic Network Process. The methodology has been applied to a maintenance project for the Spanish National Railway Infrastructure company. Results show that the most influential stakeholders are the Contractor and the Signaling systems provider accounting for 40% of the total influence. These results have helped the Project Manager to be aware of the two most influential stakeholders and set the guidelines for the stakeholder management in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

How do contract types and incentives matter to project performance?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of the European-Academy-of-Management (EURAM)	JUN 17-20, 2015	Warsaw, POLAND	European Acad Management		Capital project; Collaboration; Contract; Incentive; Relational; Teamwork; Trust	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCES; INNOVATIVE PROJECTS; METHOD VARIANCE; TRUST; TEAMWORK; RECOMMENDATIONS; COLLABORATION; VARIABLES; SUCCESS	How collaborative contracts and contractual incentives might influence project performance remains equivocal. We hypothesized that their effects on project performance are mediated by owner contractor collaboration, measured in terms of relational attitudes (relational norms and senior management commitment) and teamworking quality (inter-team collaborative processes). Using PLS-SEM, we analyzed a sample of 113 capital projects. The results suggest that through better relational attitudes and teamworking quality, projects with a partnering/alliance contract are likely to perform better than those with lump-sum and reimbursable contracts. Likewise, the projects with incentive contracts are likely to perform better than those without incentives through better relational attitudes and teamworking quality. There were no differences in project performance directly associated with different contract types and contractual incentives. Taken together, a partnering/alliance contract and incentive contracts do not necessarily result directly into better project performance but through relational attitudes and how they play out into actual teamworking behavior.

J	Eriksson, PE; Westerberg, M				Eriksson, Per Erik; Westerberg, Mats			Effects of cooperative procurement procedures on construction project performance: A conceptual framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Procurement; Project performance; Collaboration; Coopetition	ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY; INNOVATION; DESIGN; HEALTH; SAFETY; COOPETITION; ANTECEDENTS; INVOLVEMENT; INCENTIVES; MANAGERS	In this paper, we develop a testable holistic procurement framework that examines how a broad range of procurement related factors affects project performance criteria. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we put forward propositions suggesting that cooperative procurement procedures (joint specification, selected tendering, soft parameters in bid evaluation, joint subcontractor selection, incentive-based payment, collaborative tools, and contractor self-control) generally have a positive influence on project performance (cost, time, quality, environmental impact, work environment, and innovation). We additionally propose that these relationships are moderated or mediated by the collaborative climate (i.e. the trust and commitment among partners) in the project and moderated by the overall project characteristics (i.e. how challenging the project is in terms of complexity, customization, uncertainty, value/size, and time pressure).

J	AHMED, SM; KANGARI, R				AHMED, SM; KANGARI, R			ANALYSIS OF CLIENT-SATISFACTION FACTORS IN CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								What factors do clients perceive as being most important when dealing with contractor organizations? How does the perception of clients in various industries differ from each other? To answer these questions, and develop a client-satisfaction model, a survey of 101 client companies was conducted. Data analysis by a one-way analysis of variance was carried out to locate the important independent variables of the client-satisfaction model. Finally, to check if there was any interaction between the client groups (transportation, food, chemical and paper, utility, and other miscellaneous industries) and the model factors (time, cost, quality, client orientation, communication skills, and response to complaints), a two-way analysis of variance was performed. Through the analysis of data generated by the survey, it is concluded that all the factors identified in the client-satisfaction model do not possess the same significance when it comes to satisfying clients. However, clients from different industrial sectors do not display significant differences in their perception of factors leading to satisfaction. In addition, no interaction was detected between the model factors and client groups.

Two cases of highway projects in Malaysia were used to develop a knowledge utilization model for managing time-related issues (i.e.,factors causing project delay). The selected projects were similar in terms of size and scope, but the first project suffered from delay, while the second project was completed ahead of schedule. The findings traced the influence of knowledge utilization processes on project performance. The developed model was comprised of knowledge acquisition; knowledge conversion (knowledge sharing, creation, and integration); and new knowledge utilization. Also, the roles of three factors, namely, competence, teamwork, and time pressure, were highlighted in this model. This study shows knowledge utilization process while developing new solutions or making decisions about issues in the site and other daily problems that the project team is facing in road construction projects. The study emphasizes the significance of knowledge utilization to overcome time-related issues and enhance project performance.

In price negotiation, with information available about the agent's preferences, a negotiation may result in a mutually beneficial agreement However, self-interested agents may not be willing to reveal their preferences, and this can increase the difficulty of negotiating a beneficial agreement In order to overcome this problem, this paper proposes a Bayesian-based approach which can help an agent to predict its opponent's preference in bilateral negotiation. The proposed approach employs Bayesian theory to analyze the opponent's historical offers and to approximately predict the opponent's preference over negotiation issue. A Nash equilibrium algorithm is also integrated into the prediction approach to help agents on how to propose beneficial offers based on the prediction results. Validation results indicate good performance of the proposed approach in terms of utility gain and negotiation efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is believed that experiences and knowledge of past projects have the potential to improve the competitiveness of the bids submitted. This study aims to propose project learning in a structured manner as an effective approach for improvements in bidding. Through a questionnaire survey, the five most significant benefits from project learning for the betterment of bid submissions were identified, namely: "improved accuracy in pricing", "more realistic estimates", "better evaluation of risks involved in tendering for a project", "less rework and repetition of mistakes", and "faster resolution of similar problems". Further, the five most suitable project learning methods for improvement in bidding were recommended, which included "periodic learning meeting", "documentation learning", "on job training", "debriefing", and "informal face-to-face interaction". Accordingly, a structured learning model toward improved bidding is developed for large construction firms.

It is known that the complex interrelationship of material, equipment, laborers, space, environment, assess road, surrounding buildings, and building types affect the productivity and efficiency of a construction process. This complexity was inhibiting the smooth flow of resources especially when many trade contractors were working simultaneously on site. The study aimed to extract a set of core factors in site planning focusing on the tacit knowledge acquisition process to develop a Tacit-based Decision Support System (TDSS). A combination of the repertory grid technique and open-structured interviews was conducted for the tacit knowledge acquisition process. Cluster analysis and repertory grid analysis on the extensive responses from a structured interview were conducted. A computer program entitled "TDSS" was developed as a flexible tool to assist both senior and junior site layout planning engineers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lucko, G				Lucko, Gunnar			Optimizing Cash Flows for Linear Schedules Modeled with Singularity Functions by Simulated Annealing	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project planning; Financing; Financial management; Budgets; Flow profiles; Scheduling; Line of balance; Forecasting; Periodic function	TABU SEARCH; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; PROJECTS	The ability of construction contractors to plan and manage cash flow is critical for their economic success. The cumulative interaction of outflows (labor, materials, and equipment costs) and inflows (progress payments less retainage) creates a profile with a complex zigzag shape. This could only be modeled by simplification, e. g., as values tabulated at discrete times; averaged S-curves without peaks; or envelopes of all possible constellations. Neither is suited for a fully integrated model that dynamically links schedules with their cash flows for optimization. Therefore, singularity functions, whose components define ranges of behavior between cutoffs, are used to flexibly yet accurately model cash flow profiles and their various payment terms. The new approach augments construction project management toward an integrated planning model and is validated with an example from the literature. Optimization with a simulated annealing algorithm shifts activity positions in a randomized but directed search for maximizing profits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000324.

In this context, this paper presents the results of a systematic literature review of the criteria and the methods used in the phases of selecting and evaluating suppliers in projects, as given in papers published from 1973 to 2015. The papers were classified into categories in accordance with the type of project and the phase of the procurement process, investigating what criteria and methods are the most widely used for selecting suppliers and evaluating the performance of suppliers in projects. The results have revealed that the procurement process may have to consider new perspectives, such as client/supplier relations, due to the importance of having partnerships with suppliers that meet organizational needs.

J	Mpofu, B; Ochieng, EG; Moobela, C; Pretorius, A				Mpofu, Bekithemba; Ochieng, Edward Godfrey; Moobela, Cletus; Pretorius, Adriaan			Profiling causative factors leading to construction project delays in the United Arab Emirates	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; United Arab Emirates; Construction industry; Construction delay; Construction practitioners; Delivery of projects	PERFORMANCE	Purpose - A voluminous amount of research has been conducted on project delay in the recent past; however, the persistence of the problem demands that a relentless quest for solutions is upheld. It can be argued that the problem is likely to be more pronounced in areas where development pressure is the highest. One such area is the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the construction industry is said to have reached an unparalleled position in the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most significant causes of delays in the UAE construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted targeting three key types of stakeholders, namely clients, contractors and consultants. Validity and reliability were achieved by first assessing the plausibility of construction delay variables in UAE. The verification took place after the interpretation of quantitative data, this involved presenting the findings to the main participants. The validation took place after the verification process. Rigour was achieved by engaging participants previously engaged in UAE and focussing on verification and validation, this included responsiveness of the researchers during group discussions, methodological coherence, appropriate sampling frame and data analysis. Findings - From the analysis, the study unveiled a number of important causes of construction delays in the UAE, ranging from unrealistic contract durations to poor labour productivity, with consultants and clients seemingly shouldering the bulk of the " blame game". It was evident that all the three main stakeholders in a construction project (clients, consultants and contractors) need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. The research also confirms that delays are country specific and appear to be time related hence they should be viewed within the social, economic and cultural settings of the UAE. Research limitations/implications - A major limitation of the current study was the use of a single approach to facilitate data collection. Practical implications-It was evident that practitioners need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. Continuous coordination and relationship between practitioners are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance. Originality/value - As suggested in this study methods should be put in place to reduce long and bureaucratic processes within the client's organisations, not only to fulfil the requirements of the contract but also to suite fast-track projects.

To better explain the factors underpinning the use of ADR, Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model was applied to predict behavioural intention to use ADR. In general, the TPB model posits that attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control explain actual behaviour. Therefore, this study investigates the role of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control towards the prediction of intention in ADR use. Data were collected from 128 ADR decision makers from Malaysian contractor firms. Both measurement and structural assessment of the model were performed by using Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling. The results showed that TPB model provides excellent predictive accuracy and relevance for intention. The model was again examined in two distinctive scenarios. Attitude was found to be the sole predictor of intention in the occurrence of dispute; and before negotiation fails. The findings indicate a plausible future empirical investigation in the attitudinal dimension.

IT-based solutions have been employed by large businesses; however, they are not affordable to small-to-medium businesses (SMB). This paper proposes a cost-effective materials management and tracking system based on a cloud-computing service integrated with RFID for automated tracking with ubiquitous access. The current workflow of a SMB contractor was investigated and system requirements were analyzed in order to enhance it. As a low-cost solution to fulfill the requirements and improve supply chain visibility, the proposed system was developed on the cloud and integrated with RFID technology. A simulation study was conducted to show the potential impact of the system on performance of the SMB. Finally, usability and environmental studies were conducted to show the feasibility of the system implementation in the real work environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the complex and high risk environment of a construction project, questionable decisions can be made in the planning and design phase, and disagreements, conflicts, disputes, change orders, and claims can occur in the construction phase. These problems contribute to an increase in transaction costs. Transaction costs at the pre-contract phase of a project are different from the transaction costs at the post-contract phase. However, there is no consensus on a standard definition of transaction costs in construction projects. In this study, a detailed literature review focusing on transaction costs in construction project management is presented. The factors that affect transaction costs are identified and categorized under the headings of the owner's and contractor's roles in the transaction, project management efficiency, and the characteristics of the transaction environment.

A structurally different performance-based regulation document was published in 2001. A continuous research effort paralleled these developments, leading recently to the Policy Document on Building Regulations 2002-06 and the approval of a new national programme called Process and System Innovation in Building (PSIB). Actual and future developments are strongly influenced by the turmoil following the recent disclosure of the wide use of outlawed settlement of calculation cost and project 'rights' by the Dutch contractors. In addition, some blatant cases of fraudulent contract administration were revealed. By the end of 2003, key stakeholders within both the government and industry were in agreement that there was a need for radical change of the economic and social performance of the building and construction sector. The PSIB programme, in combination with a strong deregulation initiative. will be the major driver for the application of the performance approach in the sector.

As project contractors increasingly use external suppliers to complement their own capability base, the importance of supplier selection is emphasized. Supplier choices should rely on accurate knowledge of the suppliers' capabilities. We examine the literature related TO supplier capabilities in collaborative, discontinuous project business. We use a qualitative, embedded single-case strategy in shipbuilding industry to explore the importance of supplier capabilities in one shipyard and examine how consistently the shipyard and its 20 suppliers assess the capabilities of the suppliers. Our results show that the buyer prioritizes technical, operational and business capabilities over relational and developmental capabilities, and that the buyer and its suppliers diverge in their assessments of the suppliers' capabilities, creating potential misunderstandings and false expectations in the buyer supplier relationships. We complement prior research by adding a new dimension of business capabilities into the supplier's capability base in the field of project business. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) is a practical and useful technique in dealing with multi-attribute decision making problems, and has been widely employed in the construction management and other fields. The modification and extension of TOPSIS to a group decision environment is investigated in this study. In the proposed group decision making model, we both adopt the Minkowski distance function to solve the over-weighted problem in the original TOPSIS technique, the grey number operations to deal with the problem of uncertain information, and the aggregation approach to integrate experts' evaluations. Finally, an illustrative example of subcontractor selection is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although not confined to construction, the role of the state in construction demand meant that it was one of the most heavily implicated sectors. Known as 'tangentopoli', the scandals have prompted a major reform of public sector procurement in the Italian industry which, combined with changes required to conform with EU directives, is leading to a profound cultural change in the industry. This paper provides an authoritative review of the changes in the procurement codes and the roles and relationships within the construction industry. It shows how the project management of public sector programmes is being strengthened, and how the procurement of the design and construction processes is being separated to provide greater transparency in the process. Although it is too soon to tell what the actual impact of these changes will be upon construction industry practice, some suggestions are made in the concluding comments.

Differentiation of Evaluation Criteria in Design-Build and Construction Manager at Risk Procurements	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Procurement; Bidding; Qualifications-based selection (QBS); Best-value (BV) selection; Design-build (DB); Construction manager; Evaluation criteria	MODEL; QUALIFICATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; REQUESTS	The procurement processes used in the alternative contracting methods of design-build (DB) and construction manager at risk (CMAR) are heavily focused on best-value and qualifications-based selection. However, previous research has not examined the effectiveness of owners' evaluation criteria in differentiating among competing bidders. The objective of this study was to document the selection outcomes of the bidders in DB and CMAR projects and identify which evaluation criteria had the greatest differentiation in scores for competing bidders. The results were compared with previous research on the procurement of architectural and engineering consultants and design-bid-build (DBB) contractors. The study sample consisted of 362 bidders for 63 DB and CMAR projects in the United States and Canada. The statistical analysis results showed that scores on interviews and technical proposals had the greatest differentiation, while cost proposal scores had minimal differentiation. These findings provide practical guidance for owners and bidders regarding how to prioritize evaluation criteria and how to respond to them.

This study aims to examine the critical success factors as well as the relative importance of positive and negative factors influencing the attractiveness of PPP projects in Singapore, and to identify the critical risk factors and preferred risk allocations for PPP projects in Singapore. The questionnaire survey results indicated that negative factors were more affirmative than the positive factors, and that 23 risk factors had significant criticalities. Eight risks would be preferably allocated to the public sector while 19 risks could be assigned to the private sector. 11 risks were preferred to be shared by both parties and the allocation of four risks depended on project circumstances.

Although project governance has been widely studied with the aim of improving participants' relational behavior, limited research examines the distinct effectiveness of various governance mechanisms on influencing relational behavior, especially in megaprojects. Through examining three varieties of governance mechanisms-contract, trust, and institutional support-a hierarchical moderated regression analysis has been used to explore the impact of each of the governance mechanisms in facilitating the relational behavior of megaproject participants and further team performance. The analysis is based on data collected from 202 contractors and consultants working at megaprojects in China. Results unveiled that both contractual term specificity and its interaction with trust can facilitate relational behavior. Project uncertainty moderates the relationship between governance mechanisms and relational behavior, thus affecting project team performance. The findings offer both theoretical and managerial implications for megaproject participants to cultivate beneficial relational behavior to improve team performance.

After collecting data from 135 BIM experts from various capital projects in the mainland of China, 95 value flows among 7 BIM-related stakeholders were quantified, including 69% intangible value and 31% tangible value flows. Owners were then selected as focal organizations to analyze 49,775 value cycles starting from and ending with owners. 9 top-ranked value cycles, 3 most important stakeholders (BIM consultants, general contractors, and subcontractors), and 20 top value flows were identified and discussed to enable owners to formulate effective strategies to drive BIM value realization. These results can provide a visualized tool to quantify the perceived value of BIM stakeholders and to formulate value-based strategies to encourage the "buy-in" decisions by stakeholders.

This research is concerned with international construction projects. In particular, it investigates the impact of local knowledge on the client value system. Workshops were organised on 12 international projects in the western Balkans region. The initial client value system was captured by using a paired comparison exercise. Next, local knowledge information was introduced, and the EFTE (Estimate-Feedback-Talk-Estimate) technique was used to capture the revised client value system. The changes in the two sets of client value systems were analysed. The results indicate that 4 parameters (Scope, Contract-admin, Human resources and Health and Safety) out of 8 changed and that the changes were statistically significant. Local knowledge can be used to impact client value system.

Relational factors in owner-contractor collaboration: The mediating role of teamworking	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Capital project; Collaboration; Relational; Teamworking; Trust	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INNOVATIVE PROJECTS; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; TEAMS; GUIDELINES; SUCCESS; WORKING; INDEX	We hypothesized that teamworking quality, defined as an inter-team collaborative process, is the mediator that links the efficacy of three antecedents relational attitudes (relational norms and senior management commitment), collaborative practices (team integration and joint working procedures), and teams' joint capability (the project team's overall competence and experience) in improving project performance (efficiency, effectiveness, perceived satisfaction, perceived success). Using a sample of 113 capital projects, we applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The results confirm that the three antecedents indirectly influence project performance through teamworking quality. There is no empirical evidence that these antecedents directly influence project performance: relational attitudes, teams' joint capability, and collaboration practices do not automatically lead to a successful collaboration without day-to-day managerial intervention in teamworking processes. We also found that the parties' expectations regarding continuing relationships, as a consequence of good project performance, are directly affected by relational attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By means of these parameters, experts in construction enterprises apply a five-point scale in order to evaluate enterprise relations with four transactors within its microenvironment. The parameters describing relationships are adopted as assessment criteria. The question of selecting the best construction enterprise for cooperation is a multi-criteria issue. The author's solution is based on the ELECTRE III method and elaborates two alternative methods of selecting the best construction enterprise on the basis of the analysis of partnering relations between construction enterprises being studied and their transactors within the microenvironment and indicates one of the above introduced methods as preference. Two methods have been developed with a view to supporting a decision-making system in a construction enterprise as regards the choice of a subcontractor. Relevant calculations can be made by the enterprise decision-maker using the ConRel programme elaborated by the Cracow University of Technology.

The empirical illustration shows that the case client has reduced the focus on price and authority and instead facilitated a relationship based on trust and cooperation, through procurement procedures involving joint specification, limited bid invitation, bid evaluation based on soft parameters, joint selection of subcontractors, standard contracts coupled with relational norms, usage of collaborative tools, and contractor self-control. The procurement procedures chosen result in a governance form rather similar to the one prescribed by the conceptual model. Furthermore, the project participants are satisfied with the project result and also consider the procurement procedures performed suitable. Hence, the results provide both theoretical and empirical support to the implementation of partnering procurement procedures in construction projects characterized by high complexity and uncertainty.

Exploring performance of the integrated project delivery process on complex building projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project delivery; Integrated project delivery; Supply chain relationships	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	Many building projects do not meet owners' performance expectations. Integrated project delivery (IPD) has emerged as a new delivery system with the potential to provide better performance through more supply chain integration. However, there is a knowledge gap surrounding how project delivery systems, IPD in particular, affect supply chain relationships and potential project performance. To fill this gap, we applied a simulation method, General Performance Model (GPM), to assess the interactions between numerous project delivery variables and compare potential performance between delivery systems. This study presents a GPM analysis of a complex hospital project and based upon cross-impact assessments by owners, architects, constructors, and specialty contractors from the building industry. The results found the most influential drivers of project delivery performance to be communication, alignment of interest and objectives, team working, trust, and gain/pain sharing. The performance of the supply chain was found to drive the project delivery performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Construction engineers spend much time on site visits, but visit effectiveness has not been explored and its effect on project performance is unclear. In this study, a checklist to improve the effectiveness of site visits was developed, based on site visit deficiencies and construction productivity factors found in the recent literature and the most frequently occurring defects from 338 construction projects. The checklist was then used on eight ongoing road and bridge projects to test its applicability and effectiveness. Results show that proper use of the checklist by contractors indicated a high level of project quality. Time spent on site visits was also reduced through using the checklist. This research links site visit practices with management knowledge, such as work planning, quality management, and coordination. The checklist developed in this research incorporates management knowledge as a systematic tool that complements technical checklists to guide and improve the effectiveness of site visits.

The framework assists contractors in performing a time-cost trade-off analysis to optimize the use of resources. The proposed framework consists of three main components which interact in a cyclic manner. These components are simulation, optimization, and reporting modules. Processes and tasks of launching girder systems are described in order to illustrate the mechanism of the simulation module which utilizes STROBOSCOPE as a general purpose simulation language. The developments made in the optimization module are extensively detailed. The optimization module uses ant colony optimization and it accounts for seven optimization variables; location of casting yard, time lag, number of casting forms, number of preparation platform, curing method, number of yard reinforcement crews, and number of stressing crews. Two optimization approaches are coded in the optimization module in two algorithms (ant colony multiobjective optimization I and II) to carry out multiobjective optimization. These are function-transformation and modified distance approaches. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the practical use of the developed framework.

Using Public-Private Partnerships to Expand Subways: Madrid-Barajas International Airport Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ECONOMICS	In the beginning of 2006, the regional government of Madrid decided to expand the subway network to the new Terminal T-4 in Madrid-Barajas International Airport using a public-private partnership (PPP) approach. Owing to the peculiar characteristics of this new access as the enlargement of an existing subway line, the PPP approach was based on separating infrastructure management from transportation service operation. The PPP contractor was entrusted with the infrastructure construction and maintenance while Madrid's public subway company remained in charge of operating the trains. This paper examines the theoretical foundation that justifies the implementation of different PPP approaches to deal with urban rail projects. The paper then explains the reasons why a nonintegrated PPP approach was ultimately adopted for the expansion of Madrid's subway network to the airport. From the outcome of the tender and the present operation performance, we find that nonintegrated PPP contracts have important advantages for urban rail PPPs, particularly for conventional subway networks. These advantages are notable in terms of encouraging economies of scale and density, boosting competition, and reducing the financial costs.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Contracting relationship trends and transitions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS	Construction industry reports worldwide have called for radical cultural changes to reduce adversarial conflicts and increase productivity levels. These reports have recommended reintegration of fragmented function and teams through different teamworking approaches such as partnering and alliancing. The theoretical basis for Such approaches can be tracked back to relational contracting (RC) principles. Recent teamworking initiatives have met with some success, based on structured cooperation between owners and contractors. However, the full benefits of these cooperative approaches may only materialize if (1) all potential team members/project partners are selected on the basis of relevant rationalized evaluation criteria; (2) all stakeholders work closely together as a coalesced team with common objectives, and (3) these arrangements are underpinned by government-sponsored, proper change initiatives. These approaches and arguments are analyzed in this paper, aiming at developing the required project culture through the application of RC principles for the joint management of risks during the entire project life cycle. Relevant observations from two recent Hong Kong-based industry surveys indicate a high motivation toward such approaches. Finally, examples of some potentially beneficial change initiatives are used to illustrate the potential synergies that are achievable.

This study presents a model that minimizes financing cost by considering different financing alternatives and a work schedule with normal activity durations. The proposed model creates a cash flow forecast based on a work schedule generated by the critical path method (CPM). The output includes optimized schedules of financing inflow (borrowed money) and outflow (repayments of principal and interest). The proposed model has advantages compared to models developed in previous studies because the contractor: (1)pays less financing cost, (2)avoids extending the project duration and avoids liquidated damages, (3)provides an optimal financing schedule, and (4)reduces the risk of ending up with a work schedule composed of more critical activities. The model has been tested in three cases and sensitivity analysis has been performed.	[Alavipour, S. M.

Supplier selection process in an integrated construction materials management model	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction material management; Supplier selection process; BOM; Decision making; Optimization	DECISION-MAKING MODEL; CONTRACTOR SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; SYSTEM; TOPSIS; BILL; CRITERIA; CHAINS	The procurement and management of construction materials involve challenges related to reducing inventory, speeding delivery, and increasing the control of materials, thus decreasing the overall project cost. The objective of this research was to define and develop an integrated construction materials management (ICMM) model to address these challenges by deploying principles of virtual inventory management, feasible materials management networks, and a supplier selection process. Contributions include the development of the ICMM model and the demonstrated potential of the selection supplier process for improving procurement for construction projects. The use of the supplier selection process has been demonstrated through implementation on an industrial project and using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. This process optimizes and validates purchasing at each stage of fabrication for each construction package. A variety of project-specific criteria are involved in the supplier selection process, including price, lead-time, cash rebate, and supplier performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, all too often contractor organizations are uncertain of what and how many components they are to receive at a given date. Such uncertainty negatively impacts construction efficiency. In an effort to increase the visibility of engineered components at the interface between supply chain and construction, this study analyzes the feasible utilization of passive radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies to automatically track the flow of structural steel components during shipping and receiving processes. To this end, empirical tests with metal mount, battery assisted passive (BAP), and passive-only tags were performed under distinct conditions. The results demonstrate that, under the adequate conditions, engineered components can be automatically tracked with passive-RFID technologies. In addition, recommendations for the investigation and utilization of passive devices to support construction processes were detailed in the study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The professional responsibilities and obligations of members toward their peers, their clients and the general public are usually delineated within these codes of conduct. An overview of business and professional ethics within construction is provided and the ethical issues facing South African construction professions are summarized. Specifically, this paper addresses ethical issues with regard to the breach of professional responsibilities and obligations to clients and the general public, as evidenced from a questionnaire survey of architects, contractors, quantity surveyors and consulting engineers. The survey findings indicate that, notwithstanding noticeable breaches, the professions take their responsibilities and obligations seriously, and regard a balance between their obligations to clients and the general public as paramount. Breaches in professional responsibilities include conflicts of interest and the divulging of confidential and proprietary information to a third party; both professionals and clients are guilty of such breaches.

J	Braimah, N				Braimah, Nuhu			Understanding Construction Delay Analysis and the Role of Preconstruction Programming	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Claims; Delay and disruption; Planning and programming; Extensions of time; Delay damages; Scheduling		Modern construction projects commonly suffer from delay in their completions. The resolution of time and cost claims consequently flowing from such delays continues to remain a difficult undertaking for all project parties. A common approach often relied on by contractors and their employers (or their representatives) to resolve this matter involves applying various delay analysis techniques, which are all based on construction programs originally developed for managing the project. However, evidence from literature suggests that the reliability of these techniques in ensuring successful claims resolution are often undermined by the nature and quality of the underlying program used. As part of a wider research carried out on delay and disruption analysis in practice, this paper reports on an aspect of the study aimed at exploring preconstruction stage programming issues that affect delay claims resolutions. This aspect is based on an in-depth interview with experienced construction planning engineers in the United Kingdom, conducted after an initial large-scale survey on delay and disruption techniques usage. Summary of key findings and conclusions include: (1) most contractors prefer to use linked bar chart format for their baseline programs over conventional critical path method (CPM) networks; (2) baseline programs are developed using planning software packages. Some of these pose difficulties when employed for most delay analysis techniques, except for simpler ones; (3) manpower loading graphs are not commonly developed as part of the main deliverables during preconstruction stage planning. As a result, most programs are not subjected to resource loading and leveling for them to accurately reflect planned resource usage on site. This practice has detrimental effects on the reliability of baseline programs in their use for resolving delay claims; and (4) baseline program development involves many different experts within construction organizations as expected, but with very little involvement of the employer or its representative. Active client involvement is however quite important as it would facilitate quick program approval/acceptance before construction, a necessary requirement for early delay claims settlement, which otherwise are often left unresolved long after the delaying events with the potential of generating into expensive disputes. The study results provide a better understanding of the key issues that need attention if improvements are to be made in delay claim resolutions. Additional research focusing on the testing of these results using a much larger sample and rigorous statistical analysis for generalization purposes would be helpful in advancing the limited knowledge of this subject matter.

The experience gained by companies who weather an economic downturn must be absorbed into the corporate structure in a meaningful way if that knowledge is to be accessible for future recessions. This study focused on identifying and better understanding the specific approaches that commercial construction companies employed to weather the great recession and the corresponding lessons learned. A stratified purposeful sampling survey was conducted across 15 different commercial construction companies and included 57 participants in various management roles. This paper provides a comprehensive list of 124 different strategies or lessons learned across six principal categories: (1) contracting, (2) risk management, (3) cost-control, (4) human resources, (5) financial, and (6) investment related responses. This paper also provides recommendations for commercial construction companies to consider during various economic cycles on the basis of the lessons learned during this recession and recovery.

The idea of BRI is based on the revival of the ancient Silk Road, a trade route that was once connecting China with Central Asia, India, Middle East, Western Asia, and Europe. More than 1,700 infrastructure projects are planned to be implemented under BRI. Such a huge infrastructure investment brings a lot of opportunities as well as risks for nations along the Silk Road, their governments, contractors, and investors. Compared to traditional international construction projects, BRI projects are exposed to additional risks since they are geographically distributed and complex in nature and include more stakeholders. Hence, risk assessment of BRI projects is a complex task that requires an efficient tool capable of providing detailed information about critical risks. To bridge this gap, a novel method is developed and applied to the risk assessment of complex, geographically distributed, and large-scale infrastructure projects, such as BRI projects. The proposed risk assessment method integrates fuzzy matrices, fuzzy logic, and probabilistic theory into a single approach that is applied to assess risks in BRI projects for different regions, as well as regional risk and total risk. In addition, sensitivity analysis is used to optimize the proposed fuzzy logic-based risk assessment method. The key findings are as follows: (1) the main risks in BRI projects are delay in supplying materials, increases in material prices, poor quality of materials, delays in equipment delivery, increases in the costs of equipment use, and economic risk; (2) the highest risk-ranked regions in BRI projects are Central Asia and Eastern Europe, while the lowest risk-ranked region is East Asia; and (3) a weighted-average method is the optimal defuzzification method for the proposed fuzzy logic-based method. The theoretical contribution of this research is a novel risk assessment method that integrates expert judgment, fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, fuzzy matrices, and probabilistic theory into a single approach supported by sensitivity analysis. In practical terms, this study provides significant information about risks in various regions, regional risk, and overall risk of BRI projects to contractors, investors, and other stakeholders.

Origins and probabilities of MEP and structural design clashes within a federated BIM model	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modelling; Clash detection; Probability density function; Cumulative distribution function; Generalized Gamma distribution; Log Logistic (3P) distribution	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; LIFE-CYCLE; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; SUSTAINABILITY; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; FUTURE	`Design clashes' encountered during the development of a large multi-storey educational building, awarded under a Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) Design and Build contract, are reported upon. The building was developed in Birmingham, UK and the contract value was circa 36 million (UK Sterling, 2015). Members of the project management team (PMT) produced designs that were subsequently integrated by the main contractor into a federated building information modelling (BIM) model; at this stage 404 error clashes were evident between the positions of the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) designer's and structural designer's building compartments. The contractor deemed that these particular clashes were 'mission critical' as previous experience suggested that project costs could spiral uncontrollably if left unabated. Participatory action research was employed to acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of the clash incidents. Clash data accrued (in mm) was subsequently quantitatively modelled using the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Two models produced were the Log Logistic Three Parameter (3P) (using all data including outliers) and Generalized Gamma distribution (excluding outliers). Both models satisfied Anderson Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests at a 0.01 and 0.02 levels of significance. Model parameters could be used to forecast similar clashes occurring on future projects and will prove invaluable to PMT members when accurately estimating the time and resource needed to integrate BIM designs. The predictive modelling revealed that 92.98% of clashes reside within the 30-299 mm range while the most probable occurrence of a clash overlap resides in a discrete category of 100-199 mm. Further qualitative investigation is also conducted to understand why these clashes occurred and propagate ideas about how such may be mitigated. The research concludes on two important points, namely: i) BIM is not a panacea to design related construction project rework and that innovative 21st century digital technologies are hampered by 20th century management practices; and ii) improvements in clash and error mitigation reside in a better understanding of tolerances specified to alleviate the erroneous task of resolving unnecessary clashes. Future research is proposed that seeks to: automate the clash detection management, analysis and resolution process; conduct further investigative analysis of the organizational and human resource management influences impacting upon design clash propagation; and devise and validate new procedural methods to mitigate clash occurrence using a real-life project.

From a sample of Spanish construction auctions with a variety of bid scoring rules, it is found that bidders are influenced by the auction rules in significant and predictable ways. The bid score weighting, bid scoring formula, and abnormally low bids criterion are variables likely to influence the competitiveness of bidders in terms of both their aggressive/conservative bidding and concentration/dispersion of bids. Revealing the influence of the bid scoring rules and their magnitude on bidders' competitive behavior opens the door for the engineer to condition bidder competitive behavior in such a way as to provide the balance needed to achieve the owner's desired strategic outcomes.

A PDA and wireless web-integrated system for quality inspection and defect management of apartment housing projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Italian Symposium on Automation and Robotic in Construction	2005	Ferrara, ITALY	IAARC, CIB, IEEE RAS, SIRI, QUASCO, Ferrara Univ, Natl Res Council		apartment housing; quality inspection; defect management; PDA; wireless internet	CONSTRUCTION	in general, quality inspection and defect management in apartment housing construction are one of the major factors that general contractors have to consider for improving customer satisfaction and raising their images in the industry. However, many cases show that prompt and efficient actions are not made due to lack of the number of on-site quality managers, excessive workload for crews to meet deadlines, and inefficient communications among project participants. The primary objective of this research is to propose a computerized Quality Inspection and Defect Management System (QIDMS) which can collect defect data at a site in real time using Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and wireless internet, and effectively manage statuses and results of the corrective works performed. Authors expect that the effective use of the proposed QIDMS would significantly improve communication efficiency among the related participants and help quality managers systematically manage and accumulate useful data that would be utilized as a reference in future construction projects.

Information Framework for Intelligent Decision Support System for Home Energy Retrofits	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Rehabilitation; Residential buildings; Construction management; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Energy retrofit; Housing; Residential building construction; Quantitative information; Expert knowledge; Intelligent decision support system; Expert system; Information technologies	KNOWLEDGE	Residential buildings are one of the major consumers of energy. The majority of the housing stock consists of existing homes, and a large number of these homes are energy inefficient. Retrofitting existing homes to make them energy efficient can contribute immensely to energy savings. Buildings in the United States consume 72% of electricity and 40% of all energy, and residential buildings account for over half of these percentages. Existing buildings consume more than 70% of the electricity consumed by the buildings. With more than 130million existing homes, energy retrofitting of existing homes is a critical area. Literature has identified that a key impediment to home energy retrofits (HER) is the lack of information or the lack of information in a format that the homeowners can understand and use to make retrofit decisions. Homeowners traditionally depend on experts in the field of energy efficiency, such as energy auditors and trade contractors, for information. There are, however, several problems with such information, including comprehensiveness, inaccuracy, cost, and perception of bias. The proposed work contributes toward understanding and solving the information barriers in the adoption of energy retrofits in existing homes. Its primary contribution lies in developing an information model for the energy retrofit decision process that can serve as a basis for the future development of a fully functional intelligent decision support system (IDSS). The IDSS will integrate quantitative information with expert knowledge in an interactive computer-based decision tool to assist the user. It will analyze the current situation of a home through queries to the user, and based on the quantitative information and expert knowledge in the system, provide customized and prioritized information needed for decision making by the user. The paper describes and categorizes various types of information needed for a retrofit decision, proposes a decision-making process model for HER, and developes a framework for organizing and integrating the quantitative information with the expert knowledge in an expert system-based IDSS. The quantitative information was gathered from published sources and from a U.S. Department of Energy's cost database, and the expert knowledge was obtained by interviewing and job shadowing energy auditors and contractors. Finally, an example was provided to demonstrate the functioning of the proposed system. The example assists the user in identifying and prioritizing retrofit measures and provides expert advice on installation of selected measures.

Although innovative designs have brought variety to the utilitarian high-rise facades clad in glass, steel and concrete, little consideration has been given to the issues of maintainability during the design/planning stage. This lack of foresight and planning has hindered the efforts of maintenance personnel and compromised the performance of such green facades. To address these concerns, an instrumental case study approach was undertaken using a series of site investigations and interviews with experts and stakeholders. The aim of this research was to strengthen the knowledge base on high-rise vertical greenery facades in the tropics, leading to the formulation of case study-based 'design for maintainability' (DfM) guidelines. These guidelines will assist clients, designers and contractors by providing a supplemental reference during the design, installation and maintenance of high-rise VGSs located in tropical regions.

Earned value management (EVM) is a performance measurement methodology to control costs and scheduling by evaluating project progress using monetary values. Complementary methods to control project duration in time units were developed. This study contributes to project management by showing how to control costs, schedules, and time variances, given changes in quantity, resource costs, and productivity to identify the responsibilities of a contractor and owner for variations in time and cost. This study addresses the main methods for controlling project time variance in time units, as obtained through an extended literature review, and utilizes these methods by applying data from a real-life project. The findings indicated that in the case of a linear distribution of planned values, four of the five methods yielded identical values for the time variance to date and one of the methods depends more on the number of parallel activities in progress or completed.

Lean Techniques in the Management of the Design of an Industrial Project	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Lean design; Industrial projects		Lean production techniques developed by Toyota Motor Corporation have been widely applied in the manufacturing sector to reduce waste, ensure just-in-time delivery, create effective value streams, and ensure continuous improvement. Over the last two decades, significant efforts have been made to develop the theoretical foundation and practical tools to implement these techniques in the construction process. The construction process is similar to production, in that it involves the assembly of raw materials into a product. The design process, on the other hand, involves conversion of the client's requirements into manufacturing instructions using creativity and technical knowledge. This makes it challenging to implement the principles of lean production directly to design. This technical note presents the techniques used by a midsize industrial construction contractor: purpose built facility, making decisions at the last responsible moment, lean audits, and 5S in the design of industrial projects to encapsulate and implement techniques of lean production in the management of design.

This study aims to clarify the complex relationships between the risks of international construction and the objectives of sustainable project performance. The scope of sustainable project performance includes the environment and health and safety in addition to the common project objectives of cost, time, and quality. A metanetwork modeling approach was adopted to analyze and evaluate the impact of each risk and its relationship with the project objectives, which were built using a case study and questionnaire data. The results indicate that despite the common impact of the increased material prices on the cost objective, the risk of environmental problems caused by contractors during the construction stage had the greatest impact on international construction. At the construction site, decision-makers or managers can clearly identify risk relationships and control the corresponding risks to the project objectives. This study identifies the relationships between the risks and the project objectives and can serve as a practical reference for managing international construction.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Corruption; Project context; Procurement; Public projects; Megaprojects; Project performance	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; COST OVERRUNS; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; BRIBERY; GROWTH; PERSPECTIVE; CONTRACTS; POLITICS	Despite the relevance of corruption in project selection, planning and delivery, the project management literature pays little attention to this crucial phenomenon. This paper sets the background to foster the discussion concerning how to select, plan and deliver infrastructure in corrupt project contexts. It presents the different types of corruptions and the characteristics of projects that are more likely to suffer from it. Corruption is particularly relevant for large and uncommon projects where the public sector acts as client/owner or even as the main contractor. Megaprojects are "large unique projects" where public actors play a key role and are very likely to be affected by corruption. Corruption worsens both cost and time performance, and the benefits delivered. This paper leverages the institutional theory to introduce the concept of "corrupt project context" and, using the case study of the Italian high-speed railways, shows the impact of a corrupt context on megaprojects.

Improving Labor-Based Road Rehabilitation in Ghana	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In an attempt to create more employment and reduce poverty, a labor-based road rehabilitation program was introduced in Ghana in 1986 with the assistance of international organizations. Although this program has the potential to create more employment than equipment-intensive methods, it is considered less attractive than equipment-intensive methods. It is considered to be too slow, encumbered with labor organization and management problems, and reliant upon casual (nonpermanent) workers. This paper describes the family-based labor management (FBLM) concept intended to make the labor-based road program more attractive to contractors and laborers, and thereby help address the unemployment and poverty problems. It is anticipated that if at least 10% of the $174 million currently used to import construction and earthmoving equipment annually is invested in labor-based road rehabilitation program, about 23,000 jobs could be created. If 50% of the equipment expenses are invested in the program, almost 117,000 jobs could be created annually. The proposed FBLM concept is flexible enough to serve as a model to other African countries encountering similar problems.	[Quagraine, V. K.; Beliveau, Y.

This study mainly aims to link knowledge enabling factors (KEFs) to various organizational performance outcomes (OPOs) of project-based firms. Through a questionnaire survey, data about KEFs and OPOs are collected from project-based firms in the Vietnamese construction industry. First, the performance degree of KEFs in project-based firms is explored using mean score method. Then, the linkage between KEFs and OPOs is explored using regression analysis. Accordingly, various shortlists of important KEFs that may significantly affect various organizational performance aspects measured by different OPOs are identified. Some key KEFs that may have a significant effect on many OPOs are also highlighted. The results of this study may provide project-based firms with some useful information about the effects of KEFs on various organizational performance aspects. Hence, project-based firms could formulate appropriate KEFs-based management strategies to improve various organizational performance aspects effectively.

J	Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM				Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM			Applying a genetic algorithm-based multiobjective approach for time-cost optimization	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						optimization; cost control; time factors; algorithms; project management	MODEL	Reducing both project cost and time (duration) is critical in a competitive environment. However, a trade-off between project time and cost is required. This in turn requires contracting organizations to carefully evaluate various approaches to attaining an optimal time-cost equilibrium. Although several analytical models have been developed for time-cost optimization (TCO), they mainly focus on projects where the contract duration is fixed. The optimization objective in those cases is therefore restricted to identifying the minimum total cost only. With the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are targeting the increased benefits and opportunities of seeking an earlier project completion. The multiobjective model for TCO proposed in this paper is powered by techniques using genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed model integrates the adaptive weights derived from previous generations, and induces a search pressure toward an ideal point. The concept of the GA-based multiobjective TCO model is illustrated through a simple manual simulation, and the results indicate that the model could assist decision-makers in concurrently arriving at an optimal project duration and total cost.

(LPS), the mechanisms by which it works are less well understood. Its strengthening of the social networks within construction projects implies the possibility of enhancing collaboration using means other than or in addition to the LPS. Inspired by Rousseau's Social Contract, a new management artefact called the Social Subcontract (SSub) was devised to test this hypothesis. The impacts of SSub and LPS interventions on the workflow in eight residential construction projects were studied using action research over periods from 7 to 16months. The results provide anecdotal evidence that application of SSub together with LPS improves coordination and workflow more than application of LPS alone. SSub also appears to motivate the general contractor to perform the make-ready process, which otherwise is often not implemented. The research provides new understanding of how the LPS functions. It contributes to industry and academia by relating theory to practice, potentially strengthening the confidence with which practitioners can apply such interventions to improve production flows.

Causes, Effects, Benefits, and Remedies of Change Orders on Public Construction Projects in Oman	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Change order; Delay; Project completion; Cost overrun; Oman		Change orders are usually issued to cover variations in scope of work, material quantities, design errors, and unit rate changes. This paper discusses variations in public construction projects in Oman by investigating causes of variations, studying their effects on the project, identifying the beneficial parties, and suggesting remedies to alleviate related problems. Tasks included an analysis of four actual case studies and conducting a field survey via a questionnaire. It was determined that the client's additional works and modifications to design were the most important factors causing change orders, followed by the nonavailability of construction manuals and procedures. The most important effects of change orders on the project were found to be the schedule delays, disputes, and cost overruns. The contractor was found to be the party most benefiting from the change orders followed by the consultant and then the client. A set of remedial actions were suggested and respondents viewed that the revision of registration of consulting offices would be the most important action followed by establishing standard documents for design procedures and building a national database about soil conditions and services.

Nevertheless, the existing TCLP methods are inefficient in addressing the multiple heavy lifts in high-rise MiC. Therefore, this paper aims to develop an innovative virtual reality (VR) tool to support main contractors in selecting the optimal tower crane layout plan for high-rise MiC. The paper adopts the design science methodology for tool development and evaluation. The tool is designed with three functional components, i.e., crane layout generation with real-time feasibility checking, layout selection using multi-criteria performance evaluation, and interactive crane-lift simulation. Using a real-life high-rise MiC project, the tool is proved to be innovative in interactive human-in-the-loop planning, effective in determining the safe and efficient crane layout, and efficient in use. The work described integrates human-in-the-loop simulation and multi-criteria decision-making via VR technologies.

However, how the contract governs the relationship between uncertainty and opportunistic behavior has not been elaborated. This paper examines the effects of uncertainty on the supplier's opportunistic behavior and the moderating effects of contractual complexity. This research classifies uncertainty into environmental uncertainty and behavioral uncertainty and distinguishes contractual complexity from a functional perspective, with elements including control, coordination and adaptation. Using data from 220 owners and general contractors in the Chinese construction industry, this research reveals that a positive relationship exists between uncertainty and opportunistic behavior. Contractual control and adaptation have effects on weakening the relationship between environmental uncertainty and opportunistic behavior, while contractual coordination can mitigate the opportunistic behavior induced by behavioral uncertainty. These findings offer new insights into uncertainty management and a nuanced understanding of contractual governance in projects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Due to huge cases of claim in construction industry, this study argues that claim management is a significant factor in construction projects success. In this study, the most possible causes of these emerging claims are identified and statistically ranked by Probability-Impact Matrix. Subsequently, by classifying claims in different cases, the most important ones are ranked in order to achieve a better understanding of claim management in each project. In this regard, a new index is defined, being able to be applied in a variety of projects with different time and cost values, to calculate the amount of possible claims in each project along with related ratios with respect to the cost and time of each claim. This study introduces a new model to predict the frequency of claims in construction projects. By using the proposed model, the rate of possible claims in each project can be obtained. This model is validated by applying it into fitting case studies in Iran construction industry.

The aim of this paper is to elaborate significance, role and types of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in the construction industry and show how different management perspectives perceive the indicators. A literature review was carried out in order to generate a listing of KPIs, used among academe and the industry. Afterwards, using surveys and semi-structured interviews, the data was gathered from more than 30 South-East European construction companies. Results were analyzed, producing a final set of 37 indicators. This study identified a low level of awareness of KPI models and performance management processes among the companies. Furthermore, the analysis showed a substantial difference in perception of KPIs among investors, consultants and contractors, which consequently led to a compiling list of KPIs. The top ten KPI's are: Quality, Cost, Number of investor interferences, Changes in project support, Time increase, Client satisfaction, Employees' satisfaction, Innovation and learning, Time and Identification of client's interest. The paper concludes with final remarks and guidelines for the implementation of KPIs in practice.

J	Ock, JH; Han, SH				Ock, JH; Han, SH			Lessons learned from rigid conflict resolution in an organization: Construction conflict case study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Success in construction projects mainly depends on how well project managers handle conflicts. There are in general five conflict resolution approaches: withdrawal, compromise, forcing, smoothing, and problem solving. Conflict results are very relevant to the interaction of the approaches. Improperly managed, the interaction often generates psychological residue such as anger that ruins the project. The main objective of this research is, through a case study, to enhance the comprehension of the approaches, their interactions, and the psychological changeovers involved. Although conflict resolution among the contractual parties with privity has been studied widely, the conflicts among the parties either in an owner or in a contractor organization have been rarely researched, although they frequently cause destructive claims to the contractual parties. This research identifies a real construction conflict as the case study that occurred between two functional entities of a local Korean government. The case illustrates that a badly managed conflict in an owner organization causes undesirable claims between contractual parties. Based on the previous research regarding the five approaches and psychological transitions in a conflict resolution process, the case is analyzed to recognize the approaches and psychological changeovers absorbed.

Thus, the industry still needs changes in the BIM implementation. This study aims to identify critical drivers for change (CDCs) towards full BIM implementation, demonstrate the theoretical rational behind the CDCs, and formulate strategies to strengthen the CDCs. Conducting a questionnaire survey with 86 professionals, this study identified 31 CDCs, among which 'BIM vision and leadership from the management' was ranked top. The results indicated that these CDCs could be interpreted with an adapted organizational change framework in which process-related attributes were key to changing towards full BIM implementation. The identification of the CDCs and the strategies enables the project management team to obtain sufficient support for strengthening the positive influence from the CDCs and enhancing BIM implementation. Additionally, overseas construction practitioners can use the drivers and strategies identified in this study to prepare their customized lists of drivers and strategies.

To reduce such risk, contractors typically include a reserve to mitigate cost overruns and schedule delays. This reserve comprises two categories: (1)a contingency reserve covering potentially required changes, and (2) a management reserve (MR) covering unplanned changes. Since estimating an MR is difficult because the inherent risks are unpredictable, the traditional percentage method is still used for this purpose. To address this shortcoming, this study proposes an MR estimation method based on the cost and schedule performance ratios of international construction projects. K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is applied to retrieve similar projects and a genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the retrieved cases. Finally, case studies are conducted to validate the estimated ratios and test the applicability of the proposed MR estimation method. The case study results show that the proposed method can infer the cost and schedule performance ratios within a 5% error rate. As a result, it can estimate the MR more accurately than the traditional percentage method. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A correlational research study was designed to achieve the research aim. Data were collected using multiple techniques from 47 completed building projects in Singapore. The curves for describing the relationships between voluntary safety investment, total accident costs, accident frequency rate, and total controllable safety costs were developed using regression techniques. The optimization of voluntary safety investment was conducted using the extreme-value theorem with the objective of finding the minimum level of total controllable safety costs. The results show that the financially minimum voluntary safety investment varies with different levels of safety culture and project hazard. The models developed in this study can be used to estimate the minimum voluntary safety investment for building projects at different safety culture and project hazard levels. The findings of this study may provide the basis for financial decision making in managing construction safety for building contractors. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Firms face numerous choices about which of many potential information integration opportunities to pursue. However, they lack guidance in selecting opportunities and preparing for successful implementation. In addition, there are many nontechnical factors that need to be considered for successful implementation of information integration. The tool, developed by an industry research team consisting of 15 members from leading contractors, construction clients, and academia in the U.S., uses 37 benefit driver and 34 implementation hindrance questions that are scored to provide an assessment of a specific integration opportunity. The questions in the tool take market/legal, organizational and process, and people-related issues pertinent to the implementation of information integration into account. The tool has been applied to 16 test cases and is shown to adequately address key benefits and challenges, helping guide implementation choices. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000066.

While several studies have highlighted the relationship between aptitude and employee performance, very few have tested such a relationship using empirical data, especially in the construction domain. Therefore, to address this gap, this study attempts to establish the relationship between construction workers' aptitudes and their productivity. To achieve this aim, first the aptitude of the workers was measured using a general aptitude test battery (GATB). Second, the productivity of the same workers was measured via direct observation at construction sites. Subsequently, by applying various regression models to the data collected on 112 workers, best-fit curves were developed between aptitude and observed productivity. The results revealed that the physical aptitude of the workers impacts performance more than mental aptitude. Moreover, spatial and clerical perception have a negative impact on performance. The study concludes that aptitude is an important performance indicator of any construction worker, and thus, to enhance labor productivity, contractors must ensure the availability of high-aptitude workers on site.

The existent literature has predominantly focused on risk misallocation as the allocation of risk to the inappropriate party. Notwithstanding, risk misallocation includes use of inappropriate mechanisms, incomprehensive allocation and use of inappropriate resources. This paper developed causal networks resulting in risk misallocation. The causal networks are developed from 15 purposive semi-structured interviews from a heterogeneous sample and supplemented sequentially by 198 questionnaire survey responses in the building sector selected randomly from construction clients, contractors and consultants. The causal networks depict how the processes of risk identification, risk analysis, risk control measures and risk allocation could lead to risk misallocations. The findings suggest that the risk control/response stage has potential for various forms of risk misallocation in comparison to any other stage. Networks presented are a basis for improvement in professional practice for construction professionals as they manage risk on various projects.

The effects of delays may include time and cost overruns, litigation and project abandonment. Thus, the global research domain is saturated with studies investigating the causes of construction delay. However, despite the rising trend of construction globalization, a systematic review of what has been achieved so far in construction delay research is lacking. Such a study will synthesize extant data from previous studies to illustrate the global picture and will be of potential benefit to concerned stakeholders. Consequently, this study presents an overall review of studies on the causes of construction delays and executes a meta-data analysis utilizing Relative Importance Index (RII) values from some influential studies in the last 15 years. 36 common delay causes investigated globally were identified, and the effect summaries derived from the meta-analysis showed that the top five causes include: "contractor's financial difficulties", "delay in approval of completed work", "slow delivery of materials", "poor site organization and coordination between various parties", and "poor planning of resources and duration estimation/scheduling".

Beyond the 'iron triangle': Stakeholder perception of key performance indicators (KPIs) for large-scale public sector development projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project performance management; Large construction projects; Key performance indicators (KPIs); Thai construction industry		Performance measurement criteria vary from project to project. Despite much work on the subject, there is no commonly agreed framework of performance measurement on mega projects. To bridge this gap, this research targets to investigate the perception of the key performance indicators (KPIs) in the context of a large construction project in Thailand. The study explores the significance of key performance indicators in perspective of various construction stakeholders (client, consultants, and contractors). Findings indicate that the traditional measures of the iron triangle (on-time, under-budget and according to specifications) are no more applicable to measuring performance on large public sector development projects. Other performance indicators such as safety, efficient use of resources, effectiveness, satisfaction of stakeholders, and reduced conflicts and disputes are increasingly becoming important. This implies that the Thai construction industry is slowly departing from the traditional quantitative performance measurement to a rather mix of both quantitative and qualitative performance measurement on large-scale public sector development projects.

J	Ng, ST; Zhang, YS				Ng, S. Thomas; Zhang, Yanshuai			Optimizing construction time and cost using ant colony optimization approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHMS; TRADEOFF	Time and cost are the most important factors to be considered in every construction project. In order to maximize the return, both the client and contractor would strive to optimize the project duration and cost concurrently. Over the years, many research studies have been conducted to model the time-cost relationships, and the modeling techniques range from the heuristic methods and mathematical approaches to genetic algorithms. Despite that, previous studies often assumed the time being constant leaving the analyses based purely on a single objective-cost. Acknowledging the significance of time-cost optimization, an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm known as ant colony optimization is applied to solve the multiobjective time-cost optimization problems. In this paper, the basic mechanism of the proposed model is unveiled. Having developed a program in the Visual Basic platform, tests are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model against other analytical methods previously used for time-cost modeling. The results show that the ant colony system approach is able to generate better solutions without utilizing much computational resources which provides a useful means to support planners and managers in making better time-cost decisions efficiently.

Lean management model for construction of high-rise apartment buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHANGE ORDERS; PRODUCTIVITY; PRINCIPLE; IMPACT	Execution of the finishing works in high-rise apartment buildings is made complex by the need to customize apartments to the varying requirements and designs of individual clients. The conventional construction planning practice of progressing upward from floor to floor breaks down in the face of the arbitrary sequence in which clients finalize their decisions. The results are long cycle times for delivery of completed apartments and corollary high levels of work in progress, budget and schedule overruns, and general dissatisfaction with the process on the part of the developer, contractor, subcontractors, and the clients. Application of lean construction principles to this problem has led to development of a management model that adopts pull scheduling, reduced batch sizes, and a degree of multiskilling. The main benefits expected are an enhanced ability to provide customized apartments, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle times. The model was first formulated in theory, then tested using a management simulation game and computer simulation, and subsequently, developed for practical application. This paper presents an analysis of conventional practice, the theoretical background to the lean approach, and the specific management changes proposed.

J	Hanna, AS; Gunduz, M				Hanna, AS; Gunduz, M			Impact of change orders on small labor-intensive projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						project management; labor; productivity; construction industry; change orders	CONSTRUCTION; EFFICIENCY	In today's construction, small projects can be just as important if not more important than the larger projects. However, small projects are usually fast track projects, which often involve overlapping design and construction time. Subsequent modifications may be required for the sections that are already under construction. These disruptions to the ongoing project are labeled as change orders. The impact due to changes has been described as the adverse effect upon the unchanged work due to changes in the contract. For this study, 34 projects were selected to develop a statistical model that estimates the amount of labor efficiency lost due to change orders for small projects. The variables in the final model are percent design related changes, percent owner initiated changes, the ratio of actual peak labor to estimated peak labor, the ratio of actual project duration to estimated project duration, and project manager's percent time on the project. The results of this paper are of value to owners, electrical and mechanical contractors, and construction managers. The model quantifies the impact of change orders by introducing the most important variables that bring the largest disruptions.

J	Li, H; Ma, ZL; Shen, QP; Kong, S				Li, H; Ma, ZL; Shen, QP; Kong, S			Virtual experiment of innovative construction operations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						virtual reality; construction planning; experiment		The planning of construction operations is a complicated activity involving abstraction of construction activities from the drawings, choosing of suitable plants and falseworks, allocation of resources on site, planning of safe working place for labourers, and the scheduling of activities sequence. The increasing competition among contractors demands them to adopt innovative construction methods, which have not been used or tested previously. It is not until the beginning of actual construction that the construction planner can realize the validity of his construction operations planning. The lack of tools for the construction planner to evaluate and validate his planning can result in incorrect construction plans, which cause a lot of rework in the construction phase. Virtual Reality (VR) technology, on the other hand, is very likely to provide a solution to the above problem. VR system generates virtual environment containing objects with real world properties and allows user/planner to interact with the objects. This paper proposes an integrated VR system that generates near to reality construction environment for the construction planner to perform construction activities in a real world manner in order to plan, evaluate and validate the construction operations.

J	Wang, CM; Xu, BB; Zhang, SJ; Chen, YQ				Wang, Chun Mei; Xu, Bing Bing; Zhang, Su Juan; Chen, Yong Qiang			Influence of personality and risk propensity on risk perception of Chinese construction project managers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project manager; Big five personality model; Risk propensity; Risk perception	DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH-RISKS; BEHAVIOR; ENTREPRENEURS; DETERMINANTS; CONTRACTORS; OWNERS; DOMAIN; DIMENSIONS; TRAITS	Construction project managers (CPMs) with different types of personalities make various assessments in risky situations and draw up different risk management strategies. This research presents the findings of an empirical study in China that investigated whether and how CPMs with different personality traits differed in the way they perceived project risk. A conceptual model was developed and four hypotheses were proposed concerning the relationships among personality traits, risk propensity, and risk perception using the Big Five personality model. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling analyses of a sample of 152 imply that 1) Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness significantly influence risk propensity; 2) risk propensity negatively affects risk perception; 3) Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness have significant effects on risk perception; and 4) risk propensity fully mediates the relationship between personality traits and risk perception. The results were complemented by qualitative evidence from 5 semi-structured interviews with project managers. This research contributes to a better understanding of how CPMs perceive risk.

J	Osipova, E				Osipova, Ekaterina			Establishing Cooperative Relationships and Joint Risk Management in Construction Projects: Agency Theory Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Joint risk management; Procurement; Project management; Collaboration; Agency theory; Construction	ALLOCATION; TRUST	Through construction contracts, clients and contractors are involved in principal-agent relationships. These relationships are argued to be adversarial and characterised by two main features of contracting parties, as follows: (1) different goals, and (2) different attitudes to risk. Agency-related problems contribute to the project participants concentrating on risks associated with their own parts of projects instead of joint risk management (JRM). Fewer studies have discussed JRM, although risk-sharing is a key issue in principal-agent relationships and agency-related problems must be effectively addressed to establish strong collaboration. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate how project participants address problems associated with principal-agent relationships and thereby enhance cooperative relationships (and JRM). The empirical findings are based on two longitudinal case studies and show that strong collaboration is a multidimensional activity that is crucial for JRM. Effective JRM is highly dependent on strategies for fostering relationships and collaboration (such as cooperative procurement, establishment of common goals, and open communication), and should be implemented together with these strategies.

J	Tennant, S; Fernie, S				Tennant, Stuart; Fernie, Scott			The commercial currency of construction framework agreements	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						collaboration; construction industry; framework agreement; procurement	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; ECONOMICS; COOPERATION; MODELS	A critique is presented of construction client-main contractor framework agreements. In the midst of an unpredictable and volatile construction environment, the commercial currency of collaborative working practice, and by extension framework agreements, is being put under increasing management scrutiny. Drawing on a literature review, the guiding principles of framework agreements are examined. A dramatic downturn in construction demand has created considerable surplus in supply. Under such conditions the buyer-supplier interdependencies become imbalanced and commercial relationships fraught. Reports by construction industry analysts demonstrate a number of private sector clients rejecting framework agreements in favour of traditional competitive procurement practices. Drawing upon a neoclassical lens, three guiding principles embedded within economic orthodoxy are employed to examine business-to-business tensions within construction framework agreements, namely, individualism, instrumentalism and equilibrium. This neoclassical interpretation of construction framework agreements reveals a potential relational management bias within mainstream rhetoric. Notably, providing a complementary account of framework agreements practice should not be construed as a rejection of collaborative working practices. An alternative account of framework agreements is presented that does not rely upon the mainstream behavioural model of contemporary contracting.

The effects are multiplied in terrorism-affected countries (TACs). However, there are limited studies on the time overrun risk factors (TRFs) in highway projects in the TACs. Consequently, this article examined TRFs in highway projects in the FATA region, a severe terrorism-affected province in Pakistan using a questionnaire survey. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) modelling of the TRFs showed that stakeholder interference and insecurity threats is the most critical factor grouping, followed by inexperienced contractors and unproductive workforce, ineffective project planning and contractual arrangement, and construction materials shortages and force majeure. These critical TRFs are important to practitioners and international construction companies because risks abound in highway projects in TACs and require prioritization. Thus, the critical TRFs could be used to develop a decision support system for managing the risks and improving the performance of highway projects in TACs.

Methodology to extract underlying basic assumptions of a public sector construction project culture: an exploratory case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project culture; basic assumptions; exploratory case study; methodologies; sub-cultures; public sector; project team; Sri Lanka	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; PRIVATE-SECTOR; VALUES	Identifying underlying basic assumptions of a construction project team brings insightfulness to cultural studies and is useful for managing project changes. However, methodological issues create barriers to such studies due to difficulties in capturing basic assumptions. This paper adopts an exploratory case study of a public sector building construction project to identify an appropriate methodology for data collection and test the ability to analyse the collected data for the purpose of extracting underlying basic assumptions of a construction project culture. Data were collected using interviews and observations, and analysed by code-based content analysis. Research findings confirm the suitability of questioning on internal integration and external adaptation problems of the construction project team to extract basic assumptions while highlighting the necessity of questioning on conflicting and critical situations of the project. Accordingly, several basic assumptions for client and consultant sub-cultural groups were identified. The methodology proposed in this study can be extended to explore basic assumptions of contractor sub-cultural group and then of the whole project.	[Samaraweera, Aparna; Sandanayake, Y.

However, as social consciousness and personal welfare demands increase, social conflicts among external stakeholders, such as local residents, local and central governments, and NGOs, have become more critical factors in enhancing project viability. In Korea, these conflicts have an impact of US $70 billion annually on social costs. To alleviate social conflicts and costs, this study aims to propose a conflict management framework based on twenty-two representative public construction projects. This study identifies and frames the various causes, impacts, and resolutions of conflicts through the case history of project viability. Through these findings, five types of conflict scenarios were derived: project termination, early mitigation, late mitigation, project enforcement, and late occurrence. Furthermore, this study suggests root causes, pathway of conflict propagation, and characteristics of each conflict scenario, which will assist project stakeholders in developing sustainable management for conflict solutions in line with each project's unique situation.

However, its development has faced new challenges since there has been lack of explicitly unanimous definition for the capability dimensions of precise and accurate project management, as well as the models and their process control parameters. The required core capabilities based on the precise and accurate project management for various rings are involved in the project life cycle, namely, the required internationally core competences and their components for the phases of project strategic planning and decision making in the early project phase, as well as the value engineering, and the project supervision and controls during the execution phase. Through studying the effects of the internationally core competences based on precise and accurate project management capabilities for the success and excellence of projects and configuring such models, the goal is to help the main contractors continuously obtain project success and excellence, thus improve its internationally core competences with continuous project success and excellence.

J	Lu, P; Qian, LM; Chu, ZF; Xu, XY				Lu, Ping; Qian, Lamei; Chu, Zhaofang; Xu, Xiaoyan			Role of Opportunism and Trust in Construction Projects: Empirical Evidence from China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Opportunism; Trust; Project success; External uncertainty; Complexity	INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS; MANAGEMENT; MARKET; PERFORMANCE; COMPLEXITY; MECHANISM; FRAMEWORK; RISK	Project success is the ultimate goal for all projects, and doubts often arise about what actually determines project success. On the basis of the transaction cost exchange (TCE) and relational exchange theory (RET), this study proposes that opportunism and trust coexist and work together to affect project success. External uncertainty, complexity, and cooperation duration are the variables that are considered in the specific construction context. Using primary data collected from 225 owners, contractors, designers, and supervisors in China's construction industry, the empirical analysis shows that the negative opportunism and the positive trust counteract each other and affect the project success. Their relationships are influenced by the level of external uncertainty, but not by the level of complexity. In particular, the results also demonstrate that opportunism affects project performance through a mediating process, and the effects of opportunism and trust differ under varying cooperation durations. Based on a more comprehensive model, this study empirically addresses the importance of the two mechanisms of restraining opportunism and developing trust in the construction industry.

Improving Hot Mix Asphalt Production Using Computer Simulation and Real Time Optimization	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hot mix asphalt; Quality control; Simulation; Real time optimization; Aggregate gradation	QUALITY-ASSURANCE; CONTRACTOR	The quality of hot mix asphalt is affected by the quality and consistency of input aggregates and the control of the production process. To improve the quality of hot mix asphalt, both the aggregates gradation and the process variables must be considered. Current practice involves taking samples from actual production and analyzing them in the lab. The entire process can take two hours, which, along with being expensive, is not amenable to real time online process control or even in knowing how much product is actually out of specification. In this paper, an online control system is proposed that can be used to significantly decrease the analysis time and adjust production by using discrete time stochastic simulation combined with algorithmic optimization. Additionally, the system can readily show when a mix is out of specification without lag time or physical experimentation. Results show that this approach can effectively control the production process resulting in improved quality. This is the first known such application in hot mix asphalt online process control.

The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) has limited experience with the procedure, but they are planning to use it in several future projects. Limited research was found concerning the practical issues of CD. This paper explores the experiences of Norwegian practitioners to identify such issues and suggests measures for the success of future projects using the procedure. In addition to a literature study, a document study and 22 semistructured in-depth interviews with key informants from six cases selected from the Norwegian public infrastructure projects were carried out. Both the client and the suppliers value the potential of CD. However, several challenges were identified, such as lack of practical experience with CD, ethical challenges, determining the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) criteria, evaluation based on the MEAT criteria, and varying market interest. This paper contributes to construction engineering and management practice to increase the understanding of CD by suggesting what kinds of measures ought to be taken for the success of future projects using the procedure.

Moreover, ensuring the availability of cash throughout the multiple projects' execution period increases the scheduling complexity. Accordingly, this paper presents the development of an automated system that optimizes the scheduling of multiple construction projects with respect to multiple objectives considering both financial and resource aspects under a single platform. The automated system is named Multi-Objective SCheduling OPtimization using Evolutionary Algorithm (MOSCOPEA). The system aims to help contractors in devising schedules that obtain optimal tradeoffs between different projects' objectives, namely: duration of multiple projects, total cost, financing cost, maximum required credit, profit, and resource fluctuations and peak demand. Moreover, it offers the flexibility in selecting the desired set of objectives to be optimized together. Finally, the developed system is tested and implemented using different case studies of different project sizes obtained from literature to demonstrate its capabilities in scheduling optimization.

Mark			Improved Baseline Method to Calculate Lost Construction Productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Claims; Productivity; Project management; Quantitative analysis; Quantitative methods		The measured mile/baseline method has been widely accepted to quantify labor productivity loss, which is demonstrated by comparing the impacted and unimpacted/lightly impacted portions of the work. Although the distinctions between these portions of a project can at times be identified through a cause and effect analysis, on many projects this distinction is not readily observable. For those projects, researchers and professionals have developed various procedures to implement the measured mile/baseline calculations, but shortcomings in those procedures can result in the failure to objectively identify the baseline. In this paper, a method based on basic statistical techniques is proposed to determine a baseline that represents the contractor's normal operating performance, thus overcoming many of weaknesses in the existing methods. This paper will provide construction professionals and engineers with an objective approach to determine the productivity baseline, thus aiding in the resolution of labor productivity loss claims. Further, this new method avoids the arbitrary baseline sample size and the possibility of multiple competing solutions in existing methods. A numerical example is included to compare the results using different methods and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The use of information technology (IT) has effectively promoted integration of fragmented information under the scattered construction environment. However, to date, many Internet-based systems for online project collaboration do not sufficiently provide standard formats for transmitting contractual documents and project-related information due to the data compatibility issue. As an alternative, this paper introduces a concept of virtual organization and then examines a CITIS (Contractor Integrated Technical Information Service) system for public construction projects developed in Korea from the viewpoint of a virtual organization concept. The CITIS system suggested here has been applied to local branches of the Korea MOCT (Ministry of Construction and Transportation) and is currently in use. Field evaluation has found that the Korean construction CITIS still lacks collaborative workspace despite its good results on field tests. Finally, the lessons learned from field evaluation are provided to advance the current CITIS toward fully integrated collaborative virtual organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The residence comprises of 108 precast concrete panels of varying rectangular shapes with "dog legs" and window and door "cutouts" that look like an assembled jigsaw puzzle. The erection and installation procedure called for a maximum panel-to-panel joint tolerance of 1.27 cut (0.5 in.), often in 90 degrees joints between panels. 3D animations were used to experiment with the construction process on the computer screen prior to construction in order to avoid potential costly on-site errors. In addition, the 3D animations were also used as a training tool for the contractors. This paper focuses on describing the methodology used to integrate a crane selection algorithm and optimization model with 3D modeling and animation for the selection, utilization, and location of cranes on construction sites. Analytical optimization processes were used to decrease the traveling time and distance of the selected crane, to improve the crane lifting sequence and to minimize the use of panel casting slabs.

Suppose a new technology will be available in the future, but the timing is uncertain. We propose specifying one or multiple time points in a maintenance contract, at which the manufacturer can adopt (switch to) the new technology, if it becomes available, and change the preventive maintenance schedule for the remaining time in the contract period. A model is developed to determine the value of using these (switch) points in a maintenance contract to the manufacturer. The numerical results show that, with a higher arrival rate of the new technology, the value becomes greater, and thus, the optimal switch point should be set earlier. Furthermore, if the new technology reduces maintenance costs, using switch points adds more value to a cost-plus-margin method than either the fixed payment or cost-plus-fixed-fee methods. On the other hand, if adopting the new technology results in higher maintenance costs, the value using switch points is higher for the fixed payment method.

J	Nassar, KM; Gunnarsson, HG; Hegab, MY				Nassar, KM; Gunnarsson, HG; Hegab, MY			Using Weibull analysis for evaluation of cost and schedule performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Large amounts of money are lost each year in the construction industry because of poor schedule and cost control. Few contractors specify and follow systematic schedule monitoring practices. Traditionally, the earned value method (EVM) is used to control and monitor schedule performance using the schedule and cost performance indices which compare the budgeted cost of work performed to what was originally scheduled or what is actually expended. This paper presents a statistical approach, namely Weibull analysis, to evaluate stochastically the schedule performance of construction or design projects. The approach can be used in conjunction with the EVM to enhance the evaluation and control of schedule performance. Weibull analysis is a common method for failure analysis and reliability engineering used in a wide range of applications. In this paper, the applicability of Weibull analysis for evaluating and comparing the reliability of the schedule performance of multiple projects is presented. The various steps in the analysis are discussed along with an example in which two projects are analyzed and compared. The authors conclude that Weibull analysis has several advantages and provides a relatively robust and effective method for construction managers to better control and monitor their projects.

Visualizing Evolution of Knowledge Management Capability in Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dynamic capabilities; Learning mechanisms; Knowledge management; Performance evaluation; System dynamics modeling	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; MICROFOUNDATIONS; GOVERNANCE; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; FORM	A firm, as a dynamic, evolving, and quasi-autonomous system of knowledge production and application, develops knowledge management capability (KMC) through strategic learning to sustain competitive advantages in a dynamic environment. Knowledge governance mechanisms and knowledge processes connect and interact with each other, thereby forming learning mechanisms that execute double-loop learning. This in turn drives the genesis and evolution of KMC to modify operating routines that contribute to the desired performance. This paper reports a study that was performed within a context of construction contractors, a type of project-based firm, which operates within the dynamic Hong Kong construction market. The writers used a multiple-case design to incorporate evidence from the literature and interviews, with the help of system dynamics modeling, to visualize the evolution of KMC. The writers' paper demonstrates the feasibility of visualizing how a firm's KMC correlates with its operating environment over time. The findings imply that knowledge management (KM) applications can be better planned and controlled through evaluation of KM performance over time from a capability perspective.

The research team used an action learning approach to work with managers from construction companies and housing associations to design and deliver support mechanisms, such as industry workshops, specific to the needs of SMEs. Analysis of the results showed how, as a result of interacting with other groups within a non-adversarial environment and benefiting from the process, partnering and performance improvement came to be seen as both desirable and possible. The trust and confidence generated from working together successfully also led construction SMEs to share good practice with others from the industry, including local competitors. The authors propose that SMEs should be treated as 'leaders' and 'full partners' within the programme for UK industry improvement being championed by Sir John Egan (1998), rather than simply recipients. It is also suggested that governments provide further support to ensure participation from small and micro firms.

J	Loosemore, M; Richard, J				Loosemore, Martin; Richard, Justin			Valuing innovation in construction and infrastructure Getting clients past a lowest price mentality	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Innovation; Construction; Performance; Collaboration; Bidding		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to continue the discussion about the actual and potential role of clients in driving more innovation in the construction sector through interviews with some of the Australian construction industry's leading clients, contractors and consultants. Design/methodology/approach - This paper synthesises previously disconnected literature reports interviews with 46 of Australia's leading clients, contractors and consultants. Findings - The findings confirm the importance of client leadership, yet also shows that lowest price remains the dominant selection criterion in tenders. Many clients lack the insight and tools to play a leadership role and are unwilling and unable to employ strategies to foster better performance and more innovation because of internal governance constraints, a poor understanding of how built assets contribute to core business objectives and a narrow understanding of their central role in driving innovation. The authors conclude that in reality, the potential for investment in innovation is restricted to the relatively few large companies who are lucky enough to deal with sophisticated clients which procure buildings on a frequent basis. The vast majority of the industry are left to work with clients who procure buildings very rarely, who want the lowest possible price for their investment and who do not see them as a key long-term asset in the success of their core business. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on 46 interviews. It represents and external perspective on client leadership. Further research is needed with clients to validate the results and provide a counterpoint. Practical implications - The practical implications of this research are that clients need to be more wary of equating low price with good value. While the merits of competition are widely lauded, the research shows that clients can extract more value from the construction industry by an integrated project strategy that does not lock-in solutions too early, that provides scope and time for innovation to happen, which encourages collaboration, early involvement and which distributes risk and opportunity fairly and openly. According to the research, many clients are unwilling and unable to do this because of internal governance constraints, a lack of tools to value innovation in bids, a poor understanding of how built assets contribute to core business objectives and a narrow understanding of their central role in driving innovation. Social implications - Given the planned infrastructure programme in Australia and many other countries, the potential productivity and efficiency benefits to be derived from this research are significant. These saved resources would then be available for further investments in social and economic infrastructure. Originality/value - This paper's originality lied in the synthesis of previously disconnected literature on construction innovation, efficiency and productivity.

J	Zhang, JM; Wang, T; Zhang, LM				Zhang, Jiaming; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Limao			Legal Risk Assessment Framework for International PPP Projects Based on Metanetwork	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International projects; Public-private partnership (PPP); Legal risk assessment; metanetwork	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP; ANALYTIC NETWORK PROCESS; INVESTMENT; ALLOCATION; CLAIMS; PRIORITIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGY; CHINESE	The number of international public-private partnership (PPP) projects has gradually increased with global infrastructure interconnections. These international projects incorporate high risks, and legal risk is one of the most serious risks. International PPP projects have long life cycles, and the specific legal risks in each stage may be different and related to each other. However, previous risk assessment methods have ignored the correlation and variation of legal risk factors in different stages, which have limited applications in risk management practice. Therefore, this paper establishes a legal risk analysis framework for international PPP projects based on metanetwork analysis (MNA) to evaluate the legal risks of the entire project life cycle in stages and calculate the correlations between different risk factors. Then the framework was applied to a Peruvian international PPP project. The key legal risk factors in each stage were identified, the main risk-spreading paths were depicted, and the influence and independence of risk factors were calculated. This framework is expected to provide guidance for foreign private contractors of international PPP projects to conduct fine management of legal risks.

The reason is the separation between contractors and laborers caused by the main labor resource utilization method, namely, labor subcontracting rather than direct recruitment. Service-oriented concept and technology are introduced by multiple industries for the management and optimal allocation of distributed resources, and have the potential to solve the problem of labor resource availability faced by China's construction industry. However, insufficient conceptual understanding impedes implementation. Accordingly, this research extends the service-oriented concept to construction labor and proposes a conceptual framework for explanation, thereby contributing to the body of knowledge. In this framework, a service-oriented labor resource management model called labor-as-a-service is covered and described from three aspects: organizational relationship, managerial process, and technical framework. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis is conducted to preliminarily investigate the potential of the proposed framework. Results show that the conceptual framework suits China's conditions and has the potential to improve labor resource management.

Aggregation-Based Framework for Construction Risk Assessment with Heterogeneous Groups of Experts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Risk management; Fuzzy sets; Decision making; Heterogeneity	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING; FUZZY; PROJECTS; SYSTEM; MODEL; CONTRACTORS; ADVANTAGES; OPERATORS; EXTENSION	Construction companies continuously seek to improve risk analysis techniques to determine the contingency of projects. Construction risk assessment relies on a group decision-making (GDM) process, in which a heterogeneous group of experts provides their opinions to determine the probabilities and impacts of project risks. In this paper, risk probabilities and impacts are expressed as linguistic terms, which are then represented by fuzzy sets to account for the uncertainty in these assessments. Current GDM processes help experts to obtain collective agreement through the use of a consensus-reaching process, which has several limitations, such as being a time-consuming procedure. The main contributions of this paper are to introduce a list of criteria and a set of metrics to evaluate risk-assessment expertise. Additionally, this paper discusses the development of a method for weighting the importance of experts' opinions according to their expertise levels.

J	Dzeng, RJ; Wang, PR				Dzeng, Ren-Jye; Wang, Pei-Ru			C-Negotiation Game: An educational game model for construction procurement and negotiation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Educational game; Construction procurement; Learning effect; Quantitative analysis	INSTRUCTIONAL SIMULATION GAME; COMPUTER GAMES; MOTIVATION; IMPACT; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; SKILLS	Construction procurement and negotiation is one of the key subjects in construction management education. However, most related courses involve only lectures without engaging students in real cases. Although educational games have been reported to be effective in motivating students' learning, a limited number of studies have focused on developing a realistic negotiation game as a teaching instrument in a class. We developed a web-based negotiation game, named C-Negotiation Game, for enabling students to make simulated decisions in construction procurement and negotiation processes. The game enables students to play the role of either contractor or supplier, schedule the required procurement, evaluate prospective negotiating parties, conduct parallel negotiations, allocate materials to projects, and manage the cash flow. The game is also equipped with randomization features such as assigning random quality performance levels to different suppliers. An experiment was conducted using 72 participating students, and the results indicated a significant improvement of at least 20.16% in the students' posttest scores regardless of the pretest scores.

Praxis of Rework Mitigation in Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Australia; Rework; Infrastructure; Learning; Leadership; Empowerment; Engagement	AUTHENTIC LEADERSHIP; IMPACT; COSTS	Rework is a pervasive problem within the construction industry, but many firms are reluctant to openly acknowledge it is an issue because it can potentially damage their reputations. Using a case study approach, this paper aims to examine how an AU$375million program alliance, which experienced cost and schedule overruns and an increase in safety incidents as a result of rework, addressed this problem. The case analysis revealed that rework could be significantly reduced by having an authentic leadership style in place, empowering as well as actively engaging with contractors, and focusing on continuous improvement. As a result, the alliance was able go beyond lessons that were superficial (i.e.,identifying procedures that were not followed) and undertake new and improved ways of doing business that encompassed context-specific learning. The novelty of the case study findings highlights the need to reduce rework by focusing greater attention on changing behaviors, particularly the motivations of alliance team members, by cultivating an error management culture. Such a culture needs to be harnessed in construction projects if rework is to be reduced and adopted industrywide, which necessitates the need for significant steps toward improving performance and productivity.

The PQR gives a specific score for each construction project based on a set of key variables affecting project performance and outcome. The importance of the PQR is found in its ability to quantitatively assess overall performance from the contractor's perspective, taking into account key performance areas, which include customer satisfaction, schedule, cost, profit, and communication. A practical application comparing the performance of several recently completed projects is also presented in this paper to illustrate the new model. This application shows one of many possibilities for how PQR can be used to solve industry problems and to fill an existing gap in the literature. This research offers a contribution to the construction engineering and management literature and to the architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) industry. It is the creation of a unified project performance metric for a practical comparison of overall performance for any construction project.

This perspective is used to examine the diffusion of lean construction. In recent years lean construction has grown in prominence to become one of the primary performative improvement recipes for the construction sector. However, rather than providing a stable strategy around which more collaborative, intelligent and efficient project-based organizations develop, this research reveals how the lean concept transforms during its journey with unintended organizational consequences. An ethnographic case study, informed by SaP, demonstrates how a lean strategy and its effects on organizational practice and culture cannot be understood separately from material and embodied practices and power effects. As well as contributing to the examination of lean construction practice, the findings show how strategy is enacted within construction organizations and the ensuing effects of social power. A new trajectory is opened for research into strategizing within construction organizations, which provides ways to explore actual practices and spaces where strategizing occurs.

In the United States, ASCE assigned a near failing grade of D- to the condition of water system infrastructure. Therefore. municipalities face a great challenge of managing the expected large replacement and new installation projects of water mains. This research aims at designing a robust model ill order to assess the condition and predict the performance of water mains. Data are collected from three different Canadian municipalities: (1) Moncton (New Brunswick): (2) London (Ontario) and (3) Longueiul (Quebec). An integrated model and framework, using all analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and artificial neural network (ANN), are developed. Ill addition. all automated, User-friendly, web-based infrastructure management tool (CR-Predictor) is developed based oil the integrated AHP/ANN model to assess water main condition. The developed tool and models are validated in which the), show robust results (98.51%)-the average validity percent. They are expected to benefit academics and practitioners (Municipal engineers, Consultants, and contractors) to prioritize inspection and rehabilitation planning for existing water mains.

J	El Wardani, MA; Messner, JI; Horman, MJ				El Wardani, MA; Messner, JI; Horman, MJ			Comparing procurement methods for design-build projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						delivery; design/build; construction industry; procurement	PERFORMANCE; SELECTION	The design-build delivery method is increasingly used in the United States due to numerous advantages it can offer a project. An important issue associated with design-build delivery is the procurement method used to select the design-build team. It is a critical decision that involves several key project team members, including the owner, designer, and contractor organizations, and requires the owner to carefully choose the design-build procurement method that will be used to select the team that will deliver the project. This research quantitatively analyzed the correlation between the design-build procurement method and the performance of the design-build project with regard to cost, time, and quality metrics. The procurement methods studied were sole source, qualifications-based, best value, and low bid selection. Data were collected through surveys from 76 design-build projects in the United States. Based on the patterns and relationships identified from these data, a better understanding of the procurement process and how it influences project performance is achieved. The impact of project-specific factors and guidelines are presented to assist owners in selecting the design-build team procurement method that responds to their project goals.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Relational selection for collaborative working arrangements	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PRINCIPLES; CONTRACTS; SUCCESS	Procurement arrangements for collaborative working arrangements (CWAs) should arguably provide suitable protocols under which different project partners can interact effectively and maintain harmonious relationships and mobilize their collective efforts towards common project objectives. Technical abilities of different project partners for carrying out the works are important. Also critical are their "soft" or "relational" qualities to work jointly and synergistically in the project team. The aims of the reported study are to examine the importance of a single set of different factors for selecting consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and clients for CWAs; and to assess the relative importance of various factors and strategies for building CWAs. Data were collected internationally from 17 countries through a questionnaire survey and statistical analyses were conducted. Results attribute varying degrees of importance to various factors for selecting different project partners and suggest an interrelated and consolidated selection approach in general, except for "selecting" clients. The study confirms that trust and business ethics related factors and strategies are more helpful for CWAs than some others. Outcomes of this study are expected to benefit both industry practitioners and researchers, in exploring, designing, and implementing suitable CWAs and selecting appropriate project partners.

J	Damci, A				Damci, Atilla			Impact of Personal Demographics on Civil Engineers' Motivators: Case Study of Turkey	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Motivation; Demographics; Civil engineer	JOB-SATISFACTION; ARCHITECTS; MANAGERS; SECTOR	A civil engineer who lacks motivation, may perform poorly in making decisions, which may in turn negatively affect the performance of a construction project. This study extends knowledge about individual-level motivation among civil engineers and the relationship between the motivation of civil engineers and their demographics (i.e.,age, marital status, education, work experience, type of company, project value). A questionnaire survey was administered to Turkish civil engineers in order to collect data on their personal demographics and their perceptions of the importance of different motivators. The case of Turkey is investigated because a large number of Turkish contractors are major players in international markets. This paper argues that there are statistically significant differences in the perception of some motivators by civil engineers based on their demographics and that different individuals need to be motivated by different motivators. The study demonstrates the existence of a relationship between demographics and motivators, an area that is mostly ignored in the motivation literature. Higher executives in the construction industry, who understand this relationship, may be able to motivate their engineers individually rather than using blanket motivators for all engineers.

J	Gunhan, S; Arditi, D				Gunhan, S; Arditi, D			Factors affecting international construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A construction company's decision to expand into international markets must be based on a good understanding of the opportunities and threats associated with international business, as well as the development of company strengths relative to international activities. These factors were evaluated in this Study by surveying the executives in charge of international construction of large United States based contractors. The information was collected by means of two rounds of a Delphi survey, the results of which were used as input in an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The findings indicate that track record, specialist expertise, project management capability are the most important company strengths; loss of key personnel, shortage of financial resources, and inflation and currency fluctuations are the most important threats relative to international markets; and increased long term profitability, the ability to maintain shareholders' returns, and the globalization and openness of the markets are the most important opportunities available in international works. This study is of relevance to practitioners as it systematically highlights the factors that affect international construction for the benefit of executives of medium-to-large size construction companies who are considering expanding into overseas markets. It is of relevance to researchers too as it demonstrates the successful use of the combined Delphi and AHP.

J	Ahmed, A; Mohammed, HA; Gambatese, J; Hurwitz, D				Ahmed, Ananna; Mohammed, Hameed A.; Gambatese, John; Hurwitz, David			Effects of Flashing Blue Lights Mounted on Paving Equipment on Vehicle Speed Behavior in Work Zones	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flashing blue lights; Mobile work zone; Speed reduction; Paving; Freeways		Vehicle speed in work zones is a significant concern to state transportation agencies and their construction partners. Prior research indicates that law enforcement vehicles within a work zone with active flashing lights result in reduced vehicle speeds. Placement of flashing blue lights on construction equipment during nighttime construction work has also been identified as a potential control measure to reduce speeds. The goal of this research study is to determine the impact of flashing blue lights on construction equipment on the speed of passing vehicles in mobile work zones. The research design consisted of a controlled experiment involving flashing blue lights mounted on the rear of a paver during mainline paving operations on three case study projects on high speed roadways at night in Oregon. Vehicle speed data were collected during multiple work shifts for each case study, both with and without the flashing blue lights on. The experimental results reveal that vehicle speed is affected by the presence of flashing blue lights during nighttime work. With the blue lights flashing and at distances upstream of the paver where the driver can see and react to the blue lights, mean vehicle speeds tended to be 4.3-25.7 km/h slower than when the blue lights were off. Closer to, immediately adjacent to, and downstream of the paver, the difference in the mean speed with the blue lights on was typically less or not significant; in some cases and mostly downstream of the paver location, the mean speeds were higher with the blue lights on than with the blue lights off. The speed differential (i.e., the speed prior to the work zone minus the speed in the work zone) was measured as 4.8-11.3 km/h greater with the blue lights turned on than with the blue lights off. The results support construction contractors and state departments of transportation for decision making about the use of flashing blue lights on equipment in work zones. The researchers recommend using flashing blue lights on paving equipment during nighttime operations if allowed by local laws to reduce the speed in the work zone and increase worker and driver safety. This research contributes to the construction industry by providing quantitative evidence of the extent to which flashing blue lights mounted on paving equipment impact vehicle speeds in work zones.

J	Fan, SL				Fan, Su-Ling			Soft logic delay analysis technique	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Soft-logic; Delay claims; Extension of time (EOT)	REPETITIVE PROJECTS; MODEL	Current delay analysis techniques assume that there is only one logical sequence of activities in a project. However, in a real construction project, the relationship of activities can be demonstrated by both fixed and soft logic. Fixed logic requires activities to be executed in a specific order, whereas soft logic allows activities to be executed in various orders. Due to the existence of soft logic and the contractor's obligation to mitigate delays, it is necessary to update the logic to calculate Extension of Time (EOT). However, when soft logic is present in a schedule, manual updates are time-consuming and error-prone. To facilitate soft logic updates, several models have been proposed, however, these methods only update soft-logics within activities of the same work item, rather than project-wide. To overcome the limitations of the previous research, this paper proposes an algorithm to update schedules according to delay events project-wise. Furthermore, the proposed model has been verified using practical cases, demonstrating a successful way of applying this model to update schedules based on delay events, allowing EOT to be calculated automatically as well as more accurately and reasonably.

The research objectives were to identify the factors on construction projects that impact such trust and to identify how trust affects factors on construction project. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of construction professionals working for the Engineering News Record's Top 400 US contractors was conducted. Findings - The findings showed that paying on time, competency, reliability and effective collaboration were the most important factors that affected contextual conditions trustworthiness. Factors perceived to strengthen trust included face-to-face communication, electronic documents, and timely and adequate responses to requests for information. The presence of construction managers on construction projects, and corrective changes orders from neutral third parties were perceived to weaken trust. Trust was perceived to assist leadership, team building, communication and information sharing. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the discovery of additional factors that impact trust and factors that require trust and that were not identified by previous researchers.

Effects of Contract Strategy on Interpersonal Relations and Project Outcomes of Public-Sector Construction Contracts in Australia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contracts; Construction management; Australia; Relational contracting; Public construction projects; Relationship; Strategy; Sydney; Australia	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; DELIVERY; FORMS; TRUST	Hitherto, it is not known if the integration of relationship concepts into traditional public-sector construction contracts would improve project performance. This study hence examines the effects of contract strategies on project outcomes and relationship quality in the context of public-sector construction projects in Sydney, Australia. It also identifies the relational contracting (RC) practices that are in place when certain contract strategies are adopted. Using a two-pronged research design, data were first collected from public owners and private contractors and consultants through a questionnaire survey. The data were analyzed and the results were then validated by interviews. Correlation analysis shows that cost performance, client satisfaction, and relationship quality among contracting parties are significantly correlated with contract strategies. The findings indicate the important role that contract strategies play in project outcomes and interpersonal relationship. Among the 20 RC practices that are significantly correlated with contract strategies, 16 of them are related to clients and consultants, suggesting their important role in setting the tone of the relationship in a project.

In order to maximize the profit, both the client and contractor would strive to minimize the project duration and cost concurrently. In the past, most of the research studies related to construction time and cost assumed time to be constant, leaving the analyses based purely on a single objective of cost. Acknowledging this limitation, an evolutionary-based optimization algorithm known as an ant colony system is applied in this study to solve the multi-objective time-cost optimization problems. In this paper, a model is developed using Visual Basic for Application (TM) which is integrated with Microsoft Project (TM). Through a test study, the performance of the proposed model is compared against other analytical methods previously used for time-cost modeling. The results show that the model based on the ant colony system techniques can generate better solutions without utilizing excessive computational resources. The model, therefore, provides an efficient means to support planners and managers in making better time-cost decisions efficiently.	[Ng, S.

The assumption that an industry familiar adjudicator will provide a reliable and consistent decision in comparison with the expectation of the industry as a whole has not been tested. This paper presents the results of a study on the reliability and consistency of construction arbitration through the examination of a variety of arbitrators' decisions on the same construction dispute scenario. Data was collected from attorneys, owners, owner representatives, contractors, and subcontractors. Compilation of the survey results finds little consistency in the arbitrator's awards, but with much thoughtful care in award consideration. The results suggest that the arbitrator's industry background does not influence the arbitrator's award. There is also no significant award bias due to the arbitrator's education level or years spent in construction business. The results also indicate that previous arbitration experience does not predict the award outcome. This paper concludes that construction arbitration is wholly unpredictable. However, the result will be a well-reasoned and unbiased decision.

This guidance, however, neglects delivery approaches such as design-build (D-B). This research examines 305 D-B highway projects procured using best-value and identifies the underlying reasons for bid dispersion and cost estimates inaccuracies. This study found an average bid dispersion of 27%, suggesting that a larger threshold (i.e., 25%) is needed to account for the inherent variability of D-B projects. This study also found that engineering estimates are on average 2% more than the awarded price. This result contradicts findings in existing literature and suggests that current practice in D-B best-value may be more conservative than other procurement methods. The study explores four potential reasons for bid dispersion and engineering estimate inaccuracies and suggests strategies for improvement. By providing a better understanding of bid dispersion and engineering estimate accuracy, this study will ultimately assist in the development of new policies and processes for D-B best-value projects.

J	Papajohn, D; El Asmar, M				Papajohn, Dean; El Asmar, Mounir			Impact of Alternative Delivery on the Response Time of Requests for Information for Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROGRAM-EVALUATION; SIMULATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM	Requests for information (RFIs) are a critical communication tool on construction projects. Preparing RFIs and responding to RFIs takes time and money. Unresolved RFIs or slow responses to RFIs may cause delays. The objective of this research is to determine the impact of project delivery methods such as design-bid-build (DBB), construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC), and design-build (DB) on RFI response time. Stochastic simulation with Monte Carlo random sampling was used to model the RFI process. Probability distributions for RFI process steps were developed based on more than 2,000 RFIs across 17 DB, CM/GC, and DBB highway projects. Results indicate a larger number of RFIs for DB projects than for DBB and CM/GC projects, as well as more late RFI responses in DB projects. This suggests that DB projects are more sensitive to the RFI review process and require dedicated attention and resources from the project team to manage the RFI process to prevent delays. Successful RFI practices obtained from practitioners are described to assist with managing the RFI process. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

An analytical case study research strategy has been implemented in collecting data for the construction projects. The data collected has been tested against recognised models. Statistical analyses have been carried out on the data for the specified variables, culminating in the potential proposal of an improved model with respect to these identified variables. The results revealed that the independent variables (type of construction, procurement route and type of work) affect the cash flow forecast. The findings suggested that a model could be more accurate with the input of more job-specific variables and that Hudson's DHSS model is best suited to a construction project procured traditionally. Adopting the 'trial and error' approach, Hudson's DHSS model has been recognised as an accurate model that could be adapted slightly, through changing the parameter values. The clients and the contractors are the main beneficiaries approached for this study.

LEAPCON: Simulation of lean construction of high-rise apartment buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHANGE ORDERS; IMPACT; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEM; MODEL	A lean model has been proposed for the construction management of high-rise apartment buildings with customized apartment designs. It incorporates a number of changes to traditional management practice, including single-piece flow with pull scheduling, work restructuring, and multiskilling. A simulated construction process scenario was devised for experimental evaluation of the model. The simulation was first implemented as a live management game, in which participants played the roles of the clients, general contractor, and subcontractors. Eleven runs with different teams indicated that the lean model increased throughput, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle time. However, the limitations of the live simulation led the writers to implement a discrete event computer simulation of the same process. The computer simulation reinforced the findings of the live simulation and emphasized the specific beneficial effect of single-piece flow under pull scheduling. The lean model may be of immediate interest to construction planners and managers because it enables full customization with minimal waste and no additional resources. The demonstrative clarity of the lean model simulation, both live and computerized, makes it a powerful tool for education and research.

Participants were seven each of Contractors and Consultants using data saturation to limit the number, through purposive sampling technique. Data were analyzed using content analysis technique. The most critical impacts of accidents and hazards on the GCI were identified as slow-down of work, increase in cost of project and poor performance of work. The findings of the study provide knowledge on impacts of accidents and hazards to stakeholders of the GCI and the government in general. Serious steps should be taken by stakeholders to enforce construction health and safety (CHS) practices on construction sites to reduce the high frequency rate of accidents and injuries and the high incidence rate in the GCI. The courts should be encouraged to impose fair and adequate compensation on employers and occasionally punitive or exemplary damages to deter and prevent occurrence of accidents and hazards at construction sites. CHS-related issues have to be given the needed research and academic attention in order to reduce accidents and hazards on sites.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has encouraged agencies to consider alternative contracting methods (ACMs) like design-build (DB) and construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC). There is a lack of information available to transportation agencies regarding the details of agency-performed contract administration functions between ACMs and traditional design-bid-build (DBB) delivery. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge of highway contract administration by revealing similarities and differences between agency-performed contract administration functions across contracting methods through the development of integrated definition function models (IDEF0). These IDEF0 models depict the hierarchy of contract administration functions for DBB, CM/GC, and DB highway projects and reveal differences such as developing alignment, administering preconstruction services, managing work packages, and creating risk pools for additional scope. The findings can help agencies make more informed decisions about selecting and administering contracting methods, especially as they relate to establishing the level of effort and skills needed for administering projects under various contracting methods. In addition, these IDEF0 models provide a novel framework for future research on highway contract administration. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Understanding the Interplay of Organizational Climate and Leadership in Construction Innovation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Innovation; Leadership; Innovation climate; Learning transfer climate	TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; ORIENTATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ANTECEDENTS; COMPETENCE; CREATIVITY	Innovation can create value for an organization and its stakeholders. In developing an innovation blueprint in complex contexts, such as construction, previous studies have alleged that transformational leadership is an important determinant of innovation. This study aims to investigate the role of innovation climate and learning transfer climate on the relationships between leadership and innovation in the construction sector. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 158 returns from 500 respondents (client developers, construction consultants, and contractors in China). The findings reveal that (1) support for innovation (innovation climate factor) moderates the effects of intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration (transformational leadership factor), and contingent rewards (transactional leadership factor) on innovation, and (2) performance self-efficacy (learning transfer climate factor) moderates the effects of intellectual stimulation (transformational leadership factor) and contingent rewards (transactional leadership factor) on innovation. This study reveals the intertwining relationships between leadership, climates, and innovation and lays a platform for further longitudinal, qualitative studies. Managerial implications are discussed; different leadership and management climates need to be strategically adopted and nurtured in dynamic organizational environments.

It has been well received by construction professionals for its guidance in solving delay and disruption issues. This research attempts (1)to compare the Protocol's core features with the existing references for the contracting parties and (2)to determine the feasible use of the Protocol's distinguished features into the Malaysian construction industry as a case study. The distinguishing features were identified after reviewing and comparing the local contract forms and the Protocol. Subsequently, the questionnaire survey was carried out with local developers, contractors, and consultants based on an inductive reasoning approach. Statistical and variance analyses were conducted to determine the acceptance level of the Protocol's features. The results show that most of the features were agreed to by the respondents; for instance, the guidelines on float identification, concurrency identification, proper procedures on work program, and so on. The findings render useful information for future contract drafting by incorporating the guidelines into local contract forms, particularly for commonwealth countries.

Tunnel projects are characterized by long durations, large budgets, complexities, repetitive construction tasks, risks, and uncertainties. Several construction techniques have been developed in the tunnel construction industry to improve the constructability of tunnels and decrease the impact on surrounding structures. This paper presents a framework for planning tunnel construction using computer simulation. The proposed tool aids contractors in estimating the required time and cost for construction. Five tunnel construction techniques have been considered in the development of this tool with different ground supporting techniques. The proposed framework consists of three modules: (1) tunnel analyzer module, (2) simulation module, and (3) decision support module, and is capable of selecting the best construction technique using fuzzy group decision-making method based on time, cost and other selection criteria that could be defined during the decision-making phase. This decision method ranks alternatives based on a group of experts and a predefined set of criteria. Numerical examples are introduced to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework.

J	Marzouk, M; Amin, A				Marzouk, Mohamed; Amin, Ahmed			Predicting Construction Materials Prices Using Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction costs; Construction materials; Fuzzy sets; Neural networks; Predictions; Pricing; Cost estimating; Construction materials prices; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Quantitative methods		Changes in construction materials prices have a great impact on the cost of construction projects. Such changes in prices occur randomly at different rates over time. There is no clear relationship that can be used to provide accurate calculations of materials prices. One of the biggest problems that faces the construction contracts is unbalanced rights and obligations between owners and contractors (the two parties of construction contracts). It is necessary to have a system that is capable of estimating the size and amount of the change in materials prices at reasonable accuracy. There is also a need to predict the change in building materials prices (either increase or decrease) during the execution phase of the project as well as during the preparation of tenders. Thus, determination of the appropriate lead time to order needed building materials to execute various activities could be done. This research presents a system that utilizes fuzzy logic to identify construction materials that are most sensitive to the change in prices. The research proposes a methodology for identification of construction materials that are most sensitive to the change in prices to be used in modifying the contract price with an attempt to predict the amount of future change in materials prices using neural networks technique. To achieve this objective, the research classifies construction cost items into four different components (building materials, equipment, labor, and administrative expenses), which represent the basic cost elements of any cost item. The system is based on the study of the changes in materials prices that occurred in the Egyptian market from 2000 to 2010. It also provides the impact on the prices of cost items in the priced bill of quantities (BOQ), which is determined by the change in prices of cost items' materials and their share percent on forming the cost item. Getting to identify materials' share in the bill of quantities' items has a great influence on the price of the cost item and the priority in ordering these materials according to their impact on the item's price. The developed system aids construction contractors in studying bids during the tendering stage and procurement planning during the project's execution. It can also be used by owners' representatives to estimate the expected total cost of upcoming projects. The system data are obtained from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics in Egypt through published periodicals. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed system.

J	Su, Y; Lucko, G; Thompson, RC				Su, Yi; Lucko, Gunnar; Thompson, Richard C., Jr.			Application of Voting Theory to the Float Ownership Problem	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Network schedules; Delays; Float; Voting; Allocation; Cost and Schedule	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; APPORTIONMENT; ALLOCATION; PROJECTS; POWER	A longstanding contentious question in construction scheduling is who owns float: the owner or general contractor. Float is the ability of scheduled activities to absorb delays by their flexible timing. Zero float is considered to constitute criticality. This definition creates a fundamental but largely ignored paradox: To mitigate risk, critical activities urgently need float, but by definition are given none. Yet consuming float can reduce local delays to prevent a ripple effect of negative consequences. This research revisits the float ownership problem with inspiration from voting theory, which can provide proven approaches that apportion a limited valuable good among several participants of different sizes. Equivalent concepts in voting and scheduling were extracted and aligned to derive a functioning approach. Performance of such float apportionment was visualized and quantified by how efficiently the new method protects against delays, both in terms of counts and periods, and when saturation occurs. It was validated by simulating all combinations of a substantial benchmark schedule. The initial question was thus revised to who should use float to minimize overall risk.

Abdel			Stackelberg Game Theory-Based Optimization Model for Design of Payment Mechanism in Performance-Based PPPs	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; WEIGHTED SUM METHOD; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; INCENTIVES; PROJECTS; NETWORK; SUCCESS; BRANCH	Payment mechanisms lie at the heart of public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. A good design of the payment mechanism should consider the owner's goals in the project, allocate risks appropriately to stakeholders, and assure satisfactory performance by providing reasonable compensation to the private developer. This paper proposes a Stackelberg game theory-based model to assist public agencies in designing payment mechanisms for PPP transportation projects. The interests of both public and private sectors are considered and reflected by a bilevel objective function. The model aims to search for solutions that maximize a project's overall performance for the sake of social welfare while simultaneously maximizing return for the sake of private investment. A variable elimination method and genetic algorithm are used to solve the optimization model. A case study based on a real PPP project is discussed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The solutions provided by the model reveal that the optimal payment mechanism structure could be established such that it would satisfy owners' requirements for overall project performance while optimizing project total payments to contractors.

This study provides a similar investigation for a specific context of project management within a developing country setting. It aims at identifying stakeholders' perspectives on project risks in Indonesia and comparing them against assumptions of rational, normative theories and past findings from general management in developed countries. Two separate cross-sectional surveys were carried out with respondents composed of project contractors (n = 96, response rate = 38.4%) and clients (n = 99, rate = 69.7%), respectively. Empirical results identify significant gaps of risk-related concepts between project stakeholders' perspectives and the rational assumptions of the normative decision theories. For instance, risk is widely viewed by practitioners from the negative domain while the rational theory would suggest a more neutral perspective of risk. The pattern of findings is similar to those from previous empirical studies of developed countries within a general management context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Initially, a detailed comparative review was carried out to identify the most significant causes of delay at the international level. Based on the latter and the opinions of distinguished members of the industry, a survey questionnaire was designed and distributed to a total number of 242 members of the Cyprus Scientific and Technical Chamber. The analysis of the results obtained by 54 respondents indicated particular common-practice issues that affect completion in construction projects in Cyprus, such as duration of delays, Extension of time (EOT) awards and agreements, recording methods and programmes of works. Ultimately, by using the importance of delay causes as perceived by the respondents it was determined that in Cyprus construction industry 'variations requested by the client' (70%), 'mistakes and missing information from consultants' drawings' (55%), 'low productivity' (55%), 'difficulties in financing of the works by the contractor' (52%) and 'inadequate programming of works' (50%) to be the main causes of delay in Cyprus. Based on the results, specific practices are recommended for the control of delay in the completion of construction projects.

To address these challenges, this paper presents new geometry- and appearance-based reasoning methods for detecting construction progress, which has the potential to provide more frequent progress measures using visual data that are already being collected by general contractors. The initial step of geometry-based filtering detects the state of construction of building information modeling (BIM) elements (e.g.,in-progress, completed). The next step of appearance-based reasoning captures operation-level activities by recognizing different material types. Two methods have been investigated for the latter step: a texture-based reasoning for image-based 3D point clouds and color-based reasoning for laser-scanned point clouds. This paper presents two case studies for each reasoning approach to validate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical significances of the proposed methods.

Surveys were used to generate probability and severity indexes to rank 36 risk factors. Data were collected from 14 companies that are members of the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association. The results indicate that the main risk factors that hinder achieving the tunneling construction project objectives are (1) inaccurate cost estimation or lack of detail in budget preparation, (2) unexpected geological conditions, (3) inaccurate deadline estimation or insufficient breakdown of the project schedule, (4) frequent malfunction of construction equipment, (5) excessive delays in approval processes by government entities, and (6) unexpected soil conditions and water table. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature review is provided to compare these results to international perspectives to confirm the existence of risks inherent to tunnel construction projects. This article concludes with revisiting the risk factors, which are common for the construction industry in general.

Results of factor analysis with survey data collected from China provide support for the theoretically developed motivation model which classifies BIM implementation motivations into four categories: image motives, reactive motives, project-based economic motives, cross-project economic motives. Hierarchical regression results suggest that although project participants will have stronger economic motivations to improve project performances as their BIM capability matures, this increase in economic motivations does not necessarily require a parallel decrease of desires to improve social image. Regression results also suggest that BIM implementation motivations relate to organisational ownership type and project characteristics.

Construction contract management using value packaging systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contract management; construction supply chain; construction value unit; construction value packaging system; decision making	PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; SELECTION MODEL; SIMULATION	In large construction projects, optimally dividing, packaging, and awarding the work amongst contractors and suppliers can be challenging. Typically, this procurement process is executed in the pre-construction phase based on the experience and judgement of the project leadership team. Once procurement is completed, it is difficult to demonstrate whether the results of this process are optimal, or to explain the rationale behind decision making. An auditable and robust method is needed to address these issues, while still taking into account the expertise of the project leadership team. Thus, a comprehensive construction value packaging system (CVPS) is presented which serves as a computational and process environment for assisting project leaders by increasing the efficiency, auditability, and effectiveness of the procurement process. The development of this system requires a new concept to be defined, the construction value unit (VU), whose scope covers value-added work defined by type of activity, its stage in the value chain, and its specifications. Construction value packages are composed of VUs. Research findings demonstrate that the VPS has the potential to improve the contract management of an enterprise-wide construction supply chain.

The construction industry is one of the largest industries, and at the same time, among the largest polluters. Thus, the concept of sustainability has become increasingly important to construction firms and many contractors have started to reduce the environmental impacts of their construction activities. As part of the effort to achieve sustainability in construction sector, the study develops a method to select earth-moving equipment, based on their environmental impacts as well as duration and cost considerations. To this end, the study initially devel- ops a model for determining construction costs and duration as well as a model for determining monetary environmental impacts on earthwork construction. The study then uses an Improved Weight Decision Method (IWDM) to determine the weight of variables in order to find the best performed equipment configuration. The authors expect that the findings of the study will contribute to the research and practice in configuring earthwork equipment, taking into account associated environmental impacts as well as time and costs.

Multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis (mvQCA) was used to examine the events that took place during a large Dutch Design, Build, Finance and Maintain (DBFM) transportation infrastructure project. The analysis found that most events were social in nature. Private managers' responses to these events were internally-oriented and resulted in dissatisfactory outcomes. In contrast, externally-oriented managerial responses were associated with satisfactory outcomes. The article concludes that both public and private managers need to invest sufficiently in stakeholder management resources and capabilities when implementing projects. Although the intention of DBFM contracts is to lower the burden on the government, public managers still play an important role as intermediaries between the contractor and the local stakeholders and this role should not be underestimated.

PREFABRICATED JUST-IN-TIME (PREFAB-JIT) REBAR SUPPLY IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						on-site rebar delivery system; prefab-JIT; life cycle; environmental impacts	ENERGY; PRODUCTS; WOOD	In the on-site rebar delivery system, as the common method of rebar supply in the construction industry, reinforced steel bars are delivered in large batches from supplier's facilities through contractor's warehouse to the construction site. Rebars are then fabricated on-site and installed after assembly. In the new delivery system, called prefabrication Just-In-Time (prefab-JIT) system, the off-site cut and bend along with frequent rebar delivery to the site are applied in order to improve the process and increase its efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to assess and compare the environmental impacts resulting from the air emissions associated with the two rebar delivery systems in a case study construction project. Environmental impact categories of interest include global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and smog formation. A process-based cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment methodology is applied to perform the analysis. The results show that the prefab-JIT rebar delivery system causes less contribution to all mentioned environmental impact categories compared with a traditional on-site delivery system.

The company's management system, work organization and employment of available assets are some of the most important factors upon which overhead costs and the bidding price of a construction company depend directly. A statistical analysis of a homogenous group of construction companies reveals the company's overhead costs value distribution function, which can be used to evaluate the competitive advantages and disadvantages of a specific construction company. A detailed overhead costs categorization and the findings of a survey conducted among contractors influenced the selection of the principal parameters of the company's activity, on which the value of overhead costs depends; they are the number of company's head office employees and the area of company's facilities. The developed competitiveness evaluation methodology enables the construction managers to adequate and scientific position the company on the market of homogenous construction companies group, to estimate its activity as well as to evaluate the competitive advantages and disadvantages of bidding prices and certain costs in public tendering of construction operations and services.

Relationship-based contracts are thus widely used to stimulate best-for-project ideals and attenuate the otherwise adversarial relationship that often exists between clients and contractors. This study examines the effectiveness and limitations of a project facilitation model as coaching tool for developing conducive inter-organisational relationships for construction project delivery. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a case-study approach using evidence from triangulated data sources of focus group workshops, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Findings (1) The facilitation model enabled an environment for psychological safety to be developed, which engendered a platform for effective cooperation for problem-solving and achieving quasi best-for-project ideals. (2) The model provides the mechanism to develop team behaviours that support enhanced performance and create an environment less adversarial and more collaborative than traditional contracting. Originality/value The novelty of this research is that relationship-based principles have been utilised as part of a traditional design-bid-build contract with lump-sum payment arrangements.

It refers to human - made spaces they live and work in and which are affected by various micro, meso and macro level factors. For this purpose, renovation decisions must be considered avoiding a narrow approach to the single projects of building renovation. Renovation of the built and human environment must be considered instead and the holistic approach used. From this perspective, decision-making problems of renovation often involve a complex decision making process in which multiple requirements and conditions have to be taken into consideration simultaneously. This paper describes the concept of the integrated analysis of built and human environment renovation as a whole as well as presents the multiple criteria assessment of alternatives of the Bulgarian cultural heritage renovation projects. The widely known multiple criteria assessment methods SAW, TOPSIS and COPRAS and the newly developed method ARAS were used for this purpose. As a result the best project for granting was selected.

Alternative dispute resolution methods are now commonly used as a means to resolve construction disputes. Mediation, interalia, is the popular choice in Hong Kong due to its cost-saving, flexible, speedy, confidential, and voluntary attributes. In mediation, tactics used by a mediator is central in driving desired outcomes. This paper reports a study that employs logistic regression (LR) to predict mediation outcomes respective to the tactics used. To achieve this, three main stages of work are involved. First, taxonomies of mediator tactics and mediation outcomes were developed. With these, the second stage included the development of logistic regression models each with a mediation outcome taxonomy as dependent variables and the taxonomies of tactics as independent variables. In the third stage of the study, the LR models were validated using an independent set of testing data. The LR models suggested that "win-win settlement," "progress," "improvement," and "time advantage" are responsive to mediator tactics of "ice-breaking," "trust building," "encourage for self-improve," and "process control," respectively. In addition, it is observed that these relationships are positively correlated.

The system links time-lapse digital movies of construction activities, critical path method (CPM) and progress control techniques. It accepts digital images taken from multiple cameras.. stores them in chronological order and links them to a database that contains schedule information. The digital pictures taken from up to four cameras are placed on a website from where a remote computer(s) can capture and store the pictures in the database. The system enables management staff at the contractor's and owner representatives' headquarters to follow developments at the construction site in real time. Additionally, time-lapse films of activities at the construction site taken by multiple cameras can be played back in synchrony with dynamic graphs showing planned versus actual schedules. PHOTO-NET II introduces a new concept in time-lapse photography that allows the user to manipulate the frame rate, enabling a reasonable playback time as well as the implementation of the technology for long-term construction projects using standard PCs.

Although the type of projects can relieve transportation pressure in cities and make citizen's life easier, it raises many environmental and social problems during the construction process, in particular, problems about residents' daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify key environmental and social impacts of urban subway constructions and adjust construction programs and urban transportation programs to reduce negative impacts on citizen's daily life during construction. This paper analyzes the key factors for measuring environmental and social influences of subway construction and their interrelationships by using structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Four major impact factors are identified, namely, the impact on residents' travel, transportation, environment and daily life. Then some suggestions are made accordingly. These findings can be used as references for governments, contractors and other parties to develop more rational construction programs to minimize negative impacts of subway construction in urban development.

The system uses a point laser source through a rotating optical device fixed on to a laser measurement meter. A notebook computer with custom software is used to control the laser meter and rotating device to estimate the scanned profile shape and to determine the resulting cross-section area. The information provided by this system is essential to construction industry, including window and door builders; the glass, panel, board, and floor the manufacturers; carpet venders; and building contractors for cost estimation and production control. As a result, the lead time for delivering the customized windowpanes, woodwork, floor tiles, and ceilings can be reduced. Applications of this system for measuring the shapes of window frames and floor plans are described and demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is evaluated and analyzed. Results have indicated that the measurement accuracy can be achieved within 4% of the measurement distance, for typical window designs and floor patterns required by major widow manufacturers. Recommendations to improve the system are also included. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to analyze human safety risk factors in subway construction in China and their interactions from a broad project-stakeholder perspective. Questionnaires were used to investigate cause-effect relationships among 42 factors identified from the literature and expert interviews. Weighted-network analysis showed that accidents and safety failures resulted from strong interactions of risk factors associated with multiple stakeholders. Owners' risk factors acted as a central risk source, amplifying risk and producing significant ripple effects on the global risk network. Many factors were associated with general contractors, but these resulted largely from risky acts by other stakeholders. These findings suggest that stakeholders should shift from separate risk mitigation to collaborative risk responses. This study improves understanding of the interactions of risk factors associated with diverse stakeholders. It also establishes a weighted-network approach to risk analysis that captures risk interactions more accurately than unweighted networks. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Decisions must constantly be made concerning effective utilization of available resources. Reentrant workflow patterns, where a trade crew returns multiple times to the same space, make production control particularly difficult. We present a method for pull flow control at the operational level through real-time prioritization of pending work packages and daily regulation of crew assignments and trades' production capacities. Application of various heuristics was evaluated using discrete-event simulation of a representative construction project. The experimental results emphasize the importance of dynamic control of allocation of production resources to those mature activities that ensure subsequent (downstream) flow. The most successful policy was to use the second reentrant activity as a bottleneck and to regulate the capacity of the trade with reentrant flows to ensure sufficient feeding of new work to successive crews.

How to successfully implement an ERP system in an organization is always a hot research topic for researchers as well as a pending problem for an organization that wants to implement it. This research is a case study on the selection of system suppliers and contract negotiation during the ERP implementation of a local construction company in Taiwan. After reviewing the common key success factors discussed in the literature, this study discussed seven issues: coding system, working process reengineering, priority of ERP functionality implementation, customization, participant roles, consultant role and performance level of subcontractor, which also affected the implementation. Lessons learned from the case study in discussed seven issues are valuable for a construction company in deciding to implement an ERP system. This research suggests that additional case studies are necessary for the successful application of ERP systems in the construction industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Risk allocation in public construction projects: the case of Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk factors; risk allocation; construction project; public projects; Jordan	MANAGEMENT	Proper risk identification, assessment, and allocation can reduce cost and time delay. This study identifies, assesses and allocates risks in public construction projects in Jordan with the goal of reducing the overall costly claims and disputes. Based on extensive literature review, the study identifies 62 risk factors that are grouped under 14 categories. The respondents were asked to estimate the probability, impact and proper allocation of these risk factors. Based on 208 valid responses, the results indicate that the top ranked risk factors are delays in client's payments, poorly tailored contract forms, competition, delay in approval of permits, default by subcontractors, unclear specifications, material prices fluctuations, different construction standards, change in design, and poor design. The respondents of the study recommend 4 risk factors to be shouldered by owners, five risk factors to be shouldered by contractors, and 42 risk factors to be shared by the contracting parties. The results of the study also help practitioners to allocate risks to the stakeholder who is more capable to assesses, controls and manages these risks. The generated risk priority can be used to prioritize the risks for response planning.

The objective of this article is to show how much risk preferences influence bid-price decision making in bidding for construction contracts. Based on the literature review and interviews, the authors designed a bidding situation and conducted an experiment to test decision- maker responses. In total, 172 participants with lengthy experience in bidding for construction work took part in the experiment. Both descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used for deep information mining of the data. Risk preference was found to have a significantly positive effect on bid markups. Based on a comparison of the influences of risk preferences on the bid price in different competitive bidding situations, the results show that the bid price decreased with the number of bidders, and it was even lower when the number of bidders was unknown. Therefore, considering both risk preference and the number of bidders is important in reasonable decision making. Finally, advice is also provided to construction companies for evaluating the leader's decisions and the decision-making team.

Currently, warranty bid prices are often estimated subjectively due to the lack of a systematic methodology for quantifying warranty servicing costs for highway infrastructures. A risk-based model is presented here to fill this gap. The model is founded on Kaplan and Garrick's theory of quantitative risk assessment and considers the warranted item's probability of failure (as defined in the warranty clause) and the projected cost of repairing the failure. Probability of failure is determined using survival analysis of actual historical performance data. The model was demonstrated and tested using two hypothetical pavement construction projects in northern Illinois. The computed warranty cost is within the range of actual warranty bid prices for comparable projects, indicating the applicability of the proposed approach. Contractors and surety companies can use this model to make better informed decisions regarding the bidding and pricing of highway construction warranties.

Actions necessary for successful CSU are often not well planned or executed, resulting in poor CSU performance. Recognizing this significant shortfall, the purpose of this study is to determine critical activities necessary to increase the likelihood of successful CSU performance on capital projects. Utilizing input from CSU experts, objective data collection, and subsequent data analysis, 16 critical success factors (CSFs) were identified through this research. Further elements developed include CSF's timing of CSF implementation, support of safety and quality, and current frequency of CSF achievement. The researchers recommend the industry to pay particular attention to these six laggard CSFs: CSU value recognition, adequate funding for CSU, CSU leadership continuity, system milestone acceptance criteria and deliverables, CSU systems engineering during front-end engineering design (FEED), and systems-focus in detailed design. Capital project team members (representing both owners and contractors) and researchers involved in the planning and implementation of facility CSU will benefit from the results.

However, just like other sectors of the economy, the industry is saddled with numerous risks making the achievement of project objectives elusive. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the current risk management practices prevailing in the building construction project delivery in the Ghanaian construction industry. Qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis technique. Quantitative data was obtained through survey questionnaires and analysed using fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Respondents were selected from three public Universities and construction firms in the highest building contractor financial class known as D1K1. It was found out that risk management is not implemented in a systematic, deliberate and continuous manner. However, risks are dealt with in an adhoc manner. This practice is at variance with acceptable risk management practices. The findings expose the weaknesses in the project management practice in Ghana. Project managers of large construction firms in Ghana require sound knowledge and training in internationally recognized systematic risk management practices in order to ensure achievement of value for money in construction project.

However, it is applied slowly because of barriers against its implementation. In addition, the potential benefits brought from construction supply chain management (CSCM) may not be achieved as expected if the barriers are not identified and removed. The barriers to the CSCM implementation seem to have not been thoroughly explored and analyzed by previous studies. This study identifies the barriers and discovers the underlying relationships among them. The results of the study showed that lack of effective leadership, lack of competence of parties in SCM, lack of understanding the supply chain concept, passive sub-contractors and suppliers, and organizational resistance to SCM were the five most significant barriers. The underlying relationships among the barriers were discovered under five factors, namely lack of knowledge and competence, lack of support and active participation from parties, confronting culture and adversarial behaviour, deficiencies in the contract system, and inherent difficulties in SCM. The findings could help practitioners to fully understand the barriers and to come up with appropriate strategies for promoting the development of the CSCM. The study contributes to the field of knowledge related to the CSCM.

J	Lim, BTH; Loosemore, M				Lim, Benson T.

It is argued that when people believe business transactions are fair, they are more likely to exhibit positive organizational citizenship behaviors such as working harmoniously, giving discretionary effort, respecting others, and collaborating to resolve problems. However, there has been little empirical evidence to support these assertions. To address this knowledge gap, an online survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers from across the construction project supply chain was undertaken. The results show that project participants' organizational citizenship behaviors are influenced by their perceived interpersonal justice in business transactions. However, the findings also offer a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and inter-connectedness of these relationships in showing how one type of inter-organizational justice acts on another in influencing project organizational citizenship behaviors. The results indicate that interpersonal justice is a key ingredient in bringing about positive organizational citizenship behaviors in construction projects and that project performance can be enhanced if project managers treat project participants with politeness, respect, and dignity.

Little is known, however, about the boundary conditions for the complementation of these two governance mechanisms. The aim is to investigate the interaction of contractual incentive and trust in promoting inter-organizational cooperation. A three-staged Stackelberg model was established and then solved by backward induction. Research results indicate that contractual incentive can motivate the contractor's task behaviours, while the effect of trust on relational behaviours is path-dependent. Three levels of factors (intra-organizational, inter-organizational and project factors) would affect the selection of the optimal incentive coefficient. Moreover, when the changing rate of the client's cost of effort is less than or equal to a threshold, contractual incentive and trust can be complementary. The study contributes to theory by offering nuanced insights into the governance mechanisms and addressing the complex contracting issues when mutual trust exists.

Contractors typically obtain time extensions for weather days beyond normal conditions. However, contracting parties often dispute the extent of weather-related time extensions. Typical industry contracts may overlook many important points that can provide an acceptable resolution. This paper classifies seven factors causing discrepancies in analysis of adverse weather for time extensions; namely, the definition of normal weather, weather thresholds, type of work, lingering days, criteria for lost days, lost days equivalent due to lost productivity, and work days lost versus calendar days lost. An analysis of an actual weather-caused delay claim illustrates the impacts of those factors on the outcomes of the analysis. A contract should define anticipated weather delay days and their lingering days and provide threshold values for weather parameters to differentiate between predictable and unpredictable severe weather. The contract should clearly define how a time extension is granted in calendar days as a result of work days lost, and also address how a time extension is granted due to inefficiency caused by unusually severe weather. Future research may provide an appropriate mechanism for analyzing equivalent lost days to account for lost productivity.

Traditional CJV profit-allocation approaches account only for investment shares, and do not address the marginal contribution of the participating parties. Therefore, disagreements may arise between stakeholders. This research aims to reduce profit-share-related disagreements among multiple CJV members by allocating profit based on the marginal contribution of each party. The authors developed a conceptual framework using the Shapley value as an alternative to the traditional investment-based approach. Three illustrative examples demonstrated the possible use of the developed conceptual framework. Results of the study highlighted the potential of Shapley value as an alternative profit allocation scheme. The stability of the generated results was validated mathematically, and decision makers' perception of fairness was addressed following the methods of prior experimental cooperative game theory research. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing an axiomatically fair methodology for profit-sharing negotiations among multiple collaborating parties in a project. This approach can be utilized in other engineering domains where the management needs to foster stable and fair collaborations among its stakeholders. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This study intended to extensively investigate on the factors influencing labour performance in the Sri Lankan construction industry. A qualitative study conducted from a literature review and a series of interviews revealed 117 factors under 6 categories. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was carried out among the construction firms in Sri Lanka and the responses were received from 217 contractors. Overall, 73 factors were identified as critical based on their Relative Importance Index values. Lack of training facilities, delay in salary payments, lack of labour motivation, low salary for labourers and poor performance evaluation of labour skills were found as the top five ranking factors. This study also highlights the need for training programmes that contain the direct scope of productivity improvement, and identified the expected programme outcomes for the effective design of new training programmes to improve the practices on labour operations. The findings of this study are expected to be useful to the Sri Lankan construction industry in effectively upgrading present practices. Some of these findings may also be tested in other developing construction industries in similar scenarios.

Analogously, when a bidder considers entering a bid or when an auctioneer is handling a procurement auction, assessing the likely proportion of experienced bidders is considered an important aspect, as some strategic decisions or even the awarding criteria might differ. However, estimating the number of bidders in a future auction that have not submitted a single bid yet is difficult, since there is no data at all linking their potential participation, an essential requirement for the implementation of any forecasting or estimation method. A practical approach is derived for determining the expected proportion of new bidders to frequent bidders as a function of the population of potential bidders. A multinomial model useful for selective and Open tendering is proposed and its performance is validated with a dataset of actual construction auctions. Final remarks concern the valuable information provided by the model to an enduring unsolved bidding problem and the prospects for new research continuations.

J	Thompson, PJ; Sanders, SR				Thompson, PJ; Sanders, SR			Partnering continuum	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Numerous publications have documented successes achieved through partnering. Such notable results have been achieved over a wide variety of applications, including public and private ownership, single-project and multiple-project agreements, and lump-sum and cost-plus contracts. Such accomplishment across a spectrum of application suggests that partnering, if applied properly, can work in almost any environment. Recent research by the Construction Industry Institute highlights this fact that many "shades" of partnering exist, based on the degree of objectives alignment between involved parties. To illustrate this, a partnering continuum has been developed, depicting four general stages-competition, cooperation, collaboration, and coalescence. "Competition" represents the traditional owner/contractor relationship, where each party possesses separate objectives, and minimal effort is expended toward "working together." This competitive pursuit occurs in the absence of partnering. The other three stages-cooperation, collaboration, and coalescence-incorporate increasing degrees of objective alignment and commitment by the involved parties, and are represented on the continuum to depict various partnering applications. Companies considering partnering should assess their business objectives, analyze the role of partnering in helping them to achieve those objectives, and determine the appropriate style of partnering to implement. Through this process, a balance can be struck between risk and reward, and resources can be properly utilized to develop, implement, and manage the partnering relationship.

J	De Jarnette, V; McCarthy, LM; Bennert, T; Guercio, MC				De Jarnette, Van; McCarthy, Leslie Myers; Bennert, Thomas; Guercio, Maria Chiara			Use of Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Principles to Assign Asphalt Pavement Pay Factor Adjustments	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flexible pavements; Quality control; Asphalt pavements; Design; Construction; Flexible pavements; Quality assurance (QA); Performance-related specification (PRS); Dynamic modulus; Construction materials and methods	DYNAMIC MODULUS	This paper promotes the quality analysis of flexible pavements by exploring the role of analysis programs as laboratory support tools to assess the quality of constructed pavements. Specifically, the research explored the significance of laboratory dynamic modulus testing on assigning pay factor adjustments in these tools. In the United States, the current methods of pavement acceptance are based more on construction craftsmanship (i.e.,density and smoothness, percent within limits) as opposed to how the pavement will actually perform once constructed. The use of performance-based specification models would enable a state transportation agency to quantify the impacts of varying as-built mixture quality in terms of (1)a projection of pavement service life, and (2)presenting life-cycle costs in a way that both agencies and contractors can understand. Two publicly available performance-related specification (PRS) quality assurance (QA) analysis tools have been developed based on mechanistic-empirical pavement design principles and were assessed for a small set of mixtures. The quality related specification software (QRSS) utilizes a predictive equation and traffic, binder, and mixture volumetric data to predict dynamic modulus (|E*|) values. The asphalt mixture performance tester (AMPT) QA program varies from the QRSS in that it uses the laboratory-measured |E*| as an input. Pavement distresses (i.e.,rutting and fatigue cracking) are calculated based on both the as-designed job-mix formula and as-produced construction mixture properties. Then, a predicted service life difference (PLD) and the resultant pay factor adjustments are calculated based on the variance between the as-designed and as-produced mixtures. The distress and service life predictions from the two QA programs were similar for the conventional mixes, which may indicate that requiring a laboratory-tested dynamic modulus does not add significant benefit in the analysis of conventional mixtures. Furthermore, an analysis was done in the QRSS program to compare the impacts of the preloaded default binder values to the laboratory-measured binder properties. The results indicated that laboratory testing of binders is recommended for providing inputs to the QRSS since the in situ characteristics were not fully reflected by the default binder values in the program. The differences in the distress levels predicted for the unconventional mixture types indicated that the use of laboratory-measured |E*| is necessary for setting pay factor adjustments, particularly since only conventional dense-graded mixtures were used to calibrate the models in the programs. The conditions under which the program-based analyses will have limitations are presented. Recommendations are provided on how agencies and contractors can improve the construction process by preliminary monitoring of pavement quality using the analysis tools.

For private companies, it allows the total number of competing bidders to be estimated, which may lead to better adjustments of future bids. For contracting authorities, it allows the population size of all potential bidders to be estimated and thus to implement better awarding criteria. Mathematical models for forecasting the number of new bidders and the population size of all potential bidders are, however, very scarce in the construction management literature. In this paper, we propose an exponential model for predicting the average number of new bidders based on an urn analogy. The model allows the number of new bidders to be estimated as a function of new versus total participating bidders observed in previous auctions. The parameter estimates obtained from the model also allow the statistical distribution of the number of potential new bidders to be modeled using a sum of binomial distributions. We validate the exponential model on three published construction auction data sets, showing that the proposed model significantly outperforms the multinomial model-the most advanced model for performing similar tasks found in the literature.

However, it has seldom been addressed in grain bin projects which have a stricter requirement for on-time delivery to ensure prompt and appropriate grain storage. The aim of this study is to investigate the significant causes of delay in grain bin construction projects in China. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature review and 15 structured interviews were carried out, and a self-administered questionnaire was sent out to 108 respondents with experiences in constructing grain bin projects. Results showed that the top five delay causes for grain bin construction projects were 'shortage of adequate equipment,' 'poor communication among contracting parties,' 'problems with subcontractors,' 'inadequate experience of the design team' and 'frequent change orders by clients.' Also, results showed that the most significant delay cause category in grain bin construction projects was contractor-related causes. This study has provided the industry and academia with a deep understanding of the delay issue ingrain bin construction projects, which has also reinforced the knowledge body of delay research in the construction engineering and management domain.

Estimation of the time required for pavement to reach a desired temperature level is necessary for highway agencies to make proper specifications and for contractors to plan for daily productions. In this study, energy exchange at the surface of newly laid HMA pavement was modeled as a function of time and weather conditions. Thermodynamics theory and finite-element method were used to model and simulate the cooling process. Field validation indicates that the modeling and simulation results match the observations reasonably well. The analysis procedure developed in this study can be used to predict HMA pavement cooling in different weather conditions. This paper contributes to the understanding of fundamental thermal exchanges in freshly placed HMA pavement, quantification of the influences of weather conditions and time on the thermal exchanges, and realistic estimation of pavement cooling time for better specification and production plans. It also facilitates future exploration of artificial cooling methods by reducing the number of site trials through computer simulations.

This paper discusses the peer review process and analyzes whether the questions used in the review can predict project success, as measured by cost, schedule, and the project peer rating, for 22 past projects. The data were analyzed retrospectively by using the point biserial correlation coefficient. The results indicate that project peer reviews conducted during the construction process can be used to assess and predict final project performance. Questions regarding working relationships, communication, timing, project controls, and relational approaches to project participants had significant correlations with project success. In addition, the relationship between the designer and contractor appears to be very important to the outcome of the project, regardless of project delivery method. This study suggests that companies and organizations can strategically improve projects by conducting project peer reviews early in the construction process.

J	Subramanyan, H; Sawant, PH; Bhatt, V				Subramanyan, Hariharan; Sawant, Priyadarshi H.; Bhatt, Vandana			Construction Project Risk Assessment: Development of Model Based on Investigation of Opinion of Construction Project Experts from India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analytical hierarchy process; Contract administration; Project risk management; Student t-test		Risk is involved in every business, and the construction industry is no exception. Most of the project management issues that impact a project arise from associated uncertainties. The Indian construction industry is worth about $120 billion and this could grow considerably, driven by major projects across the country. There are a number of problems in the construction industry in India that are attributed to various factors. The focus of the present research is to identify factors that influence the smooth completion of a project and develop a risk assessment model. The authors of the paper have made an attempt to analyze the present risk condition in the construction industry by meeting experts in the field to collect first-hand information as a first step towards risk assessment and suggest a risk response strategy. A total of 93 risk factors were identified and listed under various subgroups in this paper. A questionnaire was prepared on the basis of a literature review and was filled by six contractors, four owners, five project management experts, having more than 20 years of experience in the construction field in India. As the factors are represented in qualitative terms, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used. The result of the study is listed, in which the percentage contribution of various factors to smooth completion is shown. Because the findings are based on a small cross section of experts, Student's t-test, a significance test, has been applied to know the significance of test findings on the general construction industry. The study results are reduced further into two groups for simplification and better understanding. The first group covers owner-, contractor-, project manager-, finance-, and resource-specific risks; and the second group covers risk pertaining to project-, architect/consultant-, external environment-, and contract-clause-specific factors. The analysis results indicate that the risks specific to the first group are found to be 10.5 to 12.0% with a standard deviation less than 1.66, whereas the percent apportionment of second group ranges from 9.5 to 13%, a larger range than the first group of factors with standard deviation up to as high as 3.3, indicating wider variation, thus making it difficult to predict their occurrence in a project. The findings are also confirmed by the project disputes related to various projects discussed in the paper. The risk response strategy suggested in this paper will be useful in mitigating the adverse effects of risk in project completion in the Indian construction industry. A planned approach in handling a project-specific and external-environment-specific risk coupled with a proper contract administration can mitigate overall risk to a greater extent in the Indian construction industry.

J	Lin, JJ; Golparvar-Fard, M				Lin, Jacob J.; Golparvar-Fard, Mani			Visual and Virtual Production Management System for Proactive Project Controls	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PRODUCTION FLOW; CONSTRUCTION; PROGRESS; INTERIOR; BIM	Current construction still suffers from significant schedule delays and budget overruns due to inefficient and retroactive project controls programs. This paper developed a visual and virtual project control system that proactively promotes team-based planning and real-time communication of progress and schedule risk. The system benefits from the growth of visual data on construction sites and the increasing maturity level of building information modeling (BIM), to map the current state of production in 3D and expose waste. By modeling production trends, reliability in the future state of production is forecasted to highlight potential delay issues in a location-driven scheme. A visual 3D interface supports collaborative decision-making to eliminate root causes of waste, enables pull flows between people and information, decentralizes work tracking, and facilitates in-process quality control and hand-overs among contractors. This system was implemented on two projects to validate the underlying algorithms. Results show that the system's functional aspects improve transparency, accountability, and traceability in project execution, and streamline communications between the field and the office. Specifically, 30% PPC increase and four weeks project completion date advance have been observed. Limitations such as resistance to workflow changes could be further improved in the future through early system introduction. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Design decisions arise as the result of social interactions and information exchanges between project actors. Interactions can be studied using social-network analysis (SNA). The patterns of social interaction that underpinned key design decisions with the potential to impact construction WHS were investigated in an Australian case-study project. SNA was applied longitudinally to capture network information for 42 sequential design decisions. Changes in network density were examined over time, and networks were compared before and after a contractor was engaged. In-depth interviews explored differences in design and WHS outcomes. The results revealed changing social networks over the study period. Furthermore, improvement in WHS-related design outcomes was observed as participants with relevant construction knowledge joined the social networks and moved to prominent positions. It is argued that understanding how social networks change and play out to produce project outcomes (e.g., WHS) can help project leadership teams to develop communication networks that are more likely to support effective decision making and performance.

Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels are considered to be the most economical and viable options to meet this demand. Yet, FPSO projects are prone to significant cost and schedule growth. On average, FPSOs have been reported to experience a 20% cost growth and are delayed by six months. Overruns and delays represent uncertainties for owners, contractors and financial institutions. In-depth interviews with twenty-three practitioners about their experiences with FPSO projects revealed that rework arising from design and construction errors were major contributors to cost and schedule growth. Key latent conditions contributing to rework are classified according to people, organization and project. Using retrospective sensemaking an examination of the determinant histories in a new build and conversion FPSO that experienced rework was undertaken. The sharing of experience(s) is deemed pivotal for reducing rework in future projects, particularly through the use of communities of practice that are able to stimulate situated learning to take place. A reduction in rework will not only reduce cost and schedule growth, improve operational performance and augment safety.	[Love, Peter E.

Although the model has been tested and supported by many questionnaire surveys, EFQM has never been validated on real self-assessment scores obtained from companies. Therefore this study validates the model on scores from 34 construction companies in South Eastern Europe. The analysis shows that: a) there is an enabler excellence construct that is obtained by each enabler criteria; b) there is a result excellence construct that is obtained by each result criteria; and c) the EFQM model is most suitable for Contractor type organizations. Furthermore, we have found that the EFQM weights do not entirely correspond with the construction industry. Therefore we present new weights for the better use in the construction. Although this study proves EFQM to be a good representation of TQM in the construction industry, further improvements are needed. This is especially evident within investor and consultant type organization, where the criteria of Policy and Strategy, Leadership and Processes, People results and Client results showed certain limitations.

Talat			Multiagent System to Simulate Risk-Allocation and Cost-Sharing Processes in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction management; Claim negotiations; Computer-aided simulation; Distributed artificial intelligence; Multiagent systems; Fuzzy sets; Bayesian analysis	COORDINATION	Multiagent systems (MASs) consist of several autonomous entities, called agents, that interact with each other to either fulfill their own interests (competition) or reach a common goal (cooperation). In MASs, negotiation is the key form of interaction that enables groups of agents to arrive at a mutual agreement regarding some belief, goal, or plan. The aim of this study is to develop a MAS that simulates the negotiation process between parties (mainly contractor and client) about risk allocation and sharing of cost overruns in construction projects. The MAS was developed using three different negotiation protocols: time-dependent concession, Zeuthen's strategy, and Zeuthen's strategy with Bayesian learning. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effect of reservation value, first-offer value, and negotiation protocol on the settlement amounts. The model was also tested on three hypothetical cases. Results show that it is mainly the reservation value that determines the settlement amount of the negotiation. The developed system can be used by decision makers to understand how the risks and associated costs are shared between parties under different scenarios. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000218.

Utilization of float is, hence, on a "first-come, first-served" basis. Within this usage protocol and guided by the Common Law's Proximate Cause principle, the party that encounters critical delays in the later stages of a project is more likely to be held responsible for delays to the overall project completion time. Given these practices, float ownership and its utilization has continued to become a major source of disputes when project delays occur. The objective of this paper is to introduce the concept of float preallocation and management for critical path method based construction schedules. The principles for preallocating and managing "total float" include recommending contract clauses to direct its use and to explain the manner in which responsibility for any resulting delay may be assigned. The paper also introduces a bookkeeping procedure to facilitate the application of this concept on project schedules. The proposed concept continues to recognize that total float is an asset for both parties.

In addition to typical delivery requirements such as cost and schedule, there are a number of other project-specific attributes that can increase project profitability and/or reduce risks. Often owner organizations are not fully aware of these attributes, or fail to properly communicate them to the contractors. As a result, the engineering and construction (E&C) community is unable to efficiently respond to the customer's expectations. The E&C focus becomes a wide variety of perceived client's value interests, instead of few important ones. Thus, a two-year study sponsored by the Construction Industry Institute was initiated to develop a standard work process and a tool that could assist in identifying owners' project value interests, provide a standardized form for their communication, and aid in identifying an appropriate E&C response strategy. This paper presents the four-step research approach based on industry survey data collection, discusses study results, and describes the Microsoft Excel tool that supports this process.

Development of metrics and an external benchmarking program for healthcare facilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Healthcare facilities; owner; external benchmarking; metrics; planning	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; SECTOR	This paper describes the development of a benchmarking program for healthcare projects. Healthcare construction projects tend to be unique due to varied healthcare facilities and offered services, thus requiring a platform to study distinct project management approaches for the healthcare industry. The idea of continuous improvement through competitive benchmarking is already well established. However, highly targeted comparisons are not possible without industry-specific metrics. The ability to measure project performance allows for credible industry norms and continuous improvement. As a first step, a comprehensive study focused on identifying specific metrics to measure healthcare capital project-performance in key areas such as cost, schedule, change, and best practice implementation was concluded with input from a team comprised of healthcare owners, contractors, and architects. In addition, space/dimensional and program-specific metrics were also identified for this external benchmarking program. This paper presents the development of a framework for different healthcare capital facility-types using absolute and relative metrics for the healthcare industry. The findings include resources for the healthcare community in the form of healthcare facility metrics and project database that enables the process of quantifying the effectiveness and efficiency of processes specific to the healthcare industry of completed and ongoing projects.

Thus, BIM implementation needs to be enhanced. The objectives are to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for enhancing BIM implementation and investigate the interrelationships among these CSFs. 32 success factors were identified through a literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted. The results indicated that 15 CSFs were identified and grouped into integration and accuracy of models (IAM), commitment and training from the management (CTM), and advantages and support of implementation (ASI) through factor analysis. The results from structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that CTM resulted in IAM and from ASI, while ASI facilitated IAM. The proposed framework indicating the CSFs and the intergroup relationships provides an in-depth understanding of BIM implementation and can help firms to commit on their part of project-wide BIM adoption and associated advantages. Overseas practitioners may use the identified success factors and follow the method to customise their own CSFs.

A multiobjective bilevel decision-making model is established in which the transportation time and cost in each arc are considered as fuzzy random variables. The construction contractor, the leader in the hierarchy, aims to minimize both total direct and transportation time costs. The transportation agency, next in the hierarchy, assesses the target to minimize total transportation cost. To deal with the uncertainties, the expected value operator and chance constraint method are used to transform the uncertain model into a calculable one. Furthermore, a multiobjective bilevel particle swarm optimization algorithm with a fuzzy random simulation-based constraint checking procedure is applied to solve the model. Finally, the Shuibuya Hydropower Project is used as a practical example to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed model. Results and a sensitivity analysis are presented to highlight the performance of the optimization method. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

As a precursor to decreased rework and enhanced safety performance, this study appraised the correlative causes of rework and safety incidents. To do this, 20 rework causes that undermine safety performance were first identified through the literature review. Using a survey questionnaire involving Malaysian construction professionals (owners, consultants, and contractors), the causes were prioritized based on frequency, severity, and importance indices. The five leading rework-safety causes were ranked as follows: poor coordination, insufficient communication, poor subcontractor management, improper supervision and inspection, and poor site management. Spearman's rank correlation tests revealed a significant agreement between the respondent groups. An exploratory factor analysis identified the five major underlying causal dimensions of rework and safety incidents to relate to the substandard management of equipment and machinery, poor project management practices, inherent dangerous, dirty, and difficult (3D) characteristics, improper production planning and work pressure, and inadequate personnel competency and knowledge. This paper bridges the identified knowledge gap concerning the dimensionality of rework and accident causation in construction, and the findings provide guidance for devising preventive measures for simultaneously addressing rework and safety problems.

J	Su, Y; Lucko, G				Su, Yi; Lucko, Gunnar			Optimum Present Value Scheduling Based on Synthetic Cash Flow Model with Singularity Functions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Cash flows; Markup; Synthetic cash flow model; Singularity functions; Cost and schedule	NET PRESENT VALUE; RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS; PROGRAMMING APPROACH; PROJECT; MAXIMIZE; ALGORITHM	Contractors may increase their profit by rescheduling noncritical activities within their floats. Based on this hypothesis, new theory is explored to optimize the present value of the project balance (PVbal) with singularity functions in a synthetic cash flow model. Its contribution to the body of knowledge is threefold: First, PVbal is expanded to a function of activity shifts in analogy to resource leveling. Second, it is found that intuitive front-shifting may not maximize PVbal because of a trade-off between changes in pay (inflow) and interest (outflow). Conditions for front-shifting and back-shifting and the newly discovered phenomenon of scalloping are derived by exploring monotonicity, periodicity, and concavity of the PVbal function. Monotonicity controls front-shifting or back-shifting; periodicity and concavity control if scalloping can exist, whereby shifting a fractional period gives a local optimum of PVbal. It repeats periodically until all float is exhausted. Third, combinations of financial parameters (markup, interest, retainage, and bill-to-pay delay) are examined on how they impact shift decisions to optimize cash flow.

J	Park, MW; Elsafty, N; Zhu, ZH				Park, Man-Woo; Elsafty, Nehad; Zhu, Zhenhua			Hardhat-Wearing Detection for Enhancing On-Site Safety of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Occupational safety; Imaging techniques; Automatic identification systems; Information technologies	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Construction is one of the most dangerous job sectors, which annually reports tens of thousands of time-loss injuries and deaths. These injuries and deaths do not only bring suffering to the workers and their families, but also incur delays and costs to the projects. Therefore, safety is an important issue that a general contractor must monitor and control. One of the fundamental safety regulations is wearing a hardhat, which should not be violated anytime on the sites. In this paper, a novel vision-based method is proposed to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhats on the construction sites. Under the method, human bodies and hardhats are first detected in the video frames captured by on-site construction cameras. Then, the matching between the detected human bodies and hardhats is performed using their geometric and spatial relationship. This way, the people who are not wearing hardhats could be automatically identified and safety alerts could be issued correspondingly. The method has been tested with real site videos. The high safety alert precision and recall of the method demonstrate its potential to facilitate the site safety monitoring work. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Though numerous delay studies predominate, what is lacking is constructive research to develop tools and techniques to wrestle the inherent problem. Consequently, this paper presents the development of a machine learning model for delay risk assessment in tall building projects. Initially, 36 delay risk factors were identified from previous literature, and subsequently developed into surveys to determine the likelihood and consequence of the risk factors. Forty-eight useable responses obtained from subject matter experts were used to develop a dataset suitable for machine learning application. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble methods were considered. Feature subset selection revealed that the most relevant independent variables include "slowness in decision making"; "delay in sub-contractors work"; "architects'/structural engineers' late issuance of instruction"; and "waiting for approval of shop drawings and material samples". The final results showed that the best model for predicting the risk of delay was based on ANN with a classification accuracy of 93.75%. Ultimately, the model developed in this study could support construction professionals in project risk management of tall buildings.

J	Papajohn, D; El Asmar, M				Papajohn, Dean; El Asmar, Mounir			Percent Base Design and Initial Award Performance in Design-Build Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; INNOVATION	The project influence curve postulates that planning efforts conducted early in a project can influence project success more than later efforts. Although front-end planning has been shown to influence project performance, the impact of involving the contractor in design-build (DB) of highway projects starting at different points of percent base design has not been tested empirically. This paper reports on a study of 31 DB highway projects with base design ranging from 10% to 95%. This research is significant because it empirically tests whether initial award performance is enhanced at lower percent base design as implied by the project influence curve. The F-statistic indicates that, for this set of DB highway projects, years of agency DB experience is significantly related to initial award performance, while percent base design is not. This research addresses the misconception held by many transportation agencies that procuring a DB entity with lower percent base design will result in more innovation, leading to more agency cost savings. Additionally, an analysis of alternative technical concepts (ATCs), the primary tool for innovation in DB, indicates that project savings are attributed to multiple ATCs rather than one ATC-and the innovations adopted tend to be incremental rather than systemic, disruptive, or radical.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 25 micro-level variables were identified from the literature review, and a questionnaire survey was performed with 138 professionals from both academia and industry. Then, the Spearman rank correlation was used to test whether there was agreement on ranking between the two respondent groups. Furthermore, the 25 variables were grouped into six underlying factors through the exploratory factor analysis. Findings The results indicated that the most critical variables were project desirability to the host country, relationship with governments, misconduct of contractors, public opposition to the project, experiential knowledge of political risks and advantageous conditions of contract. In addition, the opinions within each group were consistent and there was no significant disagreement on the rankings of variables between academics and practitioners. However, the academic and practitioner groups held different opinions on some individual variables. The impact direction of the variables was associated with confusion among the respondents. Originality/value The findings presented in this paper can help international construction enterprises effectively manage political risks in international construction projects.

Risk Assessment and Allocation in Highway Construction Projects in the UAE	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk management; Risk assessment; International construction; Highway construction projects; United Arab Emirates (UAE)	MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; MARKET	Highway construction projects carry substantial risks. This paper highlights the risks associated with highway construction projects in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Thirty-three risks are identified through detailed literature review. A questionnaire is then developed to solicit the opinion of construction professionals as to the probability and impact of those risks in addition to their proper allocation. Fifty-one surveys were completed and used in the analysis. The priority of each risk is calculated by multiplying the probability with the impact for each risk. The priority helps identify the most significant risks. The relative importance index (RII) for the risk priority is calculated based on all responses for each risk. The most significant risks include inefficient planning, unexpected ground utilities, quality and integrity of design, delays in approvals, and delays in expropriations. Internal project risks are found to be more significant than external risks. Contractors and consultants are in agreement on the risk rankings. Recommended allocation of risks is also presented. This research assists project managers to better estimate risks prior to the commencement of a project and allows them to develop proper mitigation measures at an early stage of a project.

J	Koc, K; Okudan, O				Koc, Kerim; Okudan, Ozan			Assessment of Life Cycle Risks of Deconstruction in Urban Regeneration Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Deconstruction; Urban regeneration; Demolition waste; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Risk management	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; FUZZY AHP APPROACH; DEMOLITION WASTE; REVERSE LOGISTICS; BUILDING DECONSTRUCTION; SUPPLY CHAIN; FOCUS GROUP; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Deconstruction is the eco-friendly alternative to demolition. It can help reduce the waste stream from urban regeneration projects (URPs) to landfills. The literature, however, does not provide a sufficient theoretical basis in terms of life cycle and life cycle risks of deconstruction. This lacking presents a major roadblock to its implementation in URPs. Thus, this paper introduces the deconstruction life cycle and a risk management framework to guide construction practitioners. Initially, the deconstruction life cycle, comprising 9 phases and 55 risk factors, was identified through a literature review and a focus group discussion. Then, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was conducted to assess the impact of each risk on deliverables of deconstruction. Results showed that risk management in deconstruction should be a cyclic process and cover the entire life cycle. Risks related to inaccurate estimations, quality, health and safety issues, insufficiency of building components to reuse and recycle, unavailability of deconstruction contractors, and lack of infrastructure were among the most significant risks of deconstruction. By revealing the life cycle and life cycle risks of deconstruction, this study highly contributes to theory as well as significant managerial implications.

Using Nigeria as a case study, the research developed strategies for improving the regulation of construction H&S in a complex regulatory environment. Semi-structured interviews, analysled thematically, was adopted. The proposed H&S improvement strategies include contextualised construction H&S legislation that will enable the establishment of a homogenous but flexible regulatory system. This will be overseen by an independent National Construction H&S regulator but with the controlled support of selected industry and social actors. The regulatory process will include persuasion (such as negotiation), punitive measures, education and awareness strategies. The proposed strategies also include that H&S legislation should stipulate duties for clients, contractors and subcontractors including goal-based legislation with mainly absolute duties, and prescriptive legislation or guidance. This should not be misconstrued as oversimplifying complex phenomena. The study could help policymakers and H&S experts in countries such as Nigeria develop strategies informed by realities of H&S regulatory complexities, in increasing the chance of workability and acceptance of the strategies proposed by the regulated.

J	Chao, LC; Kuo, CP				Chao, Li-Chung; Kuo, Chiang-Pin			Neural-Network-Centered Approach to Determining Lower Limit of Combined Rate of Overheads and Markup	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bids; Competition; Markup; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Overheads; Loss risk; Quantitative methods	PROJECTS; MODEL; DECISION; COST	In bidding for construction projects, a contractor often uses the simple method of adding a combined rate of overheads and markup on top of the estimated direct cost for arriving at a bid. If the rate is subjectively charged, a greater loss risk is involved. An improved approach to determining the lower limit of the rate for a project is proposed. A neural network model built from recent winning bids and project attributes maps the rate in the winning bid for a project and is used to estimate the probabilities of winning for various rate levels. Then, the minimum rate to be charged is determined based on minimization of the overall loss risk defined by a probabilistic model with the estimated probabilities of winning and project cost variability. The approach is illustrated by an example using a firm's bidding cases in Taiwan; the results are consistent with the features of the approach. In setting the lower limit of the overheads-cum-markup rate, the approach can be used to prevent arbitrary overcuts in bids under intense competition, thereby filling a gap among existing works and advancing the field of bidding.

J	Zhang, LH; Pan, CY; Zou, X				Zhang, Lihui; Pan, Chuyun; Zou, Xin			Criticality Comparison between the Repetitive Scheduling Method and the Network Model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Repetitive scheduling; Network; Conversion; Criticality; Resource continuity; Distance constraint; Project planning and design	PATH	Although the repetitive scheduling method (RSM) is more visual and straightforward and is easier to use, the network model is more commonly accepted by both owners and contractors as a means for modeling repetitive projects. In this paper, a method for converting an RSM into an equivalent network model is proposed, and the cause of differing makespans and critical paths in the relevant literature is examined. Using the proposed method for converting an RSM into a network model enables the transfer of both resource continuity requirements and distance constraints. For three different distinguishing cases, a comparison of critical paths and activity criticality is made between an RSM and a network model, with the results showing that the RSM coincides completely with the network in terms of the makespan, critical path, and activity criticality. From this comparison, variances in makespan and criticality in existing literature are caused by the conversion of backward-controlling RSM segments containing two or more subactivities, without maintaining resource continuity. This paper can help researchers to better understand the relationship between these two methodologies. It offers practitioners a method for easily and accurately converting an RSM to a network model when contractually required, and practitioners can accrue the benefits of both methodologies.

Improving Megasite Management Performance through Incentives: Lessons Learned from the Shanghai Expo Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Megasite management; Incentives; Shanghai Expo construction; People's Republic of China (PRC)	CONTRACTORS; PROGRAMS; SUCCESS	As the biggest expo site in history, construction of the Shanghai Expo site faced a lot of challenges, including involvement of lots of investors, megaconstruction scale, concurrent construction mode, involvement of more than 40,000 migrant workers, and extremely tight completion deadlines, among others. Consequently, these challenges imposed great obstacles on accomplishing the safety, quality, and environmental goals. Through a case study of the Shanghai Expo construction, this paper paper presents the design and implementation of multicriteria incentives in megaprojects to accomplish the safety, quality, and environmental goals. Both quantitative and qualitative findings were triangulated to demonstrate the outcome of the incentives. Six critical success factors (CSFs) for the incentives, rule design, process orientation, top management support, training and promotion, communication in process, and process learning and improvement are identified and validated through case study data and content analysis. It is believed that the findings of this paper can enhance understanding of multicriteria incentive schemes in general and provide insights in implementing these incentive schemes in future megaprojects, particularly in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

J	Xu, TJ; Tiong, RLK; Chew, DAS; Smith, NJ				Xu, TJ; Tiong, RLK; Chew, DAS; Smith, NJ			Development model for competitive construction industry in the people's Republic of China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PROJECTS	This paper identifies and analyzes the open-policy trend of the Chinese construction industry, which is characterized by trade liberalization, the underlying principle of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Compared to the construction industries in the United States, Japan, and the U.K., the construction industry in China is less developed in its legal framework, industrial structure, technological level, and international market share. To develop a competitive construction industry, the Chinese construction industry needs not only to accommodate appropriate international practice, but also to adapt and adopt it according to the market environment in China. A model to enhance the performance of the Chinese construction industry is proposed. The model consists of six modules: defining government's role, opening up the construction market and establishing a competitive mechanism, promoting design institutes' services and empowering professional bodies, encouraging technological innovations, upgrading employees' educational level, and adopting multiprocurement routes. Recognizing China's recent accession to the WTO and the attendant boost to its economy and industry development, the paper gives a timely evaluation of the post-WTO Chinese construction industry and proposes a model for its development. The model may serve the needs of academics, Chinese construction policymakers, construction enterprises, design institutes, and foreign contractors.

J	Ibem, EO; Laryea, S				Ibem, Eziyi O.; Laryea, Samuel			E-tendering in the South African construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-tendering; construction industry; questionnaire survey; South Africa	PROCUREMENT; PERFORMANCE	E-tendering is gaining recognition in the construction industry in many countries across the world. However, there is a limited understanding of the extent of its adoption in construction in African countries. Therefore, this research investigated the state of e-tendering in the South African construction industry using data derived from an online questionnaire survey involving 593 respondents, and oral interviews with selected construction clients, professional consultants, contractors and supply chain managers conducted in 2014 in South Africa. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analyses. It was found that 26% of the respondents were involved in e-tendering, and that 72.4% of them used e-mail, while 21% used web-based systems to support the execution of e-tendering activities. It was also revealed that the main benefits were reduction in transaction cost, and turnaround time of the tendering process, while the barriers to e-tendering in construction were slow Internet connectivity; resistance to change; expensive Internet services; and the inability of small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) to afford the technology, training and skills needed to engage in e-tendering. The paper concludes by suggesting ways for ensuring a critical mass uptake of e-tendering and maximising its benefits in the South African construction industry.

Institutional Knowledge and Global Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Engineering; International business; International development; Institutional knowledge; Institutional theory; Knowledge management.	MODEL	Projections for future demand in infrastructure and buildings indicate that there will be increasing opportunities for firms to engage in construction projects around the world. However, international construction projects also face numerous uncertainties. Foreign firms engaged on these projects must work in unfamiliar environments, with differing regulations, norms, and cultural beliefs. This can increase misunderstandings and risks for the entrant firm. To reduce these risks, successful international firms strategically increase their understanding of the local area by collecting knowledge that is important for a given foreign project. This study compiles and analyzes data from 15 case studies of three types of international firms (developers, contractors, and engineers) engaged in international infrastructure development to identify the types of institutional knowledge that informants indicate are important for their international projects. Using institutional theory, we categorize the kinds of knowledge about foreign country operations that managers deem to be important, expanding prior studies by attending to normative knowledge in addition to regulative and cultural knowledge. Finally, we analyze the importance of different categories of knowledge according to firm type. This analysis provides entrant firms a tool to help identify important types of institutional knowledge to collect as they undertake international projects.

A significant factor that can contribute to such overruns is rework; yet to date research into the root causes and consequential costs of rework in civil infrastructure projects has been limited. Using a questionnaire survey, rework costs and probable causes were obtained from 115 civil infrastructure projects. Stepwise multiple regression was then used to determine the significant variables that contributed to rework. The regression model revealed that the following five significant predictors accounted for 25% of the variance in total rework cost: (1) ineffective use of information technologies; (2) excessive client involvement in the project; (3) lack of clearly defined working procedures; (4) changes made at the request of the client; and (5) insufficient changes initiated by the contractor to improve quality. The findings also revealed that mean total rework costs were 10% of the contract value for the sample. Interestingly, the extent of rework experienced was significantly correlated with project cost and schedule growth (p < 0.01). It is suggested that future work is required to determine the underlying factors that contribute to rework in civil infrastructure projects before effective preventive strategies can be identified.

Causes of material delays in capital projects in Saudi Arabia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Delay; material management; project performance; Saudi Arabia	CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY	Projects in the oil and gas industry are typically accompanied by time extensions, cost overruns, and owners' disappointment. Material delay is one factor for project cost overrun, delays, poor productivity, and compromised quality. This study focuses on factors affecting material availability on capital projects. Twenty-three factors were identified from the literature and experts. These factors were listed in a survey distributed to professionals in Saudi Arabia within the oil and gas industry. Two categorizations were made: the first is based on the cause's impact, and the second is based on the frequency of occurrence of the identified cause. The collected responses were evaluated using the average, standard deviation, relative importance index, frequency index, the frequency adjusted importance index, and the risk matrix. The statistics revealed that the highest three causes in terms of both the frequency and importance are errors in the design and contractual documentation, poor estimation, and inflation of material costs. These results suggest that stakeholders should stress more in developing quality designs and contractual documents. Besides, contractors are recommended to enhance their material cost estimation methods and seriously consider material cost inflation and the fluctuation in material costs during the preparation of their bid prices.

However, the US construction industry often reports temporary increases in construction labor wages following large-scale disasters due to a gap between labor supply and demand, a concept known as demand surge. Utilizing publicly available big data related to the construction labor market and postdisaster infrastructure repair expenditures, this study seeks to (1) measure construction labor demand surge in the highways, roads, and bridges construction sector following federally-declared disasters in US metro-areas and (2) identify when such postdisaster demand surge occurs. A total of 118 US metro-areas were analyzed for demand surge following federally-declared disaster events from 2004 to 2017. Findings highlight inflated postdisaster construction labor wages in metro-areas, with the demand surge spiking within six months after a disaster. This data-driven study is the first to quantitatively measure postdisaster demand surge in the US highways, roads, and bridges sector following multihazard disaster events. Knowledge of the demand surge can guide predisaster planning and decision-making processes for local, state, and national agencies and inform postdisaster best practices for contractors and engineers coordinating transportation system construction projects.

Addressing the lack of empirical research into how trust forms within such projects, this exploratory study mobilises swift trust theory to investigate the process of trust formation within a multinational disaster project management team formed in response to tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji in 2016. In-depth content analysis of qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with disaster management team members, non-participant observation of the disaster project management teams during the disaster response and analysis of disaster management documentation appear to support the predictions of swift trust theory in relation to the importance of reputation, role and interdependence in building swift trust. However, theoretical predictions around the importance of categorical assumptions, confirmation of assumptions and the leadership role of the contractor did not appear to be supported by our data. It is concluded that while swift trust theory can potentially provide valuable practical and theoretical insights into trust formation in multinational disaster project management teams, it may need to be adapted to more accurately model trust formation in a disaster project management context.

Until now, project alliances have focused mostly on large-scale road, rail and water infrastructure projects. Despite the positive results achieved in these projects, the building and real estate sector has been rather reluctant to use this delivery method. The objective of this study was to find out whether it makes sense to use project alliancing in more everyday projects. The chosen case study is a renovation construction project in Finland that was contracted using the project alliance approach. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the issues involved, a literature review was conducted and case project-specific documentation analysed. Subsequently, several interviews were conducted with project participants, paying particular attention to the experiences and feedback obtained from developer, contractor and designer sides. In terms of the project participants' perspectives, the alliance was unanimously seen as an asset which contributed to high levels of collaboration between participants and made it possible to achieve positive results.

BIM for construction safety improvement in Gaza strip: awareness, applications and barriers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; application; barriers; safety performance; construction	MANAGEMENT	The objectives of this paper are to elicit the perception of contracting parties regarding building information modelling (BIM), the most important safety-related applications of BIM and the barriers to adopting BIM in the local construction industry. Data for this study were collected through a questionnaire survey. A total of 75 questionnaires were randomly distributed to contractors, owners and consultants, and 37 were returned, representing a 49% response rate. The findings indicated that 33% of the respondents had no knowledge of the concept of BIM, 28% of the respondents' organizations are not using BIM and if used it was implemented to a limited extent. The results indicated that 'hazard identification and minimization' and 'safety training and education' are the most important safety-related applications provided by BIM tools to improve safety performance in construction. Lack of universal use in the construction sector and insufficient training availability are the highest ranked barriers to adopting BIM in construction to improve safety. The research results may assist BIM developers to introduce the best applicable tools to improve safety performance in the construction industry. It is recommended that training courses be conducted regarding BIM concept and the benefits of its application in the construction industry.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Learning Curve Models for Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Best-fit curves; Competencies; Learning curve theory; Regression analysis	SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; JOB	Workplace training aims to enhance the performance of trainees by improving their specific skills. Unfortunately, the outcome of such trainings in terms of the percentage of increase in trainees' performance is not generally measured. On one hand, this lack of measurement results in contractors not recognizing the importance of training in enhancing workers' performance, and on the other hand, the training providers do not receive constructive feedback on the efficacy of their sessions. This study therefore attempts to bridge this gap by developing a regression model of the socioemotional, cognitive, and technical skills of workers and their performance. Data was collected on 137 workers from four training centers in India. Using the developed model, a learning curve was drawn between performance and training time. Additionally, skills versus training time curves were also plotted. The results indicate that workers' performance after training was far below the desired level of employers; the reason for this emerges from skills versus training time curves, where it is found that the training does not focus on enhancing socioemotional and cognitive skills. Therefore, the study recommends that training providers incorporate these skills in their training curriculum to achieve more desirable outputs from training.

However, this will lead to congestion as a major contributing factor that can affect labour productivity and significantly impact the construction process. Various studies have analyzed the effects of congestion on labour productivity; however, they fail to quantify the impacts of congestion on labour productivity. Therefore, this paper applies the Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) as an effective tool for predicting the effects of congestion on labour productivity in construction projects. A Java-based application is developed as an implementation of the proposed model. Based on a real case study, the paper discusses the potential benefits of the model, e.g., accurately predicting labour productivity, providing opportunity for workspace allocation, and simulating project reality in a virtual model. The simulation results demonstrate a 30% decrease in productivity due to congestion. The results confirm that the impacts of congestion on labour productivity at a construction site can be predicted as an emergent property from the interaction between workers, tasks, and their environment, i.e., a construction site, as well as the dynamics of varying productivity.

J	CASEY, JJ; RUSSELL, JS				CASEY, JJ; RUSSELL, JS			OWNERSHIP TRANSFER OF DESIGN ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION FIRMS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								For businesses, and the design engineering/construction industry in particular, there are few events as important as transferring the ownership of a business because many factors are involved where ownership transfer is desired. Many industry professionals lack an understanding of these factors, consequently putting the efficiency of the transfer at risk. This paper addresses the various factors of ownership transfer from legal and nonlegal perspectives, with particular emphasis upon the practical implications of these factors in the everyday context of the design engineering and/or construction firm. Legal tools are proposed that in proper situations may properly effectuate ownership transfer. This paper emphasizes a coherent and chronological approach to ownership transfer, although in many situations a different approach may be required. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance to design engineering and construction firms in planning for ownership transfer for several reasons: (1) Planning enables the firm to remain as an ongoing business concern and perform its professional obligations; and (2) planning reduces the possibility of design engineer/contractor failure by providing for professional and economic continuity between the old and new owners. This paper presents the various factors involved in this process and illustrates the importance of recognizing these factors within the whole process of ownership transfer.

Based on social exchange theory, this study presents a novel approach extended from stakeholder value network (SVN) to identify the critical relational behavior and unveil the reciprocal multi-type relational behavior exchanges among the main stakeholders in megaprojects. Built upon six relational behavior types and 110 relational behavior flows, a qualitative relational behavior SVN (RB-SVN) model was first constructed. Questionnaire surveys from 224 megaproject managers were then used to quantify the RB-SVN model. By analyzing critical relational behavior types, flows, and cycles, we found that effective communication is the most significant relational behavior type for stakeholders. Owner-designer cooperation could create the largest relationship value through reciprocal relational behavior. The top 10 restricted (dyadic) and general exchanges were also identified to help promote stakeholders to engage in critical relational behavior cycles. This research contributes to the broad literature on relationship management, and more specifically, furthers the understanding of relational behavior networks that strengthen the relationship value of multiple stakeholders in megaprojects.

J	Wu, X; Xu, F				Wu, Xi; Xu, Feng			Detection Model for Unbalanced Bidding in Railway Construction Projects: Considering the Risk of Quantity Variation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Detection model; Unascertained measurement theory; Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy; Unbalanced bidding; Quantity variation; Railway construction projects		The application of a unit-price contract is nascent in railway construction projects in China. The investment risks for owners arising from unbalanced bidding in unit-price contracts should be given significant attention. Many models have been developed to help contractors place unbalanced bids, making the work of detecting unbalanced bidding even more difficult, especially the quantity error exploitation type of unbalanced bidding. Most detection models fail to consider the risks of quantity variation, a frequent occurrence in railway construction projects. Accordingly, this study developed a model for detecting unbalanced bidding based on an unascertained measurement theory and a analytic hierarchy process-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The proposed model considers the risks in quantity variations. A hierarchical structure model was established to calculate the risks in quantity variations from different line items. A case study was presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed models for identifying and detecting quantity error exploitation unbalanced bids in railway construction projects. The model proposes a method for detecting the quantity error exploitation type of unbalanced bidding in railway construction projects, and can effectively improve accuracy without requiring a large amount of data from previous projects.

However, there is no independent research that illustrates what measures ought to be implemented for the success of future projects using BVP. The purposes of this study are (1) to describe the BVP method thoroughly, (2) explore the experiences with the method from the Netherlands and Norway, and (3) develop suggestions for what measures ought to be implemented for the success of future projects using BVP. In addition to a literature review and document study, 11 Dutch cases and 4 Norwegian cases were studied through semistructured interviews with 28 key informants. This study identified several practical challenges practitioners are facing while using BVP. To avoid the problems documented in the case projects, both the method and its implementation should be improved continuously based on the current experiences. Recommendations for improvement are provided in this paper. Testing their effectiveness is a topic for future research. This paper contributes to construction engineering and management practice to increase the understanding of BVP by suggesting what kind of measures ought to be taken for the success of future projects using the method.

Equipment management for a single project is, in itself, challenging, and large contractors who want to achieve long-term success must also manage equipment at an intraorganizational level. While vast amounts of data are collected and updated dynamically to track equipment status within an organization, current practices do not consider these data during the decision-making process. Rather, companies often rely on a single metric, equipment utilization, for evaluating management performance. Inspired by the ability of social network analysis (SNA) to examine the interactions and relationships between objects, a SNA-based method for investigating equipment movement between project sites and equipment shops is proposed. This study proposes a novel performance metric, the direct dispatch index (DDI), which adds a distance weight to the clustering coefficient of SNA, to measure equipment dispatching performance from equipment logistics data. Historical equipment logistics data from the equipment and project management systems of a company in Alberta, Canada, were used to demonstrate the functionality and feasibility of the proposed approach. The methodology was found capable of evaluating the logistical effort associated with equipment dispatch and planning, thereby enhancing equipment management through improved decision-making.

Recent governmental investigations argue that Swedish local planning authorities' requirement setting practices stifle the potential for increased industrialization. Yet, no previous research has accounted for the industrialized housebuilders' perspective. We aim to explore industrialized housebuilders' interpretations of local requirement setting, using institutional logics to increase the understanding of how structure and human agency influence the emergence of local requirements. Interviews were conducted with representatives of five industrialized housebuilders who together span the Swedish multi-family housing market. Findings indicate that industrialized housebuilders do not perceive intentional local requirement setting as problematic, yet struggle to cope with interpretive local requirement setting. Findings also necessitate distinguishing local requirement setting in the exercise of public authority from local requirement setting in public procurement. The agency structure dualism contributes an understanding of interpretive local requirement setting in the exercise of public authority as an expression of agency and of local requirement setting in public procurement as one of structure. Furthermore, using an institutional logics approach is found to provide an accentuation of human agency and the individual level of analysis that is often absent from construction management research.

Neural Network Model for the Prediction of Safe Work Behavior in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Behavior; Neural network; Prediction; Safety climate; Labor and personnel issues	CLIMATE; CULTURE; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; PERCEPTIONS; ACCIDENTS; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; VALIDITY	A model has been developed employing an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the safe work behavior of employees using 10 safety climate constructs determined through literature review. The model utilizes safety climate constructs (determinants) as inputs and safe work behavior as an output. Two hundred twenty-two responses from several construction projects across India were collected through a questionnaire survey. A three-layer feed-forward back-propagation neural network (10-11-1) was appropriate in building this model which has been trained, validated, and tested with sufficient data sets. The model predicts the safe work behavior of employees reasonably well. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to study the impact of each construct on the safe work behavior of employees. As a result, safety climate constructs like supervisory environment, work pressure, employees' involvement, personal appreciation of risk, and supportive environment were significantly associated with the safe work behavior of employees. This model has great potential in aiding contractors and clients in promoting safe work behavior and the efficient management of the safety of employees in construction projects.

Automated construction of the paghuashan tunnel for Taiwan high speed rail (THSR) project	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction	SEP 21-25, 2004	Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA			tunnel; automation; Taiwan; BOT		The Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) project is the most significant infrastructure development in Taiwan, and the largest Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project in the world. The project is required to be completed and in operation as soon as possible. The THSR's longest main tunnel, at 7364 in long crossing Paghuashan hills, was considered as the most critical sub-phase of the project. To ensure effective control of this critical phase, the joint venture contractor brought highly efficient construction equipment and fresh planning ideas into Taiwan. The main tunnel's excavation work was carried out using a method minimizing harmful loosening of adjacent groundmass. Engineering records reveal that the Paghuashan project was implemented successfully. The project was completed two months ahead of schedule, and even recorded the best monthly excavated length of 250 in, marking a significant milestone in the progress of the THSR project. This paper introduces the cycle of excavating and lining technique used in constructing this key tunnel, and an the analysis of work productivity through the utilization of these automated equipment and facilities. This investigation also provides detailed insight and experience for future long tunnel construction, particularly in bidding for Design-Build (DB) contracts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Research was conducted to find the construction delay causes and mitigation measures. Literature reveals that different countries experience various causes of delays and significances of these causes are different based on project types. This study explores delay causes in Kazakhstan's construction industry and analyzes their influence on different types of construction projects. Fifty-five delay causes relevant to construction projects in Kazakhstan have been identified through literature review and primary interviews with selected construction professionals. Afterwards, a comprehensive survey was conducted among the industry professionals. The survey results show that different delay causes have different importance based on the project types (industrial, residential, commercial, etc). Moreover, project parties (client, contractor and consultant) have different views on the delay causes. Accordingly, the study ranks delay causes based on project parties and project types and compares their correlations. Finally, recommendations for the most prominent delay causes have been provided. This study provides better understanding on delay causes and gives important guideline for stakeholders of Kazakhstani construction industry and other construction professionals in the world to control their projects. Similar studies can be conducted in other countries to identify causes and remedial measures for delays.

J	Chao, LC; Chien, CF				Chao, Li-Chung; Chien, Ching-Fa			Estimating Project S-Curves Using Polynomial Function and Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The S-curve is a graphical representation of a construction project's cumulative progress from start to finish. While S-curves for project control during construction should be estimated analytically based on a schedule of activity times, empirical estimation methods using various mathematical S-curve formulas have been developed for initial planning at predesign stages, with the mean for past similar projects often used as the basis of prediction. In an attempt to make an improvement, a succinct cubic polynomial function for generalizing S-curves is proposed and a comparison with existing formulas shows its advantages of accuracy and simplicity. Based on an analysis of the attributes and actual progress of 101 projects, four factors, i.e., contract amount, duration, type of work, and location, are then used as the inputs of a model developed for estimating S-curves as represented by the polynomial parameters. For model development, it is proposed to use neural networks for their ability to perform complex nonlinear mapping. The neural network model is compared with statistical models with respect to modeling and testing accuracy. The results show that the presented methodology can achieve error reduction consistently, thereby being potentially useful for owners and contractors in early financial planning and checking schedule-based estimates.

Forecasting Ratio of Low Bid to Owner's Estimate for Highway Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ratio of low bid to owner's estimate; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Time series analysis; Construction bidding; Cost estimating	COST; PRICES; RISK; MODELS; NUMBER	Several state departments of transportation (state DOTs) have encountered significant challenges to accurately estimate costs of their highway projects. It is not uncommon that states' DOT estimates (owner's estimates) are significantly different from contractors' submitted bids. This is a critical problem for state highway agencies that strive to develop more accurate cost estimates, deliver projects within the budget, and optimize constrained funds for their highway programs. This inaccuracy problem is a temporal issue since the engineer's estimate is developed ahead of time before the project is advertised and bids are received. The question that transportation agencies are interested in finding an answer to is: are there any significant risk factors in the construction market indicating to the increased likelihood of the deviation between owner's estimate and the submitted low bid? In this research, a temporal perspective is selected to answer this question through identifying risk factors affecting the accuracy of the owner's estimate. The ratio of low bid to owner's estimate is examined using time-series analysis. The objectives of this research are to (1) examine several variables representing local highway construction market, overall construction market, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market, to identify the leading indicators of ratio of low bid to owner's estimate; and (2) use the identified leading indicators to develop an appropriate time-series model to forecast the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate. Four variables are identified as the major leading indicators: (1) number of projects awarded in the same month at the state level; (2) average number of bidders last month; (3) producer price index for steel mill products (PPISM); and (4) construction cost index (CCI). Several seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) models are developed that are capable of forecasting the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate with a high accuracy. This research contributes to the state of knowledge of analyzing the difference between owner's estimate and low bid through: (1) identification of leading indicators of ratio of low bid to owner's estimate that convey the extent of risk and uncertainty associated with construction projects at the cost estimation phase; and (2) development of appropriate multivariate time-series models (i.e., ARIMAX models) to predict the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate. It is anticipated that the results will help cost estimating professionals in transportation agencies better understand the variability between their estimates and submitted bids by highway contractors, and thus, prepare more accurate cost estimates and develop appropriate risk management strategies for enhanced decision-making.

To address the issue, numerous studies have explored cost overrun risks (CORs). Nevertheless, their methods of identifying risk relationship are susceptible to experts' experience. In addition, they fail to unearth the relationship structure information and analyze the risk propagation effect. To fill these gaps, this paper intends to propose a methodology that integrates the engineering case analysis and complex network theory, so as to obtain a stable relationship structure and reveal its inherent property. First, 52 CORs and 158 risk paths are extracted from 156 engineering cases, followed by the establishment of a cost overrun risk propagation network (CORPN). Finally, the statistical properties of CORPN are explored. The results indicate that CORPN presents the topological property of heterogeneity. A large number of risk paths can be blocked through preventing the CORs with large total degree, like delay in construction period and engineering quantity increase. Meanwhile, CORPN shows the small-world property. The efficiency of risk propagation can be reduced through preventing the CORs with high betweenness centrality, such as lack of technical skill and experience. These findings contribute to the formulation of beforehand strategies that promote the cost management.

Based on how they procure consultants and contractors, it is argued that public clients have the power and are in the position to act as "innovation supporters" and "change agents." However, the client's role as a driver of change and innovation is oversimplified and there is a need for further investigation into the client's ability to drive industry change. This paper presents a case study of a public client's initiative to drive industry change through the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM). We do this by investigating the process of intra-organisational change at the public client by mapping the client's absorptive capacity for change. The case study shows difficulties in turning the external knowledge into actual transformation when implementing a systemic innovation such as BIM. Findings contribute to the literature on public clients as drivers of change and innovation in construction and are relevant to research on public clients as drivers for industry change and innovation and to research on BIM as a game changer.

At present, it is unclear if and to what extent construction safety risk tolerance vary across broad geographic regions. To better understand patterns in these sociocultural constructs, a survey of building trade contractors and subcontractors was administered. Using principal component analysis and K-means clustering, the determinants of risk tolerance were analyzed for 11,997 construction workers from 17 countries via controlled sampling for equal representation. The analysis showed that risk tolerance is influenced and linked by individual and sociocultural determinants, i.e., affective associations, control beliefs, safety culture, and risk-taking attitudes. Differences and distinct groupings were observed when the derived global risk tolerance scores were compared to country-specific risk-tolerance scores. This study contributes to the literature by empirically identifying determinants of risk tolerance and quantifying cross-cultural disparities in risk tolerance. It was found that the natural grouping of countries, based on their risk-tolerance determinants, coincides with their ancestral heritage and socioeconomic systems. The results can be used to inform policymakers, stakeholders, safety professionals, and industry leaders to improve safety decisions in the workplace, promote strong situational awareness, design structural policies, and implement safety programs.

J	Hanna, AS; Iskandar, KA; Lotfallah, W				Hanna, Awad S.; Iskandar, Karim A.; Lotfallah, Wafik			Benchmarking project performance: a guideline for assessing vulnerability of mechanical and electrical projects to productivity loss	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Productivity; quantitative analysis; risk management	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; CHANGE ORDERS; IMPACT; EFFICIENCY; OVERTIME; MODEL	Loss of productivity is a contentious issue that has a profound impact on modern construction, yet existing literature provides no quantitative, data-driven method to compare the productivity of different construction projects or to assess their vulnerability to productivity loss. A new mathematically derived metric, called the "Risk of Productivity Loss (RPL)" score, provides such a method. RPL is a function of multiple distinct productivity factors. The RPL score is developed from a dataset of 166 electrical and mechanical projects, which collectively amount to 7.2 million labour hours. This large sample size makes the RPL score a reliable productivity benchmark for the electrical and mechanical construction industries due to their labour-intensive nature. The higher the RPL score, the higher the risk that a given project will suffer from productivity losses. To supplement the mathematical formula presented, objective data-based weights for multiple key productivity factors have been identified, reducing the subjectivity that affects many of the existing weighting assessment methods. RPL provides the industry with a single metric that allows tracking and assessment of productivity for multiple projects at a time so that a contractor may assess the successful reduction of productivity risk factors within the projects in their company.

One of the strategies to respond to risk is through the proper allocation of contingency amounts. The purpose of this research paper is to assess perceived ratings of cost and schedule impact, and relative importance of the identified risk drivers on cost contingency amounts. The preidentified risk drivers were evaluated using survey responses from professionals in the context of highway transportation projects. The stepwise regression modeling was used to analyze the dependency relationship between predetermined cost contingency amounts in these projects and the perceived ratings of risk drivers assessed by project professionals. The study found that inadequate constructability reviews had a significant influence on determining owner's contingency, whereas changes by owner's request impacted both the owner's and the contractor's contingency amount, and also had a significant impact on a project schedule. The models developed and the methodology used in developing these models could be used in the planning phase of similar highway construction projects to apportion risk-appropriate contingency percentage.

This research is significant as the outsourcing of scaffolding is integral to its use and productivity toward LNG infrastructure project completion. As such, this paper presents the research undertaken on the subcontracting of scaffold manufacturing, supplying and delivering. It focuses upon the organisations, management and control in scaffolding subcontracting. A comparative analysis of three organisations was carried out to reveal issues with current practice in manufacturing, supplying and delivering scaffold products for assembly onsite. Their management and control approaches are also compared and contrasted. It is found that, while the divided contract approach may help save costs, enhance market exposure and is ideal when choice of subcontractor is limited, its risks can impact upon the entire project and be difficult for the contractor to control. The limited background in scaffolding studies and importance of subcontracting within LNG infrastructure projects has made this research timely. This paper identifies issues in relation to quality assurance, warranties and rework, which have the potential to mitigate any cost benefits obtained from subcontracting practices within this supply chain.

REVIEW ON WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE HONG KONG CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY: USE OF SPECTRAL AND BISPECTRAL METHODS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						waste management system; construction and demolition waste; power spectrum; bispectral; construction; Hong Kong	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT	The Hong Kong government has implemented various measures to reduce waste, including a waste disposal ordinance, a green manager scheme, a waste reduction framework plan, a pilot concrete recycling plant, waste management systems and a landfill charging scheme. However, there are difficulties in implementing the waste management systems for contractors. This paper examines the existing implementation of waste management systems in the Hong Kong construction industry. Major sources of construction waste, awareness to install environment-friendly activities, benefits, difficulties and recommendations in the implementation of waste management systems are discussed. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. Power spectra and bispectra of the survey data are introduced to assess the implementation of the existing waste management systems. It is found that formwork and temporary hoardings are the major sources of construction waste. Improving environmental performance is ranked as the least project scope for construction projects. "Propose methods for reducing waste" is the major benefit gained. However, "Lack of well-known effective waste management methods" is the major difficulty encountered by organisations. "Use of metal formwork", "Use of prefabricated building components" and "Use of non-timber hoarding" are the recommended methods to improve the existing implementation of waste management systems.

J	Lin, YC				Lin, Yu-Cheng			Developing construction assistant experience management system using people-based maps	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						experience management; people-based maps; information system; web-based application; construction	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	Experience management encompasses the processes governing creation, storage, reuse, maintenance, dissemination and evaluation of experience relevant to a particular situation or problem-solving context. In the construction industry, experience can be reapplied and shared among engineers and participants to enhance construction processes and minimize costs and problem-solving time. This study presents a novel people-based maps (PBMs) approach that captures and represents engineer experience and project knowledge. This approach enables users to survey and access engineer and expert experience from similar projects and assess their tacit and explicit experience. This study applies experience management principles to the construction phase of construction projects and develops a construction assistant people-based map experience management (APMEM) system for contractors. The APMEM system is then applied to a Taiwan high-tech construction project to verify the efficacy of the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing experience during the construction phase. Experience can be captured and reused to benefit future projects by effectively utilizing PBMs and web technology during the construction phase of a project. Combined experimental results of this study indicate that an APMEM system provides an effective experience management platform for other construction projects by adopting a PBMs approach.

Operational Framework for Managing Construction-Contract Administration Practitioners' Perspective through Modified Delphi Method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract management; Contract administration; Delphi; Performance assessment; Operational framework		Effective construction contract administration (CCA) is a core competency for the management of construction projects. The consequences of poor contract administration can be catastrophic, and it may necessitate extensive investigation of factors affecting the CCA performance. This paper presents an operational and systematic multidimensional contract administration performance framework (CAPF) in order to assist the client, the consultant, and the contractor to effectively plan, manage, measure, monitor, and control the CCA performance. Past research, semistructured interviews, and a two-round Delphi study were used to identify the importance of 93 operational key factors in 11 project management categories that affect CCA performance. The worst-case scenario of the mode score, mode value, and standard deviation to mean ratio (SDMR) were conducted to check the overall agreement on Delphi rounds. The mean value and interrater agreement (IRA) analyses were applied to quantify the significance and strength of the agreement of the identified factors on project performance. Furthermore, the external validity of the framework was validated by two real construction projects and the results indicated substantial improvements in CCA performance by better implementation and introduction of new factors. This study contributes to the construction management body of knowledge by introducing a comprehensive framework that would cover the limitations of the existing studies.

Such prediction assists in obtaining early warnings against potential problems. Existing project performance forecasting models are fragmented, especially regarding the consideration of interdependency between multidimensional performance indicators. To address these limitations, a system dynamics (SD) model was developed to simulate the complexities that exist among interdependent variables and forecast their dynamics over time. The proposed model integrates eight construction project performance indices, which have been identified through literature review and interviews with domain experts. Performance dimensions include cost, schedule, quality, profitability, safety, environment, team satisfaction, and client satisfaction. This model focuses on the construction phase of projects under unit price contracts and is intended for use by contractors. The model was tested on a road construction project to assess its practicality and accuracy. Results demonstrate general agreement between actual and forecasted performance indices. The model was also used to simulate four possible intervention scenarios by the project manager. Results of various scenarios show overall agreement with expected impacts of the interventions. The research advances the state of practice and knowledge of project performance forecasting through the creation of a more holistic and interdependent model of project performance metrics.

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Trust; lean; design management; information flow; design quality		Low trust levels among project parties are generally believed to harm construction project performance, but the role of trust in the context of information flow and solving design quality problems (DQP) remains understudied. Whereas lean design management research highlights the importance of managing information flow, few studies have investigated the association between trust, information flow and DQP (or any combination thereof). This exploratory study investigates the association between trust and information flow in design projects and how these factors influence design quality. The paper presents a conceptual framework based on existing research on building design management and trust in a project context. The framework is elaborated on and validated using a single case study approach with multiple sites. The results indicate that even though the trust trend in the project is somewhat negatively connected to the overall amount of work and work in progress of DQP, increasing trust is not a prerequisite for solving DQP and that owners and contractors can have opposite opinions on the trust level. This study contributes to ongoing discussions about trust, information flow and design management and suggests that teams should focus on improving communication and collaboration to compensate for low trust levels.

Critical success factor analysis for effective risk management at the execution stage of a construction project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk management; critical success factors; execution stage; construction management	IMPLEMENTATION	Despite the importance of proper risk management during the construction execution stage, the current studies mainly focus on risk management at the planning stage. In order to effectively manage risks and accomplish a project success, it is instrumental to manage and mitigate risks at the execution stage where the most of risks are actually occurred. Hence, this research aims to identify the most critical success factors for effective risk management at the execution stage of a construction project. A mixed method was adopted to identify the priorities among various success factors for risk management through a questionnaire survey, and follow-up interviews were conducted to retrieve more insights and lessons learnt from construction professionals. Total 55 construction professionals responded that a) Project management capacity; b) knowledge and experience; c) early involvement of contractors and d) socio-cultural forces are the most critical success factors for successful risk management during the execution stage. This research identified the critical success factors and its relative importance expected to provide a means for the construction professionals to prioritise critical success factors for risk management at the execution stage, and it will serve a risk management supporting tool to make a proper plan and decision on risks.

J	Teng, Y; Li, X; Wu, P; Wang, XY				Teng, Yue; Li, Xiao; Wu, Peng; Wang, Xiangyu			Using cooperative game theory to determine profit distribution in IPD projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IPD; cooperative game theory; BIM; Shapley value; profit distribution	RISK-MANAGEMENT; TRENDS; POWER	IPD (Integrated Project Delivery) mode is regarded as an effective project delivery method that could achieve the consensus project goals by a collaborative team. However, the number of projects using IPD remains small, partly because of the lack of a fair incentive scheme. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fair profit distribution scheme among stakeholders of IPD projects. This study uses cooperative game theory as the method for analyzing profit distribution among the designer, construction contractor, owner and BIM consultant. The Shapley value is used as the solution to the cooperative game theory because it can assess the marginal contribution of each stakeholder to the coalition. In addition, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are used to assess the risk levels of each stakeholder to modify the profit distribution based on the marginal contribution. A modified Shapley value model, which includes four categories of risk factors, i.e. operation, economic, profit and market risks, was established in this study. The results show that the modified Shapley value can help establish a fair profit distribution scheme for the IPD projects. Practitioners are also encouraged to focus on information sharing to reach the full potential of IPD.

J	Pareek, P; Han, S; Misra, S				Pareek, Pranjal; Han, Sangwon; Misra, Sudhir			Application of Bayesian updating for real-time schedule estimation in a concreting operation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						real-time simulation; Bayesian updating technique; ready-mixed concrete; schedule estimation	SIMULATION; PROJECT; MODEL	Ready-Mixed Concrete (RMC) delivery schedules should be carefully planned due to the limited time span between mixing and placing. The scheduling of RMC supply is challenging to both contractors and plant managers because of multiple operational issues such as traffic conditions and unloading delays. Simulation has been applied to address this challenge; however, the unique and complex nature of construction environments raises a validity issue in the use of previous datasets as input for the simulation of a new operation. Based on this recognition, the idea of using real-time data has been proposed to address the input data validity issue and to enhance the predictability of the simulation model. One important concern that has not yet been fully addressed regarding this issue is the amount of data collection required to yield a valid sample such that the output is sufficiently reliable. To answer this question, this paper uses a Bayesian updating technique with data collected from a concreting operation in a high-rise building project in Abu Dhabi. Through the case study it is concluded that the Bayesian forecasting technique has great potential for providing a better statistical representation of operational data and improving the predictability of the simulation model.

A system with integrated processes, however, is able to function dynamically in response to variability in product demand and labour resources. This investigation aims to compare and contrast cross-training strategies that are applicable to off-site construction in order to create multi-skilled resources. To this end, the optimal number of additional skills was formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Then, production data from two prefabricated production facilities in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia were used to construct a total of 1080 simulation experiments. Tangible performance metrics of systems were used to compare process integration strategies and use of multi-skilled resources. Findings show that choosing optimal process integration architecture depends on the level of capacity imbalance and processing time variability. This investigation optimises the decision making on process integration in off-site construction networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Agent-based construction supply chain simulator (CS2) for measuring the value of real-time information sharing in construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							OVERLOAD; PROJECTS	This paper presents an agent-based construction supply chain simulator (CS2) that leverages computer agents technology for modeling a virtual construction supply chain. Although construction managers and contractors do not consciously consider a supply chain and its management, they all interact with the members of a supply chain and make related decisions. Having real-time information available at any time can increase information transparency, which in turn makes it easier for project managers to identify potential risks. CS2 is a modified version of the beer game that has been widely used for illustrating the importance of real-time information in the manufacturing process. Two different types of simulations are presented in this paper, namely human-to-human and computer-to-human interactive simulation. In the simulations, a group of people play different roles, as does the current practice in construction. Results of this simulation test and verify the significance of real-time information sharing in construction. In addition, how the quantity of information affects the value of real-time information using the concept of illusion in cognitive science is investigated. The developed CS2 can be further used for educational purposes as well as for addressing the valuable lesson of real-time information sharing to practitioners.

One of the most effective solutions to hedging against building operation optimization is incorporating energy efficiency measures and architectural programming early. This paper proposes a Smart Integrated Workspace Design (SIWD) framework that integrates architectural programming system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology into the Value Engineering (VE) process to assess design alternatives targeted explicitly at future smart office buildings. The use of the SIWD led to an improved development cycle linking architectural plans and engineering design. An empirical test using a large building owner, their designers, and contractors in Jakarta, Indonesia, resulted in an 18% improvement in building energy performance and quality when the design team used the SIWD framework. It is also indicated that leveraging advanced technology and incorporating familiar concepts and processes increased user willingness to adopt the SIWD in future projects. So, incorporated the IoT in architectural design and evaluated by VE made the readiness and friendly technology to all occupants to get the building efficiency and comfort unsteady.

Many studies suggest such pre-service fatigue can result in poor working performance and high casualty risks among construction workers. To ensure workers are well-rested before duties, contractors initiate various pre-service fatigue screening approaches. Traditional screening highly relies on the site managers' subjective judgment and workers' physical appearances due to the lack of practical, objective, and automated fatigue assessment tools. In addition, compared with physical fatigue, mental fatigue is even more difficult to be recognized merely through observation. This research proposes a novel screening method capable of measuring workers' mental fatigue with wearable electroencephalography (EEG) equipment. Through analyzing the EEG spectral parameters, such as gravity frequency and power spectral entropy, this study implemented four assessing indicators and developed a quantitative method to assess a subject's mental fatigue level. To verify the proposed method, an in-lab fatigue test was conducted. The experiment results reported that the screening targets can be successfully identified by comparing their test performance and reaction time.

Resource optimisation in line of balance scheduling	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Repetitive projects; resource scheduling; line of balance; optimization; nonlinear mathematical programming	CONSTRUCTION; CPM	The Critical Path Method (CPM) has failed practically for scheduling repetitive projects and Line Of Balance (LOB) has emerged as an alternative for scheduling such projects. Because of the size of most repetitive projects, efficient resource management plays a vital role in their successful implementation. However, resource levelling and allocation have not been formally investigated in repetitive projects. Heuristic methods and optimization techniques have been traditionally used to solve resource scheduling problems like the latter. Although heuristic methods can handle large-size projects, they do not guarantee optimal solutions. In this paper, resource levelling and allocation problems under LOB scheme are modelled as an optimization problem that guarantees optimal solutions. Resource continuity and logical dependency between activities are maintained where constant activity progress rate is assumed. An example project is used to demonstrate the details of model formulation. A complete solution for the range of feasible project durations is obtained as a Time-Resource Trade-Off curve. A pipeline project is used to validate the developed model revealing that the developed model is superior. The proposed model provides contractors with a complete picture for resource usage along with the range of feasible project durations from which the optimal alternative can be selected.

The conflict occurrence process over construction projects was structured as four stages based on the paradigm model approach of grounded theory. Two types of Korean cases (the first one is linear facilities and the second one is clustered facilities) were analyzed using the proposed framework. The study examined that each infrastructure type has its own pattern during conflict occurrences, with the impact of conflict factors also varying significantly. The results showed that the procedure of deciding facility's location and its route is commonly extracted as a major factor. For linear infrastructure facilities, the validity of the public engagement process and technical alternatives to mitigate conflict were distilled as major factors. In contrast, environmental and ecological concerns in the early site selection phase, because the facility required a large amount of territory, was identified as more important for clustered infrastructure facilities. This framework is expected to be useful for conflict analysis from the early stage of public projects, according to the inherent characteristics of the given infrastructure project.

This research reviews the updated scientific contributions of knowledge management in construction, as well as its influence. The results come from a bibliometric study, elaborating a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the current state. The research method was divided into the following stages: preliminary approach to the bibliography, establishment of search strategies, selection and classification of articles, quantitative analysis and discussion of relevant articles. Three main factors were identified: use and exploitation of knowledge, knowledge transfer, and information technologies; five complementary facets were also identified: culture, innovation, quality, knowledge generation and human factors. The results reaffirm the importance of the use and exploitation of knowledge, in addition to increasing attention to the transfer and technology of information. However, the generation of knowledge has declined because the sector still does not report the results of applying knowledge, and this underlines the need for the future study of strategies to transform tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.

This study examines the antecedents and consequences of relational behavior of participating organizations in megaprojects based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A sample of 285 senior managers working on China's megaprojects was surveyed, and the results were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), revealing that: (1) the adoption of relational behavior is equally motivated by an organization's behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control (PBC), and (2) relational behavior, especially information exchange, contributes the most toward achieving a high project relationship quality. A closer examination of the data found that two moderating effects, namely project culture and prior experience with other participating organizations, were particularly important. These findings contributed to four implications for project participating organizations to cultivate relational behavior and improve relationship quality in megaprojects, including identifying potential behavioral benefits, enhancing relational competence, establishing collaborative culture, and reinforcing information sharing.

Knowledge can be shared and reused among involved engineers and experts to improve a construction process and reduce the time and cost of solving problems. This paper proposes a new and practical methodology to capture and represent construction project knowledge by using a Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach. Using BIM approach, users can make visual knowledge management in the 3D Computer-aided Design (CAD) environment. This study addresses the application of knowledge management in the construction phase of construction projects and proposes a Construction BIM-based Knowledge Management (CBIMKM) system for general contractors. The CBIMKM is then applied in selected case studies of a construction building project in Taiwan to verify our proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge in the 3D environment. By applying the BIM approach, all participants in a project can share and reuse explicit and tacit knowledge through the 3D CAD-based knowledge map. The combined results demonstrate that the CBIMKM system can be used as a visual 3D-based knowledge management platform by utilizing the BIM approach and web technology.

Due to the high accident rates in the construction industry it is vital for management to take necessary steps to implement programs and procedures that will increase construction safety and worker productivity. While the effects of a drug-related jobsite accident can be catastrophic for individuals and companies, management should realize that drug use among employees can be damaging to moral, productivity, and quality even if it does not result in accidents. The level of teamwork required for excellent work is harder to achieve and efforts to improve project management by team building are hurt by the absenteeism and short-term employment typical of the employee that abuses drugs. Other areas where the project management of a construction company is compromised by worker drug use are recruitment and retention of human resources, career growth management, and safety. Drug testing construction workers is an effective method for reducing the number of impaired workers on a project site, increasing overall project safety, worker morale, productivity, and profits. There are ethical and legal questions on both sides of the issue and any such management initiative must be balanced with worker rights.

Improvement in labour productivity is indispensable for the petrochemical industry to achieve sustainable development. However, the industry lacks consensus in measuring labour productivity in construction, maintenance and shutdown/turnaround projects. This engenders a need for developing productivity improvement practices applicable to all projects. This article proposes productivity improvement solutions based on a study conducted on 17 projects at five petrochemical plants in Singapore. This research team developed and used a modified Activity Analysis method suitable to the site conditions and the maintenance and shutdown/turnaround activities which are seldom studied. The study was conducted over two cycles to assess the current trend in labour productivity, identify productivity barriers, implement improvement solutions and assess their effectiveness. The aggregated direct work percentage for the projects from the first cycle of data collection was found to be 29.5%. After implementing the improvement strategies proposed by this study, the direct work percentage has increased to 35.6% in the second cycle. The assessment of labour productivity through Activity Analysis in maintenance and shutdown/turnaround environments is an important contribution of this study. This article provides a basis for benchmarking labour productivity in the Singapore petrochemical industry.

Recently, the scope of occupational health management on large sites has increased as public health has become included within the organizational remit. Concerns have been raised around the consequences of this development, its close relationships to Corporate Social Responsibility, and how this is now shaping the wider discourse. To explore this phenomenon, a critical discourse analysis of UK "construction worker health" has been carried out, using the public-facing data of ten large UK contractors. Findings show that "public" has now overtaken "occupational", the latter restricted to legal compliance presented as corporate citizenship, the former championed as evidence of benevolent organizational values. Yet public health concerns are limited to those of lifestyle and individual responsibility, whilst more complex issues around the social determinants of health as associated with work are missing from the discourse, separating organizations from the impacts of their work on their workers. A contemporary mapping of "construction worker health" is developed for consideration by industry and academics to support future health initiatives and research.

J	Arditi, D; Nayak, S; Damci, A				Arditi, David; Nayak, Shruti; Damci, Atilla			Effect of organizational culture on delay in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture; Delay; Scheduling	PROJECTS; INDUSTRY; FRAMEWORK; INTERPLAY; NIGERIA; SECTOR; TURKEY; CLAIMS	Delay is one of the most common problems in the construction industry. This study aims to explore the relationship between a construction company's organizational culture and delay. A questionnaire survey was administered to construction companies located in the U.S. and India in order to collect data on their organizational culture and the amount of delay that they experienced in their projects. The results of this study show that construction organizations in the U.S. are dominated by "clan" culture whereas those in India are dominated by "market" culture. The study also shows that the percentage of delay relative to project duration is lower in the U.S. compared to India. Despite the fact that delays are caused by a multitude of reasons often mentioned in the literature, statistical analysis indicates that there is also a significant relationship between organizational culture and the magnitude of delays. This relationship could be useful for a construction company in cultivating an organizational culture that is expected to reduce project delay. It could also be of benefit to international contractors relative to their expectations vis-a-vis time performance in projects undertaken in different countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Razmdoost, K; Mills, G				Razmdoost, Kamran; Mills, Grant			Towards a service-led relationship in project-based firms	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Interaction; project-based firms; relationship marketing; service-dominant logic; service-led relationship	DARK SIDE; MARKETING-STRATEGY; DOMINANT LOGIC; CO-CREATION; CONSTRUCTION; TRUST	Project-based firms increasingly apply practices that are in line with relationship marketing (RM), which is a shift from individuality to mutuality, and service-dominant logic (SDL), which is a shift from a focus on goods exchange to an emphasis on service exchange. These firms also adopt value co-creation processes, benefiting from both RM and SDL views. However, their overall transition towards RM, SDL and/or both is not clearly understood. Therefore, the research aim is to explain how and why project-based firms have moved away from transitional marketing. A retrospective action research between 2002 and 2009 provides process data on how a single main contractor adapted their marketing approach over five publicly funded projects within the oil, gas and petrochemical industries. The findings show that the uniqueness and dynamics of projects necessitate the adoption of both SDL and RM, a view that is entitled the service-led relationship here. This transition occurs through services expansion, multi-level distributed interactions and process-oriented performance management in projects. The firm enabled the transition through the evolution of both institutional mechanisms such as contracts and organizational structure, and people attributes such as capabilities and culture.

Stringing Construction Planning and Execution Tasks Together for Effective Project Management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Construction management; Planning; Project management; Preconstruction planning; Project execution; Task-level strategy; Task string; Electrical construction		This paper introduces a new concept termed the continuous task-string (TS), which consists of specific combinations of preconstruction planning (PCP) and project execution (PE) tasks that, when linked together have a high probability of improving project performance. Through a two-stage process, 3,910 combinations of 46 and 85 PCP and PE tasks, respectively, were reduced down to 239 validated task-strings. These task strings were evaluated by electrical construction professionals to statistically quantify the potential influence of the task strings on cost and schedule success. Statistical analysis supported the hypothesis that those task strings which were viewed as being more important to cost and schedule success would also be viewed as being more critically interdependent. Hence, completion of the PCP-PE task combination was viewed as being a key ingredient for project success. The research reported in this paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for further studies on the influence of task strings on project performance. Ultimately, by elucidating the relationship between preconstruction planning and project execution tasks, the research reported in this paper can help electrical contractors achieve project performance improvement through effective task-level strategies.

Sources of Changes in Design-Build Contracts for a Governmental Owner	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of the Portland-International-Center-for-Management-of-Engineering-and-Technology (PICMET 2007)	AUG 05-09, 2007	Portland, OR	Portland State Univ, Dept Engn & Technol Management, Natl Sci Fdn, Ikon Off Syst, Portland Int Ctr Management Engn & Technol			DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; CONSTRUCTION	In recent years, many U.S. federal, state, and local governments have been authorized to use the design-build method of project delivery instead of the traditional design-bid-build method. Recent studies have not been definitive on the cost advantage of design-build for governmental owners. There are fewer change orders in design-build due to design errors because the designer (architect/engineer) and contractor are one entity, but there are other causes of change orders. Some literature suggests that changes requested by the owner of the facility are greater with the design-build method. This research examines the causes for construction-phase changes in 14 design-build and 20 design-bid-build projects. Total changes, expressed as number per contract, cost per contract, or percentage of original contract, were significantly lower in design-build. Fewer design errors in design-build accounted for this advantage. The number of owner-requested changes was significantly greater in design-build. The cost of owner-requested changes, averaged over all the projects, was significantly less for design-bid-build. The differences in changes due to differing site conditions were not significant. The concept that there are more owner-requested changes in design-build projects is supported by this research.

To demonstrate the benefits of using HCC (sometimes referred to as "mixed" construction) within the industry, it is essential that transparent criteria to assess this structural frame type against alternatives be determined, defined, and evaluated. Following a thorough review of literature in the building performance domain, a survey of U.K. experienced practitioners including clients, engineers, architects, quantity surveyors, and main contractors was conducted to obtain their perceptions regarding the importance of structural frame performance criteria (SFPC). A factor analysis of SFPC revealed seven dimensions, interpreted as "physical form and space," "construction process," "long-term sustainability..... establishing confidence," "building impact..... physical appearance," and "client satisfaction." These dimensions should improve the decision making process when selecting an appropriate structural frame during early project stages by providing a simple list of performance criteria to be considered. Although these SFPC and dimensions were originally developed to ensure that the benefits of using HCC were apparent during the frame selection process, they are equally applicable to all frame choice comparisons. As such, they may provide a valuable tool for ensuring added value and client satisfaction.

David; Choi, Kunhee			Comprehensive Evaluation of Influential Factors on Public Roadway Project Contract Time	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contract time determination (CTD); Project duration estimation; Project scheduling; Influential factors; Importance index		Contract time determination (CTD) is one of the most critical activities when developing a public roadway. There is no lack of policy documents, process manuals, and technical papers emphasizing its significance and impact on project performance and contractor behavior. However, little definitive information or systemic knowledge is available on the factors that affect a public roadway project's contract time. Studies holistically examining CTD factors are scarce. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study first identified 42 factors from an extensive scan of the existing literature and CTD manuals and examined the factors using a two-stage nationwide survey. The survey results provide a comprehensive evaluation of CTD factors from multiple dimensions: frequency of occurrence, level of influence, proper timing of identification, and impact boundary (projectwide versus item-specific). This study also identified the top important CTD factors, such as traffic maintenance, production rates, environmental issues, project complexity, and utility issues. This research is significant because it is probably the first national study to assemble the scattered and incoherent information and knowledge across different regions and states on CTD factors and systematically organize and evaluate them. This study's key results also carry high practical value for practitioners-another important group of readers of this journal.

This study aims to identify CSFs in terms of the different project players and their objectives in the context of Singapore's construction industry. To achieve this objective, 32 CSFs were first identified and classified into four major categories: (1) project characteristics, (2) contractual arrangements, (3) project participants, and (4) interactive processes. Then the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed to establish a hierarchical model of the factors' relative importance. To facilitate systematic analysis on their importance, 12 experts with at least 10 years of industry experience were surveyed; then, through the use of the Expert Choice software, the CSFs addressing budget performance, schedule performance, quality performance, and overall project success were identified. The results of this study may serve as a tool in the construction industry to rapidly assess the possibility of achieving project objectives. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000597.

Construction companies are not immune to economic downturns, as evidenced by the sharp decline and long recovery period associated with the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Therefore, construction companies and construction industry stakeholders need to infuse specific economic strategies into their business operations. To determine effective strategies for construction companies to consider for weathering the risks associated with economic downturns, a Delphi study methodology was employed. Three rounds were conducted with qualified construction economic and financial experts representing financial officers, certified public accountants, and sureties to collect and confirm the existence and effectiveness of economic strategies employed by construction firms during economic downturns and recessions. From the Delphi study, 40 strategies were confirmed as highly or moderately effective methods based on the consensus criteria established from the Delphi study across six categories (1) organizational and project management, (2) direct-cost, (3) overhead, (4) financial, (5) preconstruction and marketing, and (6) efficiency strategies. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a roadmap of economic, managerial, and financial strategies that can be implemented by construction companies to improve their financial health during different economic cycles.

Research have shown a compelling stakeholders' willingness to invest in sustainable buildings in the developed economies and some emerging economies. However, information on key market actors' opinion on the sustainability attributes, their willingness to adopt sustainable features and the acceptance of sustainable policy in residential property development in sub-Saharan Africa is under investigated. Our paper adopts a trio of the market-led actors' perspective evaluation; Investors, Contractors and Users, to investigate perceptions on the sustainability attributes of eight contextual property-related sustainable features, unfolded from sustainability literature and identified during the pilot study in Lagos; the largest property market and economic nerve-centre of West Africa and Nigeria. We also examine the stakeholders' willingness on the use of the sustainable features. The study employed analysis of variance, correlation analysis and willingness to adopt index (WTAI) and found that variations exist among different stakeholders. Therefore, the need to sensitize all stakeholders on the attributes of sustainable buildings, especially the extra-environmental benefits which is more relevant to the stakeholders in taking decisions on sustainable building adoption in developing economies.

Project risk management is a critical tool for authority to improve its performance and secure the success of the organization. However, a number of standards and approaches have been developed to formulate the projects based on their risks. The Elena guideline is a systematic standard developed by Iran Project Management Association. This guideline provides the full cycle of the risk management process. Risk evaluation is the key part of the risk management process. On the other hand, different techniques have been developed to model a risk evaluation problem. Fuzzy inference system is one of the most popular techniques that is capable of handling all types of the uncertainty involved in projects. This paper proposes a three-stage approach based on the fuzzy inference system under the environment of the Elena guideline to cope with the risky projects. Finally, an illustrative example of the risk evaluation is presented to demonstrate the potential application of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model evaluates the risky projects efficiently and effectively.

Telematics is the integration of wireless communications, vehicle monitoring systems, and location devices to provide real-time spatial and performance data of the fleet machines. Despite the large amount of real-time equipment data made available by telematics, fleet managers still try to identify ways to use such data to make informed fleet-management decisions. This paper presents the development of novel telematics-based computational methodologies to support two major equipment fleet management tasks: fleet use assessment and equipment health monitoring. First, a description of the telematics system and data used are presented. Second, a computational algorithm is proposed to quantify the fleet-wide equipment used, based on basic telematics data. Third, a health-monitoring framework is developed to estimate equipment failure events using telematics-based hazard functions, which were developed using survival analysis techniques. Finally, the telematics data sets of large equipment fleets (dozers, excavators, backhoes, and dump trucks) from two companies are used to verify and validate the proposed research developments by providing insightful fleetmanagement information.

Case Study to Identify Barriers and Incentives to Implementing an Engineering Control for Concrete Grinding Dust	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health and safety; Management responsibilities; Engineering controls	LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS USE; CRYSTALLINE SILICA DUST; HEARING PROTECTION; EXPOSURE; INTERVENTION; SAFETY; HEALTH; INDUSTRY; QUARTZ	Research has indicated that respirable crystalline silica dust exposure is a serious health hazard in the construction industry. One source of this hazard is the dust generated by drilling, sawing, chipping, and grinding concrete. There are several options for controlling this hazard, one of which is the use of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) directly attached to the cutting tool. Implementing an engineering control presents a challenge on the construction work site where it is often difficult to determine who will take the initiative for introducing an innovative strategy. This study examines the implementation of an LEV system on an overhead grinder illustrating the roles that various members of the construction team played. The results of the case study found that key factors that affected implementation were: (1) a cooperative relationship between individuals employed by the general contractor and the concrete subcontractor; (2) the effect of high airborne dust levels on scheduling the work of other subcontractors; (3) the public relations effects of high dust levels in a downtown area; and (4) the concrete subcontractor perceived benefits that exceeded the short-term cost of the intervention.

The goal of this paper is to develop a holistic rating system incorporating an inclusive list of factors influencing collaborative planning in construction projects using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach. This paper offers substantial contributions to the body of knowledge through (1) presenting a comprehensive hierarchy system of the categories and factors affecting collaborative planning in the construction industry; (2) providing an unprecedented objective scoring system-named Collaborative Planning Index (CPI)-to assess the effectiveness of construction collaborative planning; (3) offering interrelated stakeholders a tailored experience that allows selection of relevant collaborative planning factors in their respective projects, as well as highlighting underperforming factors; and (4) furnishing appropriate strategies to improve collaborative planning practices. The results of this research provide a foundation for properly interpreting and evaluating the factors impacting collaboration within construction projects in a holistic manner.

However, contractors do not share the necessary information with the contracted parties and thus give rise to the asymmetric information (AI) phenomenon. The aim of this study is to perform an analysis of the determining factors in the adoption of relational contracting (RC) in combination with Building Information Modelling (BIM) to reduce AI. The results of a questionnaire survey, which was e-mailed to 14 specialists with solid experience (over twenty years) and knowledge in construction projects, revealed that the probability of the AI phenomenon occurring in Portugal is very high, and its impact on construction projects is equally high. The results also show that RC in combination with the BIM methodology contributes very positively to the mitigation of AI problems in construction projects in Portugal. Approximately 85% of respondents consider that the government should seek to reduce AI in the public works sector through the use of RC and its combination with the BIM methodology in the Portuguese Public Contracts Code.

Hazard-Based Duration Models for Predicting Actual Duration of Highway Projects Using Nonparametric and Parametric Survival Analysis	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project duration; Construction management; Project management; Hazard modeling; Survival analysis	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS; COST; TIME	At the preconstruction phases of project development, facility stakeholders typically seek reliable estimates of project duration. This paper shows how hazard-based duration models could be used to forecast the actual (final) duration of a highway construction project based on variables known at the time of the project letting phase. To account for the large uncertainty in project duration, a probabilistic method known as survival analysis was used. First, a nonparametric estimation method (Kaplan-Meier) was applied to develop survival curves for project types in various work categories and identified project groups that had similar survival distributions using the log-rank test. Parametric time-to-event models were then developed to relate project duration to the external covariates. The methodology was applied to multiple project types in five work categories. The results describe the nature of the nonlinear relationship between project duration and the external covariates. The results also show how project duration can be influenced by how projects are bundled, project location, letting season, design work source, and contractor experience. The developed models can help project stakeholders improve their estimates of project duration and gain insight into the role played by the factors that affect project duration.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of using different objective functions on resource utilization histograms in Critical Path Method networks. For this purpose, nine different resource leveling objective functions were optimized via a genetic algorithm-based model. The model was developed using actual data obtained from a steel framed industrial building construction project. It was found that each of these objective functions generates different resource utilization histograms. In order to determine the improvement levels achieved by resource leveling using nine different objective functions, the improvement percentage in each parameter and the average improvement percentage for each objective function were calculated. Even though the objective function that involves the minimization of the sum of the square of the deviations in daily resource usage provided the best average improvement percentage in the studied case, another objective function(s) may provide better average improvement percentage in different projects. The contractor should consider all objective functions for resource leveling and select the one(s) that provides the best average improvement percentage.

J	Wang, DD; Zhou, ZY; Lu, YQ				Wang, Dedong; Zhou, Ziyao; Lu, Yongqiang			Combined strategy of trust repair in construction project organizations: an exploratory study in Chinese management scenario	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Trust repair; Combined strategy; Construction project organization; Qualitative comparative analysis	INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS; CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION; CUSTOMER TRUST; RECOVERY; COMPETENCE; APOLOGY; CULTURE; PERSPECTIVE; MODEL; TRUSTWORTHINESS	Purpose This study aims to explore the combined strategies leading to successful repair of two types of trust in Chinese construction projects and provide an effective guidance and control trust repair in construction projects. During the research period, the author interviewed 150 managers from 50 Chinese construction projects and collected details of 125 violations. The research examines the effect of combined strategy of trust repair in Chinese management scenario. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a mixed, quantitative, qualitative and exploratory approach. The author first extracted six strategies, namely, apology, denial, penance, communication, promise and compensation, from the literature review and generalization. Then, the author conducted an interview with 150 managers from 50 China construction projects. And the author analyzed the data through qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Findings When competence-based trust is broken, violators should adopt communication and promise, demonstrate their competence and qualification, and change the attributions of competence from the trustor. When integrity-based trust is broken, violators should apologize, actively admit the mistake, show a positive attitude and seek the forgiveness from the trustor. After reconstructing trustors' perceptions of competence or integrity, violators should also make a promise to trustors for the future. The result of this research not only illustrates the sufficiency and necessity of a single strategy for trust repair but also explores the combination of trust repair strategies that rebuild the trust. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to 50 construction projects in the Chinese construction context, so conclusions are limited in application. Data used in this research did not provide an in-depth analysis of trust repair failures. Thus, additional research is needed to explore why trust was not repaired. The study is also limited to examining the Chinese construction project organizations only, and future studies should incorporate organizations in other nations and regions. Practical implications Compared with using a single strategy, a combined strategy provides a contribution to the future practice of repair broken relationship between construction project organizations. This research helps to organize decisions and benefits managers, from Chinese owners and contractors, in choosing which of these strategies repair trust. The author also provides a specific combination of strategies to repair relationships for international companies that have conflicts with Chinese construction companies. Originality/value This research is among the early studies in China that preliminary examines the combined strategy of trust repair between Chinese owners and contractors by using causal attribution theory and QCA. This study makes a valuable contribution toward combined strategy in construction project and the knowledge system of trust repair. Future studies could build on the findings from the current study to develop a cross-cultural research on trust repair.

This sector's growth can be attributed to strategic decisions of various organizations on broadening their company's footprint into new markets. Such decisions require comprehension of job markets for successful expansion. This study focuses on utilizing post-occupancy evaluation of the quality of work on construction coating projects across the USA to understand the relationship between different regions and states and strategy to expand into new job markets. Network analysis utilized data from over two thousand owners collected over a period of four years. The study provides insights for construction-coating projects in relation to mobilization and footprint expansion. Specifically, the correlation of customer satisfaction for construction-coating contractors known as applicators working across the USA and understanding the relationship between region and states. The analysis identifies regions where jobs are performed by applicators from another region, highlighting business opportunities in the different regions across USA, while identifying poorly connected states. This study paves the way for future works that understand the footprint and connections with other states, especially for other trade applicators in the construction industry.

The skills and competency of human resources contribute considerably to the competitive advantage of the firm. Yet the skill shortage problem encourages utilizing strategies that bring more flexibility to workforce management. Multiskilling has been suggested as a potential strategy that assists workforce assignment across multiple projects. However, it brings new challenges for company workforce managers. This study contributes to the construction project management body of knowledge by proposing a simulation framework for assigning multiskilled, mainly managerial, workforces across multiple projects of one company. Meanwhile, it is a combination of a staffng and scheduling decision model, incorporating workers' competency status. A cohesive mathematical model using the cost objective function optimizes the entire allocation process toward minimizing resource usage and fluctuations, minimizing costs, and maximizing social sustainability. Ultimately, a validation example incorporating diverse workers' competency data is provided to exemplify how the optimization model performs in an academic setting compared with three commonly used methods in workforce assignment. This approach provides insight into simulating workforce assignments across multiple projects regarding competency. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A mixed method design was adopted for this research due to limited information and stakeholders on the ground. 43 industry practioners representing contractors, developers' financiers and government were identified motivating a mixed method approach in order to obtain more data given a generally lower sample available. 27 questionnaires were obtained. Findings revealed that the PPP Act had not played a significant role to influence private sector decision to participate in PPP projects. The findings from this research unlocks part of the reason why there is little participation by private sector in PPP projects. The research identifies presents areas of focus in amending the Act in order to attract and influence private investment in current critical areas such as energy, higher education and housing among others. The study recommends immediate revision of PPP Act to remove identified barriers which among others include inadequate and unclear governing PPP framework, obstruction by bureaucracy, inappropriate risk sharing mechanisms and absence of protection to the private sector stakeholders.

This paper seeks to explore the genesis of the underlying risks in non-standard forms of engineering consulting services, systematically classify the risks, and develop a Risk Breakdown Structure and a generic Framework for efficient assessment of these risks, which is a prerequisite for sound risk management in the engineering consulting industry. The research adopts a mixed method approach, synthesising exploratory type multiple-case studies and questionnaire surveys, carried out in 14 engineering consulting firms having extensive experience in the delivery of non-standard consulting services. This paper provides empirical insights of the genetic makeup of risks associated with non-standard forms of consulting services. Such risks are found to be predominantly linked to design office based activities that underline the importance of design function in engineering consulting practice. Loss of reputation and/or goodwill is rated as the most severe potential impact on consultants. Proposed Risk Assessment Framework provides the engineering consulting industry with a functional tool for efficient risk management.	[Piyadasa, W. M. Sarath C.; Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

Since projects can be lengthy and complex, a structured methodology is required to support consistent assessment and inform decisions. A methodology grounded in the principles of Bayes linear is proposed because it provides a theoretical framework for modeling the epistemic uncertainty in the reliability management process during which the decision maker synthesizes information from supplier analyses to form an assessment that will be updated as new information becomes available. Methods for structuring and populating a Bayes linear model are developed and a strategy for sensitivity analysis to explore the robustness of results to variations in subjective engineering beliefs is proposed. The feasibility of the methodology is examined through an industrial application to support reliability assessment during a defense procurement project. Based on feedback, our findings show that it is feasible to develop a requisite Bayes linear model to support reliability assessment. We find that many strengths and weaknesses of a Bayes linear approach are shared by other Bayesian models, but that a Bayes linear method has potential benefits through reduced elicitation burden and straightforward sensitivity analysis.

Modeling Interfirm Dependency: Game Theoretic Simulation to Examine the Holdup Problem in Project Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Game theory; Holdup problem; Innovation; Project networks; Simulation models	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INNOVATION; SELECTION; ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; AUCTIONS; SYSTEM; COSTS	Subcontractor selection strategies used by contractors can significantly affect short-term project and long-term organizational success. Existing research on subcontractor selection strategy implicitly assumes that the evaluation of subcontractors depends on current conditions. We extend this perspective by integrating an agent-based simulation model with game theory to examine whether precontract partner selection strategies that do not consider subcontractor selection as a repeated game may lead to a version of the holdup problem. The holdup problem we investigate focuses on relationship-specific investments in learning after the introduction of an innovation or organizational change across a project network. A minimum total cost strategy may decelerate the rate of adaptation to an innovation or organizational change, thereby proving that the holdup problem can exist in project networks. The findings contribute to subcontractor selection strategy literature by simulating the impact of the holdup problem in project networks, distinguishing task interdependence as a moderating variable, and identifying that the minimum total cost strategy can be a suboptimal strategy for project networks adapting to systemic changes.

J	Tavakolan, M; Mohammadi, A				Tavakolan, Mehdi; Mohammadi, Amir			Risk management workshop application: a case study of Ahwaz Urban Railway project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; risk management; risk analysis; fuzzy sets; case study	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; FAILURE MODE; IDENTIFICATION; INDUSTRY; FMEA; CONTRACTORS; FAULT	Effective risk management is a vital part of project management. The previous workshops in the construction industry have shown to suffer from the lack of a comprehensive risk management techniques. This paper aims to investigate the capacity of a workshop as a risk management approach through the analysis of risk management for Ahwaz Urban Railway project. The analysed workshop uses brainstorming, the combination of fuzzy and failure mode and effect analysis and multiple-choice questions to identify, evaluate and determine the best responses to risks, respectively. The workshop examination shows that a workshop gives the organization an opportunity to identify critical risks. Furthermore, it helps the organization staff to have a better understanding of the project's environment and provides chances to improve teamwork. Despite the strengths of the workshop, it has several limitations of its own. The participants should be the project's major stakeholders and the workshop requires time and money. Two of the major limitations of the analysed workshop are time limitation, and lack of risk monitoring and controlling experience. In addition, this study does not investigate the relationship between risks. However, more attempts are needed to address challenges and barriers of risk management implementation in construction industry.

J	Ye, KH; Zhu, WN; Shan, YW; Li, S				Ye, Kunhui; Zhu, Weina; Shan, Yongwei; Li, Shan			Effects of Market Competition on the Sustainability Performance of the Construction Industry: China Case	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable construction; Market competition; Construction competitiveness; Structural equation model	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK	Achieving sustainability through the market has been a research topic in the field of sustainable development. Nevertheless, the ways in which sustainability in construction is influenced by the construction market have not been explored explicitly. In the research reported in this paper, hypotheses on the effects of market competition on the sustainability performance of the construction industry were proposed. A structural equation modeling approach was adopted and data from 30 provincial construction sectors in China were collected to test the proposed hypotheses. The results show that market competition can influence industrial sustainability in three ways, namely (1) positive effects on the economic dimension, (2) negative effects on the environmental dimension, and (3) positive effects on the social dimension. The research reported in this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by addressing the role of market competition in institutional drivers of sustainable construction. It is implied that the construction industry has the importance of placing business competition on the tenets of sustainable development. Governmental authorities are thus recommended to include the triple bottom line of sustainability as a benchmark for measuring the efficiency of industrial competition policies. Clients are also suggested to stipulate sustainable construction as a contractor selection criterion in bid documents to improve sustainability in construction.

J	Mourgues, C; Fischer, M; Kunz, J				Mourgues, Claudio; Fischer, Martin; Kunz, John			Method to produce field instructions from product and process models for cast-in-place concrete operations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction; Product models; Process models; Work instructions; Field information; Standardization	CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT	The state-of-practice method to produce good and formal work instructions for construction laborers takes time, is error prone and produces outcomes with inconsistent format and content. That is why contractors rely on verbal work instructions in spite of the field mistakes and inefficiencies that this poor communication produces. Our research addresses the underlying scientific problem of this practical quandary: the lack of a formal method that defines the steps and information needed to produce good work instructions from a company's best practices and a project's 3D product model. This paper describes an automated method (Field Instructions from Product And Process Models, FIPAPM) to systematically produce work instructions with a predefined format and content (field instructions template) for cast-in-place (CIP) concrete operations using design and construction information contained in product and process models. The paper also explains the information schemas needed by the FIPAPM method to produce field instructions. We developed this method and information schemas through active project participation and computer prototyping. Initial validation of the FIPAPM method shows that it enables a faster, more correct and more consistent production of good work instructions than the state-of-practice method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries in these specialty construction sectors over time as well as their effects on the level of safety performance in the industry. Accordingly, the most prevalent causes of fatal and nonfatal incidents in the mechanical and electrical sectors are investigated and presented as a longitudinal study from 2005 to 2015. The trends in occupational injuries in these sectors over this period of time are also compared with the trends reported in previous studies. The results from this study show that the direct causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries in the electrical and mechanical sectors differ from those found in the construction industry in general. In addition, the electrical and mechanical construction industry trends identified in this study are similar to previously reported trends. The similarities between the current findings and those of previous studies highlight real shortcomings in the safety management approaches within the construction industry. Based on the findings of this study, a learning investigation system has been recommended to improve safety performance among electrical and mechanical specialty contractors.

Construction Management Challenges and Best Practices for Rural Transit Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction engineering; Construction management; Rural construction projects; Best practices		Rural transit projects are often small in scope but numerous and geographically dispersed. Management of these projects can be challenging because of very limited resources, unique risk factors, and a lack of construction management expertise. Without effective construction management strategies, it is unlikely that rural transit projects will be optimally planned and controlled, possibly resulting in delays, cost overruns, rework, injuries, and poor quality. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive desk scan, survey, and case studies that focused on identifying specific construction management challenges and effective practices that are unique to rural projects. We obtained responses from 33 of the 52 U.S. states' Departments of Transportation (63%) and two Canadian provinces. The survey findings were validated with interviews from representatives of seven rural case study projects. The results indicate that the primary issues facing rural transit projects include documentation issues; staffing; remote location issues; small contractor issues; communication issues; and local and environmental issues. The counter measures identified for these issues in agency interviews and described in this paper provide the first targeted resource for rural construction management practices. The research community benefits from this study with the increased understanding of the inherent difference in construction management practices between large urban and small rural construction projects.

This study empirically determines some organizational internal drivers influencing the social sustainability performance in construction firms. To achieve this, we developed a conceptual model and tested on a sample of registered and active large construction firms from the Malaysian Construction Industry Development Board, using partial least-squares structural equation modelling for analysis. The study reveals that organizational internal drivers could trigger social sustainability performance. However, our analysis shows that organizational capabilities - complex tangible and intangible resources that are controlled by a firm through certain organizational practices and which enable it to implement value-creating strategies-partially mediates the relationship between these drivers and social sustainability. While few limitations of this study include the fact that the data used are the subjective opinions of the top officials who responded to the survey, our findings reveal that construction firms with efficient resource capabilities tend to adopt more sustainability in project delivery. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the important factors for social sustainability in construction.	[Bamgbade, J.

A review of this literature reveals that even though the approaches are used for the same goal of predicting future safety outcomes, they are modeled independently and exclusively from one another. To organize thinking in safety prediction, the literature is organized into four operationally-defined predictive families: (1) safety risk assessment, which considers the characteristics and dangers of the work; (2) precursor analysis, which considers the conditions of the workers; (3) leading indicators, which consider the quantity of safety management activities; and (4) safety climate assessments, which considers worker perceptions of safety. Additionally, a unified model is proposed where the four families are considered together and opportunities for synergy and cross-validation are exploited. Researchers may benefit from this model as they create points of departure, propose and test novel approaches, and attempt to contextualize their findings within the existing body of literature. Furthermore, practitioners may use the model to make more accurate and robust safety predictions that account for the interconnectedness of the work attributes, human resources, and management strategies that affect safety.

This study is devoted to identify the determinants for the coopetition strategies of IJVs in the HSR projects, as well as the interactive paths. On the base of a thorough literature review and the pilot study with five industry experts, 22 determinants were identified and packaged into six groups covering the three levels (including macro, firm, and project levels). Meanwhile, the interactive paths amongst the six groups were proposed. A questionnaire survey was performed with 210 practitioners experienced in IJVs in HSR projects to assess the significance of the factors, and 113 valid questionnaires were received. Based on the collected data, six groups of 22 determinants and nine interactive paths were verified by applying partial least-squares structural equation modeling technology. Specifically, these significant paths could be classified into two categories, namely the coopetition-capability oriented paths, and the coopetition-relationship oriented paths. The findings of this paper are conductive to expand the knowledge on coopetition and provide a useful reference for the members of IJVs in HSR projects to accomplish coopetition strategies from pre-project phase, the implementation phase, to post-project phase.

While the EVMS measures project-level costs and scheduling performances, the LPS measures the percent plan complete (PPC), which indicates the level of planning reliability. This paper investigates the relationship between planning reliability at the operational level and project performance at the management level (i.e., the success or failure of a project). Analyzing the empirical data of 23 residential projects of a large construction company, the authors find that, while the production plan in the weekly schedule is correlated rigidly with the daily plan in successful projects, such a rigid correlation is not observed in unsuccessful projects. To understand this finding, the authors further conducted interviews with project stakeholders. Taken together, this study suggests that an emphasis on LPS indices causes subcontractors to engage in myopic behaviors such as modifying operational-level indices. Consequently, management-level production plan rigidity is at risk. The findings in this paper offer valuable insights and help project stakeholders understand the attributes of operational-level and management-level indices and their relationships.

When choosing the most effective investment project in construction, a major problem associated with the actual demand for resources is underestimated. In order to solve this problem in the most effective way, the application programs, covering virtually every phase of the specific construction product development, e.g. planning, design, cost estimation, scheduling, fabrication, construction, maintenance and facility management were developed and supplemented with the calculation of the demand for resources, comparison of alternatives and determination of the duration of all the stages of the project life.

Thus, preventing its causes would be an efficient strategy to improve performance of the construction projects. This research set out to highlight, ascertain and rank the critical causes of scope creep with respect to their level of occurrence and to their influence on cost and time increase for the building construction projects in the Sub-Saharan countries of D.R.Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, preventive strategies were also provided. A questionnaire survey was conducted among consultants, contractors and clients, and a total of 141 questionnaires were collected from both countries. The survey results analysed by the mean of t-test technique showed that there is a significant difference in the likelihood of occurrence and in the level of influence on cost and time overruns for majority of the 37 causes resulting to scope creep between the two countries. Also, there is significant difference in the importance level of majority of the eleven best practices in preventing scope creep. This study grants a vital contribution to control scope creep in D.R.Congo and Rwanda, and in the countries with the same condition.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Interrelationship among Belief, Intention, Attitude, Behavior, and Performance of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Attitude; Correlation analysis; Path analysis; Theory of planned behavior	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; JOB; SAFETY; MODEL	Worker behavior is one of the factors that influences construction labor productivity (CLP). This notion is discussed extensively in the literature; however, in most of these studies, the relation between behavior and productivity is either explained theoretically or demonstrated deductively. Moreover, the literature on psychology suggests that the impact of behavior on CLP cannot be understood completely without considering the effects of three other behavioral attributes (BAs)-belief, intention, and attitude. Therefore, this study has attempted to fill this gap by identifying the interrelationship among the four BAs and CLP. To achieve this objective, an existing work-attitude scale was used to measure all four BAs of workers. Simultaneously, productivity of the same workers was measured on site. After collecting data from 109 construction workers, interrelationships between their BAs and productivity were determined through path analysis. The results found a direct and positive relationship between behavior and productivity. Moreover, attitude was identified as an attribute that cannot be influenced directly by any of the tangible factors. Therefore, the study concludes that, to change behavior among workers that will enhance CLP, contractors must focus on changing the belief systems of workers through regular training to incorporate positive information into workers' beliefs.

Advanced energy retrofit projects: cross-case analysis of integrated system design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Energy-efficiency; retrofits; case study; integrated system design; construction management		Built environment researchers and practitioners are addressing the current sustainability and energy challenges facing the industry. The shift in building energy and sustainability expectations has led project teams to develop new practices and processes. Owners, project managers, designers and contractors now actively seek opportunities to improve the energy performance of existing buildings through retrofitting. Given that integrated system upgrades result in more significant energy reduction rates than traditional approaches, this study adopted a case-study approach to understand the integrated system design process and its effects on energy-efficiency performance measures in retrofit projects compared to traditional retrofit processes. Within this scope, three retrofit projects with different processes and rate of energy consumption reduction were purposefully selected to meet certain project delivery and system design characteristics. This paper focuses on effects of these characteristics on the collaborative decision-making process and integrated system design. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of critical decisions related to process and performance modelling practices in the delivery of retrofit projects. As a consequence, it was found that while collaborative energy benchmarking and performance goal setting provided a transparent decision-making environment, the review of existing conditions prior to design and the use of historical operational performance data made the iterative energy modelling of an integrated building system design realistic.

An empirical study on factors leading to the success of construction organizations in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Success attributes; success factors; performance factors; critical success factors; questionnaire survey; factor analysis; stepwise regression; construction organization	COMPETITIVENESS; CONTRACTORS; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; CRITERIA	Traditionally, construction organizations with a track record of successful project completion were considered successful construction organizations. However, if construction projects were successful, then it is not always necessary for the construction organization to also have been successful. They can even fail and go bankrupt. Therefore, there is a need to think about the success of construction organizations at a corporate level rather than focusing only at the project level. The objective of this study was to identify and to evaluate the successful attributes for construction organizations. The research methodology involved seeking responses from experts in the construction industry through a questionnaire survey. This paper presents the factors that contributed to the success of construction organizations that operate in the National Capital Region of Delhi, India. Factor analysis of responses extracted eight critical success factors: experience and performance, top management's competence, project factor, supply chain and leadership, availability of resources and information flow, effective cost control measures, favourable market and marketing team, and availability of qualified staff. The top management's competence emerged as the most critical success factor against various performance factors. The success factors that were identified in this study should provide a guideline to construction organizations for their success.	[Tripathi, K. K.; Jha, K.

Seeking a flexible mechanism to facilitate project management, which is more adaptive to changes, is the initial motivation for conducting the present study. Agile Project Management provides new opportunities for management based on the acceptance of change as an unavoidable ingredient of the project management process in the construction sector. However, applying all the agile solutions would need a tremendous amount of initial investment. Therefore, the present study aims to introduce and prioritize the agile enablers for the change management of construction projects. For this purpose, the most critical changes were identified through a questionnaire survey among 60 Iranian first-grade consultant and contractor companies in the field of construction. Subsequently, 12 experts experienced in the area of change management in construction projects selected the most appropriate agility strategies for facing the prioritized changes through semi-structured interviews. Based on the achieved results, the most effective agility solutions in the change management are: continuous resource monitoring & improvement, flexible workflow, client's participation, facilitated communication, and receiving requirements during the project which accelerate responding to the changes through a repetitive and incremental process based on continuous learning and short-term planning.

Many regulative measures have been adopted in different jurisdictions to address such payment problems. Current research primarily takes an interpretative approach for conducting semantic analysis of these measures, reporting their applications, and comparing their implementation outcomes. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these issues, their sources/roots, and related measurements, and addresses them through gametric models. Working elements of regulative measures are demarcated as punishment of opportunistic payers, remedies for unpaid payees, and costs to parties in referring to remedies and realizing justice. Empirical evidence from an international literature review of protection measures and experiences of addressing payment arrears and from a survey in mainland China is provided to support the models. This framework is useful to researchers and professionals in complementing the current descriptive approach in investigating and understanding regulative measures that address payment problems. This understanding is also useful for lawmakers to accompany the current path-dependent approach in introducing and amending payment protection legislation, i.e., referring to similar measures in other jurisdictions where a mutual legislative origin is shared.

Earned value management (EVM) is one of the methods, which can forecast the required costs for accomplishment of the project. The data collected from projects undertaken in order to update the master schedule often suffer from a level of uncertainty. Ignoring these uncertainties may even lead to project failure. Fuzzy theory has been previously used in the EVM for taking uncertainties into account. A major disadvantage of using fuzzy approaches is the need for incorporating expert judgments to construct a suitable membership function for all activities in the project undertaken. A potential approach for overcoming this issue lies in Grey theory. In this article, the current study deals with the EVM method in grey systems paradigm. Also, the performance of the proposed method, called grey earned value management (EVM-G), is evaluated through some numerical examples and a case study. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has a unique performance in highly uncertain environments when experts have become unavailable. Comparisons between EVM-G and the fuzzy earned value management approaches reveal the superior performance of EVM-G.

Motiar			Barriers of Implementing Modern Methods of Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Preassembly; Industrialized building; Modern methods of construction; Barriers; Prefabrication; Modular construction	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION	Modern methods of construction (MMCs) offer many benefits, but their uptake is low. Their contribution to the construction industry is also low. As such, this study examined the importance of various barriers to wider adoption of MMCs. Results are presented from statistical analyses of 160 questionnaire responses from the U.K. and China. The results validate the importance of 26 factors out of 29 used in the survey. Cost related issues are the most important barriers to implementing MMCs, although respondents from the two countries clearly disagree on the relative importance of different factors. Clients have consensus on the importance of fewer barriers than contractors and consultants, which is expected to help adopt MMCs. Large organizations displayed fewer consensuses than medium-sized organizations, who also displayed fewer consensuses than small organizations. This was interpreted to help the industry in adopting MMCs, because larger organizations control smaller organizations in most cases. Moreover, respondents with experience in MMCs consider that there are far less barriers to adopting MMCs than those with no experience in MMCs. Factor analysis surfaced seven interrelated components, suggesting the need for an integrated and holistic strategy to overcome the barriers. These outcomes are expected to allow policymakers to precisely identify the issues relating to the low uptake of MMCs and to devise appropriate strategies for their wider adoption.

Sustainable performance criteria for construction method selection in concrete buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction methods; Prefabrication; Concrete construction; Construction management; Sustainable development	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION; MANAGEMENT; WASTE	The use of prefabrication offers significant advantages, yet appropriate criteria for applicability assessments to a given building have been found to be deficient. Decisions to use prefabrication are still largely based on anecdotal evidence or simply cost-based evaluation when comparing various construction methods. Holistic criteria are needed to assist with the selection of an appropriate construction method in concrete buildings during early project stages. Following a thorough literature review and comprehensive comparisons between prefabrication and on-site construction method, a total of 33 sustainable performance criteria (SPC) based on the triple bottom line and the requirements of different project stakeholders were identified. A survey of U.S. experienced practitioners including clients/developers, engineers, contractors, and precast concrete manufacturers was conducted to capture their perceptions on the importance of the criteria. The ranking analysis of survey results shows that social awareness and environmental concerns were considered as increasingly important in construction method selections. Factor analysis reveals that these SPCs can be grouped into seven dimensions, namely, economic factors: "long-term cost," "constructability," "quality," and "first cost"; social factors: "impact on health and community," "architectural impact": and environmental factor: "environmental impact." The resultant list of SPCs provides team members a new way to select a construction method, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of built environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Elfving, JA				Elfving, Jan A.			A decade of lessons learned: deployment of lean at a large general contractor	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Last Planner System (R); supply chain management; construction; implementation		The purpose of this paper is to describe lean experiments from a period that lasted over a decade. The aim is to provide insights for both industry practitioners and academics concerning what worked and what did not work and to discuss barriers to avoid when taking academic concepts to industry. What makes this paper unique is that we are following the developments inside one company, Skanska Finland, uninterrupted for over a decade. Dr Glenn Ballard was closely involved in the developments and deployments throughout the journey. The paper confirms earlier findings of managing variability prior to other process improvements. At the same time, it is important to understand the minimum organisational level needed when developing and deploying lean methods. During our journey, the most successful deployment was the Last Planner System (R); it has been both robust against market turns but also it has been possible to deploy it project-by-project. Thus, there is no need to wait until the whole company or a large part of it has understood the concept before deployment can start. Supplier development requires a wider scope than just a single project or the duration of a project for successful deployment. The weak or less sustainable deployment of logistics solutions in the construction industry may be because it requires industry-level technology standardisation and data platforms.

Design/methodology/approach The OLI factors and hypothesis are significantly developed to address a weakness in the OLI framework in its application to settings, such as multinational contracting, with extreme heterogeneity arising from extreme location specificity. Findings These developments advance Dunning's seminal contribution and bring this to life in construction research that has barely applied the framework and, when doing so, has focused only on outbound FDI by multinational contractors (MCs). Research limitations/implications The power of the OLI framework is increased on explaining and predicting FDI in contexts that exhibit extreme heterogeneity associated with extreme location specificity. Furthermore, the operationalisation of key theories representing the framework's OLI factors is made far more precise. Practical implications Engineering, construction and architectural managers, can now more reliably apply the OLI framework both in MCs' outbound FDI decisions and in governments' decisions to attract new MCs - or inbound FDI.

J	Jarkas, AM				Jarkas, Abdulaziz M.			Factors influencing labour productivity in Bahrain's construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						efficiency; construction projects; labour productivity; Kingdom of Bahrain	MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS	There are many challenges facing the construction industry in the Kingdom of Bahrain, but it can be reasonably argued that low labour productivity is among the most important. The primary objective of this investigation, therefore, is to identify, explore, and rank the relative importance of the critical factors influencing labour productivity in Bahrain's construction industry. To achieve this objective, a statistically representative sample of contractors was invited to participate in a structured questionnaire survey comprising 37 productivity factors, which were categorized under the following major groups: (i) management; (ii) technological; (iii) labour; and (iv) external. Using the relative importance index technique, the following factors are perceived as most significant in their influence on labour productivity: (1) labour skills; (2) coordination among design disciplines; (3) lack of labour supervision; (4) errors and omissions in design drawings; (5) delay in responding to requests for information; (6) rework; (7) stringent inspection by the engineer; (8) working overtime; (9) lack of incentive scheme; and (10) inclement weather. The results obtained fill a gap in knowledge of factors affecting labour productivity in the construction industry, which can be used by industry practitioners to develop a wider and deeper perspective of the factors impacting on the efficiency of operatives, and thus assist in achieving a reasonable level of competitiveness and a cost-effective operation.

Impact of Green Building Design and Construction on Worker Safety and Health	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Sustainable, or "green," rating systems, such as the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), are leading to changes in the way owners, designers, and contractors approach the design, construction, and operation of buildings. The processes and features included in green design and construction may have positive and/or negative impacts on construction worker safety and health. This paper presents the findings of a research study of the impact of green building design and construction practices on construction worker safety and health. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable and lost time injury and illness data from green projects (as identified by LEED) and from nongreen projects was collected through a structured questionnaire survey. The data collected was analyzed to test for the presence of a difference in OSHA recordable incident rates (RIRs) and lost time case rates (LTCRs) between green and nongreen projects. It was found that there was suggestive, but inconclusive evidence of a statistically significant difference in the RIRs of the green and nongreen building projects included in the study. No statistically significant difference was found between the LTCRs for the green and nongreen projects included in the study. The study findings provide valuable information to the construction industry for the purposes of project safety planning and the assessment of safety and health on projects.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 representatives of clients and contractors with direct and recent experience of delivering large public infrastructure projects. Interviews explored the procurement approaches taken, and the use of incentives and performance measurement. Data was subjected to inductive analysis to identify emergent concepts and themes relating to the way that New Public Management (NPM) influences the commercial management of infrastructure construction projects, with particular reference to OHS impacts. The concept of institutional logics was utilised as a theoretical frame to understand clients' behaviour in the commercial management of infrastructure projects. Client behaviour was consistent with elements of NPM and reflected a managerialist logic in the pursuit of efficiency, the use of targets, incentives and performance measurement. However, a strong professional service logic was also found to drive active client behaviour in relation to the management of OHS. Understanding the institutional logics driving client OHS practices is an important theoretical development that can stimulate reflexive practice which may create an impetus for change.

System Development Planning via System Maturity Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integration readiness level; project monitoring and control; project planning; system readiness level; technology management; technology readiness level	REDUNDANCY ALLOCATION; TECHNOLOGY; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; COMPLEXITY; RESOURCE; FAILURE; SAFETY; MODEL	Many U. S. government agencies and their contractors have subscribed to using the prescriptive metric of technology readiness level ( TRL) as a measure of maturity of an individual technology, with a view toward operational use in a system context. A comprehensive set of concerns becomes relevant when this metric is abstracted from an individual technology to a system context, which may involve interplay among multiple technologies that are integrated through a system development life cycle. This paper proposes a system-focused approach for managing system development and making effective and efficient decisions during this life cycle. A system readiness level (SRL) index that incorporates both the current TRL scale and the concept of an integration readiness level is presented with methods for determining current and future readiness of a system. Using techniques in evolutionary algorithms, the SRL index is optimized based on resource allocation to provide a decision support approach that enhances managerial capabilities in the system's development life cycle. The optimization model for the SRL is then executed with a case example and resource constraints of 75%, 60%, 45%, 30%, and 15% to demonstrate how it can be used to make strategic planning decisions in the system's development life cycle.

J	Nguyen, LH				Luong Hai Nguyen			Relationships between Critical Factors Related to Team Behaviors and Client Satisfaction in Construction Project Organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Team behaviors; Behavior influence; Project performance; Client satisfaction	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTIONS; SCALE; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; CULTURE; QUALITY; IMPACT	Factors related to team behaviors (TBs) have been recognized as critical success factors (CSFs) of a project. Numerous studies on the topic of CSFs have been conducted, but the results have rarely emphasized developing a TB framework for construction project organizations and examining its relationship with client satisfaction, a key criterion for measuring project success; these less-researched topics are the aims of this study. TB attributes were first developed using questionnaires that collected data on 195 completed construction projects in Vietnam. By performing a principal component analysis, these attributes were organized into a four-factor TB framework: (1) project planning and organizing emphasis (P & OE); (2) coordination emphasis (CE); (3) contractor assurance emphasis (CAE); and (4) empowerment assignment emphasis (EAE). The findings reveal that P&OE, CE, and CAE have significant effects on client satisfaction with project quality (SPQ), whereas CAE and EAE contribute to improved client satisfaction with project schedule (SPS) and project budget (SPB). In addition, CAE is shown to be a relatively significant influencing factor for all criteria within client satisfaction. The study findings suggest a useful tool both for supporting the project management process of construction professionals and for improving client satisfaction.

J	Loosemore, M; Lim, BTH				Loosemore, Martin; Lim, Benson Teck-Heng			Intra-organisational injustice in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; People; Fairness; Human resource management; Justice; Organizations	PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose - Increasing workforce casualisation, under representation of women and other minority groups, racial discrimination, corruption and poor safety are just some of the documented examples of intra-organisational injustice in the industry. Typically these issues are problematised separately using different theoretical frameworks, yet at the most fundamental behavioural level they have a common cause which lies in the "unjust" treatment of one person by another. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the conceptual understanding of these hitherto separated but conceptually linked problems. Design/methodology/approach - A survey 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. Findings - Surprisingly despite widespread academic concerns about injustice in the construction industry, there are not significant concerns within the industry community. Contrary to much research about the poor culture of the construction industry, the results indicate that the relatively low levels of perceived injustice are institutional rather than cultural. The research also highlights the plight of middle management, which appear to consistently suffer the highest levels of injustice across all its theoretical categories. Research limitations/implications - Sample size and Australian focus. Practical implications - Informs organisational policies to reduce injustice in the construction industry. Social implications - By reducing injustice, this research will improve the fairness of business practices in the construction industry. Originality/value - Application of justice theories to conceptualise unfair construction practices.

It affects design quality, project communication between stakeholders, and final project performance in terms of cost, schedule, and quality. This paper examines the relationship between project definition and final project performance through a structural equation model comprising four latent constructs and six path hypotheses using data from a questionnaire survey of 120 general contractors in the Malaysian construction industry. The results show that in the study population all three items impact the project performance, but the link between design quality and project performance is indirect. Instead, the clarity of project definition affects project performance indirectly through design quality and project communication and design quality affects project performance indirectly through project communication. The primary contribution is to provide quantitative confirmation of the more general statements made in the literature from around the world and therefore adds to and consolidates existing knowledge. Practical implications derived from the finding are also proposed for various project stakeholders. Furthermore, as lack of the clarity of project definition is a very common occurrence in construction projects globally, these findings have important ramifications for all construction projects in expanding and clarifying existing knowledge on what is needed for the successful delivery of construction projects.

To achieve this objective, an original calculation procedure was proposed to quantify the fresh concrete waste, and direct quantitative measurements were performed in three batching plants in Turkey. Data obtained were analysed by descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, and hypothesis testing. As a result, clients may order 8.57% more of their concrete needs instead of using much wider margins to avoid over-ordered concrete. They may also reserve 8.96% of their concrete needs in other batching plants to compensate their possible extra concrete requirements. Based on these numbers, concrete amount and cost may be better estimated, and thus, the over-ordered concrete may be eliminated. Finally, leftover concrete amount was found to be 0.33% of total concrete in a truck-mixer and to be in a relationship with the number of arrivals of a truck-mixer in an order. Through these findings, potential conflicts between contractors and concrete suppliers about the amount of delivered concrete may be prevented. Also, batching plants may save concrete and benefit from recycling. Overall, natural resources and energy may be consumed less and environmental pollution may be prevented.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently.

Several studies have been focused on identifying leading complexity indicators; however, the complexity indicators from the perspective of primary stakeholders (owners, contractors, and consultants) have been rarely studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to utilize the systematic Delphi method to identify, rank and weight the complexity indicators based on the primary stakeholders' perspectives associated with US construction projects. Additionally, the shared entity-based complexity indicators (ECIs), as well as the weighting of entity-based complexity categories were determined and analyzed. Therefore, 101 potential ECIs were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Then, thirteen senior subject matter experts (SMEs), and three academic advisors were selected and invited to participate in a workshop to determine significant ECIs and then rank and weight them. The results reveal that the ECIs associated with complexity categories "scope definition" and "project resources" received the highest aggregated complexity weights in the aspect of the primary stakeholders. Although this study has been conducted based on US construction projects, the results would provide helpful guidance for international construction projects. Moreover, this study would assist the primary stakeholders in allocating resources properly in order to manage project complexity worldwide.

Methodological approach of construction business failure prediction studies: a review	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Review						Bankruptcy prediction models; insolvency; methodology; research methods	MULTIVARIATE DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; FORECASTING FINANCIAL FAILURE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISTRESS PREDICTION; CONTRACTOR DEFAULT; FEATURE-SELECTION; MODEL; COMPANIES; INDUSTRY	Performance of bankruptcy prediction models (BPM), which partly depends on the methodological approach used to develop it, has virtually stagnated over the years. The methodological positions of BPM studies were thus investigated. Systematic review was used to search and retrieve 70 journal articles and doctoral theses. Their general methods and philosophical underpinnings were investigated using summary of findings tables and meta-analysis. General methods results showed positive trends in terms of techniques being used, error cost consideration and model validation, with some use of skewed data being the main drawback. For philosophical underpinnings, positivism paradigm was discovered to be at the core of BPM studies. This is deemed inadequate because of the need to consider industries' dynamism, financial variables flaws and social factors which actually lead to the financial status of firms. The pragmatism paradigm using mixed method is proposed. A research design framework for executing the proposed methodology is presented. This will help BPM developers go through more rigorous and robust methodology to deliver better and more valid models. Limitations of study include not reviewing studies not reported in English language and impact of different countries' accounting practices on ratios. Limited availability of theses' database resulted in reviewing only four theses.

J	Petri, I; Beach, T; Rana, OF; Rezgui, Y				Petri, Ioan; Beach, Tom; Rana, Omer F.; Rezgui, Yacine			Coordinating multi-site construction projects using federated clouds	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Coordination; AEC projects; Building information modeling; Collaboration; CometCioud; Clouds	MANAGEMENT; BIM	The requirements imposed by AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) projects with regard to data storage and execution, on-demand data sharing and complexity on building simulations have led to utilising novel computing techniques. In detail, these requirements refer to storing the large amounts of data that the AEC industry generates from building schematics to associated data derived from different contractors that are involved at various stages of the building lifecycle; or running simulations on building models (such as energy efficiency, environmental impact & occupancy simulations). Creating such a computing infrastructure to support operations deriving from various AEC projects can be challenging due to the complexity of workflows, distributed nature of the data and diversity of roles, profiles and location of the users. Federated clouds have provided the means to create a distributed environment that can support multiple individuals and organisations to work collaboratively. In this study we present how multi-site construction projects can be coordinated by the use of federated clouds where the interacting parties are represented by AEC industry organisations. We show how coordination can support (a) data sharing and interoperability using a multi-vendor Cloud environment and (b) process interoperability based on various stakeholders involved in the AEC project lifecycle. We develop a framework that facilitates project coordination with associated "issue status" implications and validate our outcome in a real construction project.

Information-Integration Maturity Model for the Capital Projects Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Information management; Project management; Technology; Information integration; Maturity model; Management of technology	ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS; IMPACT; ENVIRONMENTS	This paper presents an information integration maturity model for the capital projects industry. Due to the trends of construction projects becoming more globalized and their processes being conducted more concurrently, information integration has been widely implemented in the capital projects industry. However, one issue for the planning of information integration is that the current practice tends to be ad hoc and centered on individual information integration opportunities. Also, the existing knowledge for information integration implementation is not helpful because different organizations have different idiosyncratic characteristics regarding work processes, culture, and information technology (IT) use. To address these issues, a research team consisting of 15 members from leading contractors, construction clients, and academia in the United States developed a capital projects information integration maturity model. The model can be used to assess the current state of work functions in terms of information integration. It can also be used to manage a portfolio of information integration opportunities that can help organizations make a systematic plan for further investment in information integration. The model has been applied to various real-world information integration cases. The application broadly validates the concept and utility of the model, showing it to be a useful and accurate characterization of information integration performance within the capital projects industry.

Research and practice have demonstrated that management tasks may be duplicated when standards are implemented in parallel. Consequently, integrated management systems are strongly advocated. However, existing literature demonstrates that the integration of planning and control instruments involves a high level of uncertainty. This paper presents an innovative model to enhance the integration of environmental-and health and safety-management systems in construction companies, focusing on the subsystems for identifying, assessing, and operationally controlling environmental aspects and health and safety hazards and using risk as an integrating factor. The findings of this study have direct implications for both designers and contractors because the model helps to explicitly consider on-site environmental impacts and construction-worker safety during the design process and offers on-site guidance to eliminate the remaining impacts and risks or reduce them to acceptable levels. A case study is reported to illustrate the practical use of the proposed model and its benefits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000579. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Ping			Enhancing knowledge exchange through web map-based knowledge management system in construction: Lessons learned in Taiwan	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						knowledge management; knowledge map; web-based application; construction projects		Knowledge management involves creating, securing, coordinating, combining, retrieving and distributing knowledge. Knowledge can be reused and shared among engineers and experts to enhance construction processes and decrease the time and cost of solving problems. This study presents a novel and practical method to capture and represent construction project knowledge by using network knowledge maps. Network Knowledge Maps (NKM) gives users an overview of available and missing knowledge in core project areas, enabling tacit and explicit knowledge to be managed appropriately. This study addresses application of knowledge management in the construction phase of construction projects, and presents a construction Map-based Knowledge Management (MBKM) concept and system for contractors. The MBKM system is then utilized in selected case studies involving a High-Tech factory building enterprise in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and indicate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge, particularly in the construction phase. Knowledge can be captured and managed to benefit future projects by effectively utilizing information and web technologies during the construction phase of a project. The results of this study demonstrate that an MBKM-like system can be applied effectively in knowledge management systems in the construction industry by using map-based knowledge management and web technology.

J	Landin, A; Nilsson, CH				Landin, A; Nilsson, CH			Do quality systems really make a difference?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						management systems; balanced scorecard; ISO 9000; quality assessment; organizational performance; Sweden		The purposes of this study were to ascertain whether Swedish construction companies measure the impact of their quality systems (such as ISO 9000) and, if so, whether the 'balanced scorecard' approach is a useful technique as a measure of performance. The balanced scorecard approach requires each organization to look at itself from four different perspectives to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance: the financial perspective, the customer perspective, the process perspective, the innovation and learning perspective. Twelve Swedish construction sector companies (clients, architectural-engineering consultants, contractors) with well-established quality systems were studied. The results indicate two important points. First, the balanced scorecard can be successfully used to measure the performance of quality systems in the construction process. Second, the organization and learning perspective is neglected in the Swedish construction process. The use of the balanced scorecard highlighted the fact that a lack of balance often exists between the four perspectives. While it is tempting to conclude that investments in quality systems increase organizational performance, there is little (if any) evidence that this is the case. Many investments in quality systems appear to be based more on blind faith than on facts. Tools are only valuable if they improve results, there is a need for further understanding the costs and benefits of quality systems in engineering and construction organizations.

However, whether internationalization can improve their productivity growth in the long run needs to be considered. Moreover, rapid changes in institutional environments and different ownership concentrations in developing economies can contribute to different outcomes. This study established models that examine the impact of internationalization on total factor productivity (TFP), TFP's components, and the profitability of 86 construction firms in Malaysia from 2003 to 2016 by applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The results showed that internationalization reduced firm productivity during Malaysia's lack of promarket phase of 2003-2009 but became negligible during the more promarket phase of 2010-2016. The negative impact was due to scale inefficiency. The effect of regulatory control and family ownership concentration reduced the negative impact of internationalization, whereas capital availability, foreign debt, price control freedom, and government ownership negatively affected the impact of internationalization on firm productivity. This study is the first to explore the impact of internationalization on TFP's components. It contributes to management in the engineering domain by extending insights into the effect of institutional environments, institutional dimensions, and ownership concentrations on the impact of internationalization on firm productivity.

Little is known about how this relationship is contingent upon informal elements that may replenish contracts-such as the shadow of the future, fairness perception, and trust. To answer these questions, the authors collected data from contractors as claimants. The results show that claimants' satisfaction is positively associated with rigid contract enforcement, with fairness perception, and with trust strengthening this relationship (but trust merely functions in cross-border interorganizational relationships). Flexible contract enforcement regarding obliging behaviors undermines claimants' satisfaction, and this relationship is negatively moderated by the shadow of the future. Hence, fairness perception and trust play a complementary role in the effectiveness of rigid contract enforcement, while the shadow of the future exacerbates the detrimental impact of flexible contract enforcement. This study not only advances our understanding of contractual governance from the reactive perspective and construction dispute management but also enhances practitioners' capability of coping with disputes regarding how to enforce formal contracts and proactively alter informal elements.

J	Ponton, H; Osborne, A; Thompson, N; Greenwood, D				Ponton, Hazel; Osborne, Allan; Thompson, Neill; Greenwood, David			The power of humour to unite and divide: a case study of design coordination meetings in construction	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction design; interdisciplinary team; humour; cohesion; conflict	DOUBLE-EDGED-SWORD; RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT; TEAM MEETINGS; WORKPLACE; JOKING; LEADERSHIP; LAUGHTER; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TASK	Design coordination meetings are the formal discussion venues that support interdisciplinary group interaction during the construction process. Social behaviour needs to be recognized, understood, and evaluated by group members if meetings are to be productive. The role of humour during the practice of coordinating building design has not previously been studied. A non-participant observation method was used to collect qualitative data from consecutive contractor-led design team meetings during a live building project. Using a 360 degrees panoramic video-recording camera, episodes of humour were captured and collated into packets of rich data. These packets were then organized, structured, and analysed using NVivo computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. The results of the analysis showed that instances of humour do not happen at random but at specific times when they performed distinct functions to facilitate the design coordination process. One notable example was the role of humour in helping to form a cohesive team that was able to manage conflict successfully and thus engender a positive cultural environment. The inclusive findings of the study have demonstrated that humour is a functional aspect of group dynamics during the coordination of design in construction that can influence social interaction and task-related performance.

J	Li, DZ; Li, X; Feng, HB; Wang, Y; Fan, SS				Li, Dezhi; Li, Xin; Feng, Haibo; Wang, Yan; Fan, Shushu			ISM-based relationship among critical factors that affect the choice of prefabricated concrete buildings in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Prefabricated buildings; construction industrialization; interpretative structural modelling (ISM)	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; MODULAR BUILDINGS; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; SYSTEM; POLICY; MODEL; INDUSTRIALIZATION; SUSTAINABILITY	It is well known that building prefabrication has numerous prominent advantages, including shortening construction time, promoting efficiency, reducing air pollution, and so on. As a result, the Chinese government is promoting prefabricated buildings (PBs) but many difficulties occur during promotion of prefabrication. One of the most effective ways to overcome these difficulties is to study the factors affecting the motivation of adopting PBs and their relationships, which has rarely been studied by previous literature. In this paper, 13 critical factors affecting the choice of adopting prefabrication were identified by reviewing literature and interviewing experts. A hierarchical graph of factors was obtained through interpretative structural modelling (ISM). It can be concluded that ?safety?, ?quality?, ?cost?, ?schedule?, ?corporate image? and ?environmental benefits? are direct factors. ?Supply capacity of component factory?, ?structure type?, ?capacity of the contractor?, ?transportation of components? and ?function of project? are indirect factors. ?Project height? and ?project size? are fundamental factors.

Thomas			Synergising R&D initiatives for e-enhancing management support systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction supply chains; Hong Kong; ICT; Information and Knowledge Management; management support systems; performance; R&D		Many R&D projects aim at developing Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) systems for enhancing productivity and performance levels in certain operations within specific segments of construction supply chains e.g. for improved collaborative design management, enhanced material control systems, and streamlined communications management. It is proposed that related R&D outputs now need to be brought together, and efforts made to align future inputs towards a consolidated cluster of systems and tools that could be applied to management support systems across the entire construction supply chain in general. In this context, two ongoing exercises to develop IKM based management support systems for large clients and small and medium contractors respectively are described, and a suggestion made for eventually linking and synergizing the two systems on specific projects through an e-platform for project-based collaborative IKM. This provides an example of the potential synergies in aiming for a convergence of some of the many hitherto parallel (or even divergent) R&D endeavors in construction academia and industry. This should help to overcome some of the obstacles impeding progress towards e-enhanced transactions across the entire supply chain, aiming at efficient e-procurement and e-delivery of construction projects.

Albeit the promising nature of the UAE's AEC industry, that sought to embrace the latest technologies, the research revealed that, BIM is not yet widely utilised. The UAE was selected as a case study due to the diversity of its local AEC industry, whereby the AEC market has attracted contractors, consultants, suppliers from across the globe. This research adopted a mixed methodological approach using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to gather data from BIM users and non-users. The research investigated the perceived benefits and challenges of adopting BIM and the impact of short and long-term initiatives that can be deployed to drive the effective diffusion of BIM. The study found that there is irrefutable evidence of a lack of impetus to generate interest in BIM from an industry that has in fact undermined the pace of BIM adoption. This paper offers a set of practical recommendations not only for the government to accelerate the transition to BIM, but also to BIM late adopters.

H.; Liu, Rui; Xia, Bo			The use of building information modelling by quantity surveyors in facilities management roles	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantity surveyors; BIM; Facilities management	BIM	Purpose Adoption of building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM) provides an information platform to store and exchange asset data. Quantity Surveyors, with cost management expertise, are increasingly involved in FM roles in the operation phase. However, no study has been conducted on how BIM may assist Quantity Surveyors when contracted in FM roles. This study aims to identify the potential benefits and challenges of using BIM by Quantity Surveyors in FM roles. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with eight professionals from an international built and natural asset design and management company and its FM business partner in Australia. Findings Lack of complete and accurate data was the main issue faced by Quantity Surveyors in FM. The benefits of BIM in FM were digitizing and storing asset information and developing a cost database that would be useful for Quantity Surveyors, whereas challenges included keeping model data up to date, cost, industry resistance to change and contractors' lack of model use. Originality/value This study contributes to revealing the niche adoption of BIM by Quantity Surveyors in FM and identifying the issues faced by Quantity Surveyors in FM roles using BIM. It contributes to the knowledge of BIM adoption in post-construction. Findings will be useful to develop strategies for adopting BIM in FM and supporting Quantity Surveyors' roles in FM.

To investigate the salient issues, 23 widespread problems plaguing the global construction industry were first observed from a detailed literature review. A questionnaire was administered in Malaysia to solicit the viewpoints of 117 construction practitioners (clients, consultants, and contractors) to prioritize these problems appropriately according to the importance index, which also considered the frequency of occurrence and severity of the problems. The five most critical problems were ranked as follows: changes of design during construction, cost overruns, late completion, competitive tendering procedures, and late payment. Spearman's rank correlation tests affirmed the homogeneity of perceptions among the primary stakeholder groups. Next, a principal component analysis (PCA) manifested six major underlying dimensions of these problems, relating to a three-dimensional (3D) stigma, poor site coordination and management, incompetency of construction stakeholders, slow technology adoption, haphazard decision-making, and inefficient administrative processes. A comparison of the principal factors with other selected countries was performed for validation purposes. The results of this research can guide practitioners and researchers to focus on human- and management-related construction problems when devising strategic action plans to improve the construction industries of developing countries.

In this study, the authors used job burnout as a core indicator of the chronic psychological stress of CPMs. Based on the job demand-resource model, a theoretical framework was proposed to investigate the causal path of job burnout of CPMs, especially the role of organizational justice. A questionnaire with a presurvey was developed referencing various psychometric and organizational behavior scales. Then, in 2017, a survey was conducted throughout China through face-to-face interviews, e-mails, and an online questionnaire system. The validity of the measurement was tested with confirmatory factor analysis, and the hypothetical model was validated with structural equation modeling. Subsequently, 14 mediating effects and 2 moderating effects of organizational justice on job burnout were identified. The results showed that different organizational justice dimensions have different pathways in the causal chain of job burnout of CPMs. Temporal and spatial injustice was most prominent and led to exhaustion of CPMs. Through mediating paths, distributive justice had the most significant impact on the cynicism and low professional efficacy of CPMs, while procedural and interactional injustice resulted in their exhaustion. In addition, procedural and interactional justice buffered the impact of job stress on job burnout.

First, the replicated dynamic equation set is established in terms of expense targets. Second, the equilibrium solutions of the equation set are obtained to test strategy options. The trends of system fluctuations caused by penalty and reward changes are also analyzed. Finally, the stability of the proposed model is improved by integrating a dynamic penalty-reward scenario into the evolutionary strategy of the PO. Simulation results show that: 1) the evolutionary stable strategy does not exist in initial interactions, 2) the degrees of penalty and reward considerably affect the CC's rate variable, and 3) the dynamic penalty-reward scenario could effectively improve the stability of the proposed modeL The unsteadiness of the quality supervision system and the stability control scenario could help in understanding the impact of interactions among stakeholders and provide suggestions for optimizing quality supervision procedures.

Although supplier selection is a strategic issue, contractors generally select suppliers based on their past experiences, which may result in selecting wrong suppliers. Supplier selection decision is generally made by multiple decision makers and is affected by several criteria. Therefore, selecting the right supplier among many alternatives considering several compromising and conflicting criteria is a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem. This paper proposes an integrated fuzzy MCGDM approach, which employs fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) together, for the supplier selection problem. In the proposed approach, fuzzy AHP is used to analyse the structure of the supplier selection problem and to determine the weights of the criteria, and the fuzzy TOPSIS method is employed to rank the alternative suppliers. The proposed approach is applied to a problem of selecting the most appropriate rail supplier and company management found the proposed decision approach satisfactory and implementable in future supplier selection problems.

J	Nguyen, LD; Ibbs, W				Nguyen, Long D.; Ibbs, William			Case Law and Variations in Cumulative Impact Productivity Claims	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Claims; Contracts; Court decisions; Productivity; Owners; Contractors		Proving and quantifying lost productivity due to cumulative impacts of multiple changes are difficult tasks. This paper presents the most acceptable methods from case law and demonstrates their applications for analyzing the loss of productivity. These methods include earned value analysis, measured mile analysis, and combinations of these two. They are either well established or drawn from recent court and board decisions. A case study is used to illustrate and compare the use of these methods. These methods result in considerably different loss of productivity values though the actual amount (i.e., inefficiency in labor hours) is unique for a particular case and though these methods are often thought to be similar or even the same. How a measured mile analysis and its variants are employed affects the amount of lost productivity estimated. The variants can avoid some drawbacks of measured mile and earned value studies. Nevertheless, which method is more accurate and reliable is difficult to provide for a particular claim. Practitioners should choose between them based on the availability of project records and the nature of changes and cumulative impacts. Practitioners may also employ two or more methods to perform a "sensitivity analysis" of the chosen methods and persuade the other party and/or the jury that their estimate of lost productivity is sufficiently certain.

This study aims to investigate the magnitude of rework costs generated by different sources for residential building projects in China. Six residential building projects were selected as sample cases; rework activities and their detailed cost information were collected and analysed. The result revealed that average rework cost of residential building projects was 4.95% of the total project cost. The majority of rework costs were generated by three sources including contractor field management (20.10%), design management (18.91%) and client management (14.73%). It was also found that the main liability bearers of rework costs did not take corresponding responsibilities. The establishment of rework costs allocation mechanism is therefore required to enhance the sense of responsibility among different entities. The magnitude of rework cost may well motivate them take collaborative actions to reduce rework cost. This article provides valuable empirical data for practitioners to understand the major sources of rework costs and main liability-bearers. Therefore, practitioners can take targeted measures to address certain key factors that cause rework based on the data. Above all, this study will bring benefit to the construction industry as well as the whole society.

This research aims to establish the effectiveness of the CMF in achieving this aim. It aims to define best value as it is understood collectively by the participants in the framework, and evaluate the performance measurement used in terms of its relevance and suitability to deliver the best value. The research also looks at perceptions of the performance of the CMF by those companies included in the framework, and the benefits and disadvantages of using this type of arrangement in highway work. Data collected from the client were compared to that given by the contractors, supply chain, and construction managers of the CMF; results showed a perception by those involved in the framework that construction management is suited to the type of work it is currently used for, and there is potential for similar CMFs to be used elsewhere in the construction industry. However, the research also found that there is a need to improve the performance measures so that value is properly reflected in the goals of the CMF; and the presentation of evidence that demonstrates the benefits that can be gained using this procurement route.

J	Jahanger, QK; Louis, J; Trejo, D; Pestana, C				Jahanger, Qais K.; Louis, Joseph; Trejo, David; Pestana, Catarina			Potential Influencing Factors Related to Digitalization of Construction-Phase Information Management by Project Owners	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Potential influencing factor; Digitalization; Construction phase; Information management; Project owner; Public agency	IMPLEMENTATION; BENEFITS; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Public agencies or owners that are responsible for the construction and maintenance of built infrastructure or facilities are working toward the digitalization of the project administration and delivery process, especially in the construction phase. However, implementation is still an ongoing effort despite technology availability. While contractors have readily adopted digital systems, owners lag in their implementation. This lag in implementation could be for different reasons, including lack of knowledge regarding challenges and barriers. Therefore, this research identifies and ranks potential influencing factors to enable successful implementation of digital construction-phase information management (DCIM) systems by project owners. Twenty-eight potential influencing factors were identified from the literature and ranked following statistical analysis of survey responses from industry professionals. While the results show that all identified potential influencing factors are important at different levels for the successful implementation of DCIM systems, their ranking enables decision-making based on perceived importance to the owner. Furthermore, responses from the two studied owner subpopulations indicated that there is general agreement on their importance despite significant statistical differences regarding the importance of six factors. The findings of this research can enhance understanding of the challenges and barriers present in the industry, especially at public agencies, to the implementation of digital technologies.

Determining the stationary financial cause of contracting firms failure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Failure causes; contracting firms failure; construction industry; Egyptian economy; relative importance index; Ginni's measure of dispersion	BUSINESS FAILURE; PROJECTS; NETWORK	Failure of the contracting firms becomes an essential part of the construction industry. There are many sources that can cause failure of contracting firms and the financial causes are one of these crucial factors. This study aims at determining the stationary financial cause of contracting firms failure. A questionnaire survey comprises 18 financial causes has been conducted with Egyptian engineers from the big-sized contracting firms for appraising their importance degree. Survey results showed that national downturns in the economy, high prices of building materials, poor estimating practice, delayed progress payments from the client, and non-payment of interest on delayed certificate are the main causes behind contracting firms failure. Further, Ginni's mean difference measure of dispersion revealed that the stationary financial cause of contacting firms failure is contractor firm starting business with a small paid-up capital. Finally, in a comparison with seven developing countries, the stationary financial cause was found to be the most frequent cause of contracting firms failure, influencing 85.71% of the surveyed countries. The findings bridge a gap in knowledge regarding the financial causes of the failure of the big-sized contracting firms in Egypt, to be utilized as variables for failure prediction models in future works.

However, there are a limited number of studies investigating the relationship between business level strategy and implementation of PM in the construction industry. This paper aligns one of the business strategies, namely differentiation, with the PM process. A framework representing differentiation in the construction industry is proposed in this study. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to validate the relationship between differentiation and the PM process. The results show that a relationship between differentiation strategy and PM exists. The two types of differentiation are revealed, namely "product variety and speed-related differentiation" (PSD) and "quality and image-related differentiation" (QID). The companies trying to differentiate based on PSD should focus on cost, time and quality management. Change management and project planning are identified as important drivers of differentiation based on PSD. On the other hand, the companies trying to differentiate on QID should consider health, safety and environmental issues as well as quality. Companies should also manage their resources effectively to support the PM process that in turn leads to successful differentiation. Companies can utilize the research findings as a guideline while formulating their differentiation strategies.

In developing countries, corruption stifles economic development and engenders social inequality. Using a structured questionnaire survey to elicit direct knowledge and lived experiences of construction practitioners, this study uncovered the prevalence and forms of corrupt practices within the developing country of Ghana. Research findings illustrate that habitual corruption and unethical behavior prevail among public officials, contractors, and construction professionals during the bid evaluation, tendering, and contract implementation stages of a construction contract. This research proffers that corruption is driven by a toxic concoction of high political connections, excessive and reckless sole sourcing of public construction projects, lack of commitment by construction companies in addressing corruption, and the inherently idiosyncratic operational environment of the construction sector. The top five forms of corruption frequently encountered, in descending order, are kickbacks (extortion), bribery, collusion and tender rigging, conflict of interest, and fraud. This research presents a rare glimpse of construction industry corruption in a developing country and provides polemic clarity geared to intellectually challenge readers in government and industry. Future work is required to explore and develop appropriate countermeasures to address corrupt practices and behaviors. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

It is a common vision to aim for coordinated homogenization of data structures, enabled by the classification of information. This paper studies the role of building information standards for classification in digitization of the building life cycle. It draws on science and technology studies of information technology standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for information systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear and multiple. The five-year design process of a large hospital in Denmark is examined as episodes of performance of the building information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client demands, several building information standards are active over time: an expansive' design brief process adds user demands and uses room classification. Another process diminishes the design brief more than 50%, with several standards in use. The client's facilities management system, which performs the structuring of data backwards' into the design process, makes architects and engineers (but not contractors) use CCS. This fragmentation of performing standards is denoted multiple performativities' and includes temporal and compartmental performativity.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on insights from a literature review, interviews were held with relevant staff to identify barriers. These were verified and their relative significance was determined through the use of a questionnaire, before being reflected upon and compared with literature findings. Findings - The research identified 37 barriers to local governments using PPPs in road development projects and showed that four barriers consistently stand out. First, the application of PPPs requires local governments to adapt their current working methods, which amounts to a large impediment to local governments applying PPPs. Second, local government employees believe that applying PPPs might effectively exclude local contractors from involvement in projects. Finally, local governments experience the whole PPP approach (the third barrier) and the PPP contract (the fourth) as overly complicated. Practical implications - To increase the use of PPPs for infrastructure provision at the local level, one has to focus on removing dominant local barriers as identified in this research. Originality/value - Although local-level PPPs have seen increasing interest, this is one of the first studies paying attention to the barriers to using PPPs for local road development projects.

Globally, construction projects are often delayed and completed above-estimated budgets because of inferior works and contract variations. These in turn negatively affect the goals set by public sector client. Many studies aim to establish factors for successful construction projects that include public road construction projects. However, challenges remain. Using institutional theory, this research focusses on success factors for implementing public road construction projects in Uganda. Loss of funds in such projects significantly affects and stalls the implementation process. This study is cross-sectional and structured self-administered questionnaires are used with Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) data analysis by Smart-PLS3 subsequently conducted. The findings reveal that professionalism, monitoring activities, familiarity with regulatory framework; perceived inefficiency of regulatory framework and compliance with these frameworks significantly enhances successful implementation of public road construction projects. However, sanctions on staff and contractors' resistance to non-compliance are insignificant predictors. Governments should emphasize and embark on improving monitoring mechanisms and staff familiarity with public procurement regulatory frameworks to avoid manipulations by unethical project stakeholders especially on contract cost variation during implementation. These regulatory frameworks should be written in a less technical language that is easily interpreted by stakeholders. Recruitment of qualified staff is paramount.

The adoption of network strategies is motivated by a set of factors (i.e., drivers), but also faces numerous challenges (i.e., barriers). The appreciation of the factors motivating and deterring networking strategies is beneficial to the successful implementation of network strategies. In the context of public construction projects, this study aims to examine the quantitative effect of drivers and barriers on three network strategies (i.e., trust, information sharing and joint problem solving). The results of a questionnaire-survey of 104 public projects show that the adoption of network strategies in public construction is mainly cost-driven. The results indicate that four barriers impede network strategies in public projects: (i) a lack of continuity and (ii) ethos of public services are harmful to trust; (iii) institutional constraints hinder information sharing; and (iv) a lack of capability is a hurdle to information sharing and trust. It is also found that one barrier (i.e., ethos of public services) has a positive influence on trust between clients and consultants. Recommendations on enhancing network strategies through the appreciation of drivers and bathers are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Ng, ST; Li, WT				Ng, ST; Li, WT			A parallel bargaining protocol for automated sourcing of construction suppliers	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						multi-agent system; supplier; construction material; parallel bargaining	NEGOTIATION; SYSTEMS; AGENTS	Bidding is a critical decision process as it would determine whether a contractor can win a construction contract at a reasonable profit margin. Among various factors affecting the bidding decisions, the selection of suitable suppliers for the provision of various construction materials is one of the most important aspects in ensuring bid and project success. Despite that, in the absence of time at the bidding stage, the negotiation with suppliers is normally carried out in a crude and unstructured manner, and the terms and prices for material supply could be far from ideal. Automated negotiation using the Multi-Agent System (MAS) concept can reduce the response time and maximize the expected profit should a suitable negotiation protocol be devised. In this paper, a parallel bargaining protocol is proposed by analyzing the characteristics of the negotiation process involved in suppliers sourcing. This new protocol is an extension of the fish-market protocol in which the bargaining of material terms and prices is conducted with several suppliers concurrently. Although some limitations were found in the study, the protocol appears to have great potential in the problem domain, and it could provide a solid foundation for the design of a MAS for the sourcing of suppliers for construction projects.

Life cycle cost savings analysis on traditional drainage systems from low impact development strategies	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						low impact development; traditional drainage system; hydraulic benefits; life-cycle cost	EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOFS	Areas that are covered with natural vegetation have been converted into asphalt, concrete, or roofed structures and have increased surface impermeability and decreased natural drainage capability. Conventional drainage systems were built to mimic natural drainage patterns to prevent the occurrence of waterlogging in developed sites. These drainage systems consist of two major components: 1) a stormwater conduit system, and 2) a runoff storage system. Runoff storage systems contain retention basins and drywells that are used to store and percolate runoff, whereas conduit systems are combination of catch basins and conduit pipes used to collect and transport runoff. The construction of these drainage systems is costly and may cause significant environmental disturbance. In this study, low impact development (LID) methods that consist of extensive green roofs (GRs) and permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICPs) are applied in real-world construction projects. Construction project documents were reviewed, and related cost information was gathered through the accepted bidding proposals and interviews of specialty contractors in the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. Results indicate that the application of both LID methods to existing projects can save an average of 27.2% in life cycle costs (LCC) for a 50-year service life and 18.7% in LCC for a 25-year service life on the proposed drainage system, respectively.

This study aims to develop a prequalification model that can serve as the basis for revising the existing regulations and criteria. The authors conducted interviews among experts to localize a framework of prequalification criteria. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), accompanied by a survey among industry participants, was used to determine the importance level of decision criteria. The results confirmed that the existing guidelines cannot meet the expectations of the industry due to the overemphasis on the past performance of consultants and disregarding their current capabilities. For the international audience, this study clarifies that (1)the working culture of industry participants impacts their judgments on the importance level of intangible and tangible criteria used for prequalification processes, (2)short-listing consultants for long-term and fragmented data collection in national registration or project prequalification should be avoided, and (3)researchers must test FAHP models with different fuzzy scales because the success of the widely used fuzzy extent analysis method is highly dependent on the scale of fuzzy functions and judgments of decision makers.

Design/methodology/approach The investigation is based on a case study where empirical evidence has been collected via semi-structured interviews of 54 professionals within the construction industry. Findings Based on the research the authors were able to identify three main dimensions vital for project partnering success: 1. who related to participant selection; 2. what related to task clarification; and 3. way related to partnering means. These dimensions give rise to what the authors have termed a 3W (Who, What, Way) model on how to succeed with project partnering in practice. The third dimension, way related to partnering means, was found to consist of the four subdimensions: 3a. partnering attitude; 3b. a collaborative culture; 3c. a holistic perspective; and 3d. an accurate handover. Originality/value The authors found 318 papers focusing on partnering, in these only 19 focused on how to succeed with project partnering. The authors have complemented the limited research on how to succeed with project partnering with 54 interviews of professionals. The majority of the existing research has focused on challenges. This paper contributes to the research gap by presenting a 3W model on how to succeed with project partnering.

Despite the complexity of bid decision making process, in the construction industry the majority of bid/no bid decisions is made informally based on experience, judgment, and perception. In this paper, a procedure based on support vector machines and backward elimination regression is presented for improving the existing bid decision making methods. The method takes advantage of the strong generalization properties of support vector machines and attempts to further enhance generalization performance by eliminating insignificant input variables. The method is implemented for bid/no bid decision making of offshore oil and gas platform fabrication projects to achieve a parsimonious support vector machine classifier. The performance of the support vector machine classifier is compared with the performances of the worth evaluation model, linear regression, and neural network classifiers. The results show that the support vector machine classifier outperforms existing methods significantly, and the proposed procedure provides a powerful tool for bid/no bid decision making. The results also reveal that elimination of the insignificant input variables improves generalization performance of the support vector machines.

J	Lam, KC; Oshodi, OS				Lam, Ka Chi; Oshodi, Olalekan Shamsideen			Using Univariate Models for Construction Output Forecasting: Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Econometric Techniques	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Box-Jenkins; Forecasting; Construction output; Support vector machine	PROPERTY PRICE; HONG-KONG; DEMAND; INVESTMENT; MARKET	Forecasting of the volume of construction works plays an important role in ensuring that stakeholders (contractors, consultants, government, etc.) formulate policies for strategic long-term planning in the construction sector. In construction economics, research efforts targeted at construction output forecasting have been limited due to the lack of availability of quantitative data. To address this problem, the current study explores the use of univariate modeling techniques in construction output forecasting. Three univariate modeling techniques [namely, Box-Jenkins, neural network autoregression (NNAR), and support vector machine (SVM)] were used to predict output of various construction sectors. In the literature, the Box-Jenkins model is considered a benchmark univariate method due to its simplicity, sound theoretical basis, and predictive performance. Out-of-sample forecasting was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. The results of the study revealed that the SVM model can reliably and accurately predict residential, maintenance, and total construction output in the medium term. The univariate models reported here can be implemented using historical data on construction output in other countries; this is particularly useful in cases where data are inadequate for multivariate models. The developed SVM model can serve as a tool for estimating future trends in construction output.

J	Yiu, TW; Cheung, SO; Chow, PT				Yiu, Tak Wing; Cheung, Sai On; Chow, Pui Ting			Logistic regression modeling of construction negotiation outcomes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction negotiation; logistic regression (LR); negotiation outcomes; negotiator tactics	BILATERAL NEGOTIATION; INTEGRATIVE SOLUTIONS; VISUAL ACCESS; CONFLICT; ORIENTATION; PREDICTION; CONTRACTOR; DISCOVERY; STRATEGY; IMPACT	Construction disputes are always negotiated before other resolution methods are considered. When it comes to negotiation, the tactics used by a negotiator is central in deriving desired outcomes. This paper reports a research that employs logistic regression (LR) to predict the probabilistic relationship between negotiator tactics and negotiation outcomes. To achieve this, three main stages of work were involved. Negotiator tactics and negotiation outcomes were first identified from literature. Then, four LR prediction models with negotiation outcomes as the dependent variable and negotiator tactics as the independent variables were constructed. Finally, these models were validated with an independent set of testing data. These models collectively suggested that: 1) increasing time pressure, taking threats, or subjecting the opponent to reality testing are inductive to "deterioration" negotiation outcomes; 2) providing various options and increasing flexibility would achieve "substantial improvement" in negotiation; 3) relationships between parties could be maintained by fair play; and 4) focusing on information exchange, giving middiscussion summaries, and offering counterproposal could clarify a party's position. Despite the skepticism over frank and open discussion of the issues and the existence of game plan, the findings of this research do support some well-established negotiation principles-focus on the issue and play down behavioral factors.

Better planning of operations and balancing of competing demands linked to environmental concerns, costs, and duration is needed. However, existing approaches (theoretical and practical) rarely address all of these demands simultaneously, and are often limited to parts of the process, such as earth allocation methods or equipment allocation methods based on practitioners' past experience or goals. Thus, this study proposes a method that can integrate multiple planning techniques to maximize mitigation of project impacts cost-effectively, including the noted approaches together with others developed to facilitate effective decision-making. The model is adapted for planners and contractors to optimize mass flows and allocate earthmoving equipment configurations with respect to tradeoffs between duration, cost, CO2 emissions, and energy use. Three equipment allocation approaches are proposed and demonstrated in a case study. A rule-based approach that allocates equipment configurations according to hauling distances provided the best-performing approach in terms of costs, CO2 emissions, energy use and simplicity (which facilitates practical application at construction sites). The study also indicates that trucks are major contributors to earthmoving operations' costs and environmental impacts.	[Jassim, Hassanean S.

The present discussion specifically focuses on the analysis of the non-parametric dataset obtained from the POs to investigate a subset of companies labelled as highly effective companies (HECs). This contribution is unique as it used a mixed-mode approach to collect data beyond construction sites and investigate the product/supplier side of construction processes to advance knowledge of how materials can be sent to construction project sites free of defects and rework and indicates practices that contribute to this goal. When compared to other companies in the dataset, HECs engage in more hours of observation in suppliers' facilities, communicate more often with suppliers, put more effort and time in the planning stages of the project, use more practices related to supplier quality surveillance and supplier quality management, and find non-conformances earlier in the project.

To prevent such claims and disputes, the participants need to be assured of their contractual positions and rights based on contract facts. For this reason, the process of writing and reviewing the contracts for construction work is crucial. Most international construction projects require contract management teams to review all the possible risks in the contracts during the bidding periods. However, it is very difficult to review a vast number of contracts in a short period of time. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an automatic model of contract-risk extraction based on natural language processing (NLP) that can automatically detect the poisonous clauses of the contract in order to support contract management for construction companies (contractors). In validating the performance of the automatic model developed in this study, we found that the precision and recall were both 81.8% compared with manual review. This study is meaningful since a model has been developed that can carry out a preemptive contract-risk review. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Huang, YC; Tsai, YC				Huang, Yuchun; Tsai, Yichang (James)			Nonparametric Lens Debris Detection of Video Log Images Using Hysteresis Updating	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Video log image; Lens debris detection; Nonparametric modeling; Hysteresis updating	BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; REMOVAL; SYSTEM; MODEL; SHAPE	Video-log images are often used by state DOTs to manually or automatically extract roadway infrastructure information, including roadway geometry and signs. Poor quality images with lens debris are unacceptable and need to be identified before state DOTs accept the collections of video-log images from contractors. However, manually reviewing the tens of millions of video-log images to detect lens debris deficiencies is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic lens debris detection in video-log images is needed. Based on joint domain-range representation of lens debris candidates that are obtained from dark channel prior depth map estimation and Canny lens debris edge detection, a nonparametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) model for lens debris detection has been developed for the first time. The model detects the lens debris areas in the video-log images using recursive bandwidth selection and hysteresis updating strategy. An experimental test, using 13,007 video-log images provided by the Alberta DOT, was conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can detect lens debris in video-log images with a detection rate greater than 84%. The proposed algorithm is promising for improving video-log image data quality control and assurance. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000121. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A key problem impeding the widespread adoption of emerging technologies is the lack of competent contractors to support the effectiveness of the technology implemented in conventional methods and to ensure returns on investment. The shortcomings of conventional methods are assessed from the perspective of IBS buildings. This paper aims to identify the different system approach using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology that is equipped with decision making processes. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes the establishment of key problem areas, the elements involved in implementing good practice and the requirements for integrating maintenance management processes and information databases in the maintenance management system. Findings Conventional methods have little emphasis on defect diagnosis tools. They also enhance inadequate strategic decision-making in the analysis of information when attempting to improve the maintenance project outcomes for IBS construction. The characteristics identified in a case study of IBS buildings are presented and analysed. Originality/value The conclusions and recommendations drawn from the analysis of the IBS case study are discussed, synthesised and deliberated upon. The approach presented in this paper integrates various aspects of building information modelling technology to facilitate improved execution of IBS maintenance activities.

Predicting Construction Labor Productivity Based on Implementation Levels of Human Resource Management Practices	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction labor productivity; Building project; Human resource management practices	PERCEPTIONS; WORKERS; ENVIRONMENT; DRIVERS; MODELS	The prediction of the odds of achieving higher or lower productivity as compared to some baseline productivity is one of the important steps to consider while analyzing labor productivity in construction projects. The objective of this research is to build a logistic regression model that can be used to estimate the productivity of building projects based on the levels of planning or implementation of human resource management practices. Quantitative data were collected from 39 contractors who worked on multistory building projects completed between 2011 and 2016. Correlation analysis was carried out and the associations between productivity, human resource management (HRM) practices, company profiles, and project characteristics were investigated. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the probability-based labor productivity prediction model. Project delay is found to be negatively correlated with HRM practices, whereas company size is positively associated with HRM practices. A scoring tool to measure the levels of HRM practice implementation on building projects was developed. On that basis, a logistic regression model of HRM practices and productivity was built. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a tool that can be used to assess the odds of having high productivity based on the implementation levels of HRM practices on a certain building project.

This study examined the nature of relationship as well as influence of TQM practices and strategies for continuous improvement on different measures of performance among large- and medium-sized construction companies in the Nigerian construction industry. Unlike earlier studies, the research gives specific thought to how the relationship between TQM practices and performance is mediated by strategies for continuous improvement. The study was conducted using sequential mixed methods. In-depth structured interviews were first conducted which formed the basis for cross-sectional survey that subsequently followed. One hundred and twenty-eight valid questionnaires from well-structured questionnaires that were self-administered to 155 medium- and large-sized construction companies were received. Based on the factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modelling that were carried out, the study revealed that TQM practices have significant effects on organizational performance. However, the mediating roles of strategies for continuous improvement are necessary to ensuring better organizational performance. Therefore, it is imperative for organizations that are craving for competitive advantage to place high premium on TQM practices while ensuring that the right strategies for continuous improvement are put in place.

J	Bong, SN; Rameezdeen, R; Zuo, J; Li, RYM; Ye, G				Bong, Shanan; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen; Zuo, Jian; Li, Rita Yi Man; Ye, Gui			The designer's role in workplace health and safety in the construction industry: post-harmonized regulations in South Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						regulation; safety; health; construction	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; BUILDING-PROJECTS; PREVENTION; LEGISLATION; ISSUES; RISK	The federal government of Australia harmonized the Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) legislation from each jurisdiction in 2013. Nevertheless, little is known about its acceptance in the construction community. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the views of industry stakeholders on safety design in the harmonized safety regulations of South Australia. A desk study on pre- and post-harmonized WHS regulations reveals that design for safety now constitutes a major theme in practice following the harmonization process. After that, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate the use of design for safety in the construction industry. The results show that the guidelines promote safety-related design requirements without significantly increasing designers' and contractors' workload. Designers are aware of the hazards on sites and design firms are willing to embrace the guidelines if they are protected from liability. However, the extent to which contracting and procurement systems encourage safety design is uncertain. Moreover, the problem of cost hinders designers in implementing it unless the client accepts it as part of the over-arching life cycle cost structure. There is great uncertainty on whether the concept will be promoted through regulation and subsequently lead to a reduction in hazardous risks and injury rates.

A new technique for subcontractor selection by adopting choosing by advantages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Subcontracting; subcontractor selection process; subcontractor selection factors; choosing by advantages; construction projects	BLOCKS MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CRITERIA; SYSTEM; PRODUCTIVITY; PROCUREMENT; IMPACT; MODEL	Proper selection of subcontractor is considered as an important criterion in the successful management of the various construction projects. Previous methods used for subcontractor selection (SS) suffered several drawbacks such as: its complexity and being time consuming. The main aim of this study is to propose a new technique for SS by adopting Choosing By Advantages (CBA). The selection factors for subcontractor are determined. CBA principals, steps, merits and some of its applications in the construction context are demonstrated. Proposed SS technique is then developed, implemented on a case study and compared with recent methods in literature. The main contributions to the body of knowledge are as follows: (1) propose equations which determine exactly how to assess the percentage advantage for each factor for quantitative factors, qualitative factors with different grades/ranks, and qualitative factors on a yes/no basis and (2) subcontractors attain a positive utility when they are able to combine a low price with a superior level of five factors, which are: reputation, acknowledgement certificates, qualification of staff, amount of work in the last five years, and estimated time of the project. Globally, this technique is highly beneficial to industry practitioners because it will facilitate the subcontractor selection process.	[El-Kholy, A.

In the construction industry, several modular solutions have been introduced and examined; however, hardly any study comprehensively classifies the different modularization strategies according to their possibility to achieve various objectives of building investments. This research aims to develop a framework for identifying and classifying modularization strategies in construction according to their suitability to achieve the specific outcomes intended for a building or its subsystem. Using the literature on product modularity, product platforms and production strategies as a basis, this study has developed a theoretical framework that proposes connections between the main objectives of a building investment and the dimensions of modularization strategies. The framework is elaborated by testing the propositions, based on an empirical analysis of nine real-life case studies. The findings reveal that modularization can be a suitable approach to develop an innovative design solution; improve a project's quality, cost and schedule performance; and enable flexibility in building use and maintenance. However, suggestions for achieving these objectives vary from project organization-driven to collaborative, integrated or supplier-driven modularization strategies. Developers, owners, contractors and module suppliers can use the framework when positioning and developing their roles in the construction supply chain.

The dual concern theory is applied to this study as a theory foundation. Design/methodology/approach The Sri Lankan commercial building industry is currently experiencing a construction boom after 30 years of civil war. Creating a dispute free environment through well conflict management is one of the main ways to keep the continuous demand and development of construction. However, the Sri Lankan construction sector is arranged in such a way that they directly approach the dispute resolution rather than avoiding the dispute initially through proper conflict management. Four cases are selected for this study with the intention of conducting meetings with three main stakeholders of each case who represented client, consultants and contractors, respectively. Findings The research findings reveal that compromising is the most common conflict management style used by the industry. Forcing style obtained the second place in the ranking whereas obliging and avoiding received third and fourth places. Originality/value This study is conducted to provide a full picture of conflicts faced by the Sri Lankan commercial building industry and their proper management so that the future projects will use this information to diminish the destructive effects of conflict situations and provide a real value for money.

The aim of this research is to investigate what happens when a project team has to collaboratively innovate to address radical design challenges in a construction setting. We focus on the role of a full-scale mock-up of a facade in transforming the design intent for a building by Frank Gehry into design realization. The concept of boundary objects is used as an analytical lens via a case study methodology utilizing non-participant observation of weekly meetings and workshops over a period of 10 months covering client, consultant and contractor involvement. The research shows the role of mock-ups in radical construction settings is in tension along three delivery dimensions: performance, aesthetic and technical construction. Task completion competed with the requirements for experimentation around innovative problem solving with the how to construct it problem left unresolved. The findings suggest that co-location and synchronicity are critical conditions for collaborative and innovative problem solving in radical construction contexts. Project teams need to create open-ended 'moments' for iterating critical objects and the interactions that take place around them.

Unfortunately, BIM applications normally stop prior to the construction stage. The MEP layout design may no longer fit properly during the installation process when there are asbuilt deviations between structures and the MEP layout. The purpose of this paper is to develop a practical BIM framework for integrating the MEP layout from preliminary design to construction stage. In this framework, BIM models were categorized into five levels of details; 3D MEP preliminary design model, 3D MEP detailed design model, 3D MEP construction design model, MEP construction model and MEP prefabrication model. Four types of coordination steps have been formulated to solve the design and constructability issues. A case study was adopted to validate the practical BIM framework. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the significant value of the proposed BIM approach. In addition, one issue of collision detection is discussed because 78% collisions are ineffective when using the BIM tools for collision detection; and a significant number of effective collisions (102 collisions) are still detected by the designers and contractors manually. Ultimately, the research renders a practical insight into improving the MEP design and constructability using the developed BIM framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is still a need to investigate this issue by looking at stakeholders higher in the supply chain, particularly the ones who have the economic power to facilitate safety implementation. As such, this research has investigated the roles of construction clients on influencing safety performance. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys from employees working in small and medium construction projects in Australia. The findings of the research have not only confirmed the importance of clients in implementing safety, but also determined specific client roles that influence the development of safety climate in construction projects. It is recommended that clients should focus on the following six safety roles: participate in site-based safety program; review and analyze safety data; appoint safety team; select safe contractors; specify how safety is to be addressed in tenders; and perform regular checks on plant/equipment. Some clients may not consider safety as important as other traditional objectives, such as time, cost, environment, and quality. As such, they need to recognize the economic benefit of safety, thus becoming willing and committed to integrating safety into day-to-day business decisions.

J	Hosny, O; Elhakeem, A				Hosny, Ossama; Elhakeem, Ahmed			Simulating the winning bid: A generalized approach for optimum markup estimation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Winning markup; Bid evaluation options; Behavior adaptation; Competitive bidding; Monte Carlo simulation; Optimum markup	CONTRACTORS MARKUP; CONSTRUCTION	This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the optimum markup to suit various bid evaluation strategies in which the winning bid is the one that is "closest but below the average", "closest to average" or "the lowest responsible/responsive bid". The paper introduces the term "winning markup" according to the bid evaluation strategy used. By tracking how the winning markup varies under various competitors' bidding behaviors, the confidence to win all bidders at any markup can be determined and then used to determine the optimum markup decision. Based on this approach, the paper introduces a comprehensive model for optimum markup estimation, which has three main modules: (1) a behavior tracking mechanism that documents and analyzes competitors' bidding behaviors; (2) a behavior adaptation module that predicts the bidding behavior (of expected) competitors under a range of variable characteristics for the project under bidding; and (3) a winning markup simulator to determine an optimum bidding strategy. To automate the process, a spreadsheet prototype was developed. A numerical example was also used and its results are compared to those of the well-known Freidman model to validate the approach. The developed model can be considered a generalized model that can be used to establish an optimum bidding strategy under various bid evaluation strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach The most significant claims affecting a project are identified. The various factors affecting the impacts of claims are identified. Then, the qualitative model of construction claims is constructed considering the complex inter-related structure of the influencing factors. The mathematical relationships among the variables are determined and the quantitative model of claims is built. Finally, fuzzy logic is integrated into the proposed model to take into account the existing uncertainties. Findings To show the capabilities of the proposed simulation model, it is implemented on a real project and the impacts of the identified claims on the project cost are quantified. It is shown that the external interactions among different claims can intensify their overall impact. Originality/value The proposed approach may present a flexible and robust method for quantification of construction claims. The novelty aspects of this paper are as follows: the extensively complex structure of claims arising from both internal and external interactions is accounted for using SD. The existing uncertainties affecting the impacts of a claim are taken into account.

J	Lan, A; Galy, B				Lan, Andre; Galy, Bertrand			Evaluation of a Horizontal Lifeline System Used during Installation of Residential Roofs	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Roofing; Fall protection; Horizontal lifeline system; On-site braced trusses; Fall tests; Construction materials and methods		Residential roofing is considered as one of the most risky occupations. Usually, workers use roof anchors for fall protection during roof installation. This method is time consuming and hinders their tasks. Instead of roof anchors, a building contractor has developed a horizontal lifeline system (HLLS) consisting of two 4.9-m long posts made up of three aluminum hollow structural sections of size 51x152x6.4mm welded together and a horizontal lifeline (HLL) wire rope of 9.5mm diameter. The posts are assembled to end trusses and hoisted in place by a crane and the HLL is installed at 1.524m above the ridge. The HLLS is heavy and has never been tested on on-site braced trusses as the host structure. This paper presents the results of a study to evaluate and optimize the HLLS and to verify the strength of on-site braced trusses as the host structure of the HLLS. Tests results show that the HLLS and the on-site braced trusses have passed all fall tests and can be used as fall protection during roof installation. The HLLS has to be installed with a crane during roof installation and it is not easy to be used on an existing roof. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In-plant production depends on a number of technical, personnel, and management issues. Controlling HMA production and producers (contractors) is a difficult task for which a qualifications-based selection system could be a viable solution. Consequently, the objective of this study is to set up and validate a method for assessing the sustainability of an asphalt plant. The new model was set up and based on a synergistic consideration of economic and environmental factors. The model allows the derivation of an innovative scoring system in which internal (nonenvironmental) and environmental requirements are considered. The primary contributions to the body of knowledge are the following: (1)the method is built on the derivation of a combined and modular ranking system; (2)it is based on a framework that identifies the links between problem and outcome; and (3)unlike traditional multicriteria analysis, it combines the summation and running of the product. Consequently, this study can be used to obtain knowledge of asphalt plant sustainability including economic perspectives and environmental concerns. A simple spreadsheet was designed and used for model implementation. The outcome of the research can benefit practitioners, researchers, road and environmental agencies, and authorities.

Inter-organizational unfairness in the construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Business relations; fairness; injustice; risk; supply chain	ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; CORRUPTION; PERCEPTIONS	There are numerous examples of unfair inter-organizational business practices in the construction industry. Conflict and confrontation, corruption, bid-shopping, insecurity of payment and supply chain exploitation are just some examples which have been documented over several decades in many countries. There have been numerous initiatives to make the construction industry a fairer business environment, but these have been largely developed in a conceptual vacuum. Consequently, few advances have been made in making the industry a fairer place to do business. To address the lack of theory in this area and provide a conceptual foundation for future improvement, theories of organizational justice were used as the basis for a survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. The findings reveal that mainstream theories of justice may need refinement and reorganization to be applied to a construction industry context. Furthermore, in contrast to much previous research, the results indicate that levels of interpersonal, social and informational justice are high within the Australian construction industry. However, they also show that more can be done to improve levels of procedural and distributive justice, particularly in relation to subcontractors and suppliers in the construction supply chain. Many of these findings are transferable to other countries which are culturally, contractually and organizationally similar to the Australian construction industry.

Stringless Portland Cement Concrete Paving	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper describes results from a study evaluating stringless paving using a combination of global positioning and laser technologies. A concrete paver manufacturer and a machine guidance solution provider developed this technology and successfully implemented it on construction earthmoving and grading projects. Concrete paving is a new area for considering this technology. A concrete paving contractor in Iowa agreed to test the stringless paving technology on two challenging concrete paving projects located in Washington County, Iowa during the summer of 2003. The research team from Iowa State University monitored the guidance and elevation conformance to the original design. They employed a combination of physical depth checks, surface location and elevation surveys, concrete yield checks, and physical survey of the control stakes and string line elevations. A final check on profile of the pavement surface was accomplished by the use of the Iowa Department of Transportation Light Weight Surface Analyzer. Due to the speed of paving and the rapid changes in terrain, the laser technology was abandoned for this project. Total control of the guidance and elevation controls on the slip form paver were moved from string line to a global positioning system (GPS). Results indicate that GPS control is a feasible approach to controlling a concrete paver. Further enhancements are needed in the physical features of the slip form paver hydraulic system controls and in the computer program for controlling elevation.

J	Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A				Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A			Proposed subcontractor-based employee motivational model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENTS PERCEPTION; CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; INDICATORS	The intent of this research was to identify the factors that promote positive motivational behavior in construction subcontractor crews. The factors affecting motivation, goal-setting, workforce needs, and incentives were investigated to determine the attributes for a subcontractor employee motivational model. A survey addressing these four categories was distributed to subcontractor foremen and supervisors to establish a list of motivational factors. The statistical analysis of the survey results aided in the final development of the proposed subcontractor based employee motivational model, which includes such components as confidence and competence as being reinforced by quality of work, incentives, safe performance, praise, and a sense of belonging. The proposed model provides industry practitioners with another level of understanding of the motivation sequence of the subcontractor's labor force. Perhaps the most interesting finding was related to the attributes found in relation to workforce needs. A common link "feeling of being a member of the team/crew" was discovered between "praise" and "job security." It was surmised that essentially a worker must first receive praise before they feel as if they are a member of the team/crew and once they feel like a member of the team, they then begin to acquire feelings of job security. The results of this study further reinforce the findings of several previous behavioral studies. Future research should attempt to validate the model using a larger sample size incorporating multiple general contractors.

J	ul Hassan, F; Le, T				ul Hassan, Fahad; Le, Tuyen			Computer-assisted separation of design-build contract requirements to support subcontract drafting	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Contractual requirements; Design-build contracts; Subcontracts; Subcontractors; Natural language processing; Machine learning; Text classification; Text mining	DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION	Construction projects delivered using the Design-Build (DB) method include a single contract which defines requirements associated with various disciplines involved in the project. Consequently, DB contractors often need to develop several subcontracts including only a subset of requirements from the main contract. The current manual practices for subcontract drafting are error-prone and time-consuming. The study developed a novel classification model using machine learning for classifying DB requirements into three predefined categories including design, construction, and operation and maintenance. The paper compared various training approaches to perform DB requirement classification including traditional algorithms (i.e., Naive Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor), and two state-of-the-art deep neural networks architectures (i.e., convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network). In addition, it examined the effect of different feature types, feature selection, feature weighting, and ensemble methods on the model training performance. The classification models were trained on a large dataset of over 3000 contractual clauses, and the best model achieved an impressive precision of 93.20%, a recall of 93.08%, and an F-score of 92.98%. The study is expected to assist contract administrators in extracting the precise scope of subcontractors in less time and effort.

A case study, modeling the cost of preliminaries is proposed to test the robustness of this approach. Design/methodology/approach A hybrid approach is developed based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and principal component regression (PCR). Cost information for a sample of 204 UK school building projects is collected involving elemental items, contingencies (risk) and the contractors' preliminaries. An application to estimate the cost of preliminaries for construction projects demonstrates the method and tests its effectiveness in comparison with such competing models as: alternative regression models, three artificial neural network data mining techniques, case-based reasoning and support vector machines. Findings The experimental results show that the AIC-PCR approach provides a good predictive accuracy compared with the alternatives used, and is a promising alternative to avoid overfitting and collinearity. Originality/value This is the first time an approach integrating the AIC and PCR has been developed to offer an improvement on existing methods for estimating construction project Preliminaries. The hybrid approach not only reduces the risk of overfitting and collinearity, but also results in better predictability compared with the commonly used stepwise regression.

J	Leung, MY; Zhang, H; Skitmore, M				Leung, Mei-yung; Zhang, Hong; Skitmore, Martin			Effects of organisation supports on the stress of construction estimation participants	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							3 DIMENSIONS; WORK; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; PREDICTORS; BEHAVIOR; STRAIN; NURSES	Forecasting the likely cost of construction work before tendering is known as to be a hazardous task. Both underestimates and overestimates may present problems to clients and contractors. Not surprisingly, cost-engineering activities can be stressful for those responsible. Coping with the stresses requires action on the part of the individuals affected and the organizations to which they belong. This paper examines the effect of organizational supports in the process of project estimation through a survey of construction estimation participants in Hong Kong. Using correlation analysis and regression analysis, it is found that: (1) the stressors of autonomy and feedback are directly related to the stress experienced by cost engineers; (2) informal organizational supports (particularly concerning relationship conflict, Type A behavior, work underload, lack of autonomy, and unfair rewards and treatment) are far more effective than formal supports in reducing stress; and (3) lack of autonomy and lack of feedback are predictable variables affecting stress. Cost-engineering managers and supervisors need to carefully distinguish between those who prefer hands-on support and those who prefer hands-off support. A good communication and team decision-making process and a fair reward and treatment system may help establish close relationships among cost engineers in a company and ensure sufficient autonomy to cost engineers and the participants in the estimation process.

Drawing on the sociotechnical perspective, we explore how BIM implementation affects relationship patterns of formal and informal collaborative networks in the DBB contract together with their in-role behaviors (IRBs) and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) during the construction phase. A complex BIM-enabled hospital project was selected as the case study. Social network analysis was performed to investigate and interpret the data. The findings reveal that although formal collaborative networks have a higher network density than informal collaborative networks, both networks are important in BIM implementation during the construction stage because they are strongly correlated. The study also revealed that the higher the betweenness centrality in formal and informal collaborative networks, the higher the degree of IRBs and OCBs, indicating that project stakeholders with higher betweenness centrality positions in a BIM-enabled project network are likely to have a stronger sense of responsibility and devotion for better project collaboration. The research findings render significant theoretical insights into the improved and coordinated interorganizational collaboration among project stakeholders in BIM-enabled DBB projects through the key influencing factors of IRBs and OCBs.

AEC projects are challenging to collaborate because they require those in different subgroups to address uniquely defined technical and functional contexts. The AEC industry often seeks integrated collaboration through organizational integration because the literature assumes that organizational structure determines collaboration structure. This study uses a network perspective to identify the inconsistency between the organization and collaboration networks through the data of email records from a $20 million AEC project with a typical fragmented organization. The analytical focus is on two network configurations: (1) a community structure through which subgroups are defined to attend to specific aspects of the project and then coordinated through ties between members of different teams; and (2) a core-periphery structure in which a relatively small number of members interact frequently in the core and then coordinate as each member of the core interacts with specific members of the periphery. Results provide evidence of integrated collaboration in fragmented project organization, indicating organizational integration is not a must to achieve integrative collaboration. The findings suggest implications to facilitate integrative collaboration: (1) efforts should focus on collaboration behaviors, (2) subgroups should adopt a dual-lead pattern, (3) subgroups should encourage non-high-profile members to function as cores, and (4) subgroups should ensure information sharing and prevent information overload.

Project management (PM) and change management (CM) have the potential to jointly contribute to the delivery of organisational changes. However, there is a lack of clarity in the literature about the boundary and relationship between these disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to explore the contribution these disciplines make to a set of project critical success factors, to understand the ways that these disciplines can most effectively work together. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses data collected through an online survey, examining project managers' and change managers' perception of each disciplines' contribution to critical success factors. The survey received 455 responses. Findings - This paper identifies the success factors that are most clearly influenced by PM and CM, and areas where practitioners of these disciplines hold significantly different perceptions of their contributions. The results have been used to rank and categorise success factors based on the influence of each discipline. This has been used to develop a risk-based questionnaire to guide the contribution of PM and CM to the mitigation of specific project risks. Originality/value - These findings will be of use to practitioners managing organisational change projects, or projects with a significant change component. The findings will be of assistance in determining the ways in which these disciplines should work together to mitigate risks associated with specific critical success factors.

Task Variation and the Social Network of Construction Trades	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Variation; Risk assessment; Social network; Performance; Construction	MANAGEMENT	Construction projects can be complex and managers are faced with the challenge of managing multiple trades working on a large number of interdependent tasks. When one trade or task experiences variation, defined as the time difference between what was planned and what occurred for this research, additional trades or tasks can be impacted. This can result in a disrupted project schedule and reduced productivity. A case study involving a general contractor (GC) building a $50 million, 150,000 sq ft data collection center was conducted. Both starting time and task duration variation data was collected on approximately 1,200 tasks performed by over 40 trades. A risk assessment matrix was used to determine which causes of variation posed the greatest risk to project performance. Pajek, a social network analysis software, was used to illustrate the organizational structure of the key trades throughout the project based on spatial proximity. It was found that material delivery and not having prerequisite work completed were the top two causes of starting time variation and overcommitment was the top cause of task duration variation. The study couples the variation analysis with the associated social network of trades to create a decision making system, thus, the paper's main contribution to the body of knowledge. The results of this research are repeatable and can be useful for managers in improving project performance. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This paper aims to identify the effect of stakeholder-associated risks on the success of mega-engineering projects. Therefore, the risks were determined and then validated by focus discussions. Afterwards, an illustrative case study was presented to better understand the effects. Finally, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process method was used to prioritize the identified risks. The prominent risks were found to include "improper partner selection," "inadequate relationships with employer," and "incompetent contractor selection." Engineering managers need to work in close coordination with all members of the project. To better manage projects, engineering managers are expected to be familiar with the concepts of project risk management, because effective project risk management has a direct and positive effect on project management performance. Professionals in the field of engineering management can benefit greatly from the findings of this study by using it as a baseline for coordinating the relationships in multistakeholder organizational structures and analyzing stakeholder-associated risks throughout their projects.

J	Lazar, FD				Lazar, FD			Project partnering: Improving the likelihood of win/win outcomes	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRUST; COOPERATION; ORGANIZATION; EVOLUTION; ALLIANCES; DISTRUST; MODEL; GAME	This article examines the potential benefits from management use of behavioral strategies in the development of successful trust-based and/or trust-emulating partnering relationships, raises questions about existing beliefs regarding the development of trust-based relationships, and offers alternative recommendations for practices drawn from research in the areas of trust development and game theory. Key differences between cooperative behavior strategies and trust-based relationships are described. Three general categories of trust (evolutionary, spontaneous, and preexistent) and two different domains of trust (interorganizational and intraorganizational) are examined along with different issues and opportunities for management. The article concludes that (1) strategies of behavior can play critical roles in the development and maintenance of successful partnering relationships; (2) premature insistence on the presence of interorganizational trust as a precursor to collaborative behavior between owner and contractor may actually be fatal to the development of a successful partnering relationship: (3) enhancement of economic benefits in an already successful partnering relationship may be one special product of trust-based relationships; and (4) spontaneous and/or preexistent trust may provide substantial but unpredictable benefits for partnering. Recommendations for management include increasing investment in project-long behavior monitoring, developing and implementing systems to feed back information for midproject relationship corrections, developing greater intraorganizational trust-based relationships, strengthening the decision-making capacity at the field level, and investing in additional personnel training with an emphasis on recognition of collaborative versus confrontational behaviors.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established standards for pollutant emissions for different tiers of equipment to attain a "least-pollution" equipment spread or fleet. Although using higher-tier vehicles and equipment can reduce pollutant emissions under otherwise identical conditions, policies and contractor operations can also significantly affect the total pollutant emitted for a given amount of work, such as cubic yards of earth moved or tons of surface course placed. Previous studies demonstrated the direct relationship between pollutant emissions and operational productivity and the quantitative effects of that relationship using real-world emissions data. This paper describes the results of a study conducted using computer-based simulation techniques to compare costs and pollutant emissions for a typical earth-moving project using a wheel loader and dump trucks to move a quantity of soil. Emissions were based on previously published field data. Simulation results are compared to classical, closed-form solutions from queuing theory. This study found that excess pollution-that is, the amount of pollution created without generating productive work-was lowest for the least-cost fleet and that the marginal increase in emissions was relatively small for changes in fleet configuration near the least-cost and least-pollution alternate.

J	Lee, DE				Lee, DE			Probability of project completion using stochastic project scheduling simulation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper introduces a software, Stochastic Project Scheduling Simulation (SPSS), developed to measure the probability to complete a project in a certain time specified by the user. To deliver a project by a completion date committed to in a contract, a number of activities need to be carried out. The time that an entire project takes to complete and the activities that determine total project duration are always questionable because of the randomness and stochastic nature of the activities' durations. Predicting a project completion probability is valuable, particularly at the time of bidding. The SPSS finds the longest path in a network and runs the network a number of times specified by the user and calculates the stochastic probability to complete the project in the specified time. The SPSS can be used by a contractor: (1) to predict the probability to deliver the project in a given time frame and (2) to assess its capabilities to meet the contractual requirement before bidding. The SPSS can also be used by a construction owner to quantify and analyze the risks involved in the schedule. The benefits of the tool to researchers are: (1) to solve program evaluation and review technique problems; (2) to complement Monte Carlo simulation by applying the concept of project network modeling and scheduling with probabilistic and stochastic activities via a web based Java Simulation which is operateable over the Internet, and (3) to open a way to compare a project network having different distribution functions.

J	Lee, HS; Ryu, HG; Yu, JH; Kim, JJ				Lee, HS; Ryu, HG; Yu, JH; Kim, JJ			Method for calculating schedule delay considering lost productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLAIMS	A delay claim often occurs when a difference between the actual completion date and the contract completion date exists. The duration of a delay is an essential piece of information required for determining the cause of a delay. However, it is difficult to analyze a delay claim due to the fact that numerous factors that cause this delay, thereby making it a very complex issue. One of such factors is the lost productivity or loss of productivity. Despite the fact that it is one of the major causes of delay, there have been only a few studies that focus on converting lost productivity into delay duration carried out to date. Claims for productivity losses are generally the result of tension between the contractor and the owner. This tension arises due to the great difficulty involved in quantifying disruption effects. Thus, to calculate accurately the delay duration, a logical method for analyzing schedule delay caused by lost productivity is necessary. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for analyzing construction schedule delay where this lost productivity is taken into consideration. This methodology was implemented on a case project to ascertain its practicability, and to decide whether it can be utilized in the case of a delay claim related to lost productivity. The significance of this paper is twofold. One is the method to convert the lost productivity into the delay duration, which can be applied to reasonable delay claim settlement. The other is the process to analyze the construction schedule delay considering lost productivity.

J	Kumaraswamy, MM; Ling, FYY; Rahman, MM; Phng, ST				Kumaraswamy, MM; Ling, FYY; Rahman, MM; Phng, ST			Constructing relationally integrated teams	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PARTNERING PROCESS	Worldwide initiatives to improve construction industry performance converge on the common need for more effective team-working. This is increasingly critical in the context of complex multiparticipant construction projects. Clashes of organizational, operational, national, and/or professional cultures point to the need for "relational integration" as a prerequisite for such synergistic teamworking. This paper draws on recent approaches to promoting trust and cooperation through (1) basic teambuilding techniques in general and (2) partnering and alliancing in construction projects. It then focuses on analyzing the views of Singapore-based contractors as derived from a survey to elicit the hypothesized 28 factors facilitating relationally integrated teambuilding, and 31 factors deterring such integration in construction project teams. On the whole:, (1) 27 of the 28 factors facilitating integrated project team, and 26 of the 31 factors deterring integrated project team, are significant; (2) these two sets of factors could be represented by four and five "broad factors," respectively; and (3) except,in a few cases, respondents from large and medium companies, as well as with and without experience in RC, have similar perceptions of the importance levels of different factors. These two sets of critical factors, as identified in this paper, complement two other previously isolated sets of factors that facilitate or deter a "relational contracting" culture. Taken together, they feed into a consolidated strategy for releasing the latent energies and potential synergies that should yield the much higher construction project performance levels that have been called for worldwide.

The strategic significance of knowledge for construction contractors, as knowledge-intensive firms, cannot be overemphasized. However, there is a limited number of studies that explore the IC-firm performance (FP) linkage with a focus on construction firms. This study explores the link between IC and FP in construction contracting firms. It also proposes exploratory and exploitative innovation as the mechanisms through which IC evolves to affect FP. The hypotheses linking IC, innovation, and FP are tested with survey data from 135 managers in construction contracting firms in Hong Kong. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling show that human capital, social capital, and relational capital directly influence FP, but organizational capital does not. Exploratory innovation shows a mix of full and partial mediating effects in the relationships between IC dimensions (except human capital) and FP. In contrast, exploitative innovation plays no mediating role in linking IC with FP. This study has advanced discussions on the effects of IC on FP by examining exploratory and exploitative innovation as the black box elements through which IC is translated into FP. It also makes a novel contextual contribution to the IC-FP literature by exploring their interrelationships in the context of construction contracting firms.

J	Rahmani, F; Leifels, K				Rahmani, Farshid; Leifels, Katrin			Abductive Grounded Theory: a worked example of a study in construction management	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Abductive approach; grounded theory; qualitative research; research methodology	MIDDLE-RANGE THEORIES; BOUNDED RATIONALITY; INVESTMENT PROJECTS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; ALLOCATING FUNDS; DECISION-MAKING; TRUST; MODEL; ECONOMICS; CONTEXT	Grounded Theory, now more than 50 years old, is a qualitative research approach widely employed in the social and human science studies to develop theories with a high degree of conceptuality. For construction management research, given the nature of this applied sub-discipline of management, a paradigmatic shift in Grounded Theory is needed, from classical positivism to pragmatism. Abductive Grounded Theory is posited as the way to achieve this shift in research methodology. The proposition is explored through a worked example, using Early Contractor Involvement research as a case study to demonstrate the research process. The data analysis process of open coding, axial coding and selective coding is described, together with the process of matching complementary prospect theory to explain the interdependencies between theoretical categories. The issues of validity and reliability are addressed. Of particular importance is the faithfulness to the original analytical coding process and then abduction of existing theories from salient literature to explain the relationships amongst emergent concepts. The findings show that, while the development of the research question is initially influenced by the review of literature, there is no deliberate effort to direct or force the collected information towards any set of pre-defined concepts. The study shows promising potential for using Abductive Grounded Theory to develop conceptual and instrumental theories in construction management research.

J	Joukar, A; Nahmens, I				Joukar, Alireza; Nahmens, Isabelina			Volatility Forecast of Construction Cost Index Using General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic Method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction Cost Index (CCI); Forecast; Volatility; Construction; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH); Quantitative methods	ECONOMETRIC-MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ESCALATION; SYSTEM; INFORMATION; PROJECTS	The Engineering News-Record (ENR) publishes the Construction Cost Index (CCI) monthly, which is a composite index of 20-city average price of construction activities in the United States. Cost estimators use this index frequently to estimate the cost of construction projects. The CCI forecast provides contractors with more accurate bids. It also helps owners with their projects' budgeting. Previous studies have forecasted this index via multivariate and univariate techniques. Homogeneity of variance is assumed on these techniques, however the CCI shows periods of substantial volatility. So far the standard tools used to address volatility on time series have been the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. In this study, a seasonal historical data set of ENR Construction Cost Index is analyzed in order to extract and forecast volatilities of the CCI in the short term. Results of this study show high and persistent volatility of the CCI in the cases of economic shocks. The maximum of the conditional variances over the entire sample period (January 1987 to July 2012) occurred in October 2008. The variance equation shows that both lags of residuals and the lag of GARCH term are highly significant, implying that the volatility of risk is influenced by past square residual terms as well as current variance of the series.

In domains other than AEC such methodologies are well-established and contribute to improving design performance. A step towards advancing AEC design management is to characterize design practices and explore the methodologies on which they may be based. In this vein, the authors describe a design practice observed while participating in the development of a design-build-operate-and-maintain (DBOM) proposal for an infrastructure megaproject. The development team's design process followed a point-based methodology, i.e., early selection from a small set of design alternatives. The team was structured as a three-party joint venture, but, as observed, integration of efforts and collaboration among its design engineers and contractors were difficult and infrequent. The point-based design methodology used showed limitations. The authors counterpose methodologies including select-and-reuse or set-based design. Especially the latter is worth adopting in our AEC industry because it has resulted in superior design performance in other domains. By characterizing and documenting a design management methodology used in practice and counterposing alternatives, the authors aim to spur discussion on the teaching and practical application of AEC design management methodologies.

Safety-Knowledge Management in American Construction Organizations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Safety; Knowledge; Management; Organizational learning	STRATEGIES; DESIGN	Despite improvements in safety performance over the past 30 years, the construction industry still accounts for an injury-and-illness rate that is approximately five times greater than the all-industry average. This disproportionate injury-and-illness rate has been attributed, in part, to the complex, dynamic, and transient nature of construction projects. To address these challenges, construction organizations must be able to adapt to change by effectively identifying, capturing, storing, and transferring safety knowledge. To investigate how safety-knowledge management strategies are employed in the construction industry, 11 case studies were conducted with a geographically dispersed sample of American general contractors. The sample was stratified by experience modification rate (EMR), a relative measure of safety performance. The results of the case studies indicate that construction organizations tend to acquire safety knowledge from a variety of internal and external sources, but have ineffective knowledge storage and transfer systems, which impede the ability of the workforce to obtain critical knowledge to solve urgent safety-related problems. High-performing organizations were distinguished by their ability to manage tacit safety knowledge with formal processes such as data-entry systems that capture reactions to safety situations from experienced workers and safety mentoring. Other innovative strategies include acquiring tacit safety knowledge during safety stand-downs through interviews with workers and storing safety knowledge in proprietary training videos.

Causes of Delay in Construction Projects in the Oil and Gas Industry in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Delay time; Construction management; Oman; Case studies; Industrial facilities; Delay; Construction projects; Oil and gas industry; Oman	MANAGEMENT; RISK	Several studies investigating the causes of delay in projects in the construction industry have been conducted worldwide. This study investigates the causes of delay in construction projects in oil and gas processing facilities in Oman and serves as a case study for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Using a questionnaire, data were collected from 59 project managers employed in different organizations in the oil and gas industry in Oman. The survey results showed a high degree of agreement among the perceptions of project stakeholders, clients, contractors, and consultants on the causes of project delay, and there is no evidence to suggest that the causes of project delay differ significantly according to organization size or organizational ownership. Moreover, seven factors were identified as the major causes of project delay. Although six of these identified elements are general factors that can account for delay in any project in any industry, one of thempoor interaction with vendors in the engineering and procurement stagesis found to be unique to construction projects in the oil and gas industry. The findings of this study could be of value to organizations that are planning to conduct construction projects for oil and gas processing facilities in Oman and other nations with similar environments, such as the GCC countries.

However, reliance on information technology is associated with risks. The purpose of this paper is to offer a better understanding of the emerging contractual and legal risks, which might influence the successful adoption of BIM, in order to facilitate the successful implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The risks used in the study were documented from the literature, and primary data were collected by a questionnaire survey. The analysis of the results was driven by univariate and inferential statistics (Analysis of Variance) to identify the emerging contractual and legal risks. Findings The findings showed that there were little significant differences in the mean rating of the occurrence of contractual and legal risks between the respondents. The study confirmed that emerging risks are likely to be related to BIM documentations, intellectual rights and liability, missing data and misplaced assumptions among project stakeholders. The results showed that BIM success depends on close collaboration, at the outset of the project, with the client, designers, contractors and consultants. Originality/value Important legal and contractual risks have been identified in the application of BIM. It renders a new understanding of the risks that might influence the successful adoption of BIM.

J	Hummer, JE; Arocho, I; Rasdorf, W				Hummer, Joseph E.; Arocho, Ingrid; Rasdorf, William			Approach to Assessing Tradeoffs between Construction Equipment Fleet Emissions and Cost	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The environmental effects of construction equipment emissions have been studied in previous research. Total emissions for construction activities and projects were previously calculated for various transportation projects as well as for other project types. This paper focuses on how contractors can use different equipment combinations and make project schedule adjustments to reduce total emissions from construction projects. It presents a newly developed optimization model that companies can use to select a fleet for a particular project to achieve the reductions. The model can be used to minimize total equipment cost and total emissions, or to minimize total equipment cost while limiting (capping) emissions for one or more of six pollutants. When the model was applied to example construction projects, the predicted reductions in emissions were significant, ranging from 25 to 85% depending on the pollutant. When the model was used to minimize cost, a reduction of 63% of the total equipment cost was achieved from the minimum-emissions solution. The lower-cost solution also resulted in a 43% reduction in project duration from the minimum-emission solution. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a decision model that can be used to select construction equipment fleets to reduce emissions production or equipment cost. The model can be customized to take into consideration the equipment fleet available for each activity and can be developed in concert with preliminary activity scheduling to look at daily emissions.

J	Russell, MM; Howell, G; Hsiang, SM; Liu, M				Russell, Marion M.; Howell, Gregory; Hsiang, Simon M.; Liu, Min			Application of Time Buffers to Construction Project Task Durations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Time; Buffer; Uncertainty; Labor and personnel issues	PRODUCTIVITY	For this research, a time buffer is defined as the extra time added during planning to individual task durations to compensate for uncertainty and protect against workflow variation to assure a predictable hand-off to subsequent crews. Although previous research has acknowledged this addition of time buffers, their use in practice has not been studied. This paper reports on what causes people to add and size time buffers. A nationwide survey was administered to project managers, superintendents, and foremen to identify the most frequent and severe reasons for adding time buffers to construction task durations. Forty-seven buffer factors were grouped into nine categories: project characteristics, prerequisite work, detailed design/working method, labor force, tools and equipment, material and components, work/jobsite conditions, management/supervision/information flow, and weather. Contributions to the body of knowledge include (1)identifying the 12 most frequent and severe causes of time buffer; (2)analyzing (understanding) how buffers are viewed differently by foremen, superintendents, and project managers, between trades and between general contractors and subcontractors, and the perception among different levels of experience; and (3)investigating how companies that do not regularly use the Last Planner System and those that do view those factors differently. Additionally, the research quantitatively developed risk profiles of the buffer factors through an integrated risk assessment approach. Understanding the application of time buffers and their associated frequency and severity will help construction managers address potential problem areas and inefficiencies in a prioritized manner.

J	Al-Shihabi, S; Aldurgam, M				Al-Shihabi, Sameh; Aldurgam, Mohammad			Multi-objective optimization for the multi-mode finance-based project scheduling problem	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multi-objective optimization; finance-based scheduling; multi-mode project scheduling; mixed-integer linear programming; CPLEX	COST TRADEOFF PROBLEM; GENETIC-ALGORITHM; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DISCRETE; SYSTEM; MODEL	The finance-based scheduling problem (FBSP) is about scheduling project activities without exceeding a credit line financing limit. The FBSP is extended to consider different execution modes that result in the multimode FBSP (MMFBSP). Unfortunately, researchers have abandoned the development of exact models to solve the FBSP and its extensions. Instead, researchers have heavily relied on the use of heuristics and meta-heuristics, which do not guarantee solution optimality. No exact models are available for contractors who look for optimal solutions to the multi-objective MMFBSP. CPLEX, which is an exact solver, has witnessed a significant decrease in its computation time. Moreover, its current version, CPLEX 12.9, solves multi-objective optimization problems. This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for the multi-objective MMFBSP. Using CPLEX 12.9, we discuss several techniques that researchers can use to optimize a multi-objective MMFBSP. We test our model by solving several problems from the literature. We also show how to solve multi-objective optimization problems by using CPLEX 12.9 and how computation time increases as problem size increases. The small increase in computation time compared with possible cost savings make exact models a must for practitioners. Moreover, the linear programming-relaxation of the model, which takes seconds, can provide an excellent lower bound.

J	Ngacho, C; Das, D				Ngacho, Christopher; Das, Debadyuti			A performance evaluation framework of development projects: An empirical study of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) construction projects in Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Constituency Development Fund; Development projects; Performance evaluation framework; Key performance indicators; Kenya	SUCCESS FACTORS; CRITERIA; DELAYS	The present work attempts to develop a multidimensional performance evaluation framework of development projects by considering all relevant measures of performance. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this performance evaluation framework, it has considered the case of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) projects constructed between 2003 and 2011 in Kenya and collected the viewpoints of 175 respondents comprising clients, consultants and contractors involved in the implementation of CDF projects with regard to their perception on 35 performance related variables. A five-point Likert scale was used as a response format for different variables with the assigned values ranging from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the collected data which gave rise to an instrument consisting of 27 items representing six factors. The findings further reveal that the items constituting these six factors essentially represent six key performance indicators (KPIs) namely time, cost, quality, safety, site disputes and environmental impact. The relative influence of each KPI towards overall performance of construction projects shows that time is the most important measure followed by cost while safety comes last in order of importance in the performance evaluation of CDF construction projects. The findings of this study have significant bearing on other similar kind of development projects undertaken in developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

This research considers PPPs in infrastructure maintenance problems, in which the principal pursues high performance levels, whereas the agent pursues cost-efficiency. This paper proposes an optimization model that describes infrastructure performance as a result of deterioration and maintenance processes, and computes the associated benefits and costs for the principal and the agent, combining game theoretical notions with life-cycle analysis. Illustrative examples show how the organizational conditions surrounding PPPs shape the parties' decisions and outcomes by running the model under different scenarios. For instance, the model can anticipate the agent's optimal reaction to specific contractual conditions; i.e., what maintenance plan can be expected from a contractor depending on whether certain performance-related constraints or incentives are in place. Finally, the model can find the optimal maintenance plan for one party conditioned on respecting the other party's optimum within a specified tolerance. This allows to explore a variety of middle-ground solutions and choose an alternative in which one party's gain exceeds the other's loss, providing evidence for incentive design. This research provides a quantitative tool to support decisions and policy on PPPs by integrating physical, financial, and organizational aspects of infrastructure management.

Green Residential Demolitions: Case Study of Vacant Land Reuse in Storm Water Management in Cleveland	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Residential demolition; Fill soil; Storm water management; Green infrastructure; Infiltration; Project planning and design		The demolition process impacts how vacant land might be reused for storm water management. For five residential demolition sites (Cleveland, Ohio), an enhanced green demolition process was observed in 2012, and soil physical and hydrologic characteristics were measured predemolition and postdemolition (including within the excavation). Measurements were taken again in 2013 after backfill and topsoil had settled for 1 year. In their predemolition condition, the sites were found to be underlain with sandy loam soils, with three of the parcels containing close to 100% impervious area. The subgrade excavated surface was compacted by excavator activity and had overall moderate permeability. This pilot feasibility study indicates that the green specifications suggested were partially successful in producing vacant lots that were useful for storm water management. Although coarser sandy loam soils were specified, the actual placement of fine-textured fill soils with lower permeability led to higher runoff potential. In each of the five demolitions, the specification for complete debris removal was apparently effective, with less measured buried debris than for traditional demolitions. Contractors need better guidance on soil selection and placement to yield vacant land that is flexible and usable for green infrastructure and other redevelopment options.

J	Al-Tmeemy, SMHM; Abdul-Rahman, H; Harun, Z				Al-Tmeemy, Samiaah M. Hassen M.; Abdul-Rahman, Hamzah; Harun, Zakaria			Future criteria for success of building projects in Malaysia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Success criteria; Project success; Factor analysis	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; SPECIFICATIONS	Several success criteria (SC) and categorization models have been introduced and studied in the previous decades to address the issue of project success. However, most of these models have failed to align success criteria with company's success in the long-term. This paper aims at proposing a framework to categorize project success for building projects in Malaysia from the contractors' perspective. The proposed framework incorporates criteria that align the project efforts with both short and long-term goals of the companies; moreover provide an appropriate judgment of success at all stages of the project. If construction managers can judge the probability of success, they would be able to evaluate the overall relative strength of each project, and identify problems on current projects to direct them toward success. Based on the available literature, thirteen success criteria were found to be significantly and substantially related to building projects success. To develop the SC categorization framework, 151 participants, who are involved in building construction, were invited through a postal and e-mails survey to generate priorities of these criteria. The results of this study indicated that a categorization scheme for success criteria for building projects should include the categories of project management success, product success, along with market success. The findings of this study can further help future researchers seeking solutions in the challenges relating to improvement of building projects implementation and enhancement of project success.

To protect the best interest of contracting firms, subcontractors should be carefully selected. Previous studies have been focusing on the factors leading to the success of subcontracting work without paying much attention to those factors contributing to the organizational success. To gain a better insight on the success factors for subcontracting organizations, a survey which focuses on equipment-intensive subcontractors has been conducted in Hong Kong with various construction stakeholders. Acknowledging that equipment-intensive subcontractors may have their peculiar needs and characteristics, this paper strives to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for this type of subcontractors. Seventeen CSFs for equipment-intensive subcontractors have been identified, and the results indicate that majority of them are internal factors. A one-way ANOVA test has been carried out, which confirms the consistency in perceptions of different construction stakeholders surveyed. Through a factor analysis the CSFs are grouped into six major components namely: (i) market position; (ii) equipment-related factors; (iii) human resources; (iv) earnings; (v) managerial ability to adapt to changes; and (vi) project success related factors. The findings of this research should not only help subcontractors to improve their performance but also to assist main contractor to identify a successful equipment-intensive subcontracting firm.

Incorporating quality considerations into project time/cost tradeoff analysis and decision making	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						project management; project planning; project scheduling; project time-cost analysis; quality management	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; RESOURCE; PRODUCT	Existing models and methods of project scheduling implicitly assume uniform quality when evaluating time/cost tradeoffs, but do not model quality explicitly. For a project manager such as a general contractor who subcontracts most tasks of a project, or other project managers who face decisions concerning the level of quality to perform for each task, this is not a realistic assumption. In this paper, we extend the standard discrete time/cost tradeoff problem by assuming that each option for each task is evaluated for its duration, cost, and also its quality. We then provide a mixed integer linear programming model for solving one version of this problem, and illustrate with an example. W next formulate a goal programming mixed integer linear program for a very general version of the problem. This formulation allows for many different definitions of quality, and many combinations of time, cost, and quality goals with preemptive and/or weighted priorities, and is also illustrated with an example. We show how these models can be used to generate quality level curves to illustrate the tradeoffs among time, cost, and quality. These level curves can then be used by project managers to make project scheduling decisions that explicitly model and consider quality as well as time and cost, so that better and more appropriate decisions can be made for a particular situation.

The three impact factors are quantified to develop an overall underground sustainability index rating (USIR) for evaluating utility projects with competing installation technologies. The main contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the demonstration of a method for calculating a sustainability index that enables decision makers to quantify public works utility projects with guidance for evaluating proposed technologies based on environmental impact, costs, and social impact criteria. The aim is to help change the myopic thought process of typical public works owners who typically base contractor selection on lowest cost, rather than examining sustainability factors. An emission calculator was used in this research to quantify environmental impact by comparing six airborne emissions: carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and hydrocarbons (HC). Costs were determined by estimating competing technology options including surface restoration. Social impacts were quantified by comparing and rating 13 factors affecting underground utility projects. The approach to calculating the USIR was demonstrated on a case study installation of 313m (1,026 linear feet) of 400mm (16in.) PVC sanitary sewer in a mature neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. The USIRs were compared for open-cut, pilot tube microtunneling, horizontal directional drilling, and vacuum microtunneling technology options. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However, the great international demand has attracted fierce competition in the HSR industry. This study explained the determinants of international competitive advantages in the HSR industry. A questionnaire survey was used to obtain the relevant data from the international HSR industry. A group of 24 variables was identified through a literature review and verified by a pilot study. According to the international questionnaire survey, the 24 variables were categorized into 6 factors using exploratory factor analysis: technology conditions, industrial integrality, firms' coopetition, demand conditions, capital and economics, and international reputation. By comparing these to the framework of the existing diamond model, a new model, i.e., the hexagonal diamond model, which describes the determinants of international competitive advantages in the HSR industry, was proposed. Postsurvey interviews were performed using a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis of the major HSR industrial systems to validate the hexagonal diamond model. This paper presents a novel model for the determinants of international competitive advantage in the HSR industry. The identified variables and the model are of great significance for both practitioners and researchers to enhance their understanding of international competitiveness in the HSR industry.

Readiness Assessment for Flash Tracking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fast track; Flash track; Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Project planning and design; Concurrent engineering; Design-construction integration; Project acceleration; Colocation; Relational contracting; Trust; Schedule-driven projects; Organizational issues	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE	The pursuit of Faster Fast Track or Flash Track is deemed necessary in today's industry for reasons such as emergency rebuilds, competitive market advantage, and regulatory compliance. Flash Tracking has been defined as a time-driven project, which by necessity requires a heightened degree of concurrency between engineering, procurement, and construction. This paper reports on Flash Track readiness assessment algorithms that were developed to enable an organization to assess its readiness to execute time-critical or Flash Track projects. The readiness assessment algorithms were developed by defining the relative importance of 47 essential Flash Track practices, grouped into 6 categories using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weights of the practices and categories were determined by a 15-member industry expert panel, comprised of 15 Construction Industry Institute (CII) member companies representing owners, contractors, and engineering organizations. The algorithms were ultimately integrated into a Flash Track toolkit. In a validation exercise, representatives from 13 completed Flash Track projects used the toolkit with reference to their projects. Project representatives' retrospective self-assessment of readiness to perform the projects on a Flash Track basis were moderately to strongly correlated (r=0.76) with their readiness assessment forecasted by this research's algorithms. This research provides the first quantitative measurement suitable to assess an organization's readiness to undertake the unique challenges of a Flash Track project.

The growing popularity of building information modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily upon the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project life cycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. Therefore, we propose an acceptance model for BIM in construction organizations using structural equation modeling (SEM). The key components, including the BIM acceptance model (BAM), are identified through a literature review about technology acceptance-behavior related theories, and was then consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on the components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, and engineers) in South Korea. A total of 114 completed questionnaires were retrieved. We used SEM for hypothesis testing. The validated BAM can serve as a foundation for positioning and comparing BIM acceptance research and provides users with a framework for evaluating BIM acceptance.

J	Arnold, P; Javernick-Will, A				Arnold, Paul; Javernick-Will, Amy			Projectwide Access: Key to Effective Implementation of Construction Project Management Software Systems	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information technology (IT); Information and communication technology (ICT); Information management; Project management software	INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE; SUCCESS	Construction engineering and management experts asserted in the 1980s that computer-based information and communication technologies (ICTs) would grow quickly to increase the efficiency of communications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Since that time, many studies have measured the rate of adoption and effectiveness of these tools. Recently, studies have noted that these tools are not being used ubiquitously and have yet to reach their full potential in increasing the efficiency of intercompany communications. The present research employed the Delphi method with a panel of AEC industry professionals to address barriers and facilitators of using project-based project management software systems (PMSS), including issues of access to PMSS and how project-based access would affect the efficiency with which information can be communicated. The results of this research indicate that data reentry is a common source of inefficiency in the use of PMSS and that future construction ICT developments should focus on implementing a more collaborative, project-based PMSS that allows direct and active access to the PMSS by all project team members. However, governance issues may be preventing more widespread use of a collaborative PMSS implementation model. Specifically, the respondents felt that general contractors should maintain their roles as managers and controllers of the PMSS. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000596.

Optimum Outcome-Sharing Construction Contracts with Multiagent and Multioutcome Arrangements	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Incentive contracts; Optimization; Cooperation; Multiple arrangements	AGENCY THEORY; MORAL HAZARD; INCENTIVES; OWNERSHIP; PRINCIPAL; BEHAVIOR	Incentive contracts are widely used in construction to not only provide motivation but also to develop a cooperative relationship among project players. However, establishing the best outcome sharing is seen as a challenge to those involved in contracts design. Although the optimization of incentive contracts has been approached by a number of researchers, there is no guidance on optimum incentive contracts with multiagent/multioutcome arrangements. This paper develops the optimum multiagent/multioutcome sharing model in incentive contracts with a risk-neutral owner and risk-averse agents (contractors, consultants). Optimization, principal-agent theory, and utility theory provide the basis for the development. The application of the model is addressed in different scenarios. The paper demonstrates that adopting optimum effort by agents is an effective strategy that avoids project time overruns and also gives maximum savings to all contracting parties. It is shown that: at the optimum, outcome (time, cost, quality, and safety) sharing is positively related to an agent's contribution and negatively related to the agent's effort cost; as the correlation of the outcomes or the level of agent risk aversion increases, agents prefer low outcome sharing; and outcome variances and outcome sharing are related negatively which means that high outcome variances result in low outcome sharing. The contribution of this study lies in providing insights into designing optimum incentive contracts with multiagent/multioutcome arrangements.	[Hosseinian, S.

Design/methodology/approach The review of published empirical studies, a national survey of transportation agencies and case studies of highway agencies form the basis of the conclusions in this research. In addition to the national survey, with 46 of 50 agencies participating, the research presents case studies from five highway agencies in the United States including the following: California, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota and Virginia. These five case studies were selected from agencies that have extensive experience in delivering ACM projects. The case studies involved a thorough procedural review and structured interviews of agency personnel. The agencies then validated the results and conclusions. Findings The results showed that implementing ACM projects requires different knowledge, skills and management and coordination efforts than traditional design-bid-build (D-B-B) projects. The study found that the key success factors of implementing ACMs are the following: (1) establishment of an ACM champion; (2) active involvement of key staff throughout the ACM project development process; (3) appropriate use of consultants and (4) ACM training and staff development. Originality/value This research is the first attempt to examine the staffing needs and utilization for ACM projects.

Business model innovation (BMI) plays a decisive role in a company's success because it quickly converts emerging technology into commercial values and produces four times more revenue growth than product and/or service innovations. Chinese construction companies encounter the BMI challenge when facing the technological shift of modular prefabrication from conventional construction methods; however, little literature provides quantifiable information for them to better understand BMI. Therefore, this study aims to identify the relationships between BMI and its drivers for the Chinese construction industry in the context of such a technological shift. The researchers conducted an industry-wide survey and analyzed the data using the structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings confirm four significant relationships: (1)favorable business environment has a positive impact on BMI; (2)favorable business environment has a positive impact on the entrepreneurial cognition; (3)entrepreneurial cognition has a positive impact on BMI; and (4)entrepreneurial cognition mediates the effect of business environment on BMI. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt that identifies the mediating effect of the entrepreneurial cognition. Outcomes are beneficial for industry practitioners to innovate valuable business models and are helpful for policy makers to promote the implementation of modular prefabrication technology in construction.

J	Moon, S; Lee, G; Chi, S; Oh, H				Moon, Seonghyeon; Lee, Gitaek; Chi, Seokho; Oh, Hyunchul			Automated Construction Specification Review with Named Entity Recognition Using Natural Language Processing	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review							CLASSIFICATION	When bidding on construction projects, contractors need to understand the specifications properly to manage project risks. However, specifications are mainly analyzed based on human cognitive abilities, which can take considerable time and can lead to errors due to misunderstanding. While efforts have been made to automate this process, that the existing academic efforts to automate the process have limitations. To develop an automated specification reviewing model applicable to various kinds of specifications, the authors propose information extraction frameworks consisting of five categories. In addition, a named entity recognition (NER) model was developed based on bidirectional long short-term memory architecture to extract information from text data automatically. The data set for model development comprised 56 construction specifications, which included a total of 4,659 sentences labeled according to five categories of information. Word2Vec was utilized to aconvert labeled text data to the form of numeric vectors to be input into the NER model. The NER model successfully assigned every word in the testing data to an appropriate category with a satisfactory performance of 0.919 precision and 0.914 recall. These results contribute to the automation of the construction specification review process. Although this research focused on road construction projects, the proposed information extraction framework can be applied to other types of construction projects.

J	Tembo-Silungwe, CK; Khatleli, N				Tembo-Silungwe, Chipozya Kosta; Khatleli, Nthatisi			Identification of Enablers and Constraints of Risk Allocation Using Structuration Theory in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agency; Constraints; Enablers; Practices; Risk allocation; Structuration; Zambia	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; COST ESCALATION; PROJECTS; ZAMBIA; ORGANIZATIONS; CONTRACTORS	Risk allocation has been a focus of interest in the construction industry for some time because of its effects on disputes, claims, tensions, quality shortfalls, and time and cost overruns. Although various theories have been used, albeit with observable limitations, the social theory of structuration has not been tried, and this study shows its relevance in this regard. In this study, structuration theory (ST) is used to understand constraints and enablers for risk allocation and the improvements that could be gained from applying aspects of the theory. A mixed-method approach is used with 15 semistructured interviews and a questionnaire survey from 198 respondents associated with the Zambian construction industry. The findings from the analysis suggest that facets of structuration theory, namely (1)work and effort; (2)interest and power; (3)agency and creativity; (4)materiality; and (5)knowledge, help to identify simple practices that can improve risk allocation. The structuration theoretical lens explains and helps to understand risk allocation because it combines the interaction between structure and agency. It clarifies some issues influencing risk allocation, decision making, and the management of risk allocation between the contractual parties, making it a valuable theoretical contribution, more so in a developing-country context where several structures are not fully developed. The facets can be agency-related or structure-related and may both enable and/or constrain appropriate risk allocation.

Effects of Price-Adjustment Clauses on Number of Bidders and Dispersion of Bid Prices in Highway Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Price adjustment clauses; Competition; Number of bidders; Dispersion; Control chart		Price adjustment clauses (PACs) offered in highway construction projects are among the most common risk-management strategies for controlling the consequences of uncertainty in the price of asphalt cement. Owners of organizations can benefit from a PAC in two different ways. First, PACs encourage contractors to exclude extra risk premiums from their bid prices and, as a consequence, submit lower bid prices. Second, PACs can boost competition among bidders and result in more bidders and less dispersion of bid prices for a project. Although several previous studies analyzed the effects of offering PACs on reduction of submitted bid prices, the actual effects of PACs on the level of competition is unclear. The objective of this paper is to analyze empirically the effects of offering PACs on the number of bidders and dispersions of submitted bid prices. System-monitoring control charts were used to track variations in the average number of bidders per project and to analyze the dispersion of submitted bid prices for four major asphalt line items to determine whether their variations changed after PACs were offered. The results reveal no evidence indicating that offering PACs leads to more bidders or less dispersion of submitted bid prices. These results can help capital planners of transportation agencies and owners of major capital projects to evaluate their financial risk-management strategies systemically through the use of PACs.

Critical factors for insolvency prediction: towards a theoretical model for the construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; insolvency prediction model; construction industry insolvency factors; financial ratios; failure	CONTRACTORS BUSINESS FAILURE; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; DEFAULT PROBABILITY; CREDIT RISK; BANKRUPTCY; FIRMS; METHODOLOGY; COMPANIES; RATIOS	Many construction industry insolvency prediction model (CI-IPM) studies have arbitrarily employed or simply adopted from previous studies different insolvency factors, without justification, leading to poorly performing CI-IPMs. This is due to the absence of a framework for selection of relevant factors. To identify the most important insolvency factors for a high-performance CI-IPM, this study used three approaches. Firstly, systematic review was used to identify all existing factors. Secondly, frequency of factor use and accuracy of models in the reviewed studies were analysed to establish the important factors. Finally, using a questionnaire survey of CI professionals, the importance levels of factors were validated using the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient and significant index ranking. The findings show that the important quantitative factors are profitability, liquidity, leverage, management efficiency and cash flow. While important qualitative factors are management/owner characteristics, internal strategy, management decision making, macroeconomic firm characteristics and sustainability. These factors, which align with existing insolvency-related theories, including Porter's five competitive forces and Mintzberg's 5Ps (plan, ploy, pattern, position and perspective) of strategy, were used to develop a theoretical framework. This study contributes to the debate on the need to amalgamate qualitative and quantitative factors to develop a valid CI-IPM.

To achieve satisfactory outcomes with BIM, adopters need to find the most appropriate implementation strategy that is economically efficient. The research discussed here explores why and how distribution of effort spent on various tasks over project life cycle can be used as a metric for assessing and improving the performance of BIM implementation. Using quantitative data collected from a single in-depth case study of a BIM-enabled design and build project and subsequent interviews with three project actors and 11 BIM experts, to validate and triangulate the findings, we explore the use of effort data to analyze and visualize effort distribution patterns. The visualizations revealed the dynamics of team collaboration and task interdependences in BIM-enabled work and their impact on effort distribution. Lack of timely input by the contractor, subcontractors and suppliers influenced unusual patterns in the distribution of efforts indicating potential sources of inefficiency and unnecessary costs in the BIM process; thereby revealing the pivotal role of procurement structure and suggesting the need for timely involvement of key project participants. The contribution of this work is twofold. Methodologically, effort distribution analytics can provide insights that managers can use to improve BIM implementation process. Theoretically, the findings can be used to support informed decision-making, control cost, optimize resources, manage cash flow and to structure fees.

Old vernacular architecture does not satisfy contemporary building norms such as daylighting and/or thermal performance parameters. These parameters are important for sustainability due to their relation with energy savings. It is obvious that seeking to improve these parameters, old buildings should be upgraded. The main problem is how to reach contemporary building norms without a negative impact to architectural heritage in a process of modernisation. The aim of the research is to find the best compromise solution for effective vernacular architecture's change. The Authors suggest using multiple criteria approach that enables to evaluate possible alternative solutions in several controversial aspects and to find rational building's modernisation type. Also, suitability of combination of usual MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) methods with grey systems theory due to possibility of processing of large quantity of uncertain information is highlighted in the research. TOPSIS Grey (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution with grey numbers) and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) methods are applied for the presented case study of upgrading the old vernacular building. Taking into account multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria and experts' opinion, the rational vernacular building's modernisation variant is chosen. Based on the comprehensive analysis, research conclusions and recommendations are formulated.

J	Shrivas, A; Singla, HK				Shrivas, Abhishek; Singla, Harish Kumar			Analysis of interaction among the factors affecting delay in construction projects using interpretive structural modelling approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); cross-impact matrix multiplication (MICMAC); delay; construction; project management	ISM; BARRIERS; ENABLERS; DISPUTES; QUALITY; CHAIN	This article identifies and analyse the critical factors affecting delay in construction projects in India and develops a model based on the mutual interaction of these factors using interpretive structural modelling approach. The article also identifies the 'driving factors' (i.e. the factors that influence the other factors) and the 'dependent factors' (i.e. the factors that are influenced by others) using MICMAC analysis. Twelve factors are identified as the most critical factors affecting delay through literature review and expert opinion. An ISM model is developed, with the help of five experts, (three from industry and two from academia). The findings of ISM suggest that lack of proper construction methodology and sequencing is the root cause (i.e. driving factor) that is causing delay, hence at the bottom of the model. Lack of defined project management plan, lack of proper contracting strategy, inter dependencies and evaluation of the contractor not considered in advance and poor project monitoring, are intermediate causes positioned at the middle of the model. Overlook of design review timelines, shortage of material, poor contract management, conflict between owners and other party, rework due to non-compliance in quality or poor workmanship and poor site management and supervision are the dependent factors getting affecting by level two factors as well have an interrelationship among themselves.

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted with 108 project management professionals from the Vietnamese construction industry. Partial least square structural equation modelling was employed in data analysis. Findings Four-dimensional structure of project success factors was confirmed in this study. Results also showed that soft skills of project managers significantly contributed to project success factors and hence the project success. Research limitations/implications There may be geographical limitation on the conclusions drawn from the findings. Similarly, the sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. In addition, the majority of the respondents were contractors and clients as other project players were reluctant to respond to the survey. Practical implications This study provides an understanding of the relationship between soft skills and project success factors. Originality/value Although there have been studies focused on soft skills of project management and project success factors, few have attempted to analyse the effects of these soft skills on critical success factors. Thus, this study adds significantly to the existing research on both project management skills and project success factors.

Such technology includes Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS). The system is three-layered and aims to solve several labor computational and usability challenges. The software for processing the collected data, presenting real-time site state visualization, and the accurate analysis of on-site labor consumption is run by smart phones with GPS devices, on-site private wireless base stations, and servers. The benefits of this quantitative labor consumption measurement approach for hydropower projects include the provision, for each dam monolith, of precise information regarding both the number and category of laborers together with their respective working hours. Such knowledge provides adequate quality management information for the owner and the supervisor and importantly aids payment negotiations with contractors. The proposed system was firstly applied to the world's third largest hydropower project. On-site tests successfully demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the whole system. The results achieved show that the system is able to log entire on-site trajectories of laborers, and calculate the accurate labor consumption of each dam monolith. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The work tasks of all these different co-builders need to be aligned to allow for the efficient delivery of the product. To allow for smooth alignment, all co-builders work together in the planning phase to rule out unwanted conflicts between work activities. Despite these efforts, many projects still accrue costs forced by on-site conflicts that were not anticipated beforehand and require costly improvisation to be resolved. The potential of 4D CAD models to avoid costly on-site improvisation by providing possibilities to anticipate conflicts better in the planning phase has been widely acknowledged. However, little empirical evidence exists that illustrate these benefits. This paper provides such evidence by providing in-depth narratives of how 4D CAD models helped to foresee conflicts on a major railway station renovation project in the Netherlands. These narratives describe in detail how practitioners on the case study successfully used 4D CAD models to coordinate their construction engineering designs, their construction schedules, and their construction operations. With these findings, the paper contributes to 4D literature by providing empirical case-based evidence for the benefits of applying 4D CAD models to plan construction work (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ndekugri, I; Braimah, N; Gameson, R				Ndekugri, Issaka; Braimah, Nuhu; Gameson, Rod			Delay analysis within construction contracting organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SYSTEM; CLAIM	Delayed completion of a construction project is often caused by a complex interaction of a combination of events, some of which are the contractor's risks and others are the project owner's. The apportionment of the liability to give effect to the risk allocation has therefore been a matter of great controversy. Many delay analysis methodologies have been developed over the years for performing this task. This paper reports on an empirical study into the current practice in the use of these methodologies in the United Kingdom, as part of a wider study aimed at developing a framework for improving delay claims analysis. The part of the study reported here was based on a questionnaire survey of key informants. The issues investigated include the categories of staff within contracting organizations who contribute to delay claims analyses, the awareness, use and reliability of existing delay analysis methods and the obstacles to their use in practice. The main findings of the study are that: (1) the preparation of delay claims often requires input from commercial managers (quantity surveyors), schedulers, site managers, external claim consultants and estimators; (2) commercial managers have the greatest involvement; (3) claims analyzed using the as-built versus as-planned and the impacted as-planned techniques are often successful although there is considerable literature on the shortcomings of these techniques; and (4) the main obstacles to the use of the methods relates to deficiencies in project records and scheduling practice.

J	Liu, WL; Zhang, JW; Li, WJ				Liu, Wanlin; Zhang, Jingwen; Li, Wanjun			Heuristic Methods for Finance-Based and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Financing costs; Credit limits; Resource constraints; Heuristics; Finance-based project scheduling	OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; COST	Contractors are often simultaneously subject to capital shortages and resource scarcities in construction projects, forcing them to rely on loans to offset cash deficits during project execution. However, few studies have proposed exact or heuristic methods to deal with the financed-based and resource-constrained project scheduling problem (FBRCPSP). This study aims at developing flexible heuristics for the FBRCPSP. To address the FBRCPSP, a mathematical model is first constructed to maximize a project's profit considering financing costs, then modified serial schedule scheme (MSSGS) and modified parallel schedule scheme (MPSGS) heuristics are designed to gain a feasible project schedule and its financial plan while complying with feasibilities of the precedence relationship, resource constraints, and credit limits concurrently. Moreover, the proposed heuristics, implemented as part of a genetic algorithm (heuristics-based GA) can be applied to solve the optimization model of the FBRCPSP. In two case studies, the results showed that the heuristics-based GA adequately explored the feasible solution space so that it could obtain the best solutions near those from the integer programming (IP) technique (By optimization software CPLEX version 12.8) and outperformed the previous precedence-preserving GA in terms of solution quality and computational time. Finally, the developed heuristics can devise or update schedules and the corresponding cash flow and resource-demand profiles, helping practitioners achieve expected profits and implement project control.

Integrating ex-offenders into the Australian construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ex-offenders; social procurement; social value; diversity; corporate social responsibility	SOCIAL PROCUREMENT; HEALTH; ENTERPRISES; EMPLOYMENT; ATTITUDES; POLICIES; ISSUES	Contributing to the development of employment requirements as an emerging theme in social procurement theory and addressing the evidence vacuum in social procurement research and policy relating to the employment of ex-offenders, the results of a survey of 94 sub-contractors in the Australian construction industry are reported. Results indicate a relatively positive attitudes towards the employment of ex-offenders compared to other industries but also numerous barriers to sustainable employment identified. These include: perceived risks of re-offending; general behavioural problems; and lack of appropriate job skills. Considerable variations exist in perceptions of risk and practices in employing ex-offenders between trades, firm size and past experiences of hiring ex-offenders. It is concluded that policy makers cannot treat the construction industry or ex-offenders as a homogeneous whole and that negative stigmas need to be challenged through supply chain education and capacity-building programmes which provide knowledge, resources and wrap-around support services to enable the successful integration into the construction industry. Theoretically, the results spotlight the potential value of feminist theory in exploring how perceptions of ex-offenders might vary across different disadvantaged groups targeted by social procurement policies. Theories of cross sector collaboration could also be usefully mobilised to explore how new shared practices can be developed between the many organisations involved in reintegrating ex-offenders into employment.

This study investigates how organizational support cascades down to cultivate a group-level safety climate at two time points over a 2-year period through a relationship with an organization-level safety climate, supervisory safety-specific transformation leadership, and coworker support in a large US-based construction contractor. Structural equation modeling analysis on data from an online survey among 284 construction professionals shows, unlike prior research, that organizational support at one point in time does not directly predict a subsequent group-level safety climate. Instead, it affects the group-level safety climate through the mediation effect of supervisory safety-specific transformational leadership and organization-level safety climate and its moderating effect on the relationship between coworker support and group-level safety climate. Importantly, the results also suggest that safety-specific transformational leadership may be an even more important predictor of group-level safety climate than organization-level safety climate and coworker support. These results imply that organizational support could focus on empowering leaders to demonstrate safety-specific transformational leadership behaviors for the sake of promoting a group-level safety climate.

Traditionally, safety has been measured and managed reactively, where actions are taken in response to adverse trends in injuries. Alternatively, safety-related practices can be measured during the construction phase to trigger positive responses before an injury occurs. Despite the potential benefits of such strategies, few have been identified in the literature and there has yet to be an organized effort to codify and investigate these methods. A mixed-methods research approach was used to (1)clearly identify and define elements of the safety management process that can be measured and monitored during the construction phase, (2)describe resource requirements for measurement, monitoring, and response, and (3)describe specific management actions required when any indicator fails to satisfy a desired value. To produce internally and externally valid and reliable results, data were triangulated from case studies, content analysis of award-winning projects, and focused discussions among construction safety experts. In total, over 50 proactive metrics were identified, 13 of which were selected as top priority by expert professionals. Use of these indicators has been connected to exceptional safety performance in industry-leading organizations. The implication of the findings is that very strong safety outcomes can be expected if contractors build upon a robust safety management foundation with the use of these methods of project safety control.

This study was conducted to develop and test the sensitivity of a Machine Learning Support Vector Regression Algorithm (SVRA) to predict construction project profit in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study relied on data from 150 institutional projects executed within the past five years (2014-2018) in developing the model. Eighty percent (80%) of the data from the 150 projects was used at hyperparameter selection and final training phases of the model development and the remaining 20% for model testing. Using MATLAB for Support Vector Regression, the parameters available for tuning were the epsilon values, the kernel scale, the box constraint and standardisations. The sensitivity index was computed to determine the degree to which the independent variables impact the dependent variable. Findings The developed model's predictions perfectly fitted the data and explained all the variability of the response data around its mean. Average predictive accuracy of 73.66% was achieved with all the variables on the different projects in validation. The developed SVR model was sensitive to labour and loan. Originality/value The developed SVRA combines variation, defective works and labour with other financial constraints, which have been the variables used in previous studies. It will aid contractors in predicting profit on completion at commencement and also provide information on the effect of changes to cash-flow factors on profit.

Design/methodology/approach - A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting the respondents for the study. These were experts working on various state housing construction projects in Ghana. Findings - Results from the study showed that the critical factors that contribute to project delays in Ghana are; delay in payment to contractor/supplier, inflation/price fluctuation, price increases in materials, inadequate funds from sponsors/clients, variation orders and poor financial/capital market. The critical effects of delays are cost overrun, time overrun, litigation, lack of continuity by client and arbitration. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to causes and effects of project delays in Ghana based on data collected from only one state institution. Due to geographic constraints the researchers were unable to sample state institutions across Ghana involved in various housing projects. Practical implications - This paper has documented the critical state housing construction project delay factors in Ghana. The results will help project managers and policymakers appreciate the effects of these delays on project outcomes. Social implications - Measures aimed at reducing cost of housing projects in Ghana can translate into significant benefits to the poor and support achievement of government objective of providing affordable housing to low income citizens. Originality/value - This research focussed on the key factors and best practices that lead to the success of state housing projects within the Ghanaian context.

The concept of new skills, however, has not been subject to empirical investigation. This paper aims to provide insight on the required new skills, and their development and application, for the successful delivery of energy-efficient school retrofit buildings. Design/methodology/approach The research employed a case study approach of a school retrofit building project in the early stages of the adoption of energy-efficient measures. Through the application of the socio-technical network approach (STNA) as the data collection and analysis framework, data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observations and a review of relevant organisational documentation and were analysed using thematic coding. Findings The findings reveal key actors (i.e. the local authority, energy contractors and school end-users), their principal interests and the required communication, project management, energy management, technical and research skills during their interactions in the successful delivery of the school retrofit building project. The results further reinforce the crucial role of the local authority in driving energy performance improvement of school buildings. Originality/value This study demonstrates empirical evidence of the principal actors and skills required for the delivery of energy-efficient school retrofit buildings, contributes to new theoretical insights at the identification of key micro-level development of construction skills through the project network and evidences on how the STNA can be mobilised in construction skills research.

A model for predicting the environmental costs of construction noise and vibration was developed in this study. The model uses noise- and vibration-level data of construction equipment to predict the construction noise and vibration levels and estimates the environmental costs based on the predicted noise and vibration levels. Monte Carlo simulation was used to develop the model, considering the uncertainty of the noise- and vibrationlevel data of construction equipment. As it is difficult to collect actual compensation cost data for noise and vibration, the validity of the model was verified by comparing the actual noise and vibration levels measured at six receiving nodes with the predicted noise and vibration levels. The results showed that the predicted noise and vibration levels differed by 2.76 dBA (4.28%) and -3.76 dBV (-5.35%) from the actual noise and vibration levels, respectively. The correlation coefficients of the predicted and measured results were 0.991 and 0.982, respectively, which show that the model was reasonably accurate. The case study showed that the environmental cost of noise and vibration was US $237,679.25 when the noise barrier was not installed. It is expected that the developed model can be used to establish a mitigation strategy for contractors to reduce damage due to construction noise and vibration in the preconstruction phase.

J	Leung, MY; Chan, YS; Yu, JY				Leung, Mei-yung; Chan, Yee-Shan; Yu, Jingyu			Integrated Model for the Stressors and Stresses of Construction Project Managers in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							A-BEHAVIOR; WORK; UK	Construction projects involve multistakeholders (e.g., architects, structural engineers, surveyors, contractors, suppliers, etc.) completing a large number of unpredictable tasks in a complex process within a limited period of time. Construction project managers (C-PMs) are the key persons in achieving project success throughout the construction process, as they are responsible for planning the construction program, organizing human resources, controlling operations and the budget, and forecasting probable difficulties. Hence, C-PMs always encounter a great deal of stress in construction projects. Apart from the subjective feelings experienced by individual C-PMs, C-PMs may also feel objective stress due to the deviation between their actual abilities and their expected abilities on tasks or projects. To understand the integrated relationships between the various stressors and stresses of C-PMs, a survey was conducted of 108 C-PMs in Hong Kong. This paper attempts to investigate the causal relationships between stressors and stresses (both subjective and objective). The study reveals seven stressors of C-PMs in the industry. Based on the results of a correlation coefficient, an optimized stressor-stress structural equation model is established. Four critical stressors were found to have significant impact on both the subjective and the objective stresses of C-PMs, including work overload, poor interpersonal relationships, poor work environment, and poor nonwork environment. A number of recommendations were made for both construction companies and individual C-PMs in their offices and at home in order to optimize their work performance in the real world.

J	Xiong, W; Zhang, XQ				Xiong, Wei; Zhang, Xueqing			The Real Option Value of Renegotiation in Public-Private Partnerships	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Renegotiation; Real options; Contracting	INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; TRANSACTION COSTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; OWNERSHIP; CONCESSIONS; PROJECTS; RISK; GAME	Public-private partnerships (PPP) are contracts with a long-lasting period, huge relationship-specific investment, and great uncertainties. In many PPP projects, it is difficult or even impossible to write a complete contract that specifies all contingencies, so a renegotiation-allowed contract could be better than a renegotiation-proof one. Under a renegotiation-allowed PPP agreement, renegotiations can significantly influence the interests of both the private party and the government, so they have to evaluate the benefit and cost of renegotiations ex ante and consider them in the tender price. This study considers renegotiations as real options that are embodied to provide flexibilities for PPP contracts, and develops a model to capture the value of renegotiation based on real option theory. The model is proposed in three steps, including modeling underlying risk, bargaining renegotiation payoffs, and determining real option value. An illustration case is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model. The case study shows that if a renegotiation-allowed contract is used, then (1)contractor-led renegotiation is very likely to occur, especially at the early stage of concession while government-led renegotiation is less likely to occur, and if any, it should occur at the middle stage of concession; (2)one party could use opportunistic renegotiation to hold the other party up and ask for excessive compensation, so renegotiations must be regulated; and (3)renegotiation in a PPP project may have a huge real option value, and the higher the uncertainty, the higher the renegotiation value.

This study has widely used the dedicated testing facility called SESSYL, built to perform high-accuracy and real-time evaluation tests on positioning systems. It has been performed in collaboration with the French road contractor COLAS and the Ecole Superieure des Geometres et Topographes (ESGT). First, there is the proposed adapted geodetic transformation procedure, compatible with the high accuracy requirements. Then, the main results of a special SESSYL tests program are presented, where the impacts of several influencing parameters on the vertical accuracy have been carefully examined. The core part of the paper is the analysis of the typical RTK GPS set of data, from which we have tried to extract two different components: a high-frequency noise, rather easy to filter, and a low-frequency bias. This bias, given its good repeatability, can be modelled and used in prediction to improve in real-time the raw accuracy of the data. As a full-scale validation of our study, a site experiment is finally described, carried out this time on a real piece of equipment (an asphalt paver) during real roadwork.

This study aims to identify different types of psychological disorders in construction projects and to develop a fuzzy mapping to determine the impact of psychological disorders in the context of time, cost, and quality in construction management. Through a questionnaire survey assisted by pair-wise comparison among experienced construction personnel, the six most common psychological disorders, including depression, generalized anxiety disorders (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), substance use disorders (SUD), acrophobia, and claustrophobia, were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-square (PLS) tests, and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP), and followed by visualization. Although various stressors such as work overload, role ambiguity and conflict, unpaid overtime, restrictive career progression, and the diverse range of personalities are common in construction management, different roles and positions are subjected to different levels of stress, which from high to low are project manager, civil engineer, architect, contractor, quantity surveyor, and mechanical and electrical (M& E) engineer. This research developed fuzzy mapping of psychological disorders in the context of project performance, which is useful for project management teams to reveal and tackle mental health problems in early stages.(C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Neural Network Approach for Safety Climate Prediction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety climate; Artificial neural network; Construction sites; Construction management; India	CONSTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR; CULTURE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; ACCIDENTS; RESPONSES; VALIDITY; INDUSTRY; HEALTH	Safety climate is a snapshot of the safety culture of any organization and it is dynamic in nature. It reflects the employees' perceptions and attitude towards the existing safety practices in construction projects. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate and differentiate construction projects based on their safety climate and to determine the significant constructs of a safety climate. This paper develops a model to predict safety climate in a construction project based on an artificial neural network (ANN). The important constructs for a safety climate have been determined through literature review. The constructs of safety climate are used as inputs and the safety climate of the project is used as an output for the ANN algorithm. This study collected a total of 250 responses through a questionnaire survey across the country. A three-layer feed-forward back-propagation neural network (10-18-1) has been utilized for the analysis. The developed model predicts the safety climate of a construction project reasonably well. Based on sensitivity analysis, commitment and supervisory environment are proposed as the most significant out of 10 constructs of safety climate. Moreover, projects are ranked with respect to their safety climate using this model and outlier projects could easily be identified through the normal probability technique. Thus, the model should prove to be helpful to clients and contractors to evaluate and predict safety climate, thereby managing safety effectively at construction projects.

An ontology-based web service framework for construction supply chain collaboration and management	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ontology; Supply chain integration; Collaboration; Construction supply chain; Semantic web services; Data mediation	ERP; BIM	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for integrating construction supply chain in order to resolve the data heterogeneity and data sharing problems in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - Standardized web service technology is used in the proposed framework for data specification, transfer, and integration. Open standard SAWSDL is used to annotate web service descriptions with pointers to concepts defined in ontologies. NoSQL database Cassandra is used for distributed data storage among construction supply chain stakeholders. Findings - Ontology can be used to support heterogeneous data transfer and integration through web services. Distributed data storage facilitates data sharing and enhances data control. Practical implications - This paper presents examples of two ontologies for expressing construction supply chain information-ontology for material and ontology for purchase order. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate the proposed web service framework for material procurement process involving three parties, namely, project manager, contractor, and material supplier. Originality/value - The use of web services is not new to construction supply chains (CSCs). However, it still faces problems in channelizing information along CSCs due to data heterogeneity. Trust issue is also a barrier to information sharing for integrating supply chains in a centralized collaboration system. In this paper, the authors present a web service framework, which facilitates storage and sharing of information on a distributed manner mediated through ontology-based web services. Security is enhanced with access control. A data model for the distributed databases is also presented for data storage and retrieval.	[Das, Moumita; Cheng, Jack C.

Design/methodology/approach At the initial stage of this study, a list of significant risks is identified and gathered through literature review. These risks are then mapped onto tender evaluation criteria. Following this, the identified risks and their mappings are validated through a questionnaire survey to determine appropriate criteria for tender evaluation. Weightings for the selected evaluation criteria are established through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) group decision-making (GDM) method. Findings In practice, different lists of criteria, covering tender's technical capability and financial performance, are often used by different client organisations. However, there is a paucity of research behind the selection of these criteria and the weighting being attributed to different criteria. Originality/value This study provides an important and a valuable insight into the actual criteria used during tender evaluation practice based on an analysis of documentary evidence. Both current practice and existing tender evaluation studies failed to address the risk element adequately. There is a lack of an explicit link between evaluation criteria and project risks. This study fills this knowledge gap by identifying tender evaluation criteria through reviewing criteria used in practice and examining their links to risk factors.

J	Langdon, RR; Sawang, S				Langdon, Rebecca R.; Sawang, Sukanlaya			Construction Workers' Well-Being: What Leads to Depression, Anxiety, and Stress?	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Coping; Mental health; Stressors; Work-life demands; Labor and personnel issues	ALCOHOL-USE; LIFE; PERFORMANCE; SUICIDE; INJURY; METAANALYSIS; SYMPTOMS; DISTRESS; OPTIMISM; SCALES	Work-related stress is an important issue in any industry, particularly in construction, in which stressful environments are frequently encountered. What are the primary stressors in the construction workplace? and What are the relationships between the strain effect of psychological distress and the countermeasures and coping mechanisms used by construction workers? are, therefore, critical questions. The first question was addressed by using Q-methodology survey with 18 participants. The results showed that time, personal finance and the nature of tasks are important stressors. For the second question, a questionnaire survey administered to 91 participants on two construction sites of a single contractor was used to collect data about the stressors, psychological strain effects, and coping strategies they used. Mediated regression analysis of the data showed that lack of personal and family time, increases in the cost of living, and fears about job security all act as powerful stressors. Coping strategies including acceptance, self-blame, and disengagement are associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Increased substance use, although associated with lower levels of anxiety, may only be a short-term coping mechanism. An anomaly was found with humor as a coping strategy, in which the relationship was found to be counterintuitive and contrary to the findings of previous research. Future research should examine this more closely. Employers should better inform workers about the negative effects of maladaptive coping strategies and offer opportunities for adopting more positive alternatives.

J	Zhang, LY; Cheng, JJ; Fan, WJ				Zhang, Lianying; Cheng, Jiajia; Fan, Weijie			Party Selection for Integrated Project Delivery Based on Interorganizational Transactive Memory System	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project delivery; Collaboration; Construction management; Network analysis; Integrated project delivery; Party selection; Inter-organizational; Transactive memory system; Social network analysis; Contracting	CONTRACTOR SELECTION; KNOWLEDGE; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; TEAMS; COMMUNICATION; EXPERIENCE; IMPACT; TRUST; MODEL	As a new delivery mode, integrated project delivery (IPD) relies on highly trust-based collaboration among project parties. Thus, selecting the appropriate parties is important for successful IPD. Although traditional selection methods, which are primarily based on only the lowest tender price or multiple criteria other than price, can help select parties that can complete an integrated project, they are not completely suitable for IPD when trust and collaborative relationship among the project parties are considered. To improve upon this shortcoming of established methods, a new method based on the concept of an interorganizational transactive memory system (I-TMS) is established in this paper. The I-TMS drives group members to be mutually trusting and cooperatively integrate their professional knowledge, which reflects the idea of collaboration that underlies IPD. In this study, party selection for IPD was achieved via two processes. First, this study developed an I-TMS rating scale and conducted a questionnaire-based analysis to verify its reliability and validity quantitatively. Second, this study selected an appropriate combination from seven combinations of party candidates. In addition, this study analyzed the appropriate combination using social network analysis (SNA). The results suggest that project parties with a low I-TMS degree should engage in frequent interaction to foster mutual cognition and trust and improve team collaboration for IPD.

Por ello, las companias requieren un mejor entendimiento sobre como interrelacionan los factores que determinan la competitividad y los indices que la miden. Considerando que la planificacion estrategica dentro de la industria de la construccion presenta retos importantes, esta investigacion apoya en la toma de decisiones asociada con la mejora de la competitividad. El presente articulo presenta de inicio las variables criticas que definen la competitividad de los contratistas generales segun apreciacion de los propios altos mandos de los contratistas generales. Luego, se propone un modelo de interrelaciones, que describe como esas variables estan interrelacionadas basandose en reconocidos modelos de negocio y otras interrelaciones encontradas en la literatura. El modelo propuesto se evaluo utilizando la tecnica de modelacion Partial Least Squares. Los resultados mostraron que el liderazgo tiene, en terminos generales, el mayor impacto sobre los indices de competitividad, lo que implica que cualquiera que sea la meta establecida por la constructora, debe poner especial atencion en este tema del liderazgo. Los siguientes factores que mas afectan los indices son la gestion de contratos y la gestion de la seguridad y salud. Los resultados obtenidos apoyan la planificacion estrategica en las constructoras, a traves de ayudar a los gerentes a orientar los esfuerzos de la compania hacia aquellos factores que mas impactan los indices que requieran mejorar.

It has been one of the leading sources of injuries and accidents in many countries. The objectives of this paper are to (1) investigate the causes of fall from roof; (2) identify control measures to roof safety that are being used in the Singapore construction industry; (3) evaluate these controls based on specific working on roof scenarios; and (4) investigate factors that influence the adoption of these solutions. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with experienced practitioners in the Singapore construction industry. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted to discuss fall protection solutions for six critical and common working on roof scenarios identified during the interviews. Results suggested that FFR accidents and injuries were caused by a combination of individual and organizational factors. Cost-effectiveness, workers competency, and site constraints are the most critical factors that differentiate solutions to specific roofing scenarios. Despite the existing solutions, it was found that some contractors are reluctant to implement appropriate solutions in their roof work due to (1) cost; (2) time pressure; (3) power imbalance; and (4) on-site constraints. Based on these findings, it was suggested that establishing a roof association would help reduce FFR accidents and injuries by addressing the following issues: (1) design working-on-roof best practices; (2) improve tendering process; and (3) develop and manage a licensing roofing worker program.

J	Brockman, JL				Brockman, Julie L.			Interpersonal Conflict in Construction: Cost, Cause, and Consequence	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Conflict management; Cost in construction; Construction productivity; Organizational issues	WORKPLACE; STRESS; HEALTH; WORKERS; SAFETY	Interpersonal conflict on the job is identified as one of the top occupational job stressors, strongly linked to a reduction in worker psychological and physical health. In addition, interpersonal conflict has been identified as a determinant of work disability, occupational accidents, and other costs related to reduced quality, loss of skilled employees, restructuring inefficiencies, decreased motivation and productivity, absenteeism, and employee turnover. For the construction industry, studies suggest that construction owners and contractors ranked conflict among construction project participants as the highest factor affecting project cost. It is astonishing, in light of this fact, that no research studies exist which attempt to expose the unmistakable financial cost of day-to-day conflict in the construction industry among project participants at the supervisory and trades level. Therefore, the research question being explored is: What are the triggers and consequences of interpersonal conflict on a construction site and at what financial cost? Using the critical-incident technique, a qualitative research method, 74 construction industry personnel were individually interviewed using a protocol designed to elicit one or more conflict incidents recalled by the interviewee. All interviews were audio taped, transcribed, and analyzed using Nvivo 9 qualitative software. Forty-one of the 86 reported incidents underwent an additional analysis using the time reported and associated labor costs. Based on the key findings, it is recommended that educational opportunities and innovative changes to the construction process could reduce/prevent the incidence of interpersonal conflict on the construction jobsite.

The data used in this study was extracted from engineering inspection reports of 250 residential buildings in Melbourne, Australia. Association rule mining technique was used to investigate the relationships among the causes of the defects in the ground floor slab systems and to generate support, confidence and lift values. social network analysis was then carried out using the confidence values and the most significant causes of the ground floor slab defect were identified. Inadequate site drainage and soil drainage, with the out-degrees centrality of 4.84 and 4.56, respectively, were found to be the two main causes of distress in ground floor slabs of the residential buildings. On the other hand, landscaping related problem was found to have the lowest out-degree centrality value (1.60) which implies that the occurrence of poor landscaping on certain residential premises might not be the major cause for defects in the slab. The output of this research can provide useful information regarding the causes of cracks in ground floor slab systems of residential buildings. Understanding the causes of the defects, in turn, can help developers and contractors to take appropriate corrective actions or to develop strategies to reduce the occurrence of defects in newly constructed houses.

J	Shiha, A; Dorra, EM; Nassar, K				Shiha, Ahmed; Dorra, Elkhayam M.; Nassar, Khaled			Neural Networks Model for Prediction of Construction Material Prices in Egypt Using Macroeconomic Indicators	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							BOX-JENKINS; COST INDEXES; HONG-KONG	Adequate cost estimation at the planning phase is an integral part of a construction project's success. Many uncertainties disturb the planners' initial estimations and lead to cost overruns. Although many researchers highlighted the correlation between economic conditions and construction costs, accurate quantification of the impact of this correlation has not yet been reached. This paper proposes three models that utilize artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the future prices of major construction materials, namely steel reinforcement bars and portland cement, in the context of the Egyptian construction industry 6 months ahead. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that also utilizes genetic algorithm (GA), NeuralTools software, and Python programing language in Spyder software was used to develop the three models. Historical data of steel and cement prices as well as macroeconomic indicators in Egypt from May 2008 to June 2018 were used for training, testing, and validation of the proposed models. The inputs to the proposed ANN models are the identified leading economic indicators such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, and Consumer Price Index (CPI). The developed ANN models show promising results in prediction of month-to-month variations in material prices while having mean-absolute-percentage error that ranges from 4.0% to 11% for the different models. The proposed models can potentially be useful tools for construction contractors as well as owners for predicting and quantifying the fluctuations of major construction materials prices to prepare mitigation measures that will reduce the extra costs incurred.

J	Karami, H; Olatunji, OA				Karami, Hamidreza; Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred			Critical overrun causations in marine projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Delay; Marine projects; Reductionism; Schedule overrun; Structural modelling	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTOR SELECTION; COST OVERRUNS; DELAY FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; POWER; OIL	Purpose Delay causations in infrastructure projects are well reported in normative literature. However, very little is known regarding the environment-related causations which can assist in developing mitigation strategies. This study aims to examine critical causations of overruns in marine construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A total of 73 delay factors, grouped into 16 themes, were identified from literature. Data relating to the significance of each factor were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 151 respondents. A total number of 126 valid responses were retrieved. Reductionist methodology was used to identify the statistical significance of each delay causation. Findings All 73 variables analysed in the study are significant, including communication issues amongst stakeholders, inadequate planning, safety issues, deficient technical instructions and inappropriate management approaches. Others include design and construction issues, issues with project organisational structures, political and cultural factors, environmental uncertainties and complexity in resource management. The study also found estimation errors, owner's attitude, financial issues, delay in approval processes, construction strategies and unavailability of appropriate technologies for the work as influencing factors. These findings are consistent with earlier studies on other forms of projects, but they further confirm that they are very relevant to marine projects. Originality/value Determining delay factors specific to marine construction projects assists stakeholders and project management community in developing dedicated strategies applicable in scheduling to prevent and correct obstructions caused by overruns. Since projects are different in types and sizes, delay observations cannot be generalised.

Design/methodology/approach A survey method was employed to test the hypotheses. The authors collected data from the Chinese construction industry, and general contractor respondents were asked to answer a questionnaire about a contract violation by one of their subcontractors. Findings Control provisions and competence trust are positively related to contractual enforcement, but goodwill trust is negatively related to contractual enforcement. Relational enforcement is influenced by goodwill trust and competence trust. Research limitations/implications This study treats contract violations as a given variable, and it focuses on contract violations by subcontractors. The cross-sectional design makes it difficult to confirm the causality of the relationships. Practical implications Overly strict contractual enforcement can generate disputes and a vicious cycle of retaliation, and overly severe relational enforcement can damage a potentially profitable long-term relationship. In construction projects, the violating party will benefit from this study to avoid excessively contractual enforcement and relational enforcement, thus developing a more collaborative atmosphere on the current project and even establishing a solid long-term relationship. Originality/value This study extends the project management literature by investigating the antecedents of enforcement after contract violations, an area not yet fully researched.

J	Khamooshi, H; Golafshani, H				Khamooshi, Homayoun; Golafshani, Hamed			EDM: Earned Duration Management, a new approach to schedule performance management and measurement	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Earned Value; EVM; Earned Schedule; Earned Duration; Earned Duration Management; EDM; Schedule management; Monitoring and control; Efficiency; Performance measurement; Forecasting; Estimation index; Performance and progress index; Project management		The concept of schedule monitoring and control as one of the most important functions of project and program management has not been fully exploited. One possible explanation could be the dominance of the Earned Value Management System (EVMS, also known as EVM). EVM was originally developed as a cost management and control tool which was extended to track the schedule as well. EVM and its derivatives (e.g. Earned Schedule) use cost as a proxy to measure schedule performance to control the duration of the project. While there is a correlation between schedule, cost, quality, and scope of a project, using cost to control duration has proven to be misleading. In contrast to Earned Value and Earned Schedule, the authors have developed the Earned Duration Management (EDM) in which they have decoupled schedule and cost performance measures and developed a number of indices to measure progress and performance of schedule and cost, as well as the efficacy and efficiency of the plan at any level of the project. These new indices are easy to understand, have wider applications, and can be used by contractors, clients and the scheduling offices to assess and measure schedule performance. The newly developed duration performance measures are all schedule-based and can be used for forecasting the finish date of the project. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Koc, K; Gurgun, AP				Koc, Kerim; Gurgun, Asli Pelin			Stakeholder-Associated Life Cycle Risks in Construction Supply Chain	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction supply chain; Supply chain risks; Content analysis; Supply chain life cycle; Supply chain stakeholders; Focus group discussion	MANAGING RISKS; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; FUZZY	Numerous inherent risks impose a systematic risk identification approach to achieve supply chain performance goals in construction projects. This paper investigates supply chain risks in construction projects with respect to life cycle and corresponding stakeholders. The research was organized with two stages. In the first stage, a systematic literature review accompanied by a content analysis was conducted based on risks in construction supply chains (CSCs) to identify research gaps, suggest future research directions, and support subsequent steps. Then, three focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed by industry representatives to (1) specify life cycle risks in CSCs, (2) associate specified risks to related stakeholders, and (3) ensure the role of each stakeholder in CSCs. Results of the content analysis indicate that relationship, communication, and sustainability are the most frequently examined research areas, while innovation and organizational learning, supplier vulnerability, and negotiation are overlooked in the literature. Based on sessions of FGDs, 135 risks were categorized into 10 phases of construction supply chain life cycle (SCLC) as requirement and demand, design, tendering and contracting, manufacturing, logistics, hand over, inventory, installation, winding up, and control and maintenance. Main contractor, subcontractor, supplier, and client were found as the critical decision entities in tendering and contracting, installation, logistics, and requirement and demand phases, respectively. The findings can be useful for researchers by indicating research gaps, and for construction companies seeking to increase their supply chain performance through life cycle and stakeholder approaches.

This approach focuses on calculus-based trust development through the use of metrics and alignment of goals and risks between client and vendor. Barriers to realizing a stewardship relation are analysed with the use of a theoretical framework that incorporates agency theory and stewardship theory. Data was collected in 2013 and 2014 through project documentation and interviews for four case studies at the Dutch Highways Agency. Collected data was used to analyse the roles of the client and vendor, the scope and level of the products and the overall process of the clarification phase of the Best Value approach to identify barriers in practice. Case study findings are analysed and explained by agency theory and stewardship theory. From a theoretical perspective the Best Value approach shows large similarities with stewardship theory. In practice, however, the cases show that the often traditional background of project teams and the lack of experience with Best Value result in a control-oriented relationship between client and vendor characterized by information asymmetry, lack of transparency and distrust. These characteristics of the relationship between client and vendor inhibit the realization of a stewardship relation using the Best Value approach.

To fill this large knowledge gap, a two-stage research methodology drawing on 1,372 highway improvement projects completed in California was adopted for this study. The Stage I study investigated the marginal change-order impacts of two ACPs, pure A+B and I/D combined with A+B. How ACP change orders affect projects' time-cost performance was numerically modeled and successfully validated over the Stage II study. The results clearly showed that both ACPs led to more schedule-change and cost-change orders than conventionally contracted projects, whereas I/D combined with A+B performed significantly better than pure A+B in terms of the magnitude of schedule-change orders. This conveys an important recommendation to state transportation agencies (STAs) that A+B be used with an I/D provision. The results and numerical models of this study would help STAs better assess and justify the impact of change orders on the duration and cost of projects, enabling them to more effectively use contingency amounts. Use of the models can also benefit contractors requesting a change order because the models can provide them with advanced knowledge of the probable time-cost growth rates specifically for the pursued ACP.

J	de Saram, DD; Ahmed, SM				de Saram, DD; Ahmed, SM			Construction coordination activities: What is important and what consumes time	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Coordination is an important function in the building process. Recent research has shown that poor or inadequate coordination is the best that is achieved on construction sites. Nevertheless, many authors of textbooks on construction project management have not discussed this vital topic. A literature review carried out in this present study revealed that there is a lack of formal understanding on how day-to-day coordination is actually achieved on a construction project. This research was directed at identifying what activities are performed to achieve coordination and, which among those are the most important and more time-consuming for a construction coordinator. In the absence of previous research, texts on the duties and responsibilities of project managers, clerks of works, construction engineers, etc., were reviewed from the contractor's project manager's perspective during the building phase of a construction project, and an array of issues relevant to achieving coordination were identified. Initially, the array included 64 coordination issues; a questionnaire was developed for construction project managers to indicate the relative importance and time consumed on a 3 point scale (i.e., high, mid or low). Thirty-three responses received from practitioners in the Hong Kong and Singapore construction industries indicate that identifying strategic activities and potential delays and ensuring the timeliness of all work are the most important activities. Conducting regular meetings and project reviews and analyzing the project performance, detecting variances and dealing with their effects (16th and 17th, respectively in order of importance) appear to be the most time-consuming activities.

Innovative Technologies and Management Approaches for Facility Design Standardization and Modularization of Capital Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Standardization; Modularization; Industrial and capital projects; Project planning; Project management; Project execution		Recently, the emergence of new technologies has renewed interest in modularization and facility design standardization. However, the application of both facility design standardization and modularization is still limited in capital projects, especially in upstream, midstream, and mining (UMM) sector projects such as natural gas processing and compressor station projects or well sites projects. The purpose of this study is to identify innovative technologies and management approaches (ITAs) that support achieving higher levels of facility design standardization and modularization in capital projects. Specifically, the authors analyzed the impact and likelihood of occurrence of these ITAs within the next 5 years. The analysis results show that ITAs such as modularization and standardization, lidar, stakeholder engagement and alignment, and discipline to maintain standardization have high impacts and high likelihoods of occurrence in the next 5 years. Other results explore a cooperative culture to support standardization and industrial robots to be ITAs, with significant statistical differences, which elucidate differences in opinions between owners and contractors. The authors also conducted a case study analysis to benchmark real-life standardized projects and derive lessons learned from such projects pertinent to ITAs. This study will help industry practitioners identify ITAs for better project planning, management, and execution of standardized projects as well as serve as the foundation for future studies on the planning and management of ITAs. Furthermore, this study will help capital projects to achieve higher levels of facility design standardization and modularization with greater predictability, agility, and improved cost-effectiveness.

J	Zhang, SB; Chen, JY; Fu, YF				Zhang, Shui Bo; Chen, Junying; Fu, Yafan			Contract complexity and trust in construction project subcontracting	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract; Trust; Psychological perception; Bilateral transaction-specific investment; The Chinese construction industry	TRANSACTION COST; FORMAL CONTRACTS; INTERFIRM COOPERATION; GOVERNANCE; MECHANISMS; PERFORMANCE; EXCHANGE; DETERMINANTS; ALLIANCES; DECISION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to unpack the "black box" of the relationship between contract and inter-organizational trust, both theoretically and empirically. Two mediators, namely perceived safeguard and restriction, are identified to build up two seemingly contrary possible paths between contract and trust from current literature. Both paths are tested in the context of Chinese construction industry due to our access to sample. Design/methodology/approach A survey of 295 contractor-subcontractor relationships from Chinese construction industry was conducted. A three-step multiple regression model was employed to test the mediating effect of perceived safeguard and restriction. Then, a hierarchical regression model was used to test the possible moderating effect of bilateral transaction-specific investment. Findings The empirical results support the mediating effect of perceived safeguard between contract and trust in the construction subcontracting industry. Bilateral transaction-specific investments enhance the positive effect of contract on safeguard perception. Originality/value Theoretically, this study contributes to governance literature by opening up the "black box" of the relationship between contract and trust. It provides a better understanding of how and when contract complexity impacts trust, instead of simply focusing on whether contract and trust act as complements or substitutes. Practically, this study provides guidelines for construction firms to decide the degree of contract complexity under various degrees of bilateral transaction-specific investments to enhance the other party's trust, so as to improve performance outcomes.

J	Wang, PP; Fenn, P; Wang, K; Huang, YH				Wang, Peipei; Fenn, Peter; Wang, Kun; Huang, Yunhan			A Bayesian belief network predictive model for construction delay avoidance in the UK	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Novel model; Construction; Project management; Questionnaire survey; Risk management	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PROJECTS; COST; RISK; IDENTIFICATION; TIME	Purpose The purpose of this research is to advise on UK construction delay strategies. Critical delay factors were identified and their interrelationships were explored; in addition, a predictive model was established upon the factors and interrelationships to calculate delay potentials. Design/methodology/approach The critical causes were identified by a literature review, verified by an open-ended questionnaire survey and then analysed with 299 samples returned from structured questionnaire surveys. The model consisted of factors screened out by Pearson product-moment correlational coefficient, constructed by a logical reasoning process and then quantified by conducting Bayesian belief networks parameter learning. Findings The technical aspect of construction project management was less critical while the managerial aspect became more emphasised. Project factors and client factors present relatively weak impact on construction delay, while contractor factors, contractual arrangement factors and distinctively interaction factors present relatively strong impact. Research limitations/implications This research does not differentiate delay types, such as excusable vs non-excusable ones and compensable vs non-compensable ones. The model nodes have been tested to be critical to construction delay, but the model structure is mostly based on previous literature and logical deduction. Further research could be done to accommodate delay types and test the relationships. Originality/value This research updates critical delay factor list for the UK construction projects, suggesting general rules for resource allocation concerning delay avoidance. Besides, this research establishes a predictive model, assisting delay avoidance strategies on a case-by-case basis.

J	Negash, YT; Hassan, AM				Negash, Yeneneh Tamirat; Hassan, Abdiqani Muse			Construction Project Success under Uncertainty: Interrelations among the External Environment, Intellectual Capital, and Project Attributes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; External environment; Intellectual capital; Fuzzy Delphi; Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory	IMPACT; AHP; IDENTIFICATION; CRITERIA	Prior studies have focused on identifying and ranking critical success factors (CSFs), but both their interdependence and the vagueness resulting from human judgment have been neglected. Furthermore, there is a need to explain CSFs from the short- and long-term planning horizons. This study aims to identify, rank, and examine the interdependence of the critical factors affecting construction projects in low-income economies. The study applied the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to validate subfactors identified from the literature. The hierarchical relationship between success factors and linguistic preferences is considered by using a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) methodology. The former is applied to rank the relative weights of the factors and subfactors, and the latter is used to discover the nature of their interrelationship. The results indicate that over the short term, the relationships with the clients, consultants, designers, top management, and the financial situation of the contractor are essential. However, for strategic management and long-term success, the most influential factors are the external environment and the types of projects undertaken. Therefore, the economic climate, technical and professional capabilities, and costs, funds, and resources should be the primary concerns when establishing the project goals. Furthermore, this study provides managerial and theoretical implications to guide construction projects from both short- and long-term perspectives. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Zhang, RP; Pirzadeh, P; Lingard, H; Nevin, S				Zhang, Rita Peihua; Pirzadeh, Payam; Lingard, Helen; Nevin, Steve			Safety climate as a relative concept: Exploring variability and change in a dynamic construction project environment	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Project management	ORGANIZATIONAL SAFETY; OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; COWORKERS; INDUSTRY; CULTURE; RISK; SUPERVISORS; COMPLETION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use a longitudinal approach to measure safety climate at construction projects, and explore the relationship between safety climate and the level of project completion in the dynamic construction project environments. Design/methodology/approach Multi-wave safety climate surveys were conducted at four processing plant construction projects in New Zealand. Safety climate was measured with a multi-level measurement instrument, which measured construction workers' perceptions of client's organisational safety response (COSR), principal contractor's organisational safety response (PCOSR), supervisors' safety response (SSR) and co-workers' safety response (CWSR). Findings At the organisational level, the research identifies a general downward change trend in workers' perceptions of COSR and PCOSR. At the group level, no clear or consistent change trend is identified between the level of project completion and workers' perceptions of SSR and CWSR. Research limitations/implications The research suggests that the construction project management should consistently emphasise the importance of safety, even when they are facing production pressure. The research highlights the opportunity to examine the role of supervisors' leadership as an antecedent to the group-level safety climate and the development of workers' safety concerns for their co-workers over time. Originality/value This research provides the starting point for understanding safety climate in the dynamic and constantly changing construction project environments, in which the relative priorities change, adverse events arise and production pressures fluctuate over time.

J	Yuan, HP				Yuan, Hongping			Achieving Sustainability in Railway Projects: Major Stakeholder Concerns	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						stakeholder management; conflict; consensus; sustainability; railway projects	PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; KEY; COMPLEXITY; SUCCESS; PERCEPTION; IMPACT; CHINA	Achieving sustainability is becoming increasingly critical for measuring the overall success of infrastructure projects. Given the complexity of such projects, the successful management of sustainability-related targets requires joint efforts from the major stakeholders involved, including project clients, contractors, suppliers, and the general public. Nevertheless, these stakeholders often have different, and sometimes even conflicting, concerns regarding the achievement of project sustainability. Confrontations and disputes can arise unless these concerns are carefully analyzed and addressed. However, we know little specifically about how major stakeholders perceive infrastructure sustainability and how their concerns differ in the three dimensions of project sustainability: economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This study investigated the major concerns of stakeholders in achieving sustainability in a typical infrastructure project (i.e., railway projects). A triangulated methodology was adopted, including a literature review, a questionnaire survey, and interviews to obtain data from project stakeholders. Based on the results, there was a significant divergence of views among stakeholder groups, and conflicts arose when there was a mismatch between stakeholders' perceptions. A list of major concerns from each individual stakeholder group was ranked and discussed. Some measures for promoting the consensus on achieving project sustainability among different stakeholder groups were also provided. The study not only provides insights into understanding differences in the concerns of major stakeholder groups in achieving railway project sustainability, it also helps develop quantitative approaches for measuring the degree of consensus and conflict among major stakeholder groups so as to minimize their concern differences.

J	Davoudabadi, R; Mousavi, SM; Saparauskas, J; Gitinavard, H				Davoudabadi, Reza; Mousavi, Seyed Meysam; Saparauskas, Jonas; Gitinavard, Hossein			SOLVING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT SELECTION PROBLEM BY A NEW UNCERTAIN WEIGHTING AND RANKING BASED ON COMPROMISE SOLUTION WITH LINEAR ASSIGNMENT APPROACH	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction project selection problem; experts' weights; interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets; compromise solution; incomplete information; linear assignment	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY-SETS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; PORTFOLIO SELECTION; MODEL; AHP; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; RESPECT; LOGIC	Selecting a suitable construction project is a significant issue for contractors to decrease their costs. In real cases, the imprecise and uncertain information lead to decisions made based on vagueness. Fuzzy sets theory could help decision makers (DMs) to address incomplete information. However, this article develops a new integrated multi-criteria group decision-making model based on compromise solution and linear assignment approaches with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs). IVIFSs by presenting a membership and non-membership degree for each candidate based on appraisement criteria could decrease the vagueness of selection decisions. The proposed algorithm involves a new decision process under uncertain conditions to determine the importance of criteria and DMs, separately. In this regard, no subjective or additional information is needed for this process; only the input information required is an alternative assessment matrix. In this approach, weights of criteria and DMs are specified based on novel indexes to increase the reliability of obtained results. In this respect, the criteria' weights are computed regarding entropy concepts. The basis for calculating the weight of each DM is the distance between each DM and an average of the DMs' community. Furthermore, the linear assignment model is extended to rank the candidates. A case study about the construction project selection problem (CPSP) is illustrated to indicate the application of proposed model.

J	Meng, JN; Yan, JH; Xue, B; Fu, J; He, N				Meng, Junna; Yan, Jinghong; Xue, Bin; Fu, Jing; He, Ning			Reducing construction material cost by optimizing buy-in decision that accounts the flexibility of non-critical activities	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Optimization; Supply chain management; Construction planning	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROCUREMENT; SYSTEM; MODEL	Purpose The goal of making buy-in decisions is to purchase materials at the right time with the required quantity and a minimum material cost (MC). To help achieve this goal, the purpose of this paper is to find a way of optimizing the buy-in decision with the consideration of flexible starting date of non-critical activities which makes daily demand adjustable. Design/methodology/approach First, a specific algorithm is developed to calculate a series of demand combinations modeling daily material demand for all the possible start dates. Second, future material prices are predicted by applying artificial neural network. Third, the demand combinations and predicted prices are used to generate an optimal buy-in decision. Findings By comparing MC in situation when non-critical activities always start at the earliest date to that in situations when the starting date is flexible, it is found that making material buy-in decision with the consideration of the flexibility usually helps reduce MC. Originality/value In this paper, a material buy-in decision-making method that accounts non-critical activities' flexible starting date is proposed. A ternary cycle algorithm is developed to calculate demand combinations. The results that making material buy-in decision considering non-critical activities' flexible starting date can reduce MC in most times indicates that contractors may consider non-critical activities' flexibility a part of the buy-in decision-making process, so as to achieve an MC decrease and profit increase.

J	Cheung, SO; Yiu, TW; Chan, HW				Cheung, Sai On; Yiu, Tak Wing; Chan, Ho Wai			Exploring the Potential for Predicting Project Dispute Resolution Satisfaction Using Logistic Regression	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction dispute resolution; Dispute resolution satisfaction; Logistic regression; Multivariate discriminant analysis	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; CONTRACTOR; SUPPORT; ERRORS; MODEL	The success of a construction project depends on the coordinated efforts of project team members. This is especially crucial when a project is in dispute and hence the achievement of satisfactory project dispute resolution is critical to project success. This proposition has been empirically demonstrated a previous research that studied project dispute resolution satisfaction (DRS) using multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA). This paper reports on a study that builds on that research, with the specific aim of predicting project DRS through the use of logistic regression (LR). In this study, a LR model of project DRS (Model 1) is developed, and then compared with the MDA model. The findings suggest that the LR technique provides a higher hit rate and thus a higher proportion of correct classification. With the wider acceptance of the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods, the effect, on the LR model, of changing the demarcation between adverse and favorable project DRS is also examined. For this examination, another LR model (Model 2) was developed. It is believed that Model 2 may reflect the prevailing sentiment that ADR is viewed as an amicable way to resolve disputes. Both the MDA model and LR models (Model 1 and Model 2) indicated that "design changes" are the root cause of adverse project DRS. Within the scope of the project data, these findings suggest that design changes are not just disruptive to project progress but also a critical cause of construction disputes.

J	Doree, AG				Doree, AG			Collusion in the Dutch construction industry: an industrial organization perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business systems; cartels; collaboration; collusion; construction business system; contractors; industry reform; public sector procurement; the Netherlands	COMPETITION; INNOVATION	Several investigations by parliament, cabinet, justice and antitrust authorities have shown a widespread use of cartels and structural bid rigging within the Dutch construction industry. The reputation of the Dutch construction industry has been dented with both the general public and clients. As a response, the Netherlands' parliamentary inquiry Committee on Construction Fraud adopted the guiding principle of 'competition is good' and urged the restoration of the proper functioning of the market. The proposed default approach to public sector procurement is design-bid-build with public tendering and selection of the lowest price. A concise overview of the investigations is provided, relating the collusions and their persistence to emerging insights from the field of industrial organization theory into underlying factors and causes. A tougher public sector procurement policy and the continued reliance on lowest bid prices may not contribute to the reform of the Dutch construction industry as intended. One-dimensional, price-oriented competition only provides a static, project-based efficiency. However, it neither addresses a number of organizational issues nor resolves the underlying pressures leading to collusion. An alternative approach allowing for a balance of competition and collaboration with a wider number of selection criteria variables would create a more dynamic, iterative competitive process over a longer timeframe and would develop an innovative, efficient and profitable industry. Although the inquiry committee acknowledges these new methods of procurement, it is expected that the overriding ambition to restore proper market function (through increased competition) will steer towards the more traditional procurement approaches.

J	Said, H; Mali, A; Deshmukh, A				Said, Hisham; Mali, Aishwarya; Deshmukh, Ajay			Identification and assessment of the unionization factors of the US electrical construction trade	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction; Strategic management; Questionaire survey; Management	UNION MEMBERSHIP; LABOR UNIONS; PRODUCTIVITY; SAFETY	Purpose Construction trade unions have been a vital force in improving the job standards and wellbeing of trade workers. However, the union membership in the construction industry has dropped by half between 1983 and 2017. The objective of this study is to identify and assess the controlling factors of construction electrical trade unionization in the United States. Design/methodology/approach The study involved four main steps. Literature review and industry townhall meetings were conducted to identify the electrical trade unionization factors. A new unionization trend metric was developed using available union market share data to quantify the growth and decline of local unions. Mixed-mode surveying was used to collect questionnaire and interview data on the unionization factors in different local units of the electrical trade union. Finally, the survey data from the questionnaire and interviews were merged and their correlation with the unionization trend data was assessed. Findings The study found that the unionization of this specialty trade is dependent on increasing the crew ratio, expanding the non-apprenticeship union membership program, organizing larger contractors, and continuing the union focus on public and heavy industrial projects. Originality/value The study contributes to the construction management body of knowledge by providing a data-driven industry-wide assessment of the factors that affect electrical construction unionization. The study advances the understanding of construction trade unions by narrowing the theory-practice knowledge gap, illustrating the use of macro quantitative empirical research methods, and developing a new unionization trend metric.

Previous research indicates that the presence of certain factors in an organization make it more successful compared with the organizations without those factors. Because the construction business is one of the riskiest businesses in the world, identification of such factors and adoption of these factors in the work ethic of the company is of vital importance for the owner/top management of the construction organizations. This study aims to test the hypothesis that success factors influence the success of the construction organization and also explores the impact of these factors on the success of the construction organization. The research methodology involved seeks responses from experts in the construction industry through a questionnaire survey. A total of 106 industry experts from 90 different construction organizations operating in India participated in the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized positive relationships between six success factors, and the success of the construction organization is measured against five performance factors. The findings of the study indicate that top management competence is the most important factor followed by experience and performance. The study could provide an excellent value addition to the professionals working in the field of construction management. Further, the results would enable professionals to focus on fewer factors rather than attending numerous factors for optimum result.

Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Fugitive Dust Control Methods	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Erosion; Fugitive dust control; Particulate matter (PM); Biogeotechnics; Sustainable construction; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA)	EMISSIONS; IMPACT	Fugitive dust at construction sites reduces air quality and can affect respiratory health. Contractors must often use dust control strategies to meet environmental regulations for dust mitigation. Water application is the most common mitigation strategy, although alternatives such as magnesium chloride (MgCl2) are also used. Although these strategies reduce fugitive dust emissions at the site, they cause other environmental impacts onsite and off-site throughout their life cycle. A new approach to dust mitigation, enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation (EICP), has been developed to improve dust mitigation while reducing life cycle impacts. A life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) was performed to compare common dust mitigation strategies with EICP across a variety of environmental impacts and cost. LCSA has not previously been applied to dust mitigation strategies, so this work contributes new knowledge on the sustainability of existing and novel approaches to dust mitigation. The results show that EICP is potentially more sustainable than water application, particularly as watering frequency or persistence of the EICP treatment increases. Compared with MgCl2, EICP may be more environmentally intensive and more expensive. However, indicators for salinization of water and soil, impacts of concern for MgCl2, do not exist, making the comparison incomplete. It is anticipated that with further research and development focused on preventing EICP process emissions, enhancing the durability of EICP treatment, and reducing production costs, the technology will become more favorable for fugitive dust control.

Talat			Exploring the Relationship between Complexity and Risk in Megaconstruction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complexity; Risk; Uncertainty; Megaprojects; Mixed methods; Construction management	MANAGEMENT; MEGAPROJECTS; MODEL; COST; STRATEGIES; OVERRUNS	Although complexity and risk are inherent characteristics of megaconstruction projects, existing project management approaches fail to incorporate complexity-based thinking into risk management. Complexity is usually considered as the source of risk events, along with uncertainty. However, prevailing risk management practices are oriented toward only handling the uncertainty. The lack of integration between the complexity and other risk-related concepts leads to unrealistic project risk assessments and the formulation of imperfect management strategies. The aim of this research is to explore the relationship between complexity and risk in detail and propose an integrated risk assessment approach. For this purpose, a mixed-methods research approach was adopted to collect data via semistructured interviews and survey questions. Data obtained from 11 megaconstruction projects carried out by Turkish contractors were analyzed in two ways. Quantitative findings served to verify the relationship between complexity and risk in numerical terms, whereas qualitative findings were utilized to develop a framework that explains the nature of this relationship. The conceptual framework represents the links between complexity and risk in megaconstruction projects, together with uncertainty and management strategies. The existence of causal relations between these concepts may constitute a significant challenge during the risk assessment. Therefore, an integrated risk assessment process (IRAP) was proposed so that megaproject practitioners could develop better risk management plans. The findings of this research were based on megaconstruction projects, but they may also apply to other types of projects. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However, there was a lack of empirical studies to compare the project performance within different contract types and investigate how different project characteristics affect the owners' selection of contract arrangement. Project information from the Design-Build Institute of America database was collected to reveal the statistical relationship between different project characteristics and contract types and to compare project performance between lump sum and GMP contract. The results show that lump sum is still the most frequently used contract method for DB projects, especially in the public sector. However, projects using GMP contract are more likely to have less schedule delay and cost overrun as compared to those with lump-sum contracts. The chi-square tests of cross tabulations reveal that project type, owner type, and procurement method affect the selection of contract types significantly. Civil infrastructure rather than industrial engineering project tends to use lump sum more frequently, and the qualification-oriented contractor selection process resorts to GMP more often compared with the cost-oriented process. The findings of this research contribute to the current body of knowledge concerning the effect of associated project characteristics on contract type selection. Overall, the results of this study provide empirical evidence from real DB projects that can be used by owners to select appropriate contract types and eventually improve future project performance.

This study develops and tests a model of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and project success in Brazilian context. As quantitative research, a survey was used to collect data. A sample of 100 valid answers from project practitioners was treated through the structural equation modeling method. As research implications, the main result points out the positive correlation between the entrepreneurial orientation and the project success, contributing to the development of this research subject and helping to minimize the gap in the literature that addresses the relationship between project success and EO. In practical terms, understanding that innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, autonomy and competitive aggressiveness (the dimensions of the EO) can contribute to project success and can also indirectly impact on organizational performance, could help organizations get competitive advantage when developing correlate factors. Finally, the results suggest that practices of project management can be aligned to the firm's entrepreneurial orientation to enable firms to attain better results in their projects and generate a competitive advantage. On other hand, given the proportion of the impact of EO on project success (20.3%) identified in this study, it is critical that project management professionals expand their horizon to recognize other factors that affect project success.

J	Kaliba, C; Muya, M; Mumba, K				Kaliba, Chabota; Muya, Mundia; Mumba, Kanyuka			Cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cost escalation; Schedule delays; Road construction industry; Zambia		The wealth of any nation is gauged by its performance in infrastructure provision through its construction industry. The construction industry is large, volatile, and requires tremendous capital outlays. For developing economies, road construction constitutes a major component of the construction industry. This means that much of the national budget on infrastructure development is channelled to road construction projects. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to identify causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. Using a detailed literature review, structured interviews and questionnaire surveys, the results of the study confirmed the prevalence of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia. The study established that bad or inclement weather due to heavy rains and floods, scope changes, environmental protection and mitigation costs, schedule delay, strikes, technical challenges, inflation and local government pressures were the major causes of cost escalation in Zambia's road construction projects. On the other hand, delayed payments, financial processes and difficulties on the part of contractors and clients, contract modification, economic problems, materials procurement, changes in drawings, staffing problems, equipment unavailability, poor supervision, construction mistakes, poor coordination on site, changes in specifications and labour disputes and strikes were found to be the major causes of schedule delays in road construction projects. Appropriate project management practices are thus required to curb the causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Impact of Design Risk on the Performance of Design-Build Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design-build projects; Design risk factors; Project performance; Exploratory factor analysis; Structural equation modeling	PLS-SEM; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION	Design risk can greatly affect the success or otherwise of design-build projects. This study presents the identification of design risk factors in design-build projects and an analysis of their impact on project performance. A total of 23 design risk factors were identified, comprising 17 factors obtained from an exhaustive literature review and 6 factors arising from in-depth interviews with 5 experienced construction practitioners. These design risk factors formed the focus of a questionnaire survey of 500 construction practitioners, which used a five-point Likert scale as the response format. This yielded 150 valid responses for data analysis. Exploratory factor analysis showed that these factors could be categorized into six groupings: risk of improper design team, risk of designer's lack of responsibility, risk of designer's lack of experience, risk of inaccuracy or delay of third-party information, risk of improper design scheme, and risk of design change and employer review. Confirmative factor analysis revealed that the risk of an improper design scheme is significantly associated with the risk of designers' lack of responsibility and experience, as well as inaccuracy and delay of third-party information, which has a significant and negative impact on project performance. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge in design-build risk analysis, and, more fundamentally, the findings enhance design-build contractors' understanding of how to achieve better project results through improved design risk management.

These macrolevel studies attempt to quantify the productivity or changes in productivity over the entire industry or a segment of the industry. This study is aimed at a micro or project level examination of productivity. The tool developed allows a company to predict, manage, and even optimize the productivity associated with a project or levels of projects. Automated productivity-based schedule animation (APBSA) is a dynamic scheduling methodology that stochastically utilizes weekly trended construction labor productivity data in order to automatically update the baseline schedule that was created at the beginning of the project by the construction manager. APBSA reports the construction activity duration variances and animates the progress of the job with most current data available in a four-dimensional (4D) environment. Contractors can improve their planning by utilizing APBSA with building information modeling (BIM) which will help them to improve their craft productivity. As a case study, a three-story Systems Engineering Facility III of Hanscom Air Force Base (AFB) was modeled. The model was developed in order to demonstrate the impacts of time and cost-based stochastic productivity indices on the baseline schedule. A time-cost trade-off analysis was also performed in order to show effects of duration variations on the cost of the project.

J	Kim, SY; Nguyen, MV; Luu, VT				Kim, Soo Yong; Nguyen, Minh, V; Van Truong Luu			A performance evaluation framework for construction and demolition waste management: stakeholder perspectives	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction and demolition waste management (CDWM); Performance evaluation framework; Waste management strategy	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; HONG-KONG; PROJECTS; INDUSTRY; MINIMIZATION; BARRIERS; SHENZHEN; SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to develop a performance evaluation framework for construction and demolition waste management (CDWM); second, to investigate feasible and effective strategies to improve the CDWM performance. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature highlighted a lack of comprehensive research to evaluate CDWM performance of key project stakeholders, like owners, contractors and consultants. After the identification of 22 performance variables through a pilot study, a first questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the views of respondents toward CDWM performance. The 132 responses were analyzed using factor analysis to determine specific CDWM performance factors, which formed a conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM. Furthermore, a practical index (PI) was proposed to integrate the feasibility and effectiveness of CDWM strategies. The values of PI were employed to prioritize CDWM strategies from data collected in a second questionnaire survey. Findings The validated results from factor analysis revealed that the conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM consists of six factors; and the attitude toward CDWM emerged as the foremost critical factor. The prioritization of PI values indicated that raising CDWM awareness among construction stakeholders was the most feasible and effective strategy for CDWM.

Despite these advances there remains a tendency for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) to be used as the medium to assist in the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I) systems within heavy industrial engineering projects. In this paper, a retrospective OOM (i.e., Systems Information Model (SIM)), for the E&I systems of a utility facility, which was constructed for an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the purpose of undertaking a construct ability assessment prior to the commencement of construction is presented and discussed. The CAD drawings and cable schedule produced by the EPC were provided to an E&I organization to undertake a constructability assessment; errors, omissions and information redundancy were identified and quantified. The SIM model was then used to examine a tender proposal from a construction subcontractor (CS) of the EPC; discrepancies were identified and it is suggested that differences arose due to the prevailing errors and omissions. The potential use of a SIM during construction as a quality assurance/control (QA/QC) is then examined, as it is suggested that it can be used to ensure the development of an 'As-built' model and provide a realistic representation of the constructed asset, which safeguards its integrity for operations and maintenance.

J	Lee, MJ; Hanna, AS; Loh, WY				Lee, MJ; Hanna, AS; Loh, WY			Decision tree approach to classify and quantify cumulative impact of change orders on productivity	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION TREES; LABOR EFFICIENCY; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION	Multiple or unusual change orders often cause productivity losses through a "ripple effect" or "cumulative impact" of changes. Many courts and administrative boards recognize that there is cumulative impact above and beyond the change itself. However, determination of the impact and its cost is difficult due to the interconnected nature of construction work and the difficulty in isolating causal factors and their effects. As a result, it is very difficult for owners and contractors to agree on equitable adjustments for the cumulative impact. What is needed is a reliable method (model) to identify and quantify the loss of productivity caused by the cumulative impact of change orders. A number of studies have attempted to quantify the impact of change orders on the project costs and schedule. Many of these attempted to develop regression models to quantify the loss. However, traditional regression analysis has shortcomings in dealing with highly correlated multivariable data. Moreover, regression analysis has shown limited success when dealing with many qualitative or noisy input factors. Classification and regression tree methods have the ability to deal with these complex multifactor modeling problems. This study develops decision tree models to classify and quantify the labor productivity losses that are caused by the cumulative impact of change orders for electrical and mechanical projects. The results show that decision tree models give significantly improved results for classification and quantification compared to traditional statistical methods in the field of construction productivity data analysis, which is characterized by noisiness and uncertainty.

Drivers for construction productivity	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Buildings; New Zealand; Construction; Life cycle management; Optimization techniques; System analysis	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; PROJECTS	Purpose The New Zealand construction sector is similar to many other countries with a few large companies and many small and micro enterprises. It seeks to achieve a 20 per cent increase in productivity by 2020 which requires a step change in how the sector operates and buy-in from key stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a set of levers to improve productivity in the construction sector and develop an implementation schedule. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a systems approach taking account of the nature of the building sector and the whole life cycle of a building from design to end-of-life. Information gained from the post-construction phases informs the pre-construction and construction phases. Findings Productivity is an integrated model whereby increases in process efficiency are executed with quality materials and workmanship, in a manner that is affordable for both the client and contractor and sustainable over time. A series of interviews and workshops produced 10 nodal points and 19 crucial levers which were prioritised for implementation. Additionally, indicators were developed to monitor progress over time and provide information for further corrective action to the system. Originality/value Previous studies identified factors affecting productivity. Piecemeal approaches to improve productivity have resulted in systemic failure. A whole of life approach provides valuable insights to improve productivity in the construction and pre-construction phases which have a flow-on effect through the life cycle. Importantly, this research proposes drivers, an implementation scheme and indicators that provide leverage on nodal points to improve productivity.

Literature suggests that effective communication is vital for achieving improved project performance. The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the barriers to effective communication in the Nigerian construction industry, using attribution theory paradigm. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires detailing 15 barriers to effective communication were administered to consultants and contractors engaged in the Nigerian construction sector. In total, 100 valid responses were analysed using mean score, factor analysis and factor score. Findings - Unclear project objectives, ineffective reporting systems and poor leadership were ranked as the most significant barriers to effective communication. Factor analysis uncovered that the principal reasons responsible for ineffective communication include: managerial and technical barriers and credibility and background barriers. Practical implications - The results provide information on barriers which needs to be addressed in order to improve communication in construction projects in Nigeria. There is a need to conduct post-completion reviews of construction projects so that project team members can learn and share knowledge on past experiences. Although the present study was conducted in the Nigerian context, it is envisaged that the research outcome will be widely applicable to other developing countries. Originality/value - The study provides insights on the perceived barriers to effective communication in Nigerian construction projects. The paper presents the direction for further research aimed at improving communication in construction projects in Nigeria.

J	Rempling, R; Mathern, A; Ramos, DT; Fernandez, SL				Rempling, Rasmus; Mathern, Alexandre; Ramos, David Tarazona; Luis Fernandez, Santiago			Automatic structural design by a set-based parametric design method	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Bridge design; Structural design; Buildability; Sustainability; Set-based design; Parametric design; Finite element analysis; Multi-criteria decision analysis	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; SYSTEM	Modern structural design faces new challenges, such as addressing the needs of several stakeholders and satisfying the criteria for achieving sustainability. The traditional design process does not allow resolution of these challenges. The purpose of this project was to investigate the applicability of a Set-Based Parametric Design method to the structural design process of bridges. The focus was on the early design stage, in which the design team evaluates design alternatives against a chosen set of criteria. The main challenge in this stage of design is that the process should be cost- and time-effective while allowing comparison of the different alternatives and their evaluation in terms of the different design criteria. Certainly, structural design is often performed by a discussion between the different stakeholders involved in this process, i.e. the client, contractor, and engineering team. An evaluation of alternatives against criteria requires a more detailed design, which is contradictory to the early design stage when information is scarce. The selected approach was to develop a script that can generate information for decision-making, automate the structural design process, perform common routine design tasks, and control the numerical analysis. The method combined Set-Based Design, Parametric Design, Finite Element Analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. Three existing bridges were selected to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method. The method was successfully applied and it was observed that it resulted in bridges that were more efficient in terms of material costs and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions compared with existing bridges. By delaying the decisions and developing the sets of alternatives, various alternatives can be assessed and evaluated, in the design stage, against different sustainability criteria.

Examination of Project Duration, Project Intensity, and Timing of Cost Certainty in Highway Project Delivery Methods	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN-BUILD; SELECTION; SYSTEMS	Although agencies design and construct the vast majority of federally funded highways through the traditional design-bid-build (DBB) method, the use of construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) and design-build (DB) is increasing. Previous research articles on the performance of these delivery methods include projects of different characteristics and projects from different sectors. This study examined solely US highway projects through a unique analysis of comparable projects. This study compared the project delivery methods that are frequently used in two separate cost pools, $2 million to $10 million and $10 million to $50 million. In the cost pool of $2 million to $10 million, the delivery methods of DBB and low-bid-procured DB (DB/LB) were compared. The delivery methods of DBB, CM/GC, and best-value-procured DB (DB/BV) were compared in the cost pool of $10 million to $50 million. The results show that the alternative contracting methods of CM/GC and DB are superior to the traditional DBB method for the performance metrics of project duration, project intensity, and timing of cost certainty in both cost pools. In comparing the alternative contracting methods in the $10 million to $50 million cost range, the CM/GC method was found to outperform DB/BV, which has not yet been shown in the research literature. With pressure on state transportation agencies to be efficient with funds, the alternative contracting methods are viable options for shortening project durations, establishing early cost certainty during project delivery, and delivering projects at a more intense pace. The findings presented are useful for practitioners to better understand how project delivery methods can meet their needs for US highway construction. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Making Operational Strategies of Asphalt Teams Explicit to Reduce Process Variability	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Action research; Asphalt pavements; Process variability; Process quality; Technology adoption; Construction materials and methods	FIELD; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; COMPACTION; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	The on-site construction process undertaken by asphalt teams has a critical impact on pavement quality. Process improvement and learning require explicit information about the process. However, current on-site operational activities and key parameters are, in general, not systematically monitored and mapped. The lack of process information makes it difficult for contractors and asphalt teams to distinguish between good and poor practices and to improve. Although technologies to make the on-site process explicit are becoming widely available, their adoption has been slow. To overcome this knowledge gap regarding explicit information about the on-site construction process, this paper proposes a framework and utilizes technologies for the systematic monitoring and mapping of on-site activities and key parameters. Various technologies and sensors, such as a global positioning system (GPS), a laser linescanner, and infrared cameras, make it possible to track the on-site movements of machinery and asphalt temperatures during construction. This framework was applied and refined during 29 asphalting projects in the Netherlands, creating an extensive set of on-site process data. Considerable variability was found in the delivered asphalt temperatures, the asphalt cooling, the compaction process and density progression, and the movements of machinery. This variability offers opportunities where action could be taken to improve process quality by reducing process variability. The framework and explicit data can help asphalt teams to verbalize their tacit knowledge and make their own processes and choices transparent and further promotes learning processes. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the on-site construction process and highlights how to encourage technology adoption in construction.	[Bijleveld, F. R.; Miller, S. R.; Doree, A.

One of these approaches is to leverage the value of emerging information technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architectural design. Leveraging these potentials requires promoting an appropriate context for the implementation and adoption of these new technologies. In response to the turbulent and multifaceted socio-technical nature of modern information technologies and the environmental uncertainty, architects enhance enablers to advance the architectural design process. Enablers are the preeminent factors that facilitate the implementation of new technologies and contribute to the sustainable development of projects and organizations. Given the lack of dedicated studies on the enablers affecting BIM application, this study aims to identify and classify these enablers in the architectural design phase. Following a systematic literature review approach, a comprehensive list of enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase was identified. The prepared survey questionnaire was distributed to 205 construction experts (i.e. project managers, employers, consultants, and contractors). The collected data were analyzed with the Robust Exploratory Factor Analysis method, ended up with classifying 36 enablers into four main categories: human skills, environmental, technological, and organizational factors. The findings of this study, considering the organizational enablers, recommend that the support of government officials to implement a particular validation process for BIM adoption is crucial. The contribution of this research lies in identifying and classifying enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase, with the potentials to be applied in real work practices to improve BIM capabilities and enhance BIM initiatives in construction projects.

In this framework, two major approaches are often cited in the literature as having the potential to improve the practices in the industry: Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Lean Construction. Several scientific studies have demonstrated the synergy of these two approaches and very recent research has reported positive results from the use of software applications as support for their implementation on construction sites. However, the stakes of such integration have been very little studied. This article presents the results of a research project conducted within a general contractor firm that decided to implement BIM and Last Planner System (LPS) on its construction sites. The research uses a four-stage action research approach, including the characterization of the research issue, the establishment of an action plan, its implementation and its evaluation. Compared to recent related studies, the research is less enthusiastic. While it highlights the need for new tools to improve production planning and control, it also points to a strong resistance to change by practitioners at the site. They emphasize the necessity for adequate pre-service training and the need for new resources that can work full-time on the ongoing training of site teams. In addition, some limitations of the tool lead workers to believe that it can quickly become a factor that slows down their daily work rather than improving it. Based on the advice of professionals, the paper formulates some recommendations to the industry, the researchers and the software developers.

J	Farshchian, MM; Heravi, G; AbouRizk, S				Farshchian, Mohammad Mahdi; Heravi, Gholamreza; AbouRizk, Simaan			Optimizing the Owner's Scenarios for Budget Allocation in a Portfolio of Projects Using Agent-Based Simulation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Portfolio of projects; Budget allocation; Agent-based simulation; Optimization	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DELAYS; OPTIMIZATION	Budget deficits or owners' cash-flow problems are often blamed for construction delays and construction cost increases that may be caused by these delays. Although many studies have focused on resource allocation, cash-flow management, and budget allocation in a portfolio of construction projects from the contractors' perspective, few studies have been conducted to investigate the allocation of budget, as the main resource of construction projects, from the owner's perspective. This paper presents an agent-based simulation model used to simulate budget allocation and its effects on projects' progress in an owner's portfolio of construction projects. In addition to simulating budget-allocation scenarios and predicting the future state of the projects in the portfolio, the model can reveal efficient ways to manage a limited budget based on defined preferences. The model considers increased costs during the construction period and income growth after completion. It uses the earned schedule (ES) concept to simulate the progress of projects and takes into account the probability of increased progress if there is a budget surplus. The proposed simulation model contributes to the portfolio management body of knowledge by helping organizations optimize budget-allocation scenarios and find an efficient scenario that could lead to earlier commissioned projects, reduced construction costs, and fewer construction delays. The model is validated using historical data from a portfolio of transportation projects, and four optimization scenarios are examined to find an efficient budget-allocation scenario. The results show the model can identify feasible optimized solutions for managing projects with limited budgets. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Soltani, MM; Motamedi, A; Hammad, A				Soltani, Mohammad Mostafa; Motamedi, Ali; Hammad, Amin			Enhancing Cluster-based RFID Tag Localization using artificial neural networks and virtual reference tags	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						RFID Tag Localization; Clustering; Artificial neural networks; Indoor positioning; k-NN; Virtual reference tags	LANDMARC; SYSTEM	Construction sites are changing every day, which brings some difficulties for different contractors to do their tasks properly. One of the key points for all entities who work on the same site is the location of resources including materials, tools, and equipment. Therefore, the lack of an integrated localization system leads to an increase in the time wasted on searching for resources. In this research, a localization method based on Radio Frequency Identification (RED) systems which does not need infrastructure is proposed to overcome this problem. This paper investigates the usage of active RFID technology for the localization of movable objects (e.g. components, equipment, and tools) equipped with RFID tags using handheld readers by extending a Cluster-based Movable Tag Localization (CMTL) technique which uses a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. CMTL uses a multidimensional clustering technique that considers signal pattern similarity between target and reference tags together with spatial distribution of reference tags for detecting the region where the target tag is located. The paper proposes applying an irregular bilinear interpolation method to form a grid of virtual reference tags within the selected cluster of real reference tags. Moreover, the proposed method uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) for positioning the target tag, as opposed to empirical weighted averaging formulas used in similar k-NN based methods. Comparative analysis is performed to quantify the improvement of the proposed method over similar k-NNbased methods using a simulation environment. A case study is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Empirical Identification and Evaluation of Risk in Highway Project Delivery Methods	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Delivery methods; Risk factors; Highways; Correlation; Cronbach's alpha	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; SELECTION; DESIGN	The highway industry currently uses three fundamental delivery methods, design-bid-build (D-B-B), design-build (D-B), and construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC), to deliver transportation projects. Selecting an appropriate project delivery method is a complex decision and often fraught with risk and uncertainty. This article presents the results of a two-tiered approach to evaluating the impacts of risks and uncertainties on project delivery selection in highway projects. Tier 1 involved identifying and verifying 31 risk factors related to project delivery based on the responses of experts with an average of 25 years of relevant experience. Tier 2 involved an empirical evaluation of project delivery risks through the analysis of 274 completed highway projects (122 D-B-B, 118 D-B, and 34 CM/GC) collected from 26 transportation agencies. The risk score of each risk factor was determined. The Cronbach's alpha test and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the internal consistency, interdependency, and reliability of delivery risk factors. The results showed that the following eight risk factors substantially impact the project delivery decision: (1) delays in completing in railroad agreements, (2) project complexity, (3) uncertainty in geotechnical investigation, (4) delays in a right-of-way (ROW) process, (5) unexpected utility encounter, (6) work-zone traffic control, (7) challenges to obtaining environmental documentation, and (8) delays in delivery schedules. These eight risk factors are discussed in detail using the content analysis of Tier 1 and the relevant literature. Highway agencies and other practitioners can use these risk factors to make more effective and defensible decisions on which delivery method is the most suitable for their transportation projects.

J	Hanna, AS				Hanna, Awad S.			Benchmark Performance Metrics for Integrated Project Delivery	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integrated project delivery; Performance metric; Quantitative methods	DESIGN-BUILD	The construction industry is fraught with waste and inefficiencies resulting in projects often failing to meet owners' expectations. Integrated project delivery (IPD) is the newest project delivery system (PDS) and changes the traditional roles and relationships of key project stakeholders. Through increased early collaboration, IPD attempts to eliminate waste and deliver the highest-value projects to owners. It is seen as a potential solution to many of the challenges impeding successful project performance. However, a transformational move toward IPD has yet to reach a tipping point, and its use is not prevalent throughout the construction industry. Little research has been done to quantitatively analyze IPD compared with the more commonly used delivery methods. Through substantial collection of quantitative project performance data and univariate statistical analysis, this study fills the gap in PDS research by evaluating the effects of IPD on building construction projects across a wide range of performance metrics from the perspective of general contractors and construction managers. This research demonstrates that IPD/near-IPD outperformed non-IPD projects with respect to performance in communication, change management, and business performance areas. Communication was found superior in terms of the number of requests for information (RFIs) per million dollars; change management in terms of change-order processing time; and business performance in terms of a project's impact on company image and the potential for return business. A new term called project quarterback rating (PQR), which combines key performance metrics, was used to quantitatively evaluate overall performance. Statistically significant evidence of the overall superior performance of IPD/near-IPD compared with non-IPD projects was found. These results should encourage owners to consider the use of IPD, or IPD principles in conjunction with other delivery methods, in future capital facilities endeavors.

L.; Walsh, Kenneth D.; Needy, Kim LaScola			Quantitative Analysis of Supplier Quality Surveillance Practices in EPC Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							REWORK	This study was funded by the Construction Industry Institute (CII) to investigate effective supplier quality practices that can reduce rework associated with supplied components in engineering-procure-construct (EPC) projects. The motivation was to analyze how the level and amplitude of inspection in different stages of a supply chain (from fabrication to mechanical completion) affect the resulting quality of products as measured by the number of nonconformances (NCs) found in its different stages. Quantitative data were collected using an instrument used by CII member organizations to submit data on actual purchase orders and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney (M-W) test on the nonparametric set of data obtained. Following the statistical analysis, interviews with subject matter experts, face-to-face presentations, and sharing of reports with the research team were used to clarify questions, interpret the data, and validate conclusions. The results provide insights regarding where inspection is most needed and indicate that some of the following supplier quality surveillance (SQS) practices are correlated with improved supplier quality: observation and inspection in the supplier's facility; development and use of a quality control or inspection and testing (QC/IT) plan; planning in concert with suppliers; increased communication before and during execution; and post-project completion assessments (PPCAs) of supplier performance. Results also showed that registered or certified suppliers do not show a statistically significant relationship to improved quality. Finally, the study contributes to explaining how process inspections are directly linked to the number of resulting product nonconformances, identifying which practices used by suppliers and owners/contractors are more effective in reducing the number of nonconformances in a product, and identifying potential indicators that can be collected during the execution of purchase orders and associated with the final quality of products.

Modeling relational transaction and relationship quality among team members in public projects in Hong Kong	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Relationship quality; Relational contracts; Public projects; Prediction; Hong Kong	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; PLS-SEM; EMBEDDEDNESS; NETWORKS; CONTRACT; ORGANIZATIONS; SELECTION; SUBCONTRACTOR	Prior studies have found that relational contracting (RC) practices are helpful in nurturing good relationships among project team members. These empirical studies, however, did not differentiate by project type (i.e., public or private projects). In reality, the situation faced in public projects would be different from that of private projects since for example, some public sector participants may be indifferent to, concerned about or indeed opposed to, building close relationships with private sector counterparts. In the context of public construction projects, this study aims to develop models to explain the association between relationship quality and the extent to which RC practices are adopted. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey in Hong Kong, China. Using Multiple Linear Regression and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), models for predicting the relationship quality among project team members were developed. The mathematical equations were validated by a case study. The models show that the relationship quality among project team members can be predicted by the extent to which these RC practices are implemented: (i) adoption of flexible strategies; (ii) readiness to compromise on unclear issues; (iii) willingness to commit on a long-term basis; (iv) attitude towards teamwork; (v) trust among team members; (vi) sharing of project information; (vii) understanding among team members; and (viii) alignment of the objectives of different parties. The models are recommended to public clients, consultants and contractors that aim to achieve good relationships in public projects. 0 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ling, Florence Y.

To meet these demands, contractors are faced with the need to explore various construction strategies in order to meet delivery dates, and to assure themselves as to the achievability and quality of a schedule. Various visual representations of a project's schedule and associated information combined with visual representations of the project in progress, i.e. 4D CAD, can assist with these tasks of identifying effective construction strategies for shortening project duration, assessing their workability, and judging schedule quality. Such visual representations aid communication amongst project staff and facilitate brain-storming, and, implemented well they can provide clear. fast, and multi-climensional feedback to the project team. In this paper, we describe aspects of our work which is directed at formulating a dynamic visualization environment that links 3D CAD, a generalization of traditional CPM which embraces linear scheduling, dual product representations (scheduling and CAD system) and their mapping onto each other, and schedule and CAD graphics in a manner which facilitates the relatively rapid exploration of alternative construction method and scheduling strategies for large scale linear projects (e.g. high-rise buildings, bridges, etc.). Requirements of such an environment include quickness, treating scale, working at multiple levels of detail, dealing with design variability. and realistic representation of the work. Use is made of a realistic example to highlight aspects of our approach and identify important issues that must be addressed if a visualization environment useful for construction professionals is to be developed.

Even though the construction industry is rich with encounters among its stakeholders, construction engineering and management (CEM) research lacks a thorough investigation of game-theoretic applications. This paper presents an overview of the current game-theoretic models in CEM research, aiming to enhance the understanding of the applications of game theory in analyzing CEM strategic interactions within multiple application domains and project delivery systems (PDSs). The authors analyzed 87 CEM peer-reviewed publications employing gametheoretic models between 1998 and 2019. The analysis accounted for CEM application domain, involvement of stakeholders, PDS addressed, and type of game theoretic solution used in each publication. The authors performed a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of the current gametheoretic interactions, identifying literature trends and gaps to be addressed in future research. Unlike traditional literature review methods, SNA provides a quantitative approach in analyzing the existing body of knowledge. Research findings demonstrate the contributions of game theory in seven CEM applications (conflict resolution; bargaining and negotiations; allocation of cooperative benefits; governance and supervision; evolution of cooperation and trust; construction bidding; and risk allocation). Through SNA, the highest degree centrality levels were found in Owner-Contractor games in the context of CEM bidding, conflict resolution, as well as bargaining and negotiations. SNA also revealed the need for further investigation of interactions among CEM stakeholders within PDS other than the traditional Design-Bid-Build and Public-Private-Partnerships. Moreover, games featuring strategic alliances and supply chains of multiagents can provide more adequate reflections of actual interactions. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Dynamic and Proactive Risk-Based Methodology for Managing Excessive Geometric Variability Issues in Modular Construction Projects Using Bayesian Theory	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Excessive geometric variability; Tolerances; Modular construction; Bayesian theory; Dynamic risk assessment; Proactive management; Decision support	OFF-SITE PRODUCTION; HONG-KONG; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; SAFETY	Managing excessive geometric variability risks (i.e., out-of-tolerance and out-of-alignment issues) represents a major challenge in modular construction projects, owing to lack of accurate data on modularization process capabilities for fabrication, transportation, and erection at the early design phase. Unrealistic and insufficient modularization process capability data typically convey a misleading risk profile and result in suboptimal mitigation solutions, which can in turn lead to cost overruns, schedule delays, quality issues, and owner dissatisfaction. Current modularization practices and previously developed risk management frameworks apply static risk assessment and management techniques, which do not enable updating of the generic information and initial assessment of the risk profile, when more realistic data become available. To address this persistent challenge in modular construction projects, this paper aims to introduce a systematic methodology that employs Bayesian inference theory for the dynamic assessment and proactive management of excessive geometric variability issues. The developed methodology includes a practical process for continual (1) updating of initial estimates of the performance of tolerance-based mitigation strategies based on real-time data, (2) reassessment of the risk profile, and (3) refinement of risk response decisions. The results of the case study described subsequently in this paper demonstrate how key project stakeholders and modular construction managers (e.g., designers, fabricators, and contractors) can use this methodology to efficiently reduce uncertainty in tolerance-related risk estimates and proactively manage impacts to improve modularization performance and maximize its benefits.

To investigate which success criteria are important to public project managers, the authors interviewed 26 Dutch project managers who are employed by the government and who are responsible for managing infrastructural projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this research the Q-methodology is applied. Q-methodology helps to find for correlations between subjects across a sample of variables. Q-factor analysis reduces the individual viewpoints down to a few factors. A factor can be seen as the mathematical representation of an "average" perspective shared by a group of people. Findings - Findings are based on the individual rankings of 19 success criteria; the authors distinguished three common perspectives: the holistic and cooperative leader, the socially engaged, ambiguous manager and the executor of a top-down assignment. In none of the perspectives the iron triangle criteria formed the top three to measure project success. Research limitations/implications - The research results may have a national character. The way project success is perceived by public project managers may be culture dependent. For this the authors expand the research to other countries in the near future. Practical implications - This paper contributes to the understanding of the public project manager by their private collaboration partners, like consultants, engineers and contractors. This will help them to understand their client and contribute to better collaboration in projects. Originality/value - This paper shows that the difference in work attitude and value frame in the public sector leads to a specific view on project success.

Project procurement systems for mechanical, electrical and piping projects in Saudi Arabia An empirical assessment	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Saudi Arabia; Design-build; Design-bid-build; Procurement system; Project cost	DESIGN-BUILD; CONTRACTOR SELECTION; DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the empirical relationship between mechanical, electrical, and piping (MEP) project procurement systems and project performance in the context of the Saudi Arabian construction industry. The study plans to expand the understanding of the relationship of design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB) performance with respect to change order rate, cost growth, and schedule growth. Design/methodology/approach - The paper statistically analyzed 207 MEP projects. It investigates the relationship of project procurement systems and three project performance indicators. Hypotheses testing was used to assess the relationship. Findings - The results show that projects using the DB procurement system are more likely to have less cost overrun and experience a lower change order rate compared to DBB for pricing and selection methods, yet neither procurement system had an advantage over the schedule duration based on the study's sample. Research limitations/implications - The lack of information identifying the cause of contract change orders limits the interpretation of the findings. Sample sizes in some of the test criteria were statistically small, thus limiting the reliability or confidence level of the analysis for those samples. Caution should be used when interpreting the results as representative of the Saudi Arabian construction industry as a whole; due to the owner's project execution policies, procedures, and standards, the level of enforcement of those practices may differ from other owners. Originality/value - The paper fulfills and identified the relationship between the project procurement system and MEP project performance in the context of the Saudi Arabian construction industry.

In addition, the positive effect of CSR practices on social sustainability performance (SSP) is examined. Design/methodology/approach A framework of hypotheses between barriers, CSR practices and SSP is established. Using a survey questionnaire, empirical data are collected from 17 construction firms in Vietnam. PLS-SEM is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that organizational and industrial barriers negatively affect CSR practices. This study also finds that education and training and government support could enable construction firms to reduce the impact of such barriers. Research limitations/implications The data are collected in Vietnam; thereby the findings are only applicable in developing countries. Further research should also be conducted in other countries to improve the generalizability of the theoretical framework. Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that construction firms could apply several strategies (e.g. providing their employees with CSR training and education; embedding CSR into their firm policy, mission and vision) to mitigate the impact of CSR barriers and, accordingly, ensure the success of adopting CSR practices. Originality/value This study is one of the first efforts in the construction industry that empirically investigates the impact of barriers on CSR practices and the moderating effects of training and education as well as government support.

J	Kim, MK; Wang, Q; Li, H				Kim, Min-Koo; Wang, Qian; Li, Heng			Non-contact sensing based geometric quality assessment of buildings and civil structures: A review	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Geometric quality assessment; Literature review; Buildings and civil structures; 3D laser scanning; Photogrammetry	DISCREPANCY FEEDBACK; INFORMATION MODELS; DAMAGE DETECTION; MACHINE VISION; LASER; BRIDGE; DOCUMENTATION; ELEMENTS; QUANTIFICATION; VALIDATION	Geometric quality assessment (QA) of buildings and civil structures is an essential process in a construction project. Timely geometric QA is able to prevent construction delays and cost overruns, maintain the performance of in-service facilities, and extend their service life. Geometric QA based on manual measurement has been proven to be time-consuming, unreliable and costly. Therefore, non-contact sensing technologies have been widely deployed for more efficient and accurate geometric QA. While a large number of techniques and algorithms have been developed in previous studies for non-contact sensing-based geometric QA, relatively little work has been done to systematically study and review their performance. This study reviews recent research on non-contact sensing-based geometric QA of buildings and civil structures in three project phases: 1) manufacturing, 2) assembly/construction, and 3) operation/maintenance phase. For each phase, the geometric QA is further categorized based on different QA purposes, including dimensional QA, surface QA, and deflection/deformation QA. Based on collected papers, two parts of analysis, consisting of 1) the adoption of different sensors for different project phases and 2) the performance of the QA algorithms/methods, are discussed in detail. Following the literature review and in-depth discussions, research gaps and future research directions are suggested, including improvement of QA techniques in each project phase, improvement of QA techniques applicability, and improvement of photogrammetry accuracy. This technical review is expected to have not only academic value by suggesting technical research directions based on the research gaps, but also practical values that allow contractors and subcontractors to automate and improve their current geometric QA practice.

Network Analysis of Flash-Track Practices	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper uses a network analysis approach to better understand the relationships and interdependencies between essential flash-track practices to identify the most central and core practices for successful execution of flash-track projects. Building on prior studies, this paper describes a practice-to-practice semantic network analysis, which reveals a rank order of the differing measures of essential flash-track practices. The findings indicate that establishing fully integrated teams, personnel selection, contractually aligning project participants and colocation of the project team are the most central and core flash-track enablers. Using a semantic network analysis suggests that the following three practices, which were ranked as Tier II practices based on delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach in the earlier research, are found to be core and enabling practices and thus merit to be promoted to the Tier I flash-track practices: (1) colocation of the project team; (2) staffing with cooperative and collaborative personnel; and (3) seeking out suppliers and specialty contractors as a source for time-saving innovations. In addition, this research indicates that the following three Tier I practices (according to delphi and AHP) even though important are not considered core or enabling practices (according to network analysis): (1) emphasizing coordination planning during the design process; (2) providing enough resources to critical path items; and (3) simplifying approval procedures. This research offers practical benefits by revealing why a particular flash-track practice is deemed essential. Although there has been some use of network analysis, particularly social network analysis in construction industry research, the authors believe that this flash-track practice-to-practice semantic network analysis is unique.

This study uses integrated project delivery (IPD) as the most recent contractual delivery approach to facilitate easier constructability implementation in the construction industry. The aim of this study is to present a practical framework to reduce changes and duplications, and facilitate constructability through focusing on the IPD approach. A case study on mass housing projects in Tehran is applied to provide supportive research data. This study uses qualitative analyses of data from both literature and the case study. Previously, comprehensive studies have been done by the authors through conducting a meta-synthesis technique. Outputs of the study, which were barriers and solutions to facilitate constructability implementation, are used in this study as presumptions. Data was collected from in-depth interviews with expert, including owners, consultants and contractors. The results were classified and compared with each other through descriptive and pattern analyses using the NVIVO Software. As determining constructability of a project needs experience and expertise, lack of constructability can be due to late or improper decision making in planning and design. The outcome of this study shows that `IPD implementation facilitates such harmony and coordination. The case is from Tehran of Iran. Given the geographical restriction of this case study that was in Iran, there were not adequate experts in the field of IPD. Currently, in Iran, these concepts are just implemented in large projects. This study uses IPD as the most recent contractual delivery approach to facilitate easier constructability implementation in the construction industry. Having coordination between construction and pre-construction stages is very significant to reduce duplications and improve real implementation of designs.

These organizational network challenges can impede successful project delivery. Innovation is a key factor in executing complex projects that require expertise from each party in a collaboration network. Unlike in many other industries, collaborations in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) project networks are typically temporary and require periods of intense collaboration. In an effort to understand the characteristics and evolutionary paths of innovative collaboration networks in the AEC industry, the authors collected data on more than 200 projects over a 15-year period (2000-2014) that were awarded the State Science and Technology Advancement Prize (SSTAP) of China and examine each of these as innovation collaboration cases. Social network analysis (SNA) techniques are used to understand the network characteristics and to examine the evolutionary patterns over time. The results find the studied innovative collaboration networks to be large and interwoven. Universities, with significantly greater betweenness centralities, serve as key network nodes in spreading creativity and promoting practical-theoretical integrations. This study also reveals that fewer repeated collaborations lead to more innovativeness. In other words, repeated collaborations may have a negative impact on novel and challenging AEC projects. Understanding such characteristics could promote innovations in the AEC industry and aid in the selection of strategic partners to participate in the execution of large and complex AEC projects more efficiently and effectively.

J	Guo, SW; Wang, JW; Wu, H				Guo, Shuwen; Wang, Junwu; Wu, Han			Profit distribution of IPD projects using fuzzy alliance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy alliance; Degree of participation; Integrated project delivery; Profit distribution; Shapley value		Purpose This paper examines the profit distribution of engineering projects in the integrated project delivery (IPD) mode. IPD is a new delivery method that can ameliorate many of the disadvantages of traditional delivery methods and improve project results. In the implementation of IPD, the profit distribution is key for ensuring the success of IPD projects. Design/methodology/approach This paper described a new method for characterizing profit distribution in the IPD mode. The payment function and Shapley value of the cooperative fuzzy game of fuzzy alliance were defined by considering the Choquet integral of the fuzzy measure. The participation of each player was considered, and the influence of participation on the profit distribution was discussed. Lastly, changes in the profit distribution of core participants under different alliance combinations were studied. Findings A case from a report of The American Institute of Architects (AIA) was used to verify the fuzzy alliance model. There was a significant correlation between the degree of participation of the owner, architect and builder and the profit distribution among these three participants. Research limitations/implications The theoretical research in this paper has some limitations. Initially, this paper selects a case with only three key participants in order to simplify the research. When there are many core participants, how to establish the alliance in the IPD mode and how to establish the corresponding profit distribution model, further work is certainly required to disentangle these complexities in models. Second, in this case, BIM technology has little impact on the income of the whole project. Therefore, this paper does not consider the impact of BIM technology on the marginal effect of the IPD project. Third, the contract type in the case is a custom tri-party based on IFOA. There is no classified discussion of the impact of different contracts on the profit distribute in the paper. Practical implications Based on the in-depth study of cooperative game with alliance structure, this paper promotes the classic cooperative game with alliance structure. The authors define the payoff function of fuzzy cooperative games by Choquet integral of fuzzy measure, and introduce the idea into the field of IPD. It aims at extending the solution to a cooperative game without a core. It can be obtained through a simple calculation. In the IPD alliance, the fuzziness and uncertainty of the participation degree of each participant will affect the profit of the whole project. The authors find that the higher the participation rate of players, the more profit each participant has. The greater the influence weight of the designer on the alliance, the lower the influence weight of the contractor on the alliance, the lower the participation of the contractor and the designer, and the lower the income distribution value of the three core participants. It shows a monotonous decline status. Social implications For any construction enterprise, it can make more profits if it joins the grand alliance. In the IPD alliance, each participant can maximize their own interests, which can also promote the enthusiasm of construction enterprises to participate in the alliance and increase the application of IPD mode in AEC industry. This research method provides a new fast, effective, and more realistic solution method for cooperative countermeasures. It can be further extended to other cooperative game fields and advance a new research perspective and solution for the distribution of cooperative interests. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is the development of a fuzzy alliance model that provides a tool for measuring the profit distribution in IPD. This is the first quantitative model to connect the degree of participation with the profit distribution in IPD using fuzzy alliance.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Exploring the Relationship between Construction Workers' Communication Skills and Their Productivity	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biases in data; Communication competence; Correlation analysis; Significance test	READING-SKILLS; SAFETY; ATTITUDE; PROJECT; HEALTH	In this globally connected world, construction sites are becoming multicultural workplaces. Workers from different places, cultures, and social backgrounds are increasing workplace diversity. However, the literature shows that workplace diversity can have a negative influence on workers' performance. The findings suggest that, when workers who speak different languages must collaborate on a project, their workplace communication is poor, which ultimately affects construction labor productivity (CLP). To date, this claim has been based only on theoretical constructs, and no empirical research on the subject has been conducted. Therefore, the present study attempts to address this gap by investigating the relationship between the four communication skills of construction workers-listening, reading, speaking, and writing-and CLP. To do so, survey instruments were developed to measure all four communication skills of the workers. Subsequently, the language of the survey instruments was translated into the local language of the workers, and all four communication skills of 114 construction workers were measured. In the next step, the same workers' productivity was measured directly at construction sites. The data on the workers were collected from six construction sites in India where a training yard facility was available. Through regression analysis, the relationship between the four communication skills and productivity was established. The result is that, of the four communication skills, an increase in listening and writing skills impact the productivity of workers positively, while an increase in speaking and reading skills affect it negatively. Thus, the study concludes that instead of enhancing the speaking skills of the workers, contractors must focus on improving the listening and writing skills of workers to enhance CLP.

Construction delay risk taxonomy, associations and regional contexts A systematic review and meta-analysis	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Taxonomy; Scheduling; Terminology; Delay; Systematic review; Construction planning; Project risk management; Risk paths; Regional contexts; Association rules	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; CAUSATIVE FACTORS; COST OVERRUNS; PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; TIME; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; TRENDS; RULES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically develop a delay risk terminology and taxonomy. This research also explores two external and internal dimensions of the taxonomy to determine how much the taxonomy as a whole or combinations of its elements are generalisable. Design/methodology/approach Using mixed methods research, this systematic literature review incorporated data from 46 articles to establish delay risk terminology and taxonomy. Qualitative data of the top 10 delay risks identified in each article were coded based on the grounded theory and constant comparative analysis using a three-stage coding approach. Word frequency analysis and cross-tabulation were used to develop the terminology and taxonomy. Association rules within the taxonomy were also explored to define risk paths and to unmask associations among the risks. Findings In total, 26 delay risks were identified and grouped into ten categories to form the risk breakdown structure. The universal delay risks and other delay risks that are more or less depending on the project location were determined. Also, it is realized that delays connected to equipment, sub-contractors and design drawings are highly connected to project planning, finance and owner slow decision making, respectively. Originality/value The established terminology and taxonomy may be used in manual or automated risk management systems as a baseline for delay risk identification, management and communication. In addition, the association rules assist the risk management process by enabling mitigation of a combination of risks together.	[Derakhshanfar, Hossein; Ochoa, J.

J	Zhao, XB; Singhaputtangkul, N				Zhao, Xianbo; Singhaputtangkul, Natee			Effects of Firm Characteristics on Enterprise Risk Management: Case Study of Chinese Construction Firms Operating in Singapore	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Enterprise risk management; Construction firms; Firm characteristics; Structural equation modeling	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTORS; STRATEGIES; MODELS; SYSTEM; PLS	The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of regulatory pressure, firm ownership, and firm size on enterprise risk management (ERM) implementation in international construction firms. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire survey was conducted with 35 professionals from Chinese construction firms (CCFs) operating in Singapore. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The analysis results confirmed the three constructs of ERM implementation: commitment and involvement of top management (CITM), communication and understanding (CU), and execution and integration (EI). Additionally, the results showed that: (1)higher regulatory pressure led to a higher level of CITM and EI; (2)a higher level of government ownership contributed to a higher level of CITM, CU, and EI; and (3)larger firm size led to a higher level of CITM and EI. The quantitative results were complemented by qualitative evidence from six semistructured interviews, which validated the proposed framework. These findings are arguably the first to be presented for the construction industry and therefore add to the existing body of knowledge on ERM. Additionally, the findings can help management teams tailor their ERM practices in accordance with firm characteristics, thereby contributing to current ERM practices. Although this study is focused on ERM in Singapore-based CCFs, a similar research design and method can be used to investigate the role of firm characteristics in ERM implementations in construction firms located in other countries. The future development of the ERM body of knowledge can, for enhancement purposes, take into account various firm characteristics for implementation. Therefore, this study contributes to the ERM body of knowledge.

This study aims to solve the dynamic transportation planning problem for the PCSC by addressing the interdependency, dynamic interaction and coordination among the multiple stages and different objectives of the stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach The PCSC is analyzed and then the formulation for the dynamic transportation planning problem is developed based on the just-in-time (JIT) strategy. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to solve the dynamic optimization problem. Findings The proposed dynamic transportation planning method for the PCSC regarding component supplier selection, transportation planning for means, routes and schedule, site layout planning and transportation plan adjustment is able to facilitate coordination among the multiple stages by addressing their interdependencies and dynamic interactions, as well as different economic objectives of the stakeholders such as suppliers or the contractor. Originality/value The study helps to achieve the advantages of prefabricated construction by prompting coordination among multiple stages of the PCSC by realizing different benefits of the stakeholders. In addition, it provides the stakeholders with the competitive bidding prices and the evaluation data for the bids quote. Meanwhile, it contributes to the domain knowledge of the PCSC management with regard to the viewpoint of coordination and integration of multiple stages rather than only one stage as well as the dynamic optimization model based on the JIT strategy and the PSO algorithm.

Updating ground conditions and time-cost scatter-gram in tunnels during excavation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Markov process; Bakhan road tunnel; Ground conditions; Time-cost scatter-gram; Time-cost uncertainties; Updating process	RISK-ASSESSMENT; DECISION AIDS; PREDICTION; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; NETWORKS; DESIGN; MODEL	Minimizing uncertainties is an important issue among the significant discussions pertaining to the project design and planning. Usually, the uncertainties in subsurface projects arise from the unknown ground conditions that may cause the designer to fail to consider all the potential issues prone to occur during the construction procedure. Total time and costs uncertainties can be considered as the most important uncertainties during the planning and excavation of a tunnel project that is directly connected with cognition of the subsurface conditions. This work presents an updating procedure and associated code, which allows one to refine predictions during construction. Updating does not only involve replacing the original prediction by actual data from the excavation but also includes a learning effect. The updating uses information from the actual excavation to arrive at an improved prediction for the unexcavated part. Updating the ground conditions and time-cost scatter-gram in tunnels during excavation is a tool, which helps the user refine input parameters by deriving relevant information from construction data and presenting it together with original input. In this paper, an example project shows that the updating result has a significant impact on the precision of the prediction and reduces the uncertainty about ground conditions and construction time and cost of the tunnel substantially. It facilitates both the owners and the contractors to be aware of the risk they should carry before construction of the unexcavated part, and it is useful for both tendering and bidding.

However, due to the complicated and multifaceted nature of international business and performance, there is as yet no consensus on how to evaluate the performance of international construction firms (ICFs). The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a practical framework for measuring the performance of ICFs. Based on the balanced scorecard (BSC), a framework with detailed measures is developed, investigated, and tested using a three-step research design. In the first step, 27 measures under six dimensions (financial, market, customer, internal business processes, stakeholders, and learning and growth) are determined by literature review, interviews with academics, and seminar discussions. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate weights of these 27 performance measures. The questionnaire survey also supports the importance of measuring intangible aspects of international construction performance from the practitioner's viewpoint. Additionally, a case study is described to test the framework's robustness and usefulness. This is achieved by benchmarking the performance of a Chinese ICF with nine other counterparts worldwide. It is found that the framework provides an effective basis for benchmarking ICFs to effectively monitor their performance and support the development of strategies for improved competitiveness in the international arena. This paper is the first attempt to present a balanced and practically tested framework for evaluating the performance of ICFs. It contributes to the practice of performance measurement and related internationalization in the construction industry in general.

J	Mahamid, I				Mahamid, Ibrahim			Impact of rework on material waste in building construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Material waste; rework; buildings; steel reinforcement; concrete	GENERATION; INDUSTRY; COSTS	This study aims at identifying the relationship between material waste and rework in building construction projects in the northern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To elicit the views of professionals in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia about rework factors, material waste factors and the relationship between rework and material waste, 82 questionnaires were distributed and 70 were returned. The study reveals that the main rework causes on construction sites are errors and omissions, lack of labour skills, non-conformance with specification requirements, inadequate supervision, and scope changes. While the study concludes that the top causes of material waste are using untrained labours, rework due to workers' mistakes, frequent design changes, selecting the lowest bidder contractor/subcontractor, and design and construction detail errors. To develop regression models that describe the relationship between rework and material waste, data from 47 building projects were collected. The predictive models emanating from the current study indicate a significant relationship between rework and material waste on construction sites in Saudi Arabia. Equally, the nature of the relationship is directly proportional, i.e. the higher the rework cost the higher the material waste and conversely the lower the rework cost the lower material waste. Results of this study will draw attention to potential causes that contribute to material waste and rework on construction sites. It may also help construction practitioners in the derivation methods and strategies to minimize rework and material waste and hence, enable improvements of construction industry to be made. The recommendation of this study may also apply to other developing countries.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify and classify barriers to PPP projects implementation in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were collected through the administration of questionnaires to public sector authorities, concessionaires, local lenders, consultants, and contractors already involved in PPP projects. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean score, Kruskal-Wallis test, and factor analysis. Findings - The study identified 58 barriers and the analysis of the total ranking among stakeholders revealed that all the identified barriers were considered as serious barriers influencing PPP projects in Nigeria. The result of Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that except for 18 (out of 58) identified barriers, there was no statistical significant difference in stakeholders' perceptions on barriers to PPPs project implementation in Nigeria. The study through factor analysis grouped the identified 58 barriers into ten principal factors with their components. Practical implications - This study provides an in-depth understanding on Nigeria's PPP market environment current context in terms of prevalent barriers influencing PPPs project. This would be beneficial to PPP stakeholders in decision making and planning towards PPP projects implementation. Originality/value - The findings would be valuable in assisting all stakeholders, particularly potential local, and foreign private investors to recognise major barriers in the implementation of PPP projects in Nigeria and thus helping them to develop strategies for penetrating Nigeria and developing countries PPP market successfully. This study results are crucial as not many empirical studies have been conducted in Nigeria.

Therefore, they must be accurate and up to date to better serve citizens, contractors, property owners and town planning departments. Traditionally, they have been updated by aerial photogrammetry, but this is not always possible and alternatives need to be sought. In such cases, a useful option for large scales is the mobile mapping system (MMS). However, automatic extraction from MMS point clouds is limited by the complexity of the urban environment. Therefore, the influence of the urban pattern is analysed in three zones with varied urban characteristics: areas with high buildings, open areas, and areas with a low level of urbanization. In these areas, the capture and automatic extraction of 3D urban elements is performed using commercial software, which is useful for some elements but not for manholes. The objective of this study is to establish a methodology for extracting manholes automatically and completing hidden buildings' corners, in order to update urban basemaps. Shape and intensity are the main detection parameters for manholes, whereas additional information from satellite image Quickbird is used to complete the buildings. The worst rate of detection for all the extracted urban elements was found in areas of high buildings. Finally, the article analyses the computing cost for manhole extraction, and the economic cost and time consume of the entire process, including the proposed methodology using an MMS point cloud and the traditional survey in this case.

J	Kim, P; Chen, JD; Cho, YK				Kim, Pileun; Chen, Jingdao; Cho, Yong K.			SLAM-driven robotic mapping and registration of 3D point clouds	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM); Point cloud registration; Laser scanning; Mobile robot	CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS; RETRIEVAL; FRAMEWORK; MODELS	With the rapid advancement of laser scanning and photogrammetry technologies, frequent geometric data collection at construction sites by contractors has been increased for the purpose of improving constructability, productivity, and onsite safety. However, the conventional static laser scanning method suffers from operational limitations due to the presence of many occlusions commonly found in a typical construction site. Obtaining a complete scan of a construction site without information loss requires that laser scans are obtained from multiple scanning locations around the site, which also necessitates extra work for registering each scanned point cloud. As an alternate solution to this problem, this paper introduces an autonomous mobile robot which navigates a scan site based on a continuously updated point cloud map. This mobile robot system utilizes the 21) Hector Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique to estimate real-time positions and orientations of the robot in the x-y plane. Then, the 21) localization information is used to create 3D point clouds of unknown environments in real time to determine its navigation paths as a pre-scanning process. The advantage of this framework is the ability to determine the optimal scan position and scan angle to reduce the scanning time and effort for gathering high resolution point cloud data in real-time. The mobile robot system is able to capture survey-quality RGB-mapped point cloud data, and automatically register the scans for geometric reconstruction of the site. The performance of the overall system was tested in an indoor environment and validated with promising results.

Analyzing the Impact of Negative Cash Flow on Construction Performance in the Dubai Area	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Negative cash flow; Project life cycle; Construction management; Construction performance; Construction industry		Cash flow impacts all aspects of the construction project implementation process. Cash shortages can lead to project failure and business bankruptcy. Researchers have studied cash flow in the context of scheduling, project delay, business failure, and forecasting. However, negative cash flow trends and patterns themselves have not been closely examined. This paper investigates negative cash flow trends and patterns and their impact on construction performance. To this end, the study reviews financial and scheduling data for 40 ongoing projects in the Dubai area and selects four projects for in-depth analysis. These projects represent the main categories of the Dubai construction industry in terms of type, budget, and business. Three elements of project cash flow are analyzed: (1) actual cash disbursements; (2) cash receipts; and (3) accumulated cash flow. Results of data analysis indicate that there was negative cash flow for 30 to 70% of project duration in each of the selected subject projects. The high shortage values ranged from two to four times the average monthly expenses. The study also investigated how some contractors are able to reduce the extent and amount of negative cash flow on their projects and complete them as scheduled by rescheduling construction activities on the basis of cash flow availability. The study shows that the amount, duration, and distribution of negative cash flow are critical factors in construction performance. Finally, study results underscore the essential need to plan for cash flow in all phases to ensure a successful and profitable project. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000123.

Few construction projects are being executed using modular building components in developing countries. This study is aimed at assessing the challenges to the implementation of the modular method of construction (MMC) with a focus on developing countries using two major states in Nigeria as a case study. A quantitative research approach was adopted with the design of a questionnaire survey. The study engaged construction professionals such as Quantity Surveyors, Architects, Engineers, Builders and Project Managers in Nigeria. Data retrieved were analysed using percentile, mean item score, Kruskal-Wallis H-Test as well as exploratory factor analysis. The findings showed that construction practitioners are faced with the challenge of finding a compromise between the cost of the project and the value obtainable by using MMC. The challenges were further classified into construction industry practices, client concerns and site characteristics. Practically, the study revealed the need for the proper enlightenment of both construction practitioners and clients with regards to the inherent value of the MMC. This involves the inclusion of MMC requirements in the client's information requirement for the construction project, the tender pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ), and the contractor's technical method statement for the construction project. Theoretically, the study serves as a good foundation for future research seeking to explore the use of MMC in developing countries. The study will assist construction organisations as well as the industry at large in shaping their policies to accommodate the use of innovative methods of construction by understanding the challenges that might hinder its effective implementation.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the root causes of changes in hospital construction projects. The paper aims to propose ways to prepare for the changes. Design/methodology/approach - The study focuses on changes during the construction of new hospital facilities. An explorative, case study research design is utilised. Five case projects from Finland, Sweden and the USA were selected for in-depth analysis. The primary data comprise semi-structured interviews, supported by secondary evidence such as change order documents. Findings - The findings reveal eight categories for change sources: contracts, and equipment and systems are reflective of the fast-paced healthcare technology and changing user requirements, while external environment comprises changes caused by both regulatory and physical environment. Changes in operations are reflected in the continuous development of treatment methods and processes. The user, owner, designer and contractor initiated changes represent the stakeholder influence. The paper makes a connection between these change sources and project complexity dimension. A framework for change dynamics is introduced, and product and process flexibility is suggested as a suitable method to prepare for and manage changes. Originality/value - The paper is the first to link construction changes to project complexity factors. The paper argues that changes, when managed appropriately, are not only necessary but also beneficial to large construction projects in a quickly changing environment. The findings guide project stakeholders in implementing project flexibility, in the product and process dimensions, which is a balancing force to project complexity.

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to appraise the survival strategies of organisations within the built environment, with a view to showcasing these strategies to ensure continuous survival of organisations within the industry. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a survey approach, and construction professionals across the six geo-political zones of the country were sampled using structured questionnaire. Data gathered were analysed using percentage, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and factor analysis. Findings The study revealed that organisation- and workforce management-related strategies are the most adopted survival strategies in the country, as they have the highest factor loading and accounts for about 37 per cent of the total extracted factors. This is followed by the adoption of strategies relating to organisation's innovation, diversification, financial management and organisation's networking, the combination of which accounts for 27.5 per cent of all extracted factors. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study imply that although organisations within the built environment see the need for effective management of their organisation and workforce in a bid to survive in the harsh economic situation of the country, more need to be done as regards the other identified survival strategies, as they can help ensure the survival of these organisations. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it showcases the survival strategies being adopted by the different organisations within the built environment in the challenging Nigerian economy, as against the usual common practice of studying specific organisations within the industry.

J	Cao, MT; Cheng, MY; Wu, YW				Cao, Minh-Tu; Cheng, Min-Yuan; Wu, Yu-Wei			Hybrid Computational Model for Forecasting Taiwan Construction Cost Index	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multivariate adaptive regression spline; Radial basis function neural network; Artificial bee colony; Construction cost index; Cost estimate; Cost and schedule	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; BEE COLONY; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; SVM	The ability to accurately forecast future trends in the Construction Cost Index (CCI) is critical for construction cost managers to prepare accurate budgets for owners and prepare proper bids for contractors. However, CCI forecasting accuracy is affected by concurrent fluctuations in numerous factors (e.g., domestic/international economic conditions, economic indicators, and the price of energy). The main contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is the creation of a new procedure and a novel inference model, the self-adaptive structural radial basis neural network intelligence machine (SSRIM), to help cost engineers deal with the variability of CCI. In SSRIM, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) analyzes the relative importance of various potential factors of influence on CCI, with those factors identified as significant assigned as input variables in the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and used to forecast CCI values. Meanwhile, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is employed to search for the optimal parameters of RBFNN to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. A total of 122 Taiwan CCI data were used to build the proposed model, identifying SSRIM as the fittest CCI forecast model with attaining lowest values of RMSE and MAPE. It is expected that this work will contribute to the construction engineering and management global community by helping cost engineers and project managers prepare more accurate budget estimates, proper bids, and attain better-timed project execution to reduce construction costs during the operation process.

Edward, Jr.; Zhang, Yuanxin; Shah, Dev			Industry Attitudes toward Alternative Contracting for Highway Construction in Florida	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Alternative contracting methods; Project delivery systems; Highway construction; Florida		Alternative contracting methods have become popular replacements for traditional practices based on low-bid acquisition. The benefits of decreased project duration, increased job quality, and improved delivery processes have demonstrated their value to the public over the years through the implementation of such methods as AthornB, design-build (D-B), incentive/disincentive (I/D), no excuse bonus (NEB), and lump sum (LS) contracting. In their continued efforts to gauge the performance of their Alternative Contracting Program in the administration of highway construction projects, the Florida DOT (FDOT) sought to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods compared with the traditional design-bid-build (DBB) system. The research team first examined literature and surveyed past project participants on common practice. Next, interviews were conducted to garner further insight on method-specific performance and general sentiment. To assess the effective administration of alternative contracting methods, this report provides the results of the surveys, interviews, method reviews, and recommendations. The results show that attitudes have improved over time both within and between project participants. Increased exposure, understanding, and use of newer alternative contracting methods has improved the manner in which state highway agencies more accurately select projects that use these methods. The data obtained from the implementation of these methods in this research will provide further substantive support for the use of nontraditional methods of project procurement. Furthermore, the expressed opinions of the designers, contractors, and inspectors in this research help shed light on the perceived benefits and drawbacks of each alternative contracting method. Moreover, understanding the personal views in the use of each method will aid in preventing and resolving party conflict. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Framework to Implement Performance-Based Contracting for Chip-Seal Road Maintenance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chip seal; Performance-based contracting (PBC); Delphi technique; Critical factors; Maintenance work	HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE; SPECIFICATIONS; QUALITY	The road maintenance workload for transportation agencies increases every year. To maintain roads effectively, one contracting method state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) use to outsource is performance-based contracting (PBC). However, state DOTs are having problems identifying the execution issues with PBCs. This study prepares a framework for execution of the PBC method for chip seals (one of the highest expenditure activities for most states), to help guide state engineers to effectively execute the contracts. This framework was developed by conducting a Delphi study with state engineers. The study found five reasons for selecting PBC chip seal; five performance measures; a range of incentives/disincentives to be provided; and the method of PBC team training. For the procurement phase, this study identified the five personnel to be included in the procurement team, as well as the contract duration and best contractor selection method. Similarly, for the contract implementation phase, the five key personnel to be included in the project implementation team, the best way to manage traffic, the timeliness to fix defects, responsibility, the frequency to complete quality assurance work, and the mobilization payment method were identified. As the primary contribution, this paper identified the critical factors of PBC contract life-cycle phases and developed a framework that will provide an easy-to-follow guide to execute PBC contracts to state DOTs. This study has a limitation with its sample size in the Delphi study due to a lack of experience of state DOTs in using the PBC method. The authors recommend conducting similar studies for other activities (cleaning, culvert cleaning, etc.) with larger sample sizes.

J	Baek, M; Ashuri, B				Baek, M.; Ashuri, B.			Analysis of the Variability of Submitted Unit Price Bids for Asphalt Line Items in Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ESTIMATING COST; CONSTRUCTION; MODELS; IMPACT	Highway construction costs are subject to significant variations from project to project and over time. Variations in construction cost disrupt transportation agencies in making right investment decisions and estimating accurate construction costs for projects. A wide range of variables has been proposed in different studies to explain variations in construction cost. There is value in conducting a research study that attempts to consider a comprehensive list of variables with potentials to explain the variations. The study needs to simultaneously take into account all possible explanatory variables to examine their relations with construction costs. The objective of this research is to assess the relations of several potential variables to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for major asphalt line items in highway projects. The primary contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the creation of a random parameters model to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items in highway projects. The identified variables used to build the random parameters model were classified into two major tiers. Tier 1 represents project-specific categories, including project characteristics, major supply sources for critical materials, and price adjustment clauses. Tier 2 represents global and external categories, consisting of the level of activities in local highway construction market, construction market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market conditions. It is expected that the findings of this paper will contribute to the current practice of cost estimation and investment decision making by helping transportation agencies develop more accurate budgets and contractors prepare more accurate bids for highway projects.

J	Hasan, A; Jha, KN				Hasan, Abid; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Acceptance of the Incentive/Disincentive Contracting Strategy in Developing Construction Markets: Empirical Study from India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Incentive; Disincentive; Construction industry; Factor analysis; Contracting	IMPACT; INCENTIVES	Modern construction projects often include incentive/disincentive (I/D) provisions in order to serve a variety of different client objectives. Studies have shown both the advantages and disadvantages of using I/D clauses to improve performance. In India, out of 82 construction projects of varied size and nature investigated, only 14 projects of a critical nature were found to have I/D clauses in their contract document. The present study was carried out to identify various attributes affecting the successful use of I/D clauses in achieving their intended purpose. A total of 25 attributes were identified based on a literature review and structured personal interviews that present practical difficulties while using the I/D contracting method and thus, prevent I/D clauses from unlocking their true potential. These attributes have been evaluated based on the results of a survey conducted among experienced professionals working in the Indian construction industry. Factor analysis conducted on responses associated with important attributes identified five key factors: difficulty in contract management, additional effort by project participants, adverse effect on the working relationship of the client and contractor, increased responsibility of the client, and client's reluctant top management. These factors also explain the reason behind the low acceptance of the I/D contracting method in developing construction markets. Case studies performed in four construction projects show that three out of four projects discussed were delayed due to inadequate understanding and wrong implementation of I/D provisions. This paper will be of interest to academicians and practitioners interested in the use of the I/D contracting method in construction projects. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Liao, LH; Lin, ETA; Low, SP				Liao, Longhui; Lin, Evelyn Teo Ai; Low, Sui Pheng			Assessing building information modeling implementation readiness in building projects in Singapore A fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Process; Project management; Building information modelling	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; BIM IMPLEMENTATION; EXPERT-SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; ADOPTION; DESIGN; FIRMS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify critical non-value adding (NVA) building information modeling (BIM) implementation activities in current building project delivery process, develop a BIM implementation readiness (BIMIR) evaluation model, and assess BIMIR statuses in building projects in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey and four post-survey interviews were conducted in Singapore. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach was adopted in the model development. Findings In total, 38 out of 44 NVA BIM implementation activities were deemed critical and used in the proposed model, among which "lack of involvement by contractors to contribute site knowledge" in the design development phase was ranked top. This model was validated in five projects. It was found that most of 73 surveyed building projects were in a low BIMIR status and the assessment results were consistent with current industry practices of BIM implementation in Singapore. Research limitations/implications - There may be geographical limitation on the identification of the critical NVA BIM implementation activities. However, because BIM mandate spreads globally, the findings can help overseas project teams customize their own NVA activities and evaluation models. Practical implications - As BIM implementation is mandated in Singapore, BIMIR evaluation helps local project teams identify weak areas of their BIM implementation activities and prioritize resources to enhance those areas. Originality/value No tool has been developed for evaluating BIMIR at the project level in the construction industry in Singapore or at large in Asia. Four BIMIR statuses are defined, which are consistent with Singapore's BIM guidelines and standards.

J	Abdirad, H; Dossick, CS				Abdirad, Hamid; Dossick, Carrie S.			Restructuration of architectural practice in integrated project delivery (IPD): two case studies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IPD; Architecture; Integration; Design management; Case study; Integrated project delivery; Integrated practice; Architectural practice; Restructuration	CONTRACTORS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to clarify that while integrated project delivery (IPD) methods can be momenta for restructuring architectural practice, they do not predetermine specific patterns of restructuration for the roles, responsibilities and services of architects. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a multiple case study design; two IPD projects were theoretically sampled and studied. The data collection methods included semi-structured interviews and observations. An inductive data analysis approach was applied to frame the phenomena, conduct cross-case comparisons and develop propositions. Findings While IPD implementations set expectations for new structures for practices, it is the project participants' situated decisions that lead to the restructuration of some dimensions of architectural practice. The dimensions in this study included team formation, design leadership and collaboration and architectural services. IPD project participants locally changed and redefined conventional roles, responsibilities and project artifacts (e.g. drawings and models) that concerned design development and coordination. Practical implications - IPD context, by itself, does not predetermine a fixed pattern of change in establishing designers' roles, responsibilities and services because restructuration is highly negotiated amongst the IPD parties and can lead to different responses to this contractual setting. Contracts set expectations for collaborative behavior, but the fulfillment of these expectations is situated and emerging as project participants negotiate to develop practices. Originality/value - While IPD research and guidelines aim to provide recipes for IPD implementation, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by clarifying that IPD is a context in which unprecedented ways of practice restructuration could emerge.

Effects of Nonnormal Distributions on Highway Construction Acceptance Pay Factor Calculation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Percent within limits; Quality control; Skewness; Kurtosis; Bias		Percent within limits (PWL) is a commonly used quality control/quality assurance measure of highway pavement materials and construction, and it is a popular index for adjusting pay factors. However, PWL is based on the assumption of normal distribution of quality characteristics (e.g., concrete compressive strength and asphalt air voids). Skewness and kurtosis, which are common forms of statistical nonnormal distributions, can potentially bias the acceptance pay factor calculations. To examine this potential pay bias, simulations were performed to investigate the magnitude and the direction (overestimation or underestimation) of pay factor calculations. The study revealed that for both one-sided and two-sided specification limits, bias in pay factors not only did vary in magnitude but also reversed in direction over various ranges of PWL. These analyses showed that for a one-sided upper specification limit, on average, a positive skewness and kurtosis can underestimate the pay factor of an acceptable quality level population by 0.90%, and overestimates a rejectable quality level population by 3.8%. This leads to falsely penalizing acceptable products and rewarding bad products. The same was true for two-sided limits, which again varied based upon the percent of defective materials at the tails of the distribution. This is a very important issue because these biases in pay factors can easily upset the relative profit margins of the contractor. Furthermore, this may not be easily detectable without a detailed and sophisticated analysis as outlined in this paper. For multiple quality characteristics based pay factors, analyses showed that the combined magnitude of these biases was not linearly cumulative. Findings of the study indicate that bias in pay was higher for lots with fewer sublots and higher skewness and kurtosis.

It explores the importance and performance of key project management constructs and indicators with a purpose to make practical and actionable recommendations for project managers to identify and improve project management practices. Design/methodology/approach The data used were derived from 3,130 system delivery projects in the facilities management industry. The data was analyzed with Partial Least Squares Modelling (PLS) software SmartPLS, using its embedded importance-performance functionality. Findings The findings indicate the importance and performance of the project management constructs and their respective indicator variables in an importance-performance (IPMA) map. All three project management phases (constructs); proposal, installation and commissioning, were significantly related to satisfaction. The installation phase (construct) showed the highest potential for performance improvement in project management. With regard to the specific indicator variables, the variable "Coordinating their work with other contractors (or the owner's staff)" received a strong "Do better" recommendation. Originality/value The approach and results provide an easy to use and visual tool for project managers to assess the importance and performance of the various elements of project management. The instrument provides a project management direction for the identification of strategic enhancement areas as it is essential to recognize what facets of project management contribute most to the improvement of project management performance over a longer period of time (Cronin and Taylor, 1992; Palmer, 1998).

J	El-Gohary, KM; Aziz, RF				El-Gohary, Khaled Mahmoud; Aziz, Remon Fayek			Factors Influencing Construction Labor Productivity in Egypt	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Labor productivity; Egypt; Factors; Management; Construction; Rank; Relative importance index; Improvement		Construction is a labor-intensive industry. Therefore, construction labor productivity is of critical importance to the profitability of most construction projects. Many construction industry sectors have been experiencing chronic problems such as poor management, inferior working conditions, and insufficient quality. Many researchers have identified these problems as factors that affect construction productivity and will affect a company's performance and the overall economy of the country. This paper aims to identify, investigate, and rank factors perceived to affect construction labor productivity in the Egyptian construction context with respect to their relative importance. To achieve this objective, practitioners and experts comprising a statistically representative sample were invited to participate in a structured questionnaire survey. The questionnaire comprised 30 productivity factors that were classified under the following three primary categories: (1)human/labor, (2)industrial, and (3)management. The management category was ranked first, followed by the labor category and the industrial category. This study revealed that the following five factors, ranked in descending order, are the most significant in their effects on construction labor productivity in Egypt: (1)labor experience and skills; (2)incentive programs; (3)availability of the material and ease of handling; (4)leadership and competency of construction management; and (5)competency of labor supervision. Industry practitioners and researchers can use the primary outcomes of this study in developing systems to enhance and improve construction labor productivity in Egypt. Also, this paper can serve as a guide for contractors and construction managers for the effective management of construction labor forces and help to achieve a competitive level of quality and a cost-effective project.

J	Deng, F; Liu, GW; Jin, ZG				Deng, Fei; Liu, Guiwen; Jin, Zhigang			Factors Formulating the Competitiveness of the Chinese Construction Industry: Empirical Investigation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						China; Construction industry; Competitiveness; Competition; Porter's diamond model	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PROJECT PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS; CONTRACTORS; STRATEGIES	The competitiveness of the construction industry is significantly affected by various factors, such as abundant manpower, integrated performance of supporting industries, and government support. The construction industry in developing countries is less competitive than its counterparts in the international construction market, and causes of this situation are multifaceted. Nation-related characteristics should be taken into account to produce competitive strategies for a specific construction industry, and this also leads to the situation that factors differ between countries, especially between developing and developed countries. Porter's diamond model is adopted to develop potential factors formulating the competitiveness of the construction industry, and 34 factors are identified within the Chinese constriction industry (CCI). In order to get empirical findings, a questionnaire survey is managed to investigate the significance of these factors, and factor analysis is also applied. Factor analysis further reveals six underlying factors: stable home market (F-I), supply chain management (F-II), corporate management practices (F-III), qualified professionals (F-IV), satisfactory business environment (F-V), and migrant workers (F-VI). The study provides insights in finding key areas that formulate the competitiveness of the CCI, as well as valuable implications for other countries. These research results provide some practical implications for practiced professionals and policy-makers to emphasize these critical aspects that determine the competitiveness of the industry, e.g.,creating a dynamic and advanced domestic market. However, as the market context and institutional environment vary significantly among different countries, similar studies in different construction industries would enrich the understanding of the competitiveness of the construction industry generally.

J	Chan, APC; Chan, DWM; Chiang, YH; Tang, BS; Chan, EHW; Ho, KSK				Chan, APC; Chan, DWM; Chiang, YH; Tang, BS; Chan, EHW; Ho, KSK			Exploring critical success factors for partnering in construction projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						teamwork; construction industry; Hong Kong; factor analysis; multiple regressions; partnerships	PERFORMANCE; MODEL	The construction industry is a very competitive high-risk business. Many problems, such as little cooperation, lack of trust, and ineffective communication resulting in adversarial relationships between contracting parties, are facing the construction industry. Partnering is perhaps one of the most innovative developments in delivering a project efficiently and reducing construction disputes. It provides a sound basis for a "win-win" climate and synergistic teamwork. Project partnering in the Hong Kong construction industry has gained in popularity since 1994. A number of potential factors contributing to partnering success have emerged and deserve further study. This paper presents a review of the development of the partnering concept in general and identifies critical success factors for partnering projects from the Hong Kong perspective in particular. Through a postal questionnaire survey geared toward project participants with hands-on partnering experience, the opinions of various parties--clients, consultants, and contractors were sought and evaluated in relation to partnering success factors. The relationship between the perception of partnering success and a set of success factors hypothesized in the study was derived using factor analysis and multiple regression. The results indicated that certain requirements must be met for partnering to succeed. In particular, the establishment and communication of a conflict resolution strategy, a willingness to share resources among project participants, a clear definition of responsibilities, a commitment to a win-win attitude, and regular monitoring of partnering process were believed to be the significant underlying factors for partnering success. Such an identification of success factors could well formulate effective strategies for minimizing construction conflicts and improving project performance.

Classification and description of various concrete placing methods are given. The normally available quality control (QC) records for 462 concrete pours from five ongoing Hong Kong building construction projects were captured into a database, representing a total of 6,833 truckmixer trips out of two major concrete plants in Hong Kong. By querying the database, the placing rates for particular placing methods were established, and validated by comparison with existing industry benchmarks. One promising observation is that in general the Hong Kong construction sites may now be more efficient in processing truckmixers than they were a decade ago. The normal concreting QC records, routinely accumulated on site in a mandatory and standardized fashion, include the timing and quantity data as needed because of the time-sensitive nature of freshly mixed concrete. Data of this type is a better and more convenient alternative to collection by direct observation and measurement. The concreting placing rates for the various placing methods derived from the database are found to be potentially of direct value for assisting concrete plant and site managers in estimating the progress of work and attaining better coordination in concrete supply and placing between concrete suppliers and site contractors. They also serve as performance yardsticks for benchmarking the state of the Hong Kong concreting industry as time goes by and indeed, and most usefully, for comparison with other large cities if similar records are obtained for processing from those cities.

J	Wu, CL; Li, N; Fang, DP				Wu, Chunlin; Li, Nan; Fang, Dongping			Leadership improvement and its impact on workplace safety in construction projects: A conceptual model and action research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Leadership; Safety performance; Construction project; Action research (AR); Longitudinal evaluation	TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; CULTURE; ORGANIZATIONS; CONTRACTORS; INVOLVEMENT; OPERATIONS	Leadership is proven as a key factor impacting safety while researchers and practitioners are fostering proactive approaches to preventing workplace injuries. Practitioners' lack of leadership is one of the major causes for the continuous high-level accident frequency within the construction projects. An important yet still unsettled academic issue is how leadership impacts safety performance of construction projects, and how safety leadership can be improved. In order to probe into the mechanism by which leadership improves project safety, this study develops a safety leadership model for construction projects (SLMCP) in both theoretical and pragmatic perspectives. Theoretically, this model incorporates specific characteristics of construction projects and applies a multiple levels-of-management perspective to depict leadership's cascading influences across project stakeholders. Safety culture and safety management are the two major paths by which leadership impacts safety performance. Pragmatically, the action research (AR) method is used to validate the theoretical model empirically and develop feasible measures to implement safety leadership in practice. A five-round longitudinal evaluation confirmed in a case study the validity of SLMCP and the effectiveness of safety leadership improvement measures. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by clearly depicting safety leadership's cascading top-down influencing mechanism in construction projects and providing concrete and validated measures for leadership improvement. The AR based intervention also establishes a general procedure for leadership promotion in practice. Conclusions of the paper serve as novel ideas and methods for workplace safety improvement in construction projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Vu, HA; Cu, VH; Min, LX; Wang, JQ				Hong Anh Vu; Viet Hung Cu; Min, Lian Xing; Wang, Jian Qiong			Risk analysis of schedule delays in international highway projects in Vietnam using a structural equation model	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Engineering; Risk management; Methodology; Project management; Construction planning	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS; SUCCESS	Purpose - As in other developing countries, increased highway development in Vietnam provides enormous opportunities for international construction companies (ICCs). However, a prolonged schedule delay (SD) can have an extremely detrimental impact on a project's efficiency, cost and investment reputation. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential SD risk factors in international highway projects (IHPs) in Vietnam, and to explore the effects of and influences on such factors. A specific risk management framework is proposed as a useful tool for ICCs. Design/methodology/approach - A system of SD risk indicators is presented for IHPs in Vietnam through a questionnaire survey. The system comprises 50 indicators that are grouped into 12 main factors. A structural equation model (SEM) is then used to assess the influences and mechanisms of these factors. Based on the obtained results, corresponding suggestions for preventing SD risks are presented and discussed. Findings - First, among the 12 aforementioned major factors, the authors identify eight facors that have significant effects on IHP SDs. Second, the SEM analysis reveals that policy flaws and the fiscal ability of the owner play the most important roles, on account of their direct and indirect influences on SDs. Originality/value - Considering stakeholders and external environmental effects, a system of indicators is introduced to explore SD risks to IHPs. In particular, an SEM is used to assess the effects of potential SD factors and characterize their interacting influences. This study could help ICCs to avoid or mitigate project delays and cost overruns in Vietnam, and also provide valuable lessons for other developing countries.

Preliminary Engineering Cost Estimation Model for Bridge Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Infrastructure; Bridges; Construction costs; Budgets; Preliminary engineering; Preconstruction; Infrastructure; Bridges; Cost estimation; Regression; Planning; Design; Budget control; Project planning and design		This paper addresses one of the costs of new bridges, i.e.,the cost of doing the preliminary engineering (PE). This particular aspect of cost has largely been neglected because of the difficulty in obtaining appropriate data. Typically, PE costs are determined as a percentage of construction costs, disregarding other project-specific parameters. Bridge projects let by the North Carolina (NC) DOT between 2001 and 2009 were reviewed. From an analysis of these 461 projects, the writers developed statistical models linking variation in PE costs with distinctive project parameters. The primary contribution this paper makes to the body of knowledge is the finding that PE cost estimates for bridge projects are commonly and significantly underestimated. The writers found that bridge projects exhibited a mean PE cost ratio of 28%. This result is significantly greater than the percentage used in practice. An investigation of data sources related to bridge projects, a description of regression techniques applied to predict the PE cost of such projects, and an assessment of the predictive performance of models are addressed in this paper. New knowledge contributions include identification of key factors affecting the PE costs of bridges, illustration of how those key factors enabled us to predict PE costs of future projects, and discussion of the data collection problems that hindered model development. The writers' PE cost analyses and predictive modeling effort relate to infrastructure funding issues. All of the parties involved in infrastructure construction, from legislators to contractors, must understand costs and have confidence in the cost estimates developed to ensure efficient and effective funding of infrastructure projects. This paper on bridge PE costs addresses one component of infrastructure funding.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the 2-4 Model, a framework of the ACM-HC was constructed, and the accident causal factors (CF) were extracted from four aspects of human, material, environment and management. In addition, association rule mining (ARM) was introduced to analyze accident investigation reports to obtain the interrelationships between the factors. Based on the framework, factors and ARM results, the ACM-HC was established. Finally, the ACM-HC was verified with a tunnel collapse accident. Findings Both the external and internal causes of contractor cause accidents. The flaws of safety management of other stakeholders are external causes. In terms of the internal causes, there are four stages: direct causes, indirect causes, radical causes and root causes. More specifically, the direct causes refer to the unsafe acts and the unsafe conditions; ineffective safety supervision and poor individual factors of frontline workers constitute the indirect causes; the radical causes lie in the flaws of construction procedures and technical schemes; the root causes are related to the poor individual factors of decision makers and managers. Originality/value The ACM-HC expresses the causes, sequence and mechanism of highway construction accidents in a visual way. In addition, this study describes a process of using a qualitative-quantitative hybrid approach to establish a modified ACM, which provides a different perspective for the establishment of an ACM.

Global Collaborative Network of Skyscraper Projects from 1990 to 2010: Temporal Evolution and Spatial Characteristics	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaproject collaborative network; Skyscraper; Social network analysis; Spatial characteristics; Temporal evolution	SOCIAL NETWORKS; BUSINESS; MEGAPROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; CENTRALITY; REPUTATION; POWER	With architecture, engineering, and construction projects tending to be larger and more complex, their participating organizations are becoming more diversified and internationalized. This is particularly true for megaprojects that require higher levels of specialized workforces and exhibit more complicated organizational relationships. To examine the characteristics of megaproject collaboration from a dynamic network perspective, this research selected skyscraper projects as a featured megaproject field. A total of 422 completed skyscraper projects over 250 m in height that were built from 1990 to 2010 worldwide, as well as more than 1,100 participating organizations, were analyzed using social network analysis. Increasingly tight and interwoven collaborative relationships in the discrete-time global skyscraper networks were found, and design firms played a vital role by holding central network positions over time, indicating the importance of the design phase in skyscraper projects. The distinctive interregional and/or intraregional collaboration features were revealed at different geographical settings. Designers, especially those from North America, Europe, and Oceania, were also more active and thus successful in participating in skyscraper projects abroad, mostly in Asia and the Middle East, whereas the general contractors were more generally involved in local projects. The identified preferential attachment phenomenon and regional collaborative features led to the network topology dynamics. This study not only contributes to an holistic understanding of the status quo and development trends of the skyscraper industry integrating network theory with megaproject management, but also provides a reference for corporate practices and decision making in the specific megaproject field.

I: Iterative Experiment to Test the Predictive Validity of Human Judgment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							UNSAFE WORK BEHAVIOR; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS; CONTRACTORS; INDUSTRY; PROGRAM; SITES; MODEL	In order to prevent fatalities, new methods of evaluating work conditions and making predictions are needed. Nuclear energy, chemical manufacturing, and commercial airline industries have all used precursor analysis to predict and prevent catastrophic events. This paper presents the first steps toward a precursor-analysis process for the construction industry. First, a comprehensive catalog of 43 potential precursors was established by triangulating results from a literature review; performing a deterministic event analysis of 21 fatalities; and having brainstorming sessions with construction safety, law, regulation, and psychology experts. The 43 potential precursors were then translated into a precursor-data collection protocol. The protocol involved questions and field observations to assess the presence or absence of each precursor before an event occurred. The protocol was applied to collect data for 19 new cases, which included (1) events where high-energy work was successfully completed without incident; (2) near misses where high-energy was released but no one was harmed; and (3) fatal or disabling injury events. Using these cases, a controlled experiment was conducted where a group of 14 experts were asked to predict each case outcome using only the leading information collected via the protocol and their judgment. Later, the same experiment was conducted with moderately experienced professionals and students for validation and to test generalizability. A permutation test indicated that people of all levels are able to distinguish between success and failure far better than random using only the leading information. Future research is proposed to reduce the scope of the protocol and to create objective methods of prediction using statistical tools, thereby making the precursor-analysis process less resource intensive and more reliable.

J	Shrestha, PP; Mani, N				Shrestha, Pramen P.; Mani, Nirajan			Impact of Design Cost on Project Performance of Design-Bid-Build Road Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design-bid-build; Design cost; Total cost growth; Construction schedule growth	NUMBER	The vast majority of highway and street projects in the United States are procured and constructed by state or local governments using the design-bid-build (DBB) project delivery method. In the DBB method, the contractors build the project according to the detailed design and specifications prepared by the engineers. Using the DBB method, the quality of design has an impact on the construction performance. To date, only a few studies have measured the effect of design cost on the project performance of the road projects. In order to determine the impact of design cost on construction cost and schedule performance, this paper analyzes a sample of 47 Clark County public road projects of Nevada and 17 road projects of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The sample includes projects completed between 1991 and 2009, and cost more than $3.43billion in construction value, converted to a 2010 base cost. Besides determining the impact of design cost on the cost and schedule growth of the road projects, this study also determines a correlation between the design cost percentage and the final project cost of the projects. The analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the design cost percentage and the total cost growth of the project. In addition, the design cost percentage was found to have a strong negative correlation with the final project cost for this sample. The t-test showed that the design cost percentage of road projects that have total cost growth less than or equal to zero was significantly higher than that for road projects that have a total cost growth higher than zero.

The importance of BIM capability assessment An evaluation of post-selection performance of organisations on construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; Capability; Case study; Competence; Performance	CONTRACTOR SELECTION; QUALIFICATION CRITERIA; PRE-QUALIFICATION; FUZZY; PREQUALIFICATION; TOPSIS; MODEL; AHP; IMPACTS; SETS	Purpose The emergence of building information modelling (BIM) has led to the need for pre-qualification and selection of organisations capable of working within a BIM environment. Several criteria have been proposed for the assessment of an organisation's BIM capability during the pre-qualification and selection phase of projects. However, no studies have sought to empirically establish whether organisations selected on the basis of such criteria have actually been the most successful at delivering BIM on projects. The purpose of this paper is to address the aforementioned gap through a comparison of predicted BIM capability and post-selection performance. Design/methodology/approach BIM capability of firms in a case study was predicted using 28 BIM pre-qualification and selection criteria, prioritised based on their perceived contribution to BIM delivery success from a survey of practitioners on BIM-enabled projects. The comparison of predicted BIM capability and post-selection performance was, on the other hand, achieved through the application of the Technique to Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and fuzzy sets theory (Fuzzy-TOPSIS). Findings Findings underscore the reliability of the 28 BIM pre-qualification and selection criteria as well as the priority weightings proposed for their use in predicting BIM capability and likelihood of performance. The findings have highlighted the importance of criteria related as previous BIM use experience as well as information processing maturity as critical indicators of the capability of organisations, particularly design firms. Originality/value Overall, the findings highlight the need for prioritisation of BIM pre-qualification and selection criteria on the basis of their actual contribution to delivery success from post-selection evaluation of performance.

J	Ling, FYY; Ong, SY; Ke, YJ; Wang, SQ; Zou, P				Ling, Florence Yean Yng; Ong, Shi Ying; Ke, Yongjian; Wang, Shouqing; Zou, Patrick			Drivers and barriers to adopting relational contracting practices in public projects: Comparative study of Beijing and Sydney	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project outcome; Performance; Relational contracting; China; Australia	PARTNERING PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION; INTEGRATION; SELECTION; BUSINESS; SUCCESS	When contracting parties adopt relational contracting (RC) as opposed to formal contracting stance, the construction project may achieve good outcomes. However, public projects usually face more constraints in adopting RC, as close relationships may lead to allegations of corruption. The aim of this study is to undertake a comparative analysis of drivers and barriers to adopting RC practices in public construction projects in two different markets viz, a centrally planned economy and a free market economy by investigating practices in Beijing and Sydney. The survey research design was adopted and data of public construction projects in Beijing and Sydney were collected using a structured questionnaire. The results revealed that relationship quality and level of harmony among contracting parties are significantly good in both cities. In Sydney, the level of inter-personal relations between contractors and consultants is significantly higher than in Beijing. It was found that the same 18 factors drive contracting parties in Beijing and Sydney to adopt RC practices, and in 6 instances, these are significantly greater drivers in Sydney. The barriers to adopting RC practices are totally dissimilar in both cities. Contracting parties in Beijing could not adopt more RC practices because of a lack of training in relational arrangement and public clients lack initiative in adopting RC practices. The conservative industry culture that encourages preservation of the status quo is also prevalent in Beijing. In Sydney, the only significant barrier is public sector accountability concerns. To cultivate readiness to embrace RC practices, it is suggested that industry professionals and the government adopt recommendations highlighted in this study according to the type of market structure.

J	Gibb, AGF; Isack, F				Gibb, AGF; Isack, F			Re-engineering through pre-assembly: client expectations and drivers	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business process re-engineering; clients; modularization; pre-assembly; re-engineering construction; system building		Pre-assembly is an important facet of the strategy to re-engineer construction. It can be categorized as: modular building; volumetric pre-assembly, non-volumetric pre-assembly and component manufacture/subassembly. This paper presents the results of an interview survey of major construction clients about their expectations from and drivers for pre-assembly on their projects. In particular, time, cost, quality and productivity benefits through minimization of on-site operations and duration, less congestion on site, improved health and safety along with greater and more predictable quality are identified. To get the best out of pre-assembly, clients acknowledge that they must be able to freeze the design early, provide reasonable lead times and provide time for presite prototyping. Clients' past experience has been mixed, with some citing tangible benefits, but others experiencing poor-quality products and a limited and disjointed supply chain - these mitigate against efforts to increase pre-assembly as part of the re-engineering mantra. Typically, clients accepted that suppliers should be involved early, but in practice many do not re-engineer the process and leave key decisions too late in the process to maximize benefits. More than half wanted to see an increase in the use of pre-assembly on their projects, but the supply chain must refocus to consider the client's perspective and capitalize on this opportunity. Whilst pre-assembly is not new and many have published on the subject, the perspective of clients has not been adequately covered. Pre-assembly may be well understood by manufacturers, contractors and even some designers, but unless the client decision-makers understand its benefits and limitations, then their misunder standings and prejudices will continue to be a barrier to further development.

J	Said, HM; Kandimalla, P				Said, Hisham M.; Kandimalla, Prathyaj			Performance Measurement of Building Sheet-Metal Ductwork Prefabrication under Batch Production Settings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sheet metal; Mechanical ductwork; Linear regression; Batch production; Prefabrication; Quantitative methods	DESIGN; EFFICIENCY; PROJECTS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Mechanical contractors have been among the very early pioneers of construction prefabrication by moving a significant amount of work to sheet metal fabrication shops off-site to produce common fittings of mechanical building systems and architectural metal finishes. These sheet metal fabrication shops usually follow standard families of fittings and batch-based production process, in which different customized fittings are fabricated together following a single instruction sheet, called a cut sheet. Aggregate and manual tracking systems are used to record the total fabrication labor hours for every cut sheet, which does not provide a direct means to measure the performance of fabrication of the whole batch and individual fittings. As such, the goal of this paper is to assess the feasibility of developing performance measurement models for HVAC sheet metal fabrication operations that are based on batch production with limited tracking data. Six different fabrication time estimation models with different tracking scopes and detail levels were formulated and implemented using multilinear regression and artificial neural networks. The models were trained, validated, and tested using a large sample of sheet metal fabrication data. The contributions of this study include (1)analyzing the trade-off between the formulation complexity and the reliability of their implementations, (2)implementing these formulations using two common machine learning tools (artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression) and comparing between their fit quality and prediction accuracy, and (3)examining the feasibility of reliable performance measurement models of batch production operations with only a single dependent variable (total fabrication time) and an abundance of fabrication and design variables.

J	Asiedu, RO; Frempong, NK; Alfen, HW				Asiedu, Richard Ohene; Frempong, Nana Kena; Alfen, Hans Wilhelm			Predicting likelihood of cost overrun in educational projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cost overruns; Model; Educational projects; Ghanaian construction industry; Multi linear regression; Predictive variables	TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; TIME; MODEL; CONTRACTS	Purpose - Being able to predict the likelihood of a project to overrun its cost before the contract signing phase is crucial in developing the required mitigating measures to avert it. Known parameters that permit the timely prediction of cost overrun provide the basis for such predictions. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a model for forecasting cost overruns. Design/methodology/approach - Ten predictive variables known before the contract signing phase of a project are identified. Based on a survey approach, information on 321 educational projects completed are compiled. A multiple linear regression analysis is adopted for the model development. Findings - Five variables - initial contract sum, gross floor area, number of storeys, source of funds and contractors' financial classification are observed to influence cost overruns. The model, however, yields a fairly weak coefficient of determination with a mean absolute percentage error of 30.22 and 138 per cent, respectively. Research limitations/implications - The model developed focussed on data only educational projects sampled from three out of the ten administration regions in Ghana based on a purposive sampling approach. Practical implications - Policy makers and construction managers working on public projects stand to gain tremendous assistance in formulating and strengthening their own in-house cost forecasting at the precontract phase based on "what if" analysis to generate various alternative predictions of cost overruns.

J	Mollaoglu, S; Sparkling, A; Thomas, S				Mollaoglu, Sinem; Sparkling, Anthony; Thomas, Sean			An Inquiry to Move an Underutilized Best Practice Forward: Barriers to Partnering in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						partnering; delphi method; barriers; trust; cultural; organizational; project team	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; MODEL; PROJECTS	There is an obvious need in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry for improved project team integration through project delivery to ensure improved project outcomes. The literature reports that, among other methods, project partnering, when followed successfully, provides a great opportunity to improve project performance via improved collaboration among key project stakeholders (e.g., owner, designer, contractor) and reduce claims as a result while letting all project members stay in their traditional roles and work under any contractual framework, including design-bid-build. Despite its potential and history in the United States since the late 1980s and being classified as one of the best practices by the Construction Industry Institute in 1996, partnering continues to be underutilized. Existing research on partnering is mostly limited to public projects such as mega roadway and bridge projects. Guided by the literature, the aim of this research is to understand and report barriers to project partnering in the United States from both vertical/horizontal and public/private construction sectors. Via a comprehensive literature review, followed by a Delphi survey of partnering experts, this study systematically classified barriers to project partnering. In study results, implementation barriers to partnering during project delivery are more frequently pronounced than the barriers to its adoption. Of the top reported barriers to project partnering, the majority are cultural; project team related barriers show the greatest area of potential for improvement; and contrary to the literature, none is legislative. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by drawing attention to project delivery and management practices in the AEC industry to improve team collaboration and chances of successful implementation and adoption of integrative practices.

The aim of this research is to investigate the relevance of organizational flexibility management to construction firms, because firms that are more flexible are more likely to survive and prosper than less flexible firms. More specifically, the objectives are to define a model that will allow contractors to understand the complex factors that contribute to organizational flexibility; ascertain whether organizational flexibility should be treated as a uni- or multidimensional construct; and identify the key determinants that drive organizational flexibility. A two-pronged research method with exploratory interviews and an industrywide survey was adopted. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with construction industry experts. The data collection instrument for the survey was a structured questionnaire specifically designed for this study. By using structural equation modeling, the study empirically investigated the key dimensions and determinants of organizational flexibility. The results showed that organizational flexibility should be treated as a multidimensional concept, comprising operational flexibility, tactical flexibility, and strategic flexibility. The key determinants-employees' skills and behavior, supply chain capabilities, and business strategies-were found to have the highest positive impacts on operational flexibility, tactical flexibility, and strategic flexibility, respectively. The structural equation model developed from this research provides guidance to practitioners on the organizational attributes that they could improve to achieve organizational flexibility, which would help them to survive and grow.

Design/methodology/approach The viewpoints of the experts engaged in Indian construction industry were used to apply factor analysis and fuzzy preference relation with the help of a questionnaire survey. Findings The findings indicate that project factor is the most important factor, whereas favourable market and marketing team is the least important factor. Among the success attributes, the availability of qualified staff is the most important attribute, and health and safety management plan is the least important attribute. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study are based on the viewpoint of the experts of construction organisations engaged in building projects in India. Practical implications The study can be used as a yardstick for the top management of construction organisations to manage their resources efficiently and to develop a strategy to be successful in this business. Social implications Indian construction industry provides direct and indirect employment to the people of India. Hence, the success of construction organisation will contribute to the development of the society and ultimately the nation. Originality/value In the earlier studies, researchers have used various statistical tools to identify and evaluate the alternatives for the success factors of construction organisations, but very few of them have tried to assign weights to those alternatives. The simple ranking of alternatives using various statistical analyses, such as mean and standard deviation, relative importance index, etc., is not much useful unless their relative weights are known. With the help of the present study, the authors have tried to overcome the shortcomings of the previous research works.

J	Ekeskar, A; Rudberg, M				Ekeskar, Andreas; Rudberg, Martin			Third-party logistics in construction: the case of a large hospital project	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Case study; construction logistics; construction supply chain; supply chain management; third-party logistics	SUPPLY CHAINS; PRODUCTIVITY; INDUSTRY; ISSUES	The construction supply chain is of temporary nature and complex, with many interactions between multiple actors in different construction projects. This challenging context typically leads to relatively higher costs and lower productivity, compared to other industries. Supply chain management (SCM) has been put forward as a mean to better handle this challenging context. As a part of SCM initiatives some construction industry stakeholders have turned to third-party logistics (TPL) providers, especially in large construction projects. The use of TPL providers is a new, and under-investigated, phenomenon in the construction industry. The main purpose of this study is thus to explore the use of a TPL provider in a large construction project and to analyse its resulting effects. Driving forces and possible concerns for implementing TPL are identified and the possibility for TPL to be a facilitator for implementing SCM in construction is investigated. The research is based on a literature review and an explorative case study of a large hospital project in Sweden, where the client and the main contractor have initiated the use of a TPL provider to coordinate sourcing and materials handling activities on site. The results show positive effects on establishing an effective interface between the construction site and the supply chain. The results also show that a TPL solution facilitates an increase in productive work at the construction site itself, a reduction of costs and an increased utilisation of site assets. On the downside, the study also shows a lack of SCM knowledge amongst the involved actors in the project, hindering them to reap the full potential of TPL.

Adherence to COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites may prevent the occurrence of COVID-19 cases, which eliminates the risk of site closure. However, adding a disinfection process to the construction process, as mandated in COVID-19 response guidelines, increases overall construction cost and time. Conversely, however, not adding a disinfection process may result in COVID-19 cases among construction workers, which would delay construction and perhaps even cause closure of the construction site. Therefore, this study analyzed the feasibility of COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites, especially the addition of a disinfection process, in terms of cost and time. To this end, CYClic Operations NEtwork (CYCLONE) models were developed to simulate the construction process, and a case study was conducted to validate the applicability of the suggested approach. The results showed that compliance with COVID-19 response guidelines increased the number of working days and the construction costs of the subject construction project, but because there was no more risk of construction site closure, the construction delays were short, and the liquidated damages were minimized. Through the method proposed in this study, it is possible to estimate construction cost and time before and after the COVID-19 pandemic; this method could be used to provide data for both owners and contractors to pro-actively recognize and respond to situations or damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data could also be used as evidence in case of future damages or disputes.

J	Niewerth, S; Vogt, P; Thewes, M				Niewerth, Stefan; Vogt, Peter; Thewes, Markus			Tender evaluation through efficiency analysis for public construction contracts	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						bid evaluation; public procurement; best value for money; data envelopment analysis; contractor selection	PROCUREMENT; SELECTION; CRITERIA	Given the European Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU, policymakers have ordered the inclusion of various criteria, such as the price, life-cycle costs, environmental, and social aspects, in the evaluation of tenders for public construction projects. Consequently, the relevance of non-monetary award criteria has gained significant value. However, the established evaluation formulas, which are used to obtain the best value for money procurement, have resulted in legal disputes. The existing evaluation formulas exhibit mathematical weaknesses, wherein scoring indices do not express economic efficiency adequately. Thus, a conflict is observed between the political requirement of non-monetary award criteria and their evaluation by contracting authorities. To overcome such dilemma, an extensive literature review is conducted. Specifically, this study explores the essential problems of existing evaluation formulas and develops a more reliable method. The technique from the field of efficiency analysis, i.e., Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is adopted in this study. For contract awarding, the DEA is extended by introducing a decision theoretical framework. For public procurement, the proposed method combines two advantages. First, the proposed method ensures the derivation of a robust tender ranking given that with respect to clients' preferences, irrelevant and insufficiently tailored tenders do not influence the scoring. Second, the proposed method supports the intention of policy makers to promote public goals, such as sustainable aspects. By disclosing the strengths and weaknesses of bidders with respect to their competitors, all bidders can obtain a precise overview of their performance regarding the award criteria. In sum, the proposed method allows a targeted improvement of certain criteria values in future tenders and consequently leads to an enhancement of public goals.

B.; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Risk impact assessments in project budget development: quantity surveyors' perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Elemental cost plan; final tender sum; New Zealand; quantity surveyor; traditional building procurement; variability	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS; ACCURACY; MANAGEMENT	One aspect of construction project budgeting requiring attention is the inaccuracy of early estimates during design development. Accuracy of estimates is important to project owners and their financiers. However, inconsistent risk information makes this difficult to achieve. Proper risk analysis could offer a partial solution by reducing the variance between design-stage elemental cost plans (ECPs) and final tender sums (FTS) of construction projects. This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between ECPs and FTS. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant during design development. Data for the study were sourced from 62 practicing quantity surveyors (QS) through an online questionnaire survey. Survey responses were analysed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk measure and Spearman's correlation. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software facilitated the analysis, and top ten risk factors were found important for practicing quantity surveyors in New Zealand (NZ). The identified risk factors were responsible for the variability observed. The values obtained from the analysis would enable greater accuracy in the forecast of FTS by quantity surveyors. As a main contribution, the study creates awareness of the risk factors that should be given considerable attention by consultants at project outset, to guard against wide variation between the design-stage ECPs and FTS. This knowledge could assist quantity surveyors to pro-actively manage their client's fund. In addition, these findings can assist in the development of a predictive model that construction industry practitioners in NZ could use for reliable estimation of FTS from the design-stage ECP.

Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was developed and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 183 professionals. The data collected were analyzed by the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings The results identified six critical factors influencing trust asymmetry behavior in construction projects. The power imbalance, information asymmetry and cognitive difference have a positive influence on both upward-trust behavior and downward-trust behavior in the construction organization, while the competence, performance capacity and relationship satisfaction have negative effects. Research limitations/implications - This paper based on the assumption that trust asymmetry behavior has a negative impact on project performance, which should be further studied. Besides, future research may carry out a comparative analysis among the trusting relationships and behavior of different participants dynamically. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, the factors influencing trust behavior in project organization have been identified for the first time. Second, a comprehensive view of trust asymmetry behavior has been theorized by SEM method. Third, the result bridges the existing gap caused by the lack of empirical evidence to understand the genetic mechanisms of trust asymmetry behavior in the construction industry.

However, little is known about the factors contributing to NVA BIM implementation practices from different stakeholders' viewpoints. This study aims to identify the leading contributors to NVA BIM implementation activities in BIM-based building project delivery in Singapore, compare perceptions among stakeholders with different roles, firm sizes, and BIM implementation experience, and propose strategies for NVA implementation activity reduction. An extensive literature review and a pilot study were conducted to determine causes. The results of a questionnaire survey, statistical analyses, and four postsurvey interviews found that all 49 causes categorized by major stakeholders were critical. Among the most influential causes were "design models do not fit for intended downstream uses" (for architect/engineers) and "design changes are expensive once fabrication has commenced" (for manufacturer/supplier). The subgroup analysis indicated that contractors, especially those of small to medium size, perceived that the leading causes related to consultancy firms' reluctance to enhance design-construction integration and consider incremental changes, whereas stakeholders without much BIM practical experience probably underestimated the difficulties of conducting value-adding BIM diffusion activities.

Evaluation of project cost and schedule performance using fuzzy theory-based polynomial function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Earned value; evaluation; fuzzy sets; forecasting; system; polynomial function; planned duration	EARNED VALUE MANAGEMENT	Earned value method (EVM) is used for cost performance forecasting. But, it has not been used for time performance forecasting. Also, the extended methods to EVM for improving the time forecasting have some limitations and deterministic evaluation. Therefore, this research introduces an integrated tool called the fuzzy project performance evaluation (FPPE) system, which is mainly depending on fuzzy theory and polynomial function to evaluate the project performance forecasting (PPF) under uncertainties. Two actual projects are provided to demonstrate the advantages of FPPE system over traditional time forecasting methods (TTFMs). The goal to use the polynomial function is to obtain the best-fit curve that simulates the planned cumulative progress curve (PCPC) of a project. The best two degrees were 11 and 10 for the two Projects A and B respectively. Then, the best-fit curve is updated in the light of new work performed percent to obtain time forecasts, which have been compared against that produced by the critical path method. Such a comparative study reveals that the best-fit provided the most accurate time forecast with the lowest mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE(a)= 0.73% and MAPE(b)= 0.41%). Then, the next step is to incorporate the best-fit procedures into the fuzzy theory to develop the FPPE system, which can be used to help the contractors through detecting early warning points of project performance deterioration and then making corrective decisions. The new integrated system FPPE has been programmed in M-file for MATLAB software and it can be applied to all kind of projects because it works depending on the three EVM curves at the summary of project level.

Design/methodology/approach - Reviewing literature and interviewing with local experts selected from the Iranian construction industry, top 58 delay factors were identified and categorized into six major groups. The interrelations among these factors were, then, modeled using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The resulting causal loop diagrams obtained from SD were used subsequently for identifying the most significant factors influencing and influenced by delay through the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The impact of factors on each other was finally determined based on the opinions of 63 experts selected from the Iranian community of consultants, contractors, and clients. Findings - According to the analysis, eight out of the 58 factors were identified as the most influencing factors on delay, and nine factors were found to be the most influenced factors by delay in the field of delay analysis. The study also concluded that factors related to labors are the most important and influential factors. In addition, factors related to client were the most influencing factors and external-related factors were the least important ones. At the end, some recommendations to reduce variation of delay in the construction projects are presented as well. Originality/value - Considering the interconnected structure of the factors, the paper identifies the most important factors interacting with time delay in construction projects.

Therefore, this paper reports on a high-performance building project that implemented a collaborative project delivery method through the examination of the following research questions: RQ1: What were the most important contractual, cultural and organisational elements studied in the collaborative project delivery method? RQ2: What were the effects of the studied elements? Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal case study approach was adopted. As for means of data collection, a document review, semi-structured interviews, and observations was conducted. A total of 20 observations (App. 80 h, 175 pages of notes) and 12 interviews (App. 20 h, 100 pages of notes) with project participants was conducted. Findings The analysis indicates that if attention is paid to task, team and individual needs through contractual, cultural and organisational elements, this will affect the development of an integrated team. Research limitations/implications We demonstrate that the effects of the elements are shown through their achievement in creating and sustaining an integrated team of inter-organisational participants working in a collaborative environment. Practical implications It provides a better understanding of how a collaborative project delivery method for the design phase emphasises team integration. We demonstrate that while the principal sets the contractual boundaries by deciding the contractual elements, the agent should be intentional in the selection and use of organizational and cultural elements. Originality/value The paper suggests that it is not enough to just have contractual elements implemented. Consequently, this insight suggests that managers should be attentive to the untapped potential that lies within organisational and cultural elements.

Social network conformity and construction work plan reliability	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social network analysis; Job site interactions; Social influence; Conformity; Construction subcontractors; Work plan reliability	LABOR FLOW RELIABILITY; FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES; PRODUCTIVITY	In a large construction project delivery is usually handled by numerous subcontractors. Work plan reliability (WPR) of subcontractors is an essential element for improving project performance. Previous research mainly focused on the consequence of the WPR variability of a subcontractor on the following subcontractors in the project task-sequence. Construction industry lacks a good understanding of the social aspect of the subcontractors' WPR. Plausibly and arguably, construction subcontractors and their interactions/relationships in a project constitute a network, conceptualized as a "social network". "Social conformity" is one of the various social influehte types that results in a change of performance/behavior in order tuft in a group. This research aims to understand how conformity plays a role in the subcontractors' performance particularly in their WPR. The objective of this paper is to develop an analytical approach to 1) demonstrate the impact of conformity on the WPR of subcontractors, and 2) identify the role of social network in conformity occurrence in a construction project. Two construction projects, each including a general contractor overseeing several subcontractors, were Studied. Findings show that deviation from norms decreases as project proceeds. It also shows that the tendency of subcontractors to follow the norms of their neighborhood (local) is higher than their willing to follow the project norm (global). The research contributes to the body of knowledge as it proposes a social network based approach for the first time to explore how the subcontractors' WPR in a construction project can be under the influence of the conformity phenomenon. Understanding the subcontractors' manner can be useful for project managers when they need to establish a long-term working relationship with a particular subcontractor, or when they need to know much effort is necessary to spend on improvement initiatives of planning reliability.

J	Hussain, S; Zhu, FW; Ali, Z				Hussain, Shahid; Zhu FangWei; Ali, Zaigham			Examining Influence of Construction Projects' Quality Factors on Client Satisfaction Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Lack of quality; Impact client satisfaction; Structural equation model; Public construction projects	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; PLS-SEM; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTORS; IMPACT; INDUSTRY; FRAMEWORK; SUCCESS; TIME	Quality and client satisfaction is a long-established focus of attention in the construction industry due to its significant role in the success or failure of a project, yet few studies have examined the impact of a lack of quality on client satisfaction in the context of public construction projects. This study, therefore, proposes that lack of quality in construction projects has a significant impact on client satisfaction using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. A conceptual model was developed for assessment of client satisfaction, and the model consisted of two main latent variables. Through the questionnaire survey, an empirical analysis was carried out to test the conceptual model. Data were collected from 484 construction experts employed in the Pakistani public construction industry. The result of the analysis found that the R2 value of the model was 0.454, which revealed that lack of quality in projects has a significant impact on client satisfaction. Based on the final form of the model, the construction-related factor (beta=0.491) has a greater influence on client satisfaction. The goodness of fit index of the conceptual model was measured to be 0.54, which revealed that the conceptual model has appropriate reliability and validity and fits the data correctly. This study adds to the body of knowledge by offering new insights and contributes toward greater understanding of lack of quality in public projects and its impact on client satisfaction, and use of applied advance statistical method, PLS-SEM, which is previously missing in the literature. The lessons from this study would be helpful for policymakers and decision makers to focus on highlighted issues and problems faced by the public construction industry worldwide.

J	Manley, K; Chen, L				Manley, Karen; Chen, Le			The impact of client characteristics on the time and cost performance of collaborative infrastructure projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Infrastructure; Cost efficiency; Collaborative projects; Client characteristics; Time efficiency	EARLY CONTRACTOR INVOLVEMENT; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; ADOPTION	Purpose - Collaboration is thought to offer significant benefits over traditional contracts, however there is little existing research concerning how these benefits can be optimized. To address this gap, a survey investigated the impact of client characteristics on the time and cost efficiency of collaborative infrastructure projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The survey of experienced senior practitioners of Australian collaborative infrastructure projects yielded 320 valid responses. Cluster analysis, one-way between group ANOVA tests and independent sample t-tests were used to confirm that three client characteristics are critical to time and cost performance: client sector (public/private); client experience with asset procurement; and client approach to price competition. Findings - Projects procured by experienced private sector clients were found to meet targeted levels of performance, regardless of their approach to team selection. Among projects procured by experienced public sector clients, groups of relatively low and high performing projects could be distinguished, regardless of their approach to team selection. Projects run by teams selected competitively on non-price criteria prior to the pricing stage exhibited significantly better performance than those run by teams that competed on the price of the project to win the work. Research limitations/implications - This study focussed only on analysis of three client characteristics. Future research may consider a broader range of contextual variables. Results are based on perceptual data rather than objective data. Practical implications - The findings show collaborative infrastructure clients in the construction sector should be less concerned about inexperience than they might have been, and more interested in single-team selection approaches than they might have been. Originality/value - The results indicate significant performance differences between client types. In particular, experienced public sector clients had more polarized performance outcomes, compared to the private sector.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative, exploratory research strategy is employed in the context of construction projects, with construction component manufacturers as the focal component suppliers. In total 22 interviews were conducted with structural engineers and architects as relevant third parties, to discover the specifics of component suppliers' third-party relationship development in construction projects. Findings - The results show the crucial role of third parties in the constructor's and customer's decision-making process, and various ways for component suppliers to develop the relationship toward the third parties. The results offer important knowledge about the cooperation between construction component suppliers and third parties and means to increase the centrality of component suppliers in the project network. Research limitations/implications - The research was delimited to structural engineers and architects as third parties in construction projects in one country. Further research is encouraged on third-party cooperation in other kinds of project networks, other kinds of third parties, and the various forms of triadic cooperation in project networks. Practical implications - The results encourage component suppliers to take a proactive approach in developing relationships with third parties, when strengthening their network position. The paper introduces practical ways in which component suppliers may take action toward generating powerful main contractor-supplier-third-party triads. Originality/value - Limited research attention has been directed at third parties and triadic cooperation in project networks. This paper offers important knowledge about the relationship between component suppliers and third parties, particularly in terms of third parties' expectations and practical initiatives to enhance the relationships.

Dynamic Quality Control of Process Resource to Improve Concrete Supply Chain	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Concrete technology; Feedforward information; Radio-frequency identification (RFID); Process resource; Supply chain; Embedded sensors; Concrete curing; Construction materials and methods	EARLY-AGE; CONSTRUCTION; TEMPERATURE; INSPECTION; MANAGEMENT	The latest literature on quality management in the construction industry asserts that it has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management's insistence on punch-list inspection creates barriers to adopting the model that fosters a culture of constant improvement embraced by total quality management (TQM). With this recognition, this research paper presents a model that extends the output-oriented process model to pursue continuous improvement along the supply chain. Extensive field observations and discussions with contractors show that the ready-mixed concrete supply and placement suffers the loss of information when concrete is delivered in truckloads and sampled for quality testing in the laboratory. Without recording the spatial boundaries of a truck volume of poured concrete, a failing quality report leads to large costs for core-drilling to find the location of the unacceptable concrete poured 28days earlier. The latter part of the paper will present the work to design and field-experiment a feedforward control method that also served as a novel electronic as-built documenter. Ruggedized radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) as the concrete flowed from the truck into the hopper of the pump. A hand-held RFID reader not only detected 14 out of the 15 embedded tags, but the tags' readability served as an indicator of the concrete's curing progress. The unique contribution of this research project can be seen in the experimental work established by the feasible evidence measured from a real-world construction context. In order to overcome the ingrained view of reactive inspection in concrete supply chains, this research offers a proposed approach whereby its workability is evaluated through first-hand examination.

Vibration is a commonly used method to make concrete flowable and to remove the excessive entrapped air, therefore contributing to proper concrete consolidation. To introduce vibrations to freshly placed concrete, various tools such as internal vibrators are widely used in the construction industry. Producing a dense concrete without segregation with these tools requires an experienced vibrator operator. Inexperienced vibrator operators tend to over-consolidate or under-consolidate concrete. Many of these quality problems have their roots in the lack of quality control methods that can provide real-time feedback on the quality of concrete consolidation to vibrator operators. A real-time wireless sensing-based internal vibrator tip tracking system was developed and validated in this research to support intelligent concrete consolidation operations. More specifically, the research explored the use of an ultra wideband (UWB) tracking system to realize precise localization of the tip of an internal vibrator. A series of indoor and outdoor experiments are conducted to validate and model the tracking accuracy. A novel visualization program was developed to visualize operators' vibration effort in real-time. The program is capable of displaying vibration location and time in real-time. A vibrator operator can leverage such information to visualize the distribution of his vibration effort, and spot areas that may need mitigation actions. This also provides an innovative construction inspection practice to owners and resident engineers. The new concrete consolidation tool will allow contractors to proactively address concrete consolidation issues, a problem common to many concrete construction projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Effectiveness of Speed Control Measures on Nighttime Construction and Maintenance Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Nighttime work-zone safety has become a concern among state transportation agencies due to an increasing number of work-zone fatalities and the high percentage of roadwork performed at night. Speed control has been determined by numerous researchers to be one of the best ways to improve safety on nighttime work zones. This paper presents an empirical analysis of speed-control strategies for nighttime interstate construction and maintenance projects in Indiana. The analysis considers the effect of various speed-control measures on the mean speed and the standard deviation of speed through nighttime work zones. Using a seemingly unrelated regression modeling approach, the present analysis revealed that the presence of police enforcement, a high percentage of semitrucks in the traffic stream, and a high traffic flow significantly reduced mean work-zone speeds. Factors found to significantly increase mean work-zone speeds included an increase in the number of open lanes, an original speed limit of the road section greater than 100 km/h (62 mi/h) an increase in the distance between the work-zone speed-limit signs and the first cone/barrel in the construction zone taper, and the progression of time through the night. The standard deviation of vehicle speeds was found to be significantly lower before midnight and as the number of vehicles queued increased. It was found to be significantly higher with an increase in the number of open lanes through the work zone, an increase in the number of worksite speed-limit signs, a high percentage of personal vehicles in the traffic, and an increase in total traffic flow. The results from this research demonstrate a useful analysis methodology (seemingly unrelated regression estimation) and provide some empirical results that can provide guidance for transportation agencies and contractors to improve speed-control strategies in nighttime work zones.

J	Glaser, SD; Tolman, A				Glaser, Steven D.; Tolman, Anne			Sense of Sensing: From Data to Informed Decisions for the Built Environment	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information management; Life cycles; Infrastructure; Performance characteristics; Project management; Sensors; Structural behavior	IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; QUALITY; MODELS; BRIDGE	There is currently an explosion of research on microsensor and wireless network technology, and methods of discerning structural state from such data. Besides the inherent interest in such fascinating technology, the question remains as to why an owner, operator, or user of the built environment should care. The construction industry is now adopting new types of contracting practice. Previously the contractor simply implemented a given design, but the current trend is for clients to commission certain performance requirements to be met with performance-based design. The emphasis of the industry is becoming the delivery of certain structural behavior states rather than simply building to a client's set plans. The contracting process becomes the determination of the performance criteria, and delivery becomes a long-term fulfillment of these criteria. This can only take place if the performance states can be measured, and the measurement utilized in a decision-making process. The tools needed for both the evaluation of the delivery after construction and during operation are changing accordingly. The process is increasingly dependent on densely spaced sensor data, valid models to turn the data into physical behavior, and decision-making tools to determine whether the performance requirements are being met. This process must take place in order to satisfy all stakeholders. This paper describes the approaches in monitoring the performance, the obtaining of data and refining into information for decision making. Example cases concern the continuous performance and condition monitoring within buildings and civil structures, and indicators of the economical impacts of informed decisions including structural safety, hygro-thermal, and energy aspects. A case study of structural health monitoring of the Golden Gate Bridge is also presented. The enabling sensor technology is described, and the exploitation of the data for life cycle needs is discussed.

J	Yu, ATW; Javed, AA; Lam, TI; Shen, GQ; Sun, M				Yu, Ann Tit Wan; Javed, Arshad Ali; Lam, Tsun Ip; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Sun, Ming			Integrating value management into sustainable construction projects in Hong Kong	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Value management; Construction; Questionnaire survey; Integrated practice	SWOT ANALYSIS; BARRIERS; PERFORMANCE; DRIVERS; SUCCESS	Purpose Integrating sustainability into the value management (VM) process can provide a strategic platform for promoting and incorporating sustainable design and development during the lifespans of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) for integrating sustainability into the VM process in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach Following an extensive literature review, 45 attributes were identified and grouped into strength, weakness, opportunity and threat elements. A questionnaire survey based on these groupings was supported by semi-structured interviews with public sector clients, value managers and VM facilitators. They shared their experience and views on how to integrate sustainability into the VM exercises. Findings The triangulated results of the survey and interviews are presented in this paper. The ranking of the SWOT analysis results indicate that VM does provide opportunities for multidisciplinary professionals and stakeholders to focus on issues relating to society and the environment, which is considered a main strength. The major weakness of integration is the lack of well-trained staff and low levels of VM participant expertise in relation to the sustainable construction issue. Research limitations/implications Current practices generally neglect integration of sustainability into the VM process due to cost and time constraints. There are ample strengths and opportunities recommended by this study for integrating sustainability into the VM process which are beneficial for the clients and contractors for achieving value for money and meeting sustainability targets. Practical implications There are immense opportunities for integrating sustainability into the VM process, including encouragement of the reduction, reuse and recycling of construction and demolition waste. However, threats presented by integration include the additional time and costs required for achieving sustainability targets. Originality/value Findings and recommendations provided in this paper should be helpful to decision makers including clients and VM facilitators for the successful integration of the sustainability concept into the VM process.

J	Zhang, YB; Wang, YS; Yao, HJ				Zhang, Yangbing; Wang, Yousong; Yao, Hongjiang			How does the embeddedness of relational behaviours in contractual relations influence inter-organisational trust in construction projects?	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Project management; Construction; Organisation; Questionnaire survey		Purpose This paper aims to explore the relationship between the embeddedness of relational behaviours in contractual relations and the development of inter-organisational trust between contracting parties in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was undertaken to collect data from 310 experienced project practitioners. Hierarchical regression and curvilinear regression were mainly used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results validated the role of relational behaviours in boosting trust expectation, with the contractual context dampening the positive effect only slightly. However, the impact of the embedded relational behaviours on trust intention was found contingent on the equality of outcome: relational behaviours make an impact on trust intention opposite to what the equality of outcome makes; the combination of relational behaviours and the equality of outcome finally has a positive impact on trust intention. As such, the relational behaviours embedded in contractual relations would help reduce particular distrust or improve trust when the outcome is perceived equal. Research limitations/implications The conclusions are derived from the Chinese cultural background and may apply to a certain geographical scope. The nonprobability sampling method also limits the generalization of some conclusions. Besides, the results may present the contractor's view better than the owner's view. Practical implications This research would help the practitioners to find a balance between relational behaviours and contractual behaviours in managing inter-organisational relationship. It would also supply effective ways for contracting parties to reduce particular distrust or cultivate particular trust in construction projects. Originality/value Previous studies have investigated the unique impact of relational behaviours and contractual behaviours on trust. However, few of them have checked how the mixture of both kinds of behaviours influences trust. This paper contributes to this knowledge by investigating how the embeddedness of relational behaviours in contractual relations influences the trust between contracting parties.

J	Gan, XL; Chang, RD; Langston, C; Wen, T				Gan, Xiao-Long; Chang, Rui-Dong; Langston, Craig; Wen, Tao			Exploring the interactions among factors impeding the diffusion of prefabricated building technologies Fuzzy cognitive maps	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Technology; Construction; Simulation; Approach	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; PRECAST CONCRETE SYSTEMS; GREEN BUILDINGS; WIND POWER; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; POLICY; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDUSTRY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the interactions of factors impacting the widespread adoption of prefabricated building technologies and the intervention strategies to facilitate the development of prefabrication based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). Design/methodology/approach Through in-depth interviews with six stakeholder groups, namely, the government, developers, designers, contractors, manufacturers and researchers, 13 critical factors were identified and used to construct stakeholder-grouped FCMs, which were further aggregated into a collective FCM. The complexity and density of the collective FCM and the centrality of factors in the FCM were examined. Subsequently, a series of "what-if" simulations of the collective FCM were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting prefabrication. Findings The results show that three factors including market demand, cost, and policies and regulations have been mentioned by all stakeholder groups. However, these factors were ranked differently by stakeholder groups, implying that different stakeholder groups perceive the barriers to prefabricated building technologies differently. FCM simulations show that strengthening policies and regulations yield the strongest overall effect stimulating prefabrication, alleviating the organizational and environmental barriers more than the technological barriers, while improving the knowledge and expertise alleviate the technological barriers more. These measures need to be accompanied by other approaches, such as reducing cost and improving quality. Originality/value Few studies aim to analyze the interactions among the barriers to prefabrication, while this study specifically investigates this issue by illustrating the complex interactions using FCMs. Few studies also aim to identify the intervention strategies promoting prefabrication based on a quantitative approach, while this study employs FCM simulations to directly simulate the effectiveness of different strategies to facilitate prefabrication in a quantitative manner.

J	Lee, S; Yu, JH				Lee, Seulki; Yu, Jungho			Comparative Study of BIM Acceptance between Korea and the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); BIM acceptance model; Structural equation modeling; Information technologies	MODEL	Substantial research has been performed on data standards and exchanges in the AEC/FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management) industry over the past several years. The growing popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily on the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project's lifecycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance the implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. BIM was accepted in the United States earlier than in Korea, and BIM users are expected to have a higher maturity and positive perception about utilizing BIM depending on a lengthier utilization period. This means that the mechanism for achieving acceptance of BIM in Korea differs from the mechanism in the United States. Therefore, Korea's BIM acceptance model was compared to that in the United States using structural equation modeling. The key components, including the BIM acceptance model, were identified through a literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and related theories and was consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on these components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, engineers, and facility managers) in Korea and the United States. A total 164 completed questionnaires were retrieved. Structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing was conducted using commercially-available software. The results from this study can serve as a foundation for research looking into the organizational context to further BIM acceptance in the construction industry. The comparison of the mechanism and subsequent results will serve as a guideline for developing an acceptance strategy that is suitable for Korea. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Lin, YC; Chang, JX; Su, YC				Lin, Yu-Cheng; Chang, Jun-Xiong; Su, Yu-Chih			DEVELOPING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING BIM TECHNOLOGY IN QUALITY INSPECTION	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM (building information modeling); information system; quality inspection; defect management	INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; PROJECTS; PDA	Defect management (DM) for quality inspection (QI) is a major strategy employed by general contractors to enhance construction management of building projects. However, there are significant issues in construction DM in standard practice that affects quality inspection, including protracted procedures, data entry redundancies, confusion, and inefficient information management. Recognition of these construction DM issues, this paper proposes a new and practical approach that applies Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology to quality inspection and defect management. Specifically, BIM digitally contains precise geometry and relevant data needed to support building structures to describe 3D object-oriented CAD. Using BIM technology, this study proposes a BIM-based Defect Management (BIMDM) system by on-site quality managers during the construction phase. The intended approach integrates web and BIM technologies in the BIMDM system to illustrate and analyze defect information at the jobsite in real time. The anticipated result is the effectively managed status and results of the corrective works performed. The BIMDM system is applied in a selected case study of a building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of defect management practice. Utilizing the BIMDM system, on-site quality managers are better able to track and manage defects with BIM models through accurate records and photos. The combined results of the study demonstrate that a BIMDM-like system can be an effective visual defect management platform when integrating BIM and web technologies. The advantage of the BIMDM system lies not only in improving defect management efficiency for on-site quality engineers and managers, but also in facilitating easy quality inspection while identifying and communicating in the 3D BIM environment. As such, authors expect that effective use of the proposed BIMDM would significantly assist on-site quality engineers and managers to systematically handle defect management work using BIM technologies in future construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach First, through a comprehensive literature review, the most critical causes of DDs were identified. The review eventuated in a list of 22 causes and 12 effects, which were categorized into six groups. Second, through the rules of system dynamics and the interactions between the causes and effects were modeled and illustrated using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). With the aid of semi-structured interviews with 20 competent experts, the resultant CLDs were also validated. Third, the opinions of 54 experts, who were chosen from the Iranian community of clients and consultants, were solicited concerning the degree of influence which each factor (causes or effects) exerts on others. Finally, the social network analysis (SNA) approach was deployed to analyze and prioritize factors based on the gathered data from experts. Findings SNA results indicated that factors such as "design firms' staff rework" and "design firms' loss of reputation" are the most central factors affecting DDs. The model results also identified that factors such as "schedule variance", "workload" and "lack of quality control and supervision during the design phase" have the highest overall impact on DDs. In the end, some recommendations to address major factors and links were also put forward. Overall, more communications between the pair of stakeholder groups and continuous learning from project experiences are believed to be the main strategies. Originality/value It is believed that this study has provided a comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms among factors, which can assist project managers of different parties (clients, contractors and consulting firms) in taking more effective actions to ameliorate the quality of design documents.

J	Elsayegh, A; El-adaway, IH				Elsayegh, Amr; El-adaway, Islam H.			Holistic Study and Analysis of Factors Affecting Collaborative Planning in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OWNER-CONTRACTOR COLLABORATION; PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; DESIGN; BIM; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; IMPLEMENTATION; VISUALIZATION; PROCUREMENT	The fragmentation of the construction industry led to the development of innovative approaches including collaborative planning, relational contracting, integrated project delivery, advancements in technology, and lean construction. Existing research focused on certain aspects of collaborative planning without providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting collaboration. To this end, the goal of this paper is to provide a holistic list of factors affecting collaborative planning in the construction industry and guiding future research needs. This study followed an interrelated research methodology. As such, the authors (1) conducted an extensive review and analysis of the literature on collaboration and collaborative planning in the construction industry within the last 30 years, (2) identified and defined the factors impacting the effectiveness of construction collaborative planning, (3) performed social network analysis (SNA) to quantify the importance and impact of each of the identified factors and verified the output using a simple analytic method, and (4) highlighted the gaps in the literature and created a roadmap for the factors that need further investigation. Consequently, this study provides substantial addition to the body of knowledge at multifacets. To this effect, the results include (1) presenting 50 factors that could collectively affect collaborative planning in construction projects; (2) indicating that future research endeavors need to investigate the understudied key factors for collaborative planning comprising vision, goal alignment and integration, early involvement of key project stakeholders, project parties relationship, and willingness for collaboration and cooperation; and (3) substantiating the need to develop models that simultaneously incorporate all 50 factors to have simulation environment that is as close as possible to reality.

Design/methodology/approach Data relating to 178 completed Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund) building construction projects were obtained from construction firms via questionnaire survey. Using 90% of the data, the model was developed in the form of a hybrid-based algorithm implemented through a suitable user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using MATLAB programming language. Bayesian model averaging, Monte Carlo simulation and fuzzy logic were the statistical methods used for the algorithm development, prior to its GUI implementation in MATLAB. Using the remaining 10% data, the model's predictive accuracy was assessed via the independent samples t-test and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Findings The developed model's predictions were found not statistically different from those of actual duration estimates in the 10% test data, with a MAPE of just 2%. This suggests that the model's ability to incorporate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties improves accuracy of duration predictions made using it. Research limitations/implications The model was developed using a particular type of building projects (TETfund building construction projects), and so its use is limited to projects with characteristics similar to those used for its development. Practical implications The developed model's predictions are expected to serve as a useful basis for consultancy firms and contractor organisations to make more realistic schedules and benchmark measures of construction period, thereby facilitating effective planning and successful execution of construction projects. Originality/value The study presented a model which permits combined manipulation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, hence ensuring a more realistic incorporation of uncertainty into construction duration predictions.

Automated planning of concrete joint layouts with 4D-BIM	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Digital engineering; Structural engineers; Integrated concrete design; Concrete scheduling; 4D BIM; Optimisation	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION SITE; 4D BIM; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; FEASIBILITY; CHALLENGES; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS	Concrete pouring represents a major critical path activity that is often affected by design limitations, structural considerations and on-site operational constraints. As such, meticulous planning is required to ensure that both the aesthetic and structural integrity of joints between cast in-situ components is achieved. Failure to adequately plan concrete pouring could lead to structural defects, construction rework or structural instability, all having major financial implications. Given the inherent complexity of large-scale construction projects, the 'manual planning' of concrete pouring is a challenging task and prone to human errors. Against this backdrop, this study developed 4D Building Information Management (BIM) approach to facilitate automated concrete joint positioning solution (as a proof of concept) for design professionals and contractors. The study first developed structural model in Revit, then extracted spatial information regarding all construction joints and linked them to dynamic Microsoft (MS) Excel and Matlab spreadsheets using integration facilitated by Dynamo software. Midspan points of each beam as well as floor perimeter information were gathered via codes developed in MS Excel macros. Based on the Excel outputs, Matlab programming was used to determine best concreating starting points and directions, and daily allowed concrete volume, considering limitations due to cold joints. These information were then pushed back to Revit via Dynamo in order to develop daily concrete scheduling. The developed automated programme framework offers a cost-effective and accurate methodology to address the limitations and inefficiencies of traditional methods of designing construction joints and planning pours. This framework extends the body of knowledge by introducing innovative solutions to integrate structural design considerations, constructional procedures and operational aspects for mitigating human error, and providing a novel, yet technically sound, basis for further application of BIM in structural engineering.

The model Work Health and Safety Regulations specify that construction works above a threshold cost of AU$250,000 are deemed to be construction projects requiring the appointment of a principal contractor with duties relating to OHS planning and coordination. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of the monetary threshold as a suitable trigger for specific OHS planning and coordination duties. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 46 Australian construction industry stakeholders, including union representatives, employer groups, construction firm representatives and regulators, as well as four international construction OHS experts, to explore perceptions about the effectiveness of the monetary threshold. Two construction scenarios were also modelled to test for variability in operation of the threshold by geographical location of works and design conditions. Findings The monetary threshold was perceived to be subject to two forms of capture problem, reflecting inadvertent capture of low risk works or failure to capture high risk works. Organisations were also reported to deliberately split contracts to avoid capture by the threshold. The cost-estimate modelling revealed inequalities and variation in the operation of the monetary threshold by geographic location and design specification. Practical implications The analysis suggests that limitations inherent in the use of a monetary threshold to trigger duties relating to OHS planning and coordination in construction works. Opportunities to use more sophisticated risk-based mechanisms are considered. Originality/value The study explores a fundamental challenge of risk-based OHS regulation, i.e., how to ensure that workers' health and safety are adequately protected without creating an unnecessarily high regulatory burden. The research provides evidence that using a monetary value as a proxy measure for OHS risk in construction projects may be problematic.

J	Jin, ZY; Gambatese, J; Liu, D; Dharmapalan, V				Jin, Ziyu; Gambatese, John; Liu, Ding; Dharmapalan, Vineeth			Using 4D BIM to assess construction risks during the design phase	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Case study; Building information modelling; Construction planning; Construction safety	SAFETY HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION MODELING BIM; PREVENTION; FRAMEWORK; CHECKING	Purpose The prevention through design (PtD) concept has been widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches to eliminate or reduce construction site hazards. It encourages engineers and architects to consider occupational safety and health during the planning and design phases. Nevertheless, the implementation of PtD is often inhibited because designers lack adequate knowledge about construction safety and the construction process, and limited design-for-safety tools and procedures are available for designers to use. The purpose of this paper is to provide designers a tool for assessing construction risks during early phases of multistory building projects at an activity level and on a daily basis in a 4D environment. By using the tool, proactive measures could be taken in the design and planning phase to reduce site hazards. Design/methodology/approach The proposed method consists of four steps including risk quantification at a design element level, 4D model integration with risk values, risk assessment, and design alternative selection and model acceptance. A case study was carried out to test and verify the proposed method. Findings The proposed tool has the capability to assess the safety risk for an entire multistory project and visualize safety risk in a particular time period, work space and task prior to construction. It benefits designers in conducting risk assessments and selecting design alternatives concerning safety. Contractors could also utilize the visualization and simulation results of the 4D model for site safety planning so that a range of risk mitigation strategies could be implemented during construction. Originality/value The study provides an innovative PtD tool targeting designers as primary end-users. The proposed tool helps designers assess construction risks and has potential to incorporate the top levels of the hierarchy of risk controls.

J	Scheepbouwer, E; Gransberg, DD; del Puerto, CL				Scheepbouwer, Eric; Gransberg, Douglas D.; del Puerto, Carla Lopez			Construction engineering management culture shift: Is the lowest tender offer dead?	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Review						cost certainty; lowest responsible bid; best value; public procurement; construction engineering management culture	DESIGN; PROJECTS; SELECTION	The procurement of public construction projects must walk a fine line between the corruption of state officials and collusion of contractors. The method of awarding projects to the lowest responsible tenderer was originally implemented to guard against corruption of state officials. However, an investigation of the construction industry in the Canadian province of Quebec showed that lowest-tender-offer procurement gave rise to collusion of companies tendering for the contracts. Alternatively, bestvalue procurement has been used for decades, but here problems arise owing to the necessity of subjective judging of measures other than price to compare bids, giving rise to time- and money-consuming protests. The paper proposes a compelling argument that the construction engineering management (CEM) culture should refocus its efforts on enhancing project cost certainty rather than merely searching for means to design a project in a manner that produces the lowest initial cost, and awards the construction to the lowest tender offer that focuses on cost savings during the project development and delivery process. The difference in the two approaches is subtle but extremely important. To make the transition, the engineering management tools must be advanced to the next level. This means that all project control tools for managing cost, schedule, and technical scope must be transformed from working in the deterministic mode to the stochastic mode, thus making the probability of completing the project within or below its official budget the primary decision criterion. To do so, CEMs must accept that there is a benefit in paying more for an alternative that increases cost certainty for the entire project. The authors of this paper hope that it will provide the grist for a more general dialog across all industry sectors where engineering management is practiced.

A Hybrid Cross-Impact Approach to Predicting Cost Variance of Project Delivery Decisions for Highways	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cross-impact analysis; Project delivery selection; Factor analysis; Monte Carlo simulation	CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; MATRIX; DESIGN	Cross-impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that is designed to predict future events by capturing the interactions among variables. It is an appropriate tool to deal with the selection of a project delivery method. Project delivery selection involves the assessment of tradeoffs between numerous risks and uncertainties, complex relationships among variables, and multiple decision alternatives. In fact, the number of variables involved in project delivery decisions creates CIA models that are extremely complex, and few researchers have attempted to apply them. This paper presents a hybrid CIA approach to project delivery decisions in highway design and construction. It provides for the evaluation of project cost with projects in three fundamental delivery methods: design-bid-build (DBB), design-build (DB), and construction manager/general contractor (CMGC). The paper discusses in detail how the cross-impact concepts support the selection of an appropriate delivery method in highway projects. The hybrid CIA approach integrates the results from the factor analysis of 31 delivery risk factors, which were evaluated by 137 practitioners, to determine the interaction between variables in the cross-impact matrix. These data allowed the researchers to reduce the number of required judgments in the CIA model approximately from more than 3,000 to fewer than 300. A case project from the Florida Department of Transportation demonstrates the approach. The hybrid CIA approach provides a defensible and repeatable process for highway agencies to quantitatively select an appropriate delivery method for their projects. More fundamentally, the findings from this paper contribute to theory by providing a new method to apply the CIA technique. It is expected that researchers can use this hybrid CIA approach for other areas in construction engineering and management research. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Application of Data Mining Techniques to Quantify the Relative Influence of Design and Installation Characteristics on Labor Productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction productivity; Classification and regression tree; Mechanical piping; Measurement; Labor and personnel issues		The factors affecting productivity have classically been categorized as those related to the work environment and the work to be done, resulting in a piecewise understanding of productivity. In general, the factors among these categories have been considered as influencing the work environment in a mutually exclusive manner. Current industry practices of labor productivity are derived from unitized measures of piping installation under various design parameters. The heterogeneous nature of mechanical piping and plumbing projects introduce a system of installation factors that warrants simplification. This paper presents a methodological approach to develop a practical data collection metric for productivity based on established industry factors of influence. This method is developed to capture the systematic and integrative behaviors of complex piping installation factors in a simple master code structure. Although the methods applied in the paper are used to develop a productivity metric for mechanical piping, the methods could be applied to develop productivity metrics for other systems using relevant data sources. Accordingly, the paper also presents a productivity metric based on the Mechanical Contractors Association of America estimating data sources. A data mining technique utilizing a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is used to expose the most influential factors of piping installation on industry recognized standards of estimated labor rates without conceptual bias or industry prejudice. The optimization of progressive CART cases based on three sources of mechanical piping and plumbing estimating data results in post hoc perspectives of productivity factors that are systematically delineated and integrated across their categorical, ordinal, and scalar natures. In each case, the method provides a statistically sound and reproducible result in the form of plausible data collection metric to represent a simple industry-level coding structure capable of quantifying productivity inputs and outputs uniformly across heterogeneous piping scopes.

J	Bowles, G; Morgan, J				Bowles, Graeme; Morgan, James			An evaluation of the performance of a large scale collaborative procurement initiative in the social housing sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Financial performance; Collaboration; Partnering; Social housing; Procurement efficiency		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors relating to the implementation of a new procurement initiative that affect performance and value for money (VFM). The study is based on a four-year research project carried out on behalf of the Scottish Government to monitor and evaluate the performance and efficiency of a bulk procurement vehicle for social housing. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers had a brief to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the procurement process and its influence on cost and efficiency targets. The study employed a mixed method approach with annual rounds of qualitative and quantitative data collection from project stakeholders including the contractors, consultants, clients and sponsor. Confidential semi-structured interviews were conducted on conclusion of the project to gauge views on how well the procurement process worked from the various perspectives and to reflect on the influence of the process on VFM. Findings - The procurement programme failed to achieve the capital cost and efficiency savings targets quantified at the outset and on this measure alone VFM was not demonstrated, although there were a number of reported benefits. A major factor was the extent of process and behavioural change required from the project team and, although a procurement consultant was engaged to facilitate this, the theoretical benefits of "best practice" were not realized. The picture was further complicated by rapidly changing economic conditions experienced, and debate about the robustness of original cost savings targets. Research limitations/implications - The findings and conclusions are of relevance and interest to clients and construction organisations undergoing change through adopting novel procurement processes. Originality/value - The empirical nature of the study provides a comprehensive evidence base for the performance of a collaborative procurement programme and an understanding of the potential difficulties in attaining the theoretical benefits of procurement innovation.

J	Song, XL; Xu, JP; Shen, C; Pena-Mora, F				Song, Xiaoling; Xu, Jiuping; Shen, Charles; Pena-Mora, Feniosky			Conflict resolution-motivated strategy towards integrated construction site layout and material logistics planning: A bi-stakeholder perspective	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Bi-stakeholder decision conflict; Site layout; Material logistics plan; Bi-level model; Bi-PSO	FUZZY RANDOM-VARIABLES; TEMPORARY FACILITIES; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; MODEL; ALLOCATION; INVENTORY; GIS	Efficiency of construction site layout planning (CSLP) and construction material logistics planning (CMLP) is of great significance for a successful project control. Despite considerable research undertaken to separately optimize the site layout plan or material logistics plan, the interdependencies and decision conflicts of the layout planner and the logistics planner are neglected in the construction planning and design phase. The ignorance of the decision conflicts and interdependencies can lead to an overrun cost, a delayed project or a worse quality. This research proposes a decentralized methodology based on a bi-level model and a Bi-PSO algorithm, enabling the layout planner and the logistics planner to optimize the CSLP and the CMLP in an integrated model. Fuzzy random parameters are utilized to deal with uncertainty in the data collection process. By utilizing the methodology, the stakeholders are capable of adjusting the respective decisions based on the changes of others. By iteratively adjusting the CSLP and CMLP solutions, the CSLP-CMLP decision conflicts are dealt with, accordingly, the bi-stakeholder conflict resolution-motivated CSLP-CMLP strategy is planned. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, a real case study is conducted to optimize CSLP and CMLP simultaneously. The significance of optimizing an integrated CSLP-CMLP for the layout planner, the logistics planner and the general contractor is also justified. The contributions of this research include the capability of modeling the decision conflicts in a bi-level model, the ability of generating an integrated CSLP-CMLP solution and the practicality of guiding academic researchers and practitioners to optimize construction management from a global viewpoint. The research can be extended to other fields to explore the effects of decentralized decision making on other bi-stakeholder conflict resolution cases.

Arguably, competition in the international construction market has shifted to these knowledge-intensive CPS areas. Yet CPSs represent a research frontier that has received scant attention. This research aims to enrich the body of knowledge on CPSs by examining strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of Chinese CPSs (CCPSs) in the international context. It does so by triangulating theories with quantitative and qualitative data gleaned from yearbooks, annual reports, interviews, seminars, and interactions with managers in major CCPS companies. It is found that CCPSs present both strengths and weaknesses in talents, administration systems, and development strategies in dealing with the external opportunities and threats brought about by globalization and market evolution. Low price, which has helped the Chinese construction business to succeed in the international market, is also a major CCPS strength. An opportunity for CCPSs is the relatively strong delivery capability possessed by Chinese contractors; by partnering with them CCPSs can better establish themselves in the international arena. This is probably the first ever comprehensive study on the performance of CCPSs in the international marketplace. The research is conducted at an opportune time, particularly when the world is witnessing the burgeoning force of Chinese businesses in many areas including manufacturing, construction, and, potentially, professional services. It adds new insights to the knowledge body of CPSs and provides valuable references to other countries faced with the challenge of developing CPS business efficiently in the international market.

Construction delays in Hong Kong civil engineering projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction delays are common in civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, inevitably resulting in contractual claims and increased project cost. This study was aimed, first, at gathering the perceptions of civil construction practitioners on how significant are the causes of delay; and, second, investigating whether the suggestions as stated in the report of the Construction Industry Review Committee (the Committee comprises members with good standing and knowledge in the construction and related fields as well as those from other professions who are responsible for examining the current state of the construction industry in terms of its output quantity, the quality of work, its environmental friendliness, site safety, its workforce and the system of supervision) are applicable to and effective at mitigating the corresponding delays with reference to a ranking order established using the mean score method. The extent of the differences in perception among the different respondent groups on these two issues was also examined using the rank agreement factor (RAF), percentage agreement (PA), and percentage disagreement (PD). The differences in the perceptions of the respondents on the significance of delays and the actual causes of delays for the six projects studied were also examined. The results of the study showed that the respondents tended to admit their own faults as shown in the top ten significant causes of delay. A strong consensus was found between the client and consultant groups on the significance of the various causes of delay (PA=74%) and the effectiveness of mitigation measures (PA=67%) compared with the other pairs of groups. The consultant and contractor groups held extremely different perceptions regarding the significance of various delay causes (RAF=4.9 and PD=32%) and the effectiveness of corresponding mitigation measures (RAF=6.2 and PD=47%). It is believed that the findings can provide much more insight for the construction practitioners as well as the researchers and thus help to improve the productivity and overall performance of civil construction projects in Hong Kong.

J	Zhu, LY; Cheung, SO; Gao, XL; Li, Q; Liu, G				Zhu, Liuying; Cheung, Sai On; Gao, Xinglin; Li, Qian; Liu, Gang			Success DNA of a Record-Breaking Megaproject	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project; Project control; Incentivization	INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; INCENTIVE MECHANISMS; AGENCY-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTS; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MODEL	After 8 years of construction, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) came into use in October 2018. The HZMB is currently the world's longest oversea bridge. The HZMB is technically demanding for both the physical conditions and the stringent environmental protection measures. In addition, the involvement of three regional governments gave rise to complex coordination and communication issues. All these challenges called for supereffective project management. Notwithstanding, notable accomplishments were reported and more than 450 patents were obtained. For example, the rapid island formation technology used greatly shortened the construction period and saved cost. The project can be identified as a showcase of the latest oversea bridge construction technology. To unveil the success DNA of this record-breaking megaproject, an in-depth case study was conducted. While many reported case studies on the HZMB project have focused on the technical aspects, this case study takes a project management perspective. Through structured interviews, the HZMB project team members commented that the project reputation evaluation system (PRES) used in the project incentivized the contractors' performance through building an interorganizational relationship (IOR). This observation is in line with the proposition advocated in the IOR literature-an enhanced relationship has a positive effect on project performance. The comment of the project team member is further supported by the analyses of 28 sets of quarterly PRES evaluation scores that are reflective of IOR determinants. This study concludes that: (1) the PRES is an instrumental project management tool, and (2) one of the functions of the PRES is building IOR. The theoretical framework and empirical evidence showcase exemplary project management. Accordingly, it is further recommended that for megaprojects: (1) monetary reward cannot be the singular performance motivator, (2) IOR maintenance should be one of the planning foci of incentivization, and (3) there is no substitute for seamless communication in project management.

Enhancing the Knowledge of Construction Business Failure: A Social Network Analysis Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DEFAULT PREDICTION MODEL; CONTRACTOR DEFAULT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE FAILURE; DEA-DA; FIRMS; COMPANIES; INSOLVENCY; CENTRALITY; PROJECTS	The failure of construction companies is quite crucial because it results in unfinished projects and responsibilities that in turn result in many losses to governments, economies, owners, creditors, and surety companies. Previous research on the prediction of construction business failure utilized insolvency causes that were either arbitrary or based on the availability of data. Many scholars have shown the absence of, and need for, a holistic framework for the identification of the causes of construction business failure. As such, this paper reviews previous literature incorporating construction business failure applications, with the objective of identifying existing knowledge, current gaps, and needed future research directions on the different failure factors in a comprehensive approach. To this end, the authors (1) performed a meta-analysis of previous research work for a 30-year period spanning from 1988 to 2018; (2) identified and defined failure factors that impact the business operations of construction firms; and (3) utilized social network analysis to quantitatively identify the overlooked and missing construction business failure factors. Research results indicate that there are 20 factors that could collectively contribute to business failures of construction firms. It is also shown that there is a dire need for future research to better explore the impacts of some understudied critical factors, including the effect of inadequate company organizational structure and human capital on construction business failure. Another important finding is the absence of models that include a holistic incorporation of all 20 construction business failure factors. The findings herein are a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on construction business failure because they integrate the outcomes of previous works and use them to provide robust foundations for knowledge advancement. The presented guidelines are believed to close areas where an abundance of research work occurs and to unveil areas where additional research is necessary.

J	Li, KY; Cheung, SO				Li, Keyao; Cheung, Sai On			Unveiling Cognitive Biases in Construction Project Dispute Resolution through the Lenses of Third-Party Neutrals	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cognitive biases; Construction project dispute resolution; Third-party neutrals; Minimizing measures	PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; DECISION-MAKING; JUDGMENT; MODEL; ACCESSIBILITY; INFORMATION; CONTRACTOR; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT	Cognitive biases would jeopardize the quality of decisions, yet people are reluctant to admit to being affected. This study explores the types of cognitive bias that may have influences on construction project dispute resolution (CPDR) decisions. Effects of cognitive biases are first operationalized as biased behaviors. Third-party neutrals, including arbitrators, adjudicators, and mediators, were asked to report their observations of disputing parties' biased practices. The use of third-party neutrals aims to improve the objectivity of the data on disputing parties' biased behaviors. Principal component factor analysis (PCFA) on the collected responses suggested four types of cognitive bias: preconception, self-affirmation, optimism, and interest-oriented biases. Among these, interest-oriented bias was found to be the most prominent. This study contributes to CPDR management by proposing bias-minimizing measures. Fuzzy-set linguistic evaluations were employed to assess the usefulness of the measures in view of the nondiscrete nature of the assessments. The findings were further validated through semistructured interviews with experienced dispute management experts. The contributions of the study include: (1) raising the awareness of the potential types of cognitive bias that would affect decisions in CPDR, (2) enhancing the role of third-party neutrals in directing disputing parties away from influences of biases, (3) reminding disputing parties not to undervalue the proposals of the counterparts, and (4) improving dispute management by suggesting a review of all options available at each round of dispute negotiation. Having experienced third-party neutrals as respondents is also a major breakthrough in the study of behaviors of disputing parties. The findings are invaluable to construction professional communities in general and to disputing parties and third-party neutrals in particular.

Using Last Planner and a Risk Assessment Matrix to Reduce Variation in Mechanical Related Construction Tasks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Variation; Labor productivity; Construction; Risk; Last planner		Variation, defined for this research as the time difference between what was planned and what actually happened, is important as it can affect the productivity performance of construction tasks. The construction process is complex and consists of a large number of interdependent tasks. When the starting time and/or duration of one task varies, it can affect other downstream tasks and result in disruptions to the schedule and/or decreased productivity. This research examined the effect of using a risk assessment matrix in conjunction with the Last Planner System (LPS) method to reduce and/or eliminate task duration variation. A case study was conducted involving a mechanical contractor who specializes in plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The company compared the performance of two separate, but similar projects. The LPS method was used with one of the projects and the company's traditional planning system was used with the other (i.e., not using the LPS system). A total of 16 weeks' worth of data was collected for each project. Variation, productivity, and cost savings were analyzed using a risk assessment matrix and benefit-cost procedures. The project that used the LPS method had a 35% higher productivity performance than the traditionally planned project and resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 13:1. The research findings fill a gap in the body of knowledge by analyzing how planning can reduce variation with real project data. The results of this research illustrate the effect the LPS method can have on reducing variation and improving project productivity performance. The findings also serve as an example of an effective planning strategy for project managers and field managers in their efforts to improve project performance.

J	Liu, HX; Kwigizile, V; Huang, WC				Liu, Hexu; Kwigizile, Valerian; Huang, Wei-Chiao			Holistic Framework for Highway Construction Cost Index Development Based on Inconsistent Pay Items	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Highway construction; Cost estimating; Price index; Construction market condition; Data analytic; Inconsistent pay items; Unbalanced bid prices		A construction cost index (CCI) measures the price changes of construction items over time. It allows owner agencies and contractors to monitor construction market fluctuations so that they can more accurately estimate construction costs and project long-term funding needs. However, various CCI calculation methods in the highway construction industry are limited in two respects: (1) inability to account for inconsistent pay items, primarily caused by changes in pay item catalogs, and (2) insufficiency in statistically cleaning pay item data, e.g., unbalanced bid prices. For this reason, the resulting highway construction cost index (HCCI) cannot accurately reflect the construction market. To address such limitations, this research develops a three-step holistic framework for automated HCCI development using inconsistent pay items. The three-step methodology encompasses (1) data cleaning, where a text analysis algorithm and outlier detection algorithms are developed to clean inconsistent pay items and unbalanced bid prices; (2) pay item sampling, which helps to select and edit pay items through various statistical analysis; and (3) HCCI calculation, where the chained Fisher index formula is applied to calculate HCCIs at the state level, as well as indexes for specific regions and item categories. A prototype application is developed to generate quarterly and annual HCCIs automatically using the Python programming language. Ten-year data, i.e., 251,033 records, were used to verify and validate the prototyped system. The resulting HCCI and sub-HCCIs provide reliable insights into construction market conditions with high granularity. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by offering a holistic framework for automated HCCI development that leverages the text analysis algorithm for accounting for inconsistent pay items and two-stage outlier treatments for cleaning pay item data.

J	Jabri, A; Zayed, T				Jabri, Ahmad; Zayed, Tarek			Agent-based modeling and simulation of earthmoving operations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Agent-based modeling; Agent-based simulation; Multi-agent systems; Earthmoving planning; Earthmoving productivity	CONSTRUCTION	Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) models are constructed from sequential duration-based activities. DES is used in modeling several construction operations including earthmoving. Current earthmoving models cannot accommodate equipment units with different specifications performing the same task. In addition, activity durations are calculated based on primitive methods such as interpolating existing durations of similar activities in previous projects. Finally, model elements behave in a predetermined manner, ignoring special operational real-life scenarios that occur due to resource constraints. These limitations often lead to inaccuracies in calculating productivity and equipment utilization. This paper applies Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) as an effective bottom-up tool to modeling earthmoving operations. An Agent-Based (AB) earthmoving model consisting of smart, adaptive agents is developed. Each agent is assigned a state chart and a set of static and dynamic properties (attributes and variables) to direct its interactions with the environment and with other agents. This framework proves how modeling earthmoving from the agent's prospective and basing agents' interactions on their properties allow for modeling equipment units with different specifications performing the same task (e.g. trucks of different capacities), as well as for an accurate representation of activity durations, resource handling and resource constraint scenarios. A Java-based application named Agent-Based Simulator for Earthmoving Operations (ABSEMO) is developed as an implementation of the proposed model. ABSEMO will be helpful to contractors in planning earthmoving operations according to the AB approach. A real-life case study of a riverbed excavation in a dam construction project is simulated using ABSEMO, and the results are compared with those obtained from existing simulation models to verify ABSEMO's logic. A percentage difference of 0.42% from the existing results is obtained, indicating that the model's flow of resources is indeed accurate.

Construction Projects Bid or Not Bid Approach Using the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity FTOPSIS Method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set; Project selection; Multiple attribute decision making; Fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method; Contracting		This paper discusses selection of construction projects based on multiple criteria using a quantitative fuzzy-set method, which considers multiple attributes in a decision-making process involving a group of decision makers. This approach implements a modified fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to help decision makers rank projects based on various attributes. A triangular fuzzy set models linguistic terms used to provide subjective judgment related to decision makers' experience level, attribute weight assessment, and attribute rating. The fuzzy TOPSIS method is extended in this research to capture various levels of experience for decision makers involved in a decision to select a construction project. An illustrative example of project selection using the proposed method is provided to demonstrate its effectiveness. The computational results of this research provide project stakeholders with a computer model that could be implemented to assist in the construction project bid or not bid decision and provide a ranking of different projects to bid on. Furthermore, the results of this study show that the proposed method is suitable for modeling the uncertainty associated with project selection. The bid/no bid project selection model presented in this study is based on a set of common attributes; the selection of attributes that contribute toward the project bid or not bid decision can be different based on construction project conditions. The proposed method is suitable for construction type projects, but the methodology used in the study can be implemented for any type of project and is not limited to a specific geographic area. The proposed computer model is limited to handling input from up to 10 decision makers with varying degrees of experience. Another limitation of the computer model introduced in this study is that contractors can consider up to five different projects for bid purposes.	[Al-Humaidi, H.

This paper proposes a knowledge-based risk mapping tool for systematically assessing risk-related variables that may lead to cost overrun in international markets. The tool uses an ontology that relates risk and vulnerability to cost overrun [1] and a novel risk-vulnerability assessment methodology [2] to estimate potential risk paths that may emerge in international construction projects. The tool has been developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, a construction management company that gives risk management consultancy services to Turkish contractors working in international markets. The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool. As the reliability and usability of the tool significantly depend on the subjective evaluations of users about level of vulnerability and magnitude of potential risk events, a lessons learned database has been incorporated into the tool so that decision-makers may refer to risk event histories of previous projects to make estimations about forthcoming projects. In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool. Although the usability and reliability test results are satisfactory, the tool should be seen as an initial platform which should be improved by increasing its "intelligence" by high quality and enough number of risk event histories, and also customized according to user preferences as well as company policies.

J	Tuuli, MM				Tuuli, Martin Morgan			What has project characteristics got to do with the empowerment of individuals, teams and organisations?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Psychological empowerment; Empowerment climate; Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM); Project characteristics; Project-level antecedents	PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT; STATISTICAL PROCEDURES; EMPIRICAL-TEST; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; MULTILEVEL; JOB; INTERDEPENDENCE; CONSEQUENCES; IMPACT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of project settings on empowerment experiences of individuals and teams by examining the effects of specific project characteristics on facets of the empowerment concept (i.e. the structural and psychological perspectives). Design/methodology/approach A parallel questionnaire survey of client, consultant and contractor organisations was conducted in Hong Kong to test hypotheses relating three facets of the empowerment concept and five project-level antecedents. Hierarchical linear modelling and ordinary least square regression were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings The analyses show that dynamic project environments, high project team integration and high interdependence of project tasks lead to high individual psychological empowerment, while public-client projects (compared with private-client projects), a hostile project environment and high client integration lead to a low individual psychological empowerment. Uncertainty in project technology also leads to high team psychological empowerment, while hostile project environments lead to low team psychological empowerment. Further, dynamic project environments lead to more empowering work climate, while hostile project environments lead to less empowering work climate. However, project team integration, project complexity, project lifecycle and quasi-public-client projects (compared with private-client projects) have no significant association with the empowerment of individuals and teams. Originality/value This study examined task-related factors (i.e. project in this case) which traditionally have not been the focus of studies examining the antecedents of empowerment. Further, project-level antecedents and their link to an integrated perspective of empowerment comprising a sociostructural perspective, a psychological perspective and a team-based perspective are examined, which is a significant departure from the unitary perspective of empowerment taken in most previous studies.

J	Kim, H; Stump, A; Kim, W				Kim, Hyunjoo; Stump, Annette; Kim, Wooyoung			Analysis of an energy efficient building design through data mining approach	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Energy simulation; Data mining; Classification; Factor selection; Energy design process		Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable green design features into new/existing buildings has become a top priority in recent years for building owners, designers, contractors, and facility managers. This paper intends to address why delivery of an energy efficient building is not just the result of applying one or more isolated technologies. Rather, it can best be obtained using an integrated whole building process throughout the entire project development process, which leads building designers to generate a large amount of data during energy simulations. The authors observed that even a simple energy modeling run generated pages of data with many different variables. The volumes of energy modeling data clearly overwhelm traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with so many factors to be considered. An integrated or whole building design process involves studies of the energy-related impacts and interactions of all building components, including the building location, envelope (walls, windows, doors, and roof), heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, controls, and equipment, which shows why it is so difficult to find the correlation between different systems. The objective of this research is to develop an energy efficient building design process using data mining technology which can help project teams discover important patterns to improve the building design. This paper utilizes the data mining technology to extract interrelationships and patterns of interest from a large dataset Case study revealed that data mining based energy modeling help project teams discover useful patterns to improve the energy efficiency of building design during the design phase. The method developed during this research could be used to guide designers and engineers through the process of completing an early design energy analysis based on energy simulation models.

However, many organizations still struggle to apply Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques to assess and reliably control their project outcomes. This work investigated the state of practice of EVMS. This paper identifies challenges facing practitioners, critical EVMS subprocesses, and key EVMS environment factors, based on a large survey of 294 expert respondents. Sample respondents had project management experience of greater than 20 years on average, and represented a diverse set of projects and industries (e.g., capital projects, aerospace, defense, energy, and others). The responses from this survey helped craft an agreed-upon set of definitions for EVM, EVMS, EVMS maturity, and EVMS environment that are all provided in this paper. Moreover, out of 10 total EVMS subprocesses, planning and scheduling was ranked as the subprocess with the greatest impact on EVMS, by far. When ranking the top factors that impact the EVMS environment, the following factors rose to the top: organizational culture; efficient EVMS development process; leadership's past EVMS experience; effective and accountable leadership; and quality and level of data available. Moreover, leadership attitude toward EVMS was found to be the most critical EVMS challenge, by a wide margin. Comparing different perspectives, the data showed that project/program owners consider EVM implementation costs to be a major challenge, while contractors and consultants consider adequate calendar time needed for preparing EVMS to be a critical EVMS environment factor. Overall, this paper contributes to the engineering management body of knowledge by identifying the most important subprocesses and factors of a high-performing EVMS applied to a diverse array of complex projects and programs (e.g., aerospace, defense, construction, software, etc.) and uncovering corresponding key challenges.

Defining relational contracting from the Wittgenstein family-resemblance philosophy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Relational contracting; Family-resemblance; Ludwig Wittgenstein; Sunflower Model		There has been an increasing interest in the concept of relational contracting (RC) in construction starting from the late 1990s. RC embraces and underpins different forms of collaborative approaches, including partnering, alliancing, joint venture and other collaborative working arrangements and better risk sharing mechanisms. By applying Nystrom's and Yeung et al.'s similar approaches to define construction partnering and construction alliancing respectively, this paper focuses on RC and family-resemblance. A significant contribution to new knowledge is believed to have been made in providing a concise and comprehensive approach in defining the similar and yet different key components of RC by using a Sunflower Model. The development of this innovative Model is based on the German philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein's family-resemblance philosophy. His idea is that a complex concept can be understood as a network of overlapping similarities. Based on the reported literature, it is concluded that there are always five core elements included in construction RC. They are "commitment", "trust", "cooperation and communication", "common goals and objective", and "win-win philosophy". In addition to these core elements, a number of different non-core elements, or called petals, can be added to constitute a specific variant of RC in construction. The contribution can be of paramount importance to both the research community and the construction industry. By using this innovative theoretical framework to define construction RC, industrial practitioners may find the Sunflower Model useful in the procurement of a construction RC project. The Sunflower Model can be applied to explain the underlying concepts and as a common starting point for discussions between a client and a contractor on how to procure a RC project, thus avoiding any misinterpretations of what a RC project is.

Data-Driven Predictive Modeling of Highway Construction Cost Items	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data-driven predictive modeling; Construction cost; Highway construction; Cost forecast; Regression analysis; Machine learning	PROJECTS; ERROR	The highway network is an economically necessary form of transportation that has a significant impact on the quality of the life of the citizens who use it. Cost overruns in highway projects have been a universal occurrence that jeopardize the development, maintenance, and expansion of this vital infrastructure. Incorrect cost estimations can drive decision makers to pass ineffective policies that have played a large role in the cost overruns of transportation construction projects. The existing prediction models in the literature are limited in one or multiple areas of modeling approach, inputs, and model development robustness. In this research, a model was developed to accurately predict the total construction cost of highway projects by utilizing machine learning algorithms. This study developed a modeling pipeline to automate much of the cost forecasting process, reducing the amount of manual work and dependence on skilled data scientists. This study used the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT's) critical highway construction cost items between 2001 and 2017 to test the model. The highways of Florida were selected for testing due to the states' population growth, high immigrant population, logistics, and hurricane frequency. This study used a pool of five categories of independent variables (69 variables total), including the construction market, energy market, socioeconomics, US economy, and temporal variables, which were compiled from relevant sources and existing literature. The results revealed that our linear model exhibits superiority in generalization and prediction of cost items over nonlinear models and is capable of accurately forecasting highway construction costs. Our suggested approach in this study also provides more accurate forecasts for the detailed cost estimation by considering the monthly historical information for the average 92.6% of the six highway construction types mentioned with a 92.51% prediction accuracy. By employing our developed model, local governments, network operators, contractors, and logistics sectors would be capable of a more exact prediction of highway construction costs.

J	Olatunji, OA				Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred			Causations of failure in megaprojects: A case study of the Ajaokuta Steel Plant project	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						industrial projects; megaprojects; Nigeria; project organizational theories; steel plant	COST OVERRUNS; CHAOS THEORY; UNCERTAINTY; IRON; PERCEPTION; MODEL	This paper uses project organizational theories to draw lessons from a historic megaproject, the Ajaokuta Steel Plant (ASP). Archival reports on the ASP were explored to identify the unique attributes of the project; the political wrangling that underplayed its evolution, its economic significance and organizational impacts. Findings suggest the goals of the ASP project were, and still are, unambiguous. Failure occurred as socio-political forces aggravated the project's complex milestones. Stakeholders were impatient with pre-project investigations. During planning, owners ignored opinions that were contrary to their expectations. While delays lingered, pressures from the global economy weakened the project's motivation to succeed. These combined to turn the project's outcomes into a chaotic situation that triggered dire implications. Despite about 1400% overrun in cost, the success achieved on the plant was 28% at commissioning. Contractors remained on site until eight years after commissioning. Six key elements of the 482 items in the ASP project contract were not delivered nearly 40 years on. A simplistic look at these suggests poor planning is the main problem. However, planning issues is not entirely strange in greenfield projects. The paper draws strength from project organization theories to explain what was poor about the planning. Socrates' generic management theory was used to explain the role of leadership in the failure of the ASP project. McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y explain the significance of stakeholders' integration in megaprojects. Systems and chaos theories were used to explain the sensitivity of the ASP project to uncertainties. Narratives on these combine well to inspire stakeholders of megaprojects on where and how to seek courage in making effective plans that can help achieve success in complex projects. While normative literature only recognizes project success in a definitive perspective, this study provides insights from failure as an instrument to trigger sublime reflections.

SSP is coined from the integration of digital technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate sustainability practices. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a quantitative research design approach using empirical questionnaire surveys to solicit the opinions of 69 and 97 construction practitioners in Nigeria and Hong Kong. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to identify the potential survey respondents. The fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique was used to develop the PEMs. Findings The findings revealed that adequate technical expertise of the SSP processes is critical in enhancing its implementation in Hong Kong and Nigeria; as well as the provision of training programs for specialists in smart and sustainable initiatives. Meanwhile, the study's findings advocated that for an SSP-enabled construction project, its project performance is mainly influenced by the client's satisfaction level and the early involvement of the project teams. Research limitations/implications The study's results are limited to the Nigeria and Hong Kong construction industries. Practical implications Construction stakeholders such as the clients, developers, contractors can utilize the PEMs to determine and track SSP initiatives implementation in building projects in a reliable and practical way. Originality/value No tool has been developed for evaluating SSP initiatives at the project level in the construction industry. Using case studies of Hong Kong and Nigeria, PEM indices were developed to measure and track SSP implementation in construction projects.	[Olawumi, Timothy O.; Chan, Daniel W.

Design/methodology/approach To achieve the aim and provide recommendations to avoid project COs, 48 selected journal articles were reviewed and assessed with regard to the countries, institutions and researchers that have contributed to the subject. Findings The review of the articles shows that the subject has attracted a considerable attention from the researchers worldwide. However, the problem mainly occurred in developing countries and the researchers drew the attention on the resource-related, economic/financial as well as political problems. While 79 causes of COs were identified, the top ten causes of project COs, which have received the highest number of citations by the reviewed articles, were presented and discussed. These causes are: design problems and incomplete design, inaccurate estimation, poor planning, weather, poor communication, stakeholder's skill, experience and competence, financial problems/poor financial management, price fluctuations, contract management issues and ground/soil conditions. Research limitations/implications The study findings have several implications, which are not only for the academic world, but also for the construction front line. For scholars, the study provides a list of project COs that the researchers in the area could benefit for their future studies. The industry practitioners could find ways to improve project cost performance by giving attention to the causative factors that are significantly affecting construction projects and investing their resources and efforts towards the most occurred ones. Originality/value Thus, this study provides insight into the research output on the subject and a checklist of COs, which is believed to provide a better understanding of significant areas requiring attention where steps should be taken to minimize or control factors causing COs in construction projects.

J	Chen, L; Manley, K; Lewis, J; Helfer, F; Widen, K				Chen, Le; Manley, Karen; Lewis, Joanne; Helfer, Fernanda; Widen, Kristian			Procurement and Governance Choices for Collaborative Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Procurement; Infrastructure; Australia; Relational governance; Project alliance; Partnering; Integrated project delivery; Early contractor involvement	PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; INNOVATION	Collaborative approaches to infrastructure procurement are increasingly popular around the world due to their potential to provide improved project performance compared with more traditional approaches. The problem is that project outcomes continue to be unpredictable. Previous research has shown that this is the case regardless of whether the chosen procurement approach is based on price or nonprice selection of the project team. This is a major choice that clients make, but the presented research shows that governance choices for project execution are more important. This is significant because clients tend to focus more on procurement choices and typically do not differentiate governance based on those choices. This needs to change, and the authors show that optimal governance configurations vary on the basis of the chosen type of team configuration. For example, three specific governance arrangements for workshops are highlighted for single teams, and two specific governance arrangements for risk/reward sharing are highlighted for multiple teams. This study identifies governance actions that are associated with superior time and cost outcomes on collaborative infrastructure projects in Australia run by experienced public-sector clients under the two procurement scenarios. Based on a survey of 320 senior managers, independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare the application of governance actions among three distinct groups of projects, based on type of team selection and type of project outcome. The study provides evidence of the most effective approaches to project governance in a country that is a world leader. The results provide much needed recommendations for improved project performance based on large-scale quantitative analysis, which before now has not existed. Overall, the study recommends more attention be paid to noncontractual governance under both approaches to team selection, although the specific actions recommended vary.

Interrelationships of factors causing delays in the relocation of utilities A cognitive mapping approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case studies; Construction management; Cognitive mapping; Project delays; Relocation of utilities; Road and bridge projects	ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; SCHEDULE; MAPS	Purpose - Relocation of utilities is a major source of delay in Indian infrastructure projects. This delay is particularly critical in road and bridge construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify the various factors and also the interrelationships between the factors which influence the delays in the relocation of utilities. Design/methodology/approach - Case studies were conducted on 11 road and bridge projects in India with varying levels of complexity and size. Factors causing relocation delays were identified using computer aided qualitative analysis methodology. Cognitive mapping technique was used to map the interrelationships between the factors and to identify the critical delay factors. Findings - Factors affecting delays were identified across two groups, namely, technical and organizational factors. The study offers insights into the kinds of interactions of factors that can lead to delays in a project. The critical factors causing delays were identified as slow response from utility agencies, difficulty in identification of underground utilities, lack of information on underground utilities and conflict between agencies. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the study are that the interview respondents are not evenly distributed among the type of organizations which may have induced some bias in responses. The impact of the utility relocation delays on the overall project delay has to be detailed further. Practical implications - The interrelationships between factors has the potential to help the officials of highway department, contractors, utility agencies and others understand how various interactions/linkages of factors contributes to delays in utility relocations. Recommendations are provided for the practical use and to reduce the impact of delays. Originality/value - Utility relocation has received very little attention in the extant literature and this paper seeks to contribute to knowledge in this area by identifying the linkages between factors and the critical factors of utility relocation delays in India.

An agent-based modeling approach for understanding the effect of worker-management interactions on construction workers' safety-related behaviors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction site safety; Safety management; Safety-related behavior; Agent-based modeling; Simulation	SIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; LEADERSHIP; ACCIDENTS; CULTURE; OWNERS; IDENTIFICATION; CONTRACTORS; PREDICTORS; PROJECTS	Pervasive unsafe behaviors of construction workers are the primary cause of accidents on construction job sites. The workers' safety-related behaviors are subject to a variety of factors, such as interactions with coworkers and interventions by management teams. The impacts of these factors have attracted considerable attention in academia but are yet to be fully examined. To provide a quantitative assessment of these impacts and their managerial implications in practice, an agent-based modeling approach of construction safety-related behaviors, which adopts a bottom-up architecture, is proposed in this research. This approach regards safety performance as an emergent property of the behaviors and interactions of construction workers and management teams. The development of the agent-based model is based on a range of theoretical and empirical evidence, including a cognitive analysis model for modeling worker behaviors, and site observations and surveys for the design of simulated working environment and tasks, as well as the modeling of individual behaviors and interactions. Four managerial scenarios are simulated using the proposed approach. Based on the simulation results, the effects of a number of managerial factors on the safety performance of construction workers are examined. These factors include duties of supervisors, the competency and inspection strategy of safety officers, the frequency of safety training, senior managers' involvement in safety activities and emphasis on safety goals. The effects of these factors are examined in a quantitative manner, and relevant implications for construction safety management practice are discussed. The findings prove that agent-based modeling is an effective approach for analyzing the characteristics and patterns of construction safety-related behaviors and assessing possible safety management strategies.

Impacts of multi-layer chain subcontracting on project management performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multi-layer chain subcontracting; Project management; Project performance; Construction; Hong Kong	SYSTEM	This paper investigates the impacts of applying the multi-layer chain subcontracting system on project management performance with reference to Hong Kong construction industry. Multi-layer chain subcontracting system is widely used within construction industry as it is considered advantageous in many aspects such as better efficiency of subcontractors' operation due to their unique skills. However, the fact of poor quality products in construction practice raises the doubt about the effectiveness of the chain system. Accordingly, the reasons why the applications of the system contribute to poor project performance are examined. A survey conducted in the Hong Kong construction industry demonstrates that the multi-layer chain subcontracting system, while widely adopted, is largely flawed. Based on the survey results, application of multi-layer chain subcontracting system contributes largely to the poor performance across the all major aspects including quality and time management. cost control, and communication and coordination performance. The association exists between poor project management performance and the increase of the number of layers in the chain of the subcontracting arrangement. The long communication chain because of the increasing layers of subcontractors results in various problems such as communication errors, poor supervision on the bottom-layer contractors. Consequently overruns in cost and time, and abortive and remedial works are common. Recommendations for improving the practice are suggested and explored, including change the practice of the "lowest bid" to an approach which incorporate both price and technical performance, limit the number of subcontracting layers, restrain the use of "supply-and-fix" subcontracting arrangement, and enforce the implementation of government regulations. The findings of this study provide useful references in examining the practice of subcontracting system in other construction industries and identifying the areas where the improvements can be made for gaining the benefits of using the system.

Project manager's role in safety performance of Saudi construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project manager; SMEs; Construction; Project management; Health and safety	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CULTURE; CLIMATE; HEALTH; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTRACTORS; PERCEPTIONS; REGRESSION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the primary research question, which is what is the relationship between the project manager's (PM) possession of the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification and the level of the safety culture present in the construction project the PM manages. Design/methodology/approach The research was based on a survey of a purposive sample, 109 engineers and first-line supervisors worked in 23 construction projects of which ten were led by PMP-certified PMs and 13 were led by PMs lacking PMP certification. Each PM completed a demographic questionnaire for the predictor variables of PMP certification controlled for age and experience. To assess the criterion variable of safety culture total score, engineers and first-line supervisors working in the same project completed the questionnaire of safety culture values and practices. Findings Results of this study indicated the level of safety culture was significantly different, and improved, for engineers and first-line supervisors who work under PMs with PMP certification compared to the level of safety culture in projects managed by PMs with no PMP certification. Although alignment of safety culture perceptions among different levels in the organization helps to achieve a positive safety culture, the role of the PM in transferring, implementing and maintaining the safety culture in the construction project is fundamental, particularly in small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Originality/value This study addressed the role of the PMs managerial skills in the safety performance of Saudi Arabian SMEs. The principal finding was that PMs with managerial skills perform better regarding safety performance in SME construction projects than PMs lacking managerial skills. The primary recommendation is that leaders in construction projects must carefully evaluate engineers' managerial skills before hiring the individuals as PMs. A PM's promotion model developed in this study provides a suitable framework and business process component for construction leaders seeking to maintain safety performance successfully.

Return on Investment Analysis of Using Building Information Modeling in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling; Construction; Return on investment; Virtual design and construction; Cost; Schedule		The recent emergence of building information modeling (BIM) and the evolution of virtual design and construction (VDC) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry are fundamentally changing the process by which buildings are designed and constructed. However, the perceived high initial cost of implementing BIM has deterred many industry professionals from adopting this technology. This paper aims to facilitate the decision-making process in the adoption of BIM by presenting the cost savings associated with implementing BIM. In many cases, an owner's willingness to pay for the BIM is crucial in the contractor's decision to use BIM. Therefore, in order to show the returns on the investment (ROI) of paying additional fees, data was gathered from three case studies on three sets of similar projects, with each set consisting of one recently constructed BIM-assisted project and one earlier, similar project completed without BIM. The potential savings to an owner choosing to invest in BIM as an additional service were estimated based on the measurable cost benefits associated with reduced schedule overruns, fewer requests for information (RFIs), and reduced change orders. This research confirmed that BIM is a worthwhile investment in the context of the company studied. In the three case studies presented, the ROI of BIM varied greatly from 16 to 1,654%. Additionally, the total number of RFIs was reduced by 34% on a small tilt-wall project, 68% on a three-story assisted living facility, and 43% on a midrise commercial condominium project, and the number of change orders was reduced by 40, 48, and 37%, respectively. Though an owner's decision to invest in BIM should be weighed against the scale and complexity of a project, this research suggests that savings may be realized regardless of the size of a construction project. The paper presents a systematic approach for estimating the ROI realized in adopting BIM using standard project documentation. Finally, general suggestions for documenting BIM-assisted construction projects are outlined based on limitations uncovered during this study. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The authors wanted to understand the reasons behind the urgency and how the project management team succeeds in delivering in such a tight time window. Finally, the authors assessed the consequences (negative and positive, during and after the project delivery), knowing that the project was considered a success at its delivery, but not that it was successful at the post-project evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - A case study based on qualitative research interviews with management team including the client, the main contractor and some related stakeholders, combined with case archives and internal documentation from the case project. Findings - The urgency of a project or programme may lead to some negative consequences and impacts. The success seen in a short-and mid-term view is not enough to justify making acceleration decisions: thus holistic thinking and a long-term sustainable approach are needed to ensure continuity and profits. Research limitations/implications - This research is based on a single case study. There are some limitations regarding how urgent and unexpected the case was managed in comparing to normal case. A second limitation is that there is no clear definition of what are normal practices such that we can say what are a normal case and an urgent case. Practical implications - There are some lessons learned from this case study about managing the unexpected and the urgent. Practitioners can obtain insight into positive and negative consequences of fast project delivery from this case. Originality/value - This study is unique in its content and context, since it presents the first-hand insight into a case study that seemed to be successful to some extent (short-term impact); however, negative consequences appeared within a few years of its delivery.

Construction Bidding Markup Estimation Using a Multistage Decision Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting; Construction bidding; Markup estimation; Decision theory; Bayesian statistics	MONTE-CARLO; MODEL	Determining an optimum bid value maximizes the probability of winning a construction project while realizing proper profit. Thus, this issue has been one of the important research topics in construction-related research. Various models have provided different methodological approaches for bid pricing using statistical analysis of competitors' prior bids. However, the accuracy of these models is compromised in cases where the data set of competitors' historic bids is not complete and/or where such competitors utilize a dynamic behavior (i.e., having bidding schemes that change significantly with time). Through a multistage decision theory approach, this paper presents a more advanced model for construction bidding markup estimation that uses a Bayesian analytic framework. To this effect, a three-stage research methodology was utilized. First, the authors established a systematic procedure to fit competitors' historical data into appropriate Bayesian prior density functions while taking the stochastic variability of cost estimates into consideration. Second, the authors developed stochastic likelihood functions through the most recent observation(s). Third, the authors created the posterior distributions from which the joint probability of winning and the expected profit can be calculated. To this end, the use of the Bayesian statistics in the model enables it to draw sound statistical inferences even in cases of data incompleteness and dynamic behaviors of competitors, thus tackling two important weak spots in the previous models. The proposed model was applied to two case studies from the literature with different scenarios to demonstrate its use and to illustrate the effect of different parameters on the resulting optimum markup. It was shown that the more recent bidding strategies of competitors play a significant role in predicting the future ones. Also, as the contractor becomes more certain about its competitor's behavior, both its probability of winning and optimum bidding markup increase.

Risk-Based Project Delivery Selection Model for Highway Design and Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project delivery selection process; Risk analysis and management; Crossimpact analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Project planning and design	IMPACT; MATRIX	Project-delivery methods allocate risk for design and construction between contractual parties. State departments of transportation (DOTs) using federal funds employ three primary project-delivery methods: (1) design-bid-build (D-B-B); (2) design-build (D-B); and (3) construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC). Because the choice of a project-delivery method is best made early in the project-development process, it is a complex decision that is fraught with risk and uncertainty. This paper presents a risk-based modeling methodology to evaluate and quantify the potential differences in project cost attributable to the selection of a project-delivery method. The risk-based model consists of (1) an input structure of assessment and evaluation of delivery-risk factors; (2) a computational-modeling structure for calculating costs; and (3) an output structure to communicate model results and implementation. The assessment and evaluation process determines the risks that are incorporated into the delivery decision. It translates static cost and schedule uncertainty from project specifics to input variables (risk factors) and to decision variables (project outcomes). The computational model employs crossimpact analysis techniques and probabilistic inferences to capture uncertainties and interactions among the input and decision variables. The model result provides three approximate cost distributions associated with three project-delivery methods (D-B, D-B-B, and CM/GC) and a sensitivity result (i.e., tornado diagrams) that describes which risk factors have the most significant impact on these costs. The model was successfully tested on three highway projects which are discussed in detail in this paper. The findings from this paper add to the existing body of knowledge by providing a novel method to predict project costs based upon the owner's choice of alternative project-delivery methods. The approach combines multivariate analysis with crossimpact analysis to make the predictions and provide a sensitivity analysis for project risks. The findings also provide a systematic approach to quantitatively selecting an appropriate delivery method that encourages highway agencies to conduct risk analysis early in the project-development process.

J	Hwang, BG; Zhao, XB; Tan, LLG				Hwang, Bon-Gang; Zhao, Xianbo; Tan, Lene Lay Ghim			Green building projects: schedule performance, influential factors and solutions	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Singapore; Buildings; Green building; Retrofitting; Delay; Schedule	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; LESSONS; DELAYS	Purpose - The purposes of this paper are to: investigate schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; identify the critical factors that influence the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; and provide solutions to improve schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey were conducted and responses were received from 34 firms experienced in green building projects in Singapore. After the data from the survey had been analyzed, face-to-face interviews were conducted with two senior project managers to solicit comments on the survey results. Findings - This study identified the degree of project delay in 98 new green building projects and 51 retrofitting green building projects in Singapore. The result indicated that 22 percent of the Singaporean green building projects were plagued with delay and retrofitting projects had a significantly higher likelihood of delay and significantly longer extension than new projects. In addition, "consultant cooperation to solve problems" was the most influential to schedule performance of both new and retrofitting green building projects, and the two project groups agreed on the overall ranking of the factors affecting schedule performance. Research limitations/implications - There may be geographical limitation on the conclusions drawn from the findings. Also, the sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. In addition, the majority of the respondents were contractors as other project players were reluctant to respond to the survey. Practical implications - This study provides a clear understanding of the schedule performance of green building projects as well as the critical factors that should be highlighted when constructing green building projects. Also, strategies to overcome the negative impact of these factors allow practitioners to better deal with the potential causes of delay and to attain the schedule performance. Originality/value - Although construction delays have been widely investigated in previous studies relating to construction management, few have attempted to analyze the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green buildings. Thus, this study adds significantly to the existing research on both green building and construction delay.

J	Franz, B; Messner, J				Franz, Bryan; Messner, John			Evaluating the Impact of Building Information Modeling on Project Performance	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Project delivery; Project execution planning; Virtual design and construction (VDC)	BIM	There is growing interest among practitioners to measure the benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and demonstrate the impact that BIM has on projects. In recent years, several researchers have used illustrative case studies to demonstrate how adopting BIM for specific uses can improve project performance. However, generalizable findings that may be extended across the industry remain somewhat elusive. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study to examine the impact of BIM use adoption and BIM Execution Planning (BEP) on project performance across a range of project delivery methods. The core research questions guiding the study were (1) does increased BIM use adoption improve project performance, as measured by cost, schedule, and quality metrics? and (2) what role does BEP have in the successful implementation of BIM on a project? By leveraging data from over 200 projects, these questions were answered via a multiple regression analysis. The results showed a significant positive relationship between BIM use adoption and the speed of delivery, perceived facility quality, and group cohesion within the project team, when controlling for project complexity. There was no evidence to suggest that the level of participation in BEP by members of the project team moderated those relationships. Instead, BEP participation was a significant predictor of BIM use adoption. Projects implementing BEP with either a designer-contractor team or the full project team were associated with increased BIM use adoption compared with projects that did not implement BEP. Despite these key findings, this study revealed a need for a new approach for capturing process data across projects to enable more-detailed future analysis. Prior research, including the data set used in this study, was designed to test macrolevel relationships, and omits many of the details about the specific processes or implementation aspects that drive day-to-day actions. Transitioning to collect a more focused data set, aimed at the microlevel of BIM and BEP implementation, and potentially lean construction practices, would enable a better understanding of the value these tools bring to projects.

Financial Valuation of Investments in International Construction Markets: Real-Options Approach for Market-Entry Decisions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Investment valuation; Financial risk analysis; International construction; Market-entry decision making; Real-options analysis; Risk-neutral valuation; Financial risk profile	HIGHWAY PROJECTS; RISK; MODEL; FIRMS; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; PROFIT	The body of knowledge in decision making about international construction market entry has been primarily focused on identifying risk factors, quantifying risks, and developing risk management strategies for construction firms to be more likely to succeed in international markets (e.g.,risk registrars, industry checklists, entry procedures, and quantitative/qualitative risk assessment models). Going international can also be considered as a large-scale investment for a firm because it has all three major characteristics of an investment decision: (1)entering an international market requires a substantial level of initial outlays; (2)this initial capital is not completely recoverable if the firm decides to exit the market; and (3)the success of an international construction business venture is subject to great market uncertainty, which is exogenous to the firm. Traditionally, financial valuation of international construction markets is conducted by net present value (NPV) analysis approach. Although simple, NPV analysis is subject to two major limitations: (1)it does not systematically capture and treat volatility of revenue streams in characterizing the firm's financial risk profile; and (2)it does not explicitly address the firm's flexibility in market entry or exit time and its impact on the firm's investment value. This paper presents a financial valuation model based on the real-options methodology to overcome these limitations. The real-options theory from finance/decision science is applied to evaluate investments in international construction markets and determine the firm's optimal time to enter or exit a market. The real-options model presented in this paper is used to price two kinds of options typically embedded in the international construction market context: deferring investment and exiting the market. This model can be useful to international contractors because without a proper options pricing model, the significant impact of these flexible options may be overlooked; hence, the value of an investment opportunity may be erroneously computed.

J	Kumar, R; Iyer, KC; Singh, SP				Kumar, Ratnesh; Iyer, K. Chandrashekhar; Singh, Surya Prakash			Understanding relationship between risks and claims for assessing risks with project data	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Claims; Content analysis; Risks; Risk assessment	CONSTRUCTION-CLAIMS; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTORS; DISPUTES; IDENTIFICATION; ALLOCATION; DELAY	Purpose In construction management, risks and claims are treated separately, but several studies tacitly acknowledge a strong link between the two. In this context, this research intends to investigate whether risks and claims have a causal relationship? Based on this causal relationship, a claim-based risk assessment model (C-RAM) is developed to quantify occurrences and cost implications of risks using project data. Design/methodology/approach First, the causal relationship between risks and claims is established through a conceptual framework for content analysis of the literature on risk management (RM) and claim management (CM). Then, a C-RAM is developed based on the content analysis of 234 claims from 24 settled arbitration awards. Findings Risks and claims are found to be two stages in the same chain of uncertain events that affect projects, subsequently revealing a causal relationship between risks and claims. Due to this causal relationship, claim documents become a potential source of risk information from past projects. Proposed C-RAM quantifies occurrences of risks with three parameters: number of projects in which a risk occurs, number of ways in which a risk occurs, and number of claims a risk causes if it occurs. Also, cost implications of risks are quantified as percentage of contract sums for interpretation as tangible values. Research limitations/implications Though C-RAM is applicable to all types of claims, the results in this paper are based on impacts of risks in past projects that caused claims and reached to arbitration stage. Practical implications The causal relationship between risks and claims will encourage integration of knowledge on RM and CM which is currently treated separately. Practitioners can now visualize claims as cost implications of risks that occurred in projects. Further, C-RAM makes risk assessment (RA) more objective by quantifying the cost implications of risks as percentage of contract sums which can be readily used for contingency estimation. Originality/value The relationship between risks and claims, and the potential of claim documents as a source of project risk information, can initiate a new paradigm in RM research based on project data.

J	Yap, JEBH; Leong, WJ; Skitmore, M				Yap, Jeffs Ey Boon Hui; Leong, Wen Jie; Skitmore, Martin			Capitalising teamwork for enhancing project delivery and management in construction: empirical study in Malaysia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Teamwork; Team effectiveness; Dimensions; Temporary project team; Project management	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; DELAYS; MODEL; COLLABORATION; TEAMS	Purpose Teamwork in the construction industry has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial circles. Most importantly, improving team effectiveness will increase the likelihood of successful project delivery. Recognising the factors influencing team dynamics is important for enhanced team performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on a detailed literature review, a survey questionnaire containing 10 aspects and 25 attributes of teamwork relevant to construction is used to collect feedback from Malaysian construction practitioners from client, consultant and contractor organisations to prioritise these hypothesised variables. The data are then subjected to reliability analysis, descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and frequencies), a one-sample t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and exploratory factor analysis. Findings The significance of these aspects and attributes is then presented. The three most crucial aspects are "project performance", "decision-making capability" and "problem-solving ability". The most influential attributes are "effective communication between project team members", "efficient team leadership", "well-defined team responsibilities and roles", "clear team goals and objectives" and "good collaboration between all project leaders". The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA reveals five attributes having statistically significant differences with respect to company size, namely "clear team goals and objectives", "commitment to the project", "adequate resources", "team or task processes" and "creativity and innovation". Six underlying dimensions are found, comprising (1) participative engagement and task commitment; (2) team responsibility structure and accountability; (3) culture of trust and respect; (4) leader's skills and abilities; (5) top management support; and (6) synergic working environment. Practical implications - The identification of these dimensions for team effectiveness provides rigorous basis for formulating useful team-building strategies for integrating a collaborative environment among project stakeholders and consequently improving project performance. Originality/value This paper bridges the identified knowledge gap concerning the dimensionality of teamwork attributes in construction-based setting and adds to existing knowledge of how team effectiveness can be leveraged to improve project performance in the construction management literature.

J	Kadry, M; Osman, H; Georgy, M				Kadry, Mohamed; Osman, Hesham; Georgy, Maged			Causes of Construction Delays in Countries with High Geopolitical Risks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Project controls; Contracting	PROJECTS; TIME	International construction contractors are increasingly expanding their business into emerging markets that are often characterized by high geopolitical risk. Working in these regions poses unique challenges that lead to unconventional causes for construction delay. As such, this research aims to (1) develop a better understanding of the causes of delays that may be encountered in countries with high geopolitical risks, (2) gauge the relative impact these delay causes are expected to have on project completion, and (3) capture how delay causes are influenced by project and country characteristics. Research findings are based on two distinct data sources: quantitative and qualitative data. First, a window delay analysis is conducted of six project schedules and narratives with extensive quantitative data informed of the probability and impact of various delay causes in countries with high geopolitical risks. This quantitative source was then complemented with qualitative data based on interviewing 18 experts who were involved in 36 projects, which spanned 16 countries with high geopolitical risks. Results of the quantitative and qualitative data analysis were merged to create an integrated delay cause database. This merging helps to leverage the advantages of both approaches, i. e., accuracy of data and breadth of coverage, and enables construction companies to better anticipate the future causes of delay on their international construction projects. For an upcoming project in a country with high geopolitical risk, the database can be used to suggest or predict the most likely causes of delay based on matching the similarity (location and project type) with existing cases. Comparison of results with the literature on construction delay causes in developing countries suggests that there are several delay causes that are unique, and also substantial, in countries with high geopolitical risks. The benefits of this research are broad. The capacity to predict delay causes in future projects in which geopolitical risks are detectable can result in (1) the development of more effective risk response plans, (2) more reliable estimation of contingencies, and (3) establishment of more efficient project control procedures.

J	Namian, M; Albert, A; Feng, J				Namian, Mostafa; Albert, Alex; Feng, Jing			Effect of Distraction on Hazard Recognition and Safety Risk Perception	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard recognition; Hazard identification; Safety risk perception; Distraction; Injury prevention	DRIVER DISTRACTION; CONSTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; WORK	Both hazard recognition and safety risk perception are fundamental to effective safety management. When construction hazards remain unrecognized or the associated safety risk remains unperceived, the likelihood of human errors and injuries increases. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that a large number of construction hazards remain unrecognized in typical workplaces. Likewise, past research has demonstrated that safety risk is widely underestimated in construction. Therefore, to improve safety performance, a proper understanding of factors that influence hazard recognition and safety risk perception is vital. Toward achieving this goal, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of distractionswhich are ubiquitous in construction environmentson the hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception of workers. The study goals are accomplished through an experimental effort involving 70 construction workers representing various specialty trades. The workers were randomly assigned to a distracted or undistracted condition, and their hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception levels were measured using construction case images. The study findings revealed that the distracted workers recognized a smaller proportion of hazards compared with undistracted workers. However, there were no significant differences in the level of perceived safety risk between the two groups. A closer examination of the data revealed that the safety risk perception levels for the undistracted workers are positively related to their hazard recognition performance. In other words, when undistracted workers recognize a larger proportion of hazards, they also perceive higher levels of safety risk. However, no such relationship was observed for the distracted workers, suggesting that the perceived risk was unrelated to or not dependent on their hazard recognition performance. The findings suggest that workplace distractions can adversely affect hazard recognition, safety risk perception, and safety performance. Given that constuction workers are already exposed to numerous distractors in typical workplaces, contractors seeking to introduce emerging technologies such as drones, mobile devices, and smart robots must be cognizant of their potential distracting effects. The current study represents the first empirical effort investigating the effect of workplace distraction on construction hazard recognition and safety risk perception.

J	Daniel, EI; Pasquire, C; Dickens, G; Ballard, HG				Daniel, Emmanuel Itodo; Pasquire, Christine; Dickens, Graham; Ballard, Herman Glenn			The relationship between the last planner (R) system and collaborative planning practice in UK construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						UK; Construction planning; Collaborative planning; Construction sector; Last planner system; Production planning and management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how the newly emerging UK practice of "collaborative planning" (CP) for construction project delivery aligns with the advocated principles of the global last planner system (LPS) of production planning and control. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed, qualitative, exploratory approach was adopted for the study. This entailed qualitative data through three techniques, namely: semi-structured interviews, documents analysis, and structured observation. In total, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted over a 12 month period with lean construction consultants, clients, main contractors, and subcontractors drawn from the building, highways and infrastructure and rail sector. In all, 15 projects were visited where practices were observed. Findings - The study reveals that the current practice of CP in the UK partially aligns with the LPS principles. Where practitioners have heard of the LPS they believe it to be the same practice as CP. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to 30 interviews, observation of 15 projects and document analysis. The aim of the study is not to generalise the findings, however, since the study examined top construction companies and practitioners in the UK and the findings were consistent across the sample, some conclusions could be made. The study is also limited to examining the construction phase only, future studies should incorporate the design phase. Practical implications - A clear identification of the elements of current practice compared to the components of the LPS provides a contribution to the future practice of project production planning and management in the construction industry. Social implications - The study highlights a continuing resistance to collaboration within the industry. This resistance is subtly embedded within implemented practices even though they are based on collaborative working for their success. Originality/value - This is among the first studies in the UK that comprehensively examines and reports the application of LPS/CP practice in construction across the major construction sectors. Future studies could build on the findings from this work to develop an approach/methodology to improve the current practice.

The relational nature of social procurement policies requires construction firms to develop new collaborative partnerships with organisations from the government, not-for-profit and community sectors. The aim of this paper is to address the paucity of research into the risks and opportunities of entering into these new cross-sector partnerships from the perspectives of the stakeholders involved and how this affects collaborative potential and social value outcomes for intended beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach This case study research is based on a unique collaborative intermediary called Connectivity Centre created by an international contractor to coordinate its social procurement strategies. The findings draw on a thematic analysis of qualitative data from focus groups with 35 stakeholders from the construction, government, not-for-profit, social enterprise, education and employment sectors. Findings Findings indicate that potentially enormous opportunities which social procurement offers are being undermined by stakeholder nervousness about policy design, stability and implementation, poor risk management, information asymmetries, perverse incentives, candidate supply constraints, scepticism, traditional recruitment practices and industry capacity constraints. While these risks can be mitigated through collaborative initiatives like Connectivity Centres, this depends on new "relational" skills, knowledge and competencies which do not currently exist in construction. In conclusion, when social procurement policy requirements are excessive and imposed top-down, with little understanding of the construction industry's compliance capacity, intended social outcomes of these policies are unlikely to be achieved. Originality/value This research draws on theories of cross-sector collaboration developed in the realm of public sector management to address the lack of research into how the new cross-sector partnerships encouraged by emerging social procurement policies work in the construction industry. Contributing to the emerging literature on cross-sector collaboration, the findings expose the many challenges of working in cross-sector partnerships in highly transitionary project-based environments like construction.

J	Vuorinen, L; Martinsuo, MM				Vuorinen, Lauri; Martinsuo, Miia Maarit			Lifecycle view of managing different changes in projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Change management; Improvisation	MANAGEMENT; IMPROVISATION; FLEXIBILITY; LESSONS; PLANS	Purpose A project contractor can promote the success of a delivery project by planning the project well and following a project management methodology (PMM). However, various changes typically take place, requiring changes to the project plan and actions that deviate from the firm's established PMM. The purpose of this paper is to explore different types of changes and change management activities over the lifecycle of delivery projects. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative single case study design was used. In total, 17 semi-structured interviews were carried out during a delivery project in a medium-sized engineering company that delivers complex systems to industrial customers. Findings Both plan-related changes and deviations from the PMM were mapped throughout the project lifecycle. Various internal and external sources of change were identified. An illustrative example of the interconnectedness of the changes reveals the potential escalation of changes over the project lifecycle. Managers and project personnel engage in different change management activities and improvisation to create alternative paths, re-plan, catch up, and optimize project performance after changes. Research limitations/implications The empirical study is limited to a single case study setting and a single industry. The findings draw attention to the interconnectedness and potential escalation effect of changes over the lifecycle of the project, and the need for integrated change management and improvisation actions. Practical implications Efficient change management and improvisation at the early phase of a delivery project can potentially mitigate negative change incidents in later project phases. Changes are not only the project manager's concern; project personnel's skilled change responses are also helpful. The findings emphasize the importance of the project customer as a source of changes in delivery projects, meaning that customer relationship management throughout the project lifecycle is needed for successful change management. Originality/value The study offers increased understanding of changes and change management throughout the project lifecycle. The results show evidence of plan-related and methodology-related changes and their interconnections, thereby proposing a lifecycle view of integrated change management and improvisation in projects.

M.; Cheung, Esther; Ke, Yongjian			Drivers for Adopting Public Private Partnerships-Empirical Comparison between China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The private sector has long been involved in delivering public sector projects, whether its role has been as a partner or just as a contractor for the government. Over recent years the interest in adopting public private partnerships (PPPs) has increased internationally. Many research studies have presented positive reasons for the governments and the private sector to welcome this form of procurement, rather than continue adopting the traditional options. This paper aims to explore and compare the key drivers for adopting PPP in China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (referred to as Hong Kong from here onwards). An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted in both of these administrative systems and survey respondents were invited to rate their perceptions on the importance of 15 different drivers identified. Eighty-seven completed survey questionnaires were returned for analysis. The findings indicated that respondents from China rated economy-related drivers higher, whereas Hong Kong respondents tended to rate efficiency-related drivers higher. China's demand for more public infrastructure and services has imposed great pressure on the government's budget, and therefore economic drivers were rated higher. On the other hand, with adequate financial reserve in hand and budget surplus over recent years, Hong Kong has tended to prefer paying for projects upfront, and hence efficiency was regarded more significantly. Among the 15 drivers, both of the respondents from China and Hong Kong selected, "provide an integrated solution (for public infrastructure/services)" and " solve the problem of public sector budget restraint" to be within the top three drivers. Despite the general agreement on the ranking pattern, the results of independent two-sample t-test showed that China and Hong Kong shared very different views on the driver" reduce the total project cost." This driver was ranked rather high by the mainland Chinese respondents, but much lower by the Hong Kong respondents. This finding can be construed that economic drivers are in general rated higher in China as compared to that in Hong Kong.	[Chan, Albert P. C.; Lam, Patrick T. I.; Chan, Daniel W.

J	Tawalare, A; Laishram, B; Thottathil, F				Tawalare, Abhay; Laishram, Boeing; Thottathil, Fabil			Relational Partnership in Public Construction Organizations: Front-Line Employee Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Relational contracting; Structural equation modeling; Public-sector construction industry; Partnering	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; WORK TEAMS; LEADERSHIP; CONTRACTS; ESTABLISHMENT; GOVERNANCE; MECHANISMS; MOTIVATION	The adoption of relational contracting (RC) has been increasingly used by parties in various developed countries as one of the innovative tools in traditional contracting to achieve benefits such as cost savings, schedule reduction, reduced litigation, improved teamwork, increased trust, stronger relationships, and overall satisfaction. However, the adoption of RC in public-sector construction organizations has been observed to encounter difficulties when compared with implementation in private-sector organizations because of typical barriers, including a lack of understanding of partnering principles and personality indifference, in addition to a low offer mentality, ineffective top management, and a lack of positive working-level commitment. Studies in this area conducted with the objective of ensuring the effective implementation of RC in public-sector organizations are also limited. In view of this, this study aims at exploring the factors that will have an important impact on developing RC practices and the relationship between the contractor and the public firm. Previous studies focused on the identification of the success factors of RC, but those studies were limited to RC implementation from a top management perspective only. Thus, this study investigates the critical factors in RC that are necessary to produce successful relational partnerships in public organizations exclusively from the perspective of front-line employees. The front-line employees include junior engineers and assistant engineers, who are responsible for the day-to-day management of construction activities. An extensive literature review offered 9 important relational contract success factors that were identified and measured by 29 indicators. The data were collected from 202 operational-level employees at four public-sector construction organizations in India. The structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. The critical factors identified from the study are training, organizational change, commitment of top management, partner selection, and the assessment process. Organizational change for partnering emerged from this study as one of the new critical factors. The findings from this study could be used to improve the relational partnerships of public organizations.

The recent advancements in various structural systems have made the selection of the appropriate structural system for a specific project a challenging decision-making process. This process involves different economic and technical criteria representing the availability of experienced technicians and engineers and necessary machinery and construction materials. Economic life cycle, environmental protection related issues, safety of the project site, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes are also issues related to the country and location in which the construction project takes place, and they should also be addressed in the decision-making process. In this paper, a new algorithm combining two well-known multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III) and preference ranking organization method for enrich evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), have been specially developed for ranking of structural systems. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to group decision-making cases. In addition, the decision matrix data, criteria weights, preference, indifference, and veto thresholds are set as interval values to consider uncertainties in the decision-making procedure. The proposed methodology considers veto threshold, provide complete ranking, exempts the preference functions and includes conceptions such as risk, uncertainty, and reliability with interval approach. The proposed algorithm has been utilized in selecting the appropriate structural system in a low-rise multihousing project in Iran. In this case study, sixteen criteria have been used to select the best structural system between eight alternatives considering relevant uncertainties in the judgments of three groups of stakeholders (owner, consultants, and contractors). The results of the case study showed that the proposed methodology can be used as a proper tool for decision making in the construction management processes.

C.; Kajewski, Stephen			THE PUBLIC SECTOR'S PERSPECTIVE ON PROCURING PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS - COMPARING THE VIEWS OF PRACTITIONERS IN HONG KONG AND AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public Private Partnerships (PPP); Procurement; Public Sector Interviews; Hong Kong; Australia	CONSTRUCTION	Hong Kong has been one of the early jurisdictions to adopt Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for delivering large public infrastructure projects. The development of this procurement approach in Hong Kong has followed an intricate path. As such, it is believed that there are a number of areas which are interesting to unveil. As part of a comprehensive research study looking at implementing PPPs, interviews with experienced local industrial practitioners from the public sector were conducted to realize their perspective on the topic of procuring public works projects. Amongst these interviews, fourteen were launched government officials and advisers. The interview findings show that the majority of the Hong Kong and Australian interviewees had previously conducted some kind of research in the field of PPP. Both groups of interviewees agreed that "PPPs gain private sector's added efficiency/expertise/ management skills" when compared to projects procured traditionally. Also, both groups of interviewees felt that projects best suited to use PPP are those that have an "Economic business case". The interviewees believed that "Contractor's performance" could be used as key performance indicators for PPP projects. A large number of critical success factors were identified by the interviewees for PPP projects; two of these were similar for both groups of interviewees. These included "Project objectives well defined" and "Partnership spirit/commitment/trust". Finally it was found that in-house guidance materials were more common in the organizations of the Australian interviewees compared to the Hong Kong ones. This paper studies the views of the public sector towards the topic of PPPs in Hong Kong and Australia, which helps to answer some of the queries that both academics and the private sector in these jurisdictions are keen to know. As a result the private sector can be more prepared when negotiating with the public sector and realise their needs better, academics on the other hand are provided a wider perspective of this topic benefiting the research industry at large.

J	Chang, RD; Zuo, J; Soebarto, V; Zhao, ZY; Zillante, G				Chang, Rui-Dong; Zuo, Jian; Soebarto, Veronica; Zhao, Zhen-Yu; Zillante, George			Dynamic interactions between sustainability and competitiveness in construction firms A transition perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitiveness; Sustainability; Construction industry; Transition; Conceptual framework; Theory building	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; CONTRACTORS; DRIVERS; INNOVATION; BARRIERS; INDUSTRY; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - Sustainability and competitiveness have received extensive attentions. Despite a large number of studies on sustainability and competitiveness in the construction industry, little research has been conducted to holistically explore the interactions between these two concepts. From a dynamic transition perspective, the purpose of this paper is to link sustainability and competitiveness of construction firms by developing a Sustainability-Competitiveness Dynamic Interaction Framework (SCDIF). Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual theory-building approach was adopted to develop the conceptual framework. It is an iterative analysis and synthesis process, which involves reading literature, identifying commonalities and differences, synthesizing, proposing an initial framework, collecting additional literature, and revisiting and revising the framework. Findings - There are complex interactions between sustainability and competitiveness of construction firms. This leads to uncertain relationships between sustainability and competitiveness, which is context dependent. Under evolving economic and socio-political environments, sustainability and competitiveness of construction firms could transition from mutually exclusive to mutually supportive, and finally merge into "sustainable competitiveness." Research limitations/implications - A SCDIF proposed in this study demonstrates that the interactions between sustainability and competitiveness evolves according to the evolving economic and socio-political environments and firms' strategies, and thus the relationships and interactions between sustainability and competitiveness are context dependent. This framework helps corporate managers to understand how corporate sustainability and competitiveness interact with each other, thereby informing their decision-making of sustainability strategy. Similarly, the framework provides useful references for policymakers to understand the mechanisms of transitioning industries toward sustainable competitiveness. Originality/value - The proposed framework offers a new perspective for understanding sustainability and competitiveness. From the dynamic transition perspective, this study effectively illustrates that the interactions between sustainability and competitiveness evolves according to the evolving economic and socio-political environments and firms' strategies. Compared to existing approaches, the dynamic and holistic approach proposed in this paper provides the capacity to capture the complexity of sustainability and competitiveness.

With the rapid development of subway systems in Chinese urban areas, construction workers are being exposed to new risks which are poorly understood and managed. Subway construction projects are large scale and scattered over many construction sites, and involve numerous stakeholders and sophisticated technologies in challenging underground environments. Accident rates are high and have significant economic and social consequences for the firms and people involved. Addressing the gap in research about the safety risk in these projects, the purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of the factors influencing the safety of Chinese subway construction projects with the overall objective of reducing accident rates. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with 399 subway construction professionals across five stakeholder groups. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with five experienced experts in safety management on subway projects to validate the results. Findings It was found that the eight most critical factors perceived by stakeholders to influence safety risks on Chinese subway projects are: project management team; contractor-related factors; site underground environment; safety protection during the use of machines; safety management investment; site construction monitoring and measurement; hazard identification and communication; and use of machines in all stages. This indicates that in allocating limited project resources to improve the safety of subway projects, managers should focus on: developing safety knowledge and positive attitudes in leadership teams; formulating effective risk management systems to identify, assess, mitigate, measure and monitor safety risks on site; improving communications with stakeholders about these risks and effectively managing plant, equipment and machinery. Originality/value This research contributes a new multi-stakeholder perspective to the lack of safety research in Chinese subway construction projects. The research findings provide important new insights for policymakers and managers in improving safety outcomes on these major projects, producing potentially significant social and economic benefits for society and the construction industry.

J	Odediran, SJ; Windapo, AO				Odediran, Sunday Julius; Windapo, Abimbola Olukemi			Mitigating Risks in African Construction Markets through the Interactive Behavior of Resources and Capabilities in Multinational Construction Companies and Entry Decisions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						African construction markets; Entry mode; Entry model; International construction; Resources and capabilities; Risk mitigation model; Risk perception; Strategic entry decisions	FOREIGN-MARKET; POLITICAL RISK; EXPORT INTENSITY; JOINT VENTURES; FIRM SIZE; MODE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; CHOICE	The presence of African-based construction companies in African markets is low compared with their foreign counterparts. Unlike local markets, overseas markets exhibit more types of risk. Perceptions of risk in overseas markets differ, and levels of resources and capabilities influence them. Adequate perception of risk also influences entry decisions. This paper examines whether interaction exists between the level of resources and capabilities in South African construction companies (SACCs) and their choice of entry mode in entry decisions, with a view toward mitigating the perceived impact of risks and enhancing ease of entry into African construction markets (ACMs). Research data were collected through a convergent mixed-methods research approach from SACCs graded 8 and 9 in the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) register of contractors in South Africa. It emerged that the significant risks in ACMs are payment risk, volatility in exchange rate and currency, threat of terrorism, legal instability, red tape/legislative bottleneck, and unstable government. Revenues, number of employees, and years of international experience significantly influence SACCs' perception of administrative delays, red tape/legislative bottleneck, and difficulty in doing business in ACMs. Moreover, the perceived impacts of the difficulty of doing business, the threat of terrorism, and political uncertainty influence the choice of joint venture (JV) and contractual arrangement (CA) as ACM entry modes. The study established that an interactive relationship exists between the choice of JV and assets and JV and number of employees and between the choice of CA and number of employees that can mitigate the perceived impact of risks. The paper concludes that as SACCs accumulate financial, human, and experiential capital, their perception of risks in ACMs becomes more favorable. However, adequate perception of risks in markets enhances the strategic choice of entry mode, and the interactions between SACCs' resources and capabilities and decisions on entry into ACMs mitigate the perceived impact of risks. This enables SACCs to compete favorably for business opportunities in ACMs and international space.

Design/methodology/approach The study used the sequential data collection approach through an in-depth semi-structured interview (16 participants) and questionnaire survey (230 participants) to solicit their perceptions from project management practitioners (PMP), contractors and client (government officials) about the factors that lead to Ghanaian Government construction projects. The relative importance index was used to determine the relative importance of the factors identified. This was followed by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement among the participants on their perceptions. Findings In total, 34 factors were identified as the main factors that lead into Ghanaian Government construction projects failure. The top ten most important factors that cause Ghanaian Government construction projects failure are: political interferences, delays in payment, partisan politics, bureaucracy, corruption, poor supervision, lack of commitment by project leaders, poor planning, starting more projects than the government can fund and change in government. The failure factors were grouped into four main themes and found that the most important failure factors are leadership. This is followed by management and administrative practices, resources and external forces, respectively. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to only the public sector, and therefore the findings may not be applicable in the private sector. Practical implications Policy makers and construction PMP would be able to use the findings as a guide during the implementation of government projects in order to reduce and/or avoid government construction projects failure. Originality/value Construction projects failure in developing countries is high. Accordingly, the extant literature has been devoted to identifying the factors that lead to failure; however, they have mainly been discussed from a generic point of view or individual case studies. Researches that focus exclusively on government construction projects in developing countries are rare despite the dynamics in which these projects are implemented. This research extends the construction project management literature by focussing on government construction projects in a developing economy, where there are weak public institutional systems coupled with partisanship politics and bad cultural orientation towards government sector work inherited from a colonial rule.

J	Shahandashti, SM; Ashuri, B				Shahandashti, S. M.; Ashuri, B.			Highway Construction Cost Forecasting Using Vector Error Correction Models	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; COINTEGRATION	Highway construction costs are subject to significant variations over time. These fluctuations are apparent in trends of indices, such as the national highway construction cost index (NHCCI). These variations are problematic for highway contractors because they can result in bid loss or profit loss. They are also problematic for owner organizations, such as State Departments of Transportation (State DOTs), because they can result in hidden price contingencies, delayed or cancelled projects, inconsistency in budgets, and unsteady flow of projects. These problems can be prevented if highway construction costs are forecasted accurately. Existing literature lacks appropriate models to accurately forecast NHCCI. The objective of this research is to identify the leading indicators of NHCCI (i.e.,the explanatory variables of NHCCI that are useful to predict NHCCI), and create appropriate multivariate time series models for forecasting NHCCI through utilizing information available from the identified leading indicators. A pool of 16 candidate (potential) leading indicators of NHCCI, such as crude oil price, number of housing starts, and consumer price index is initially selected based on a comprehensive literature review. The leading indicators of NHCCI are identified from the pool of candidate leading indicators using statistical tests. Based on the unit root tests and Granger causality tests, crude oil price and average hourly earnings in the construction industry are found to be the leading indicators of NHCCI. Based on the results of cointegration tests, Vector Error Correction (VEC) models are created as proper multivariate time series models to forecast NHCCI. The results show that the VEC model including NHCCI and crude oil price pass diagnostic tests. The results also show that multivariate time series models are more accurate than univariate models for forecasting NHCCI in terms of out-of-sample mean absolute prediction error and out-of-sample mean square error. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge in NHCCI forecasting by rigorous identification of the leading indicators of NHCCI and creation of multivariate time series models that are more accurate than the univariate time series models for forecasting NHCCI. It is expected that the proposed forecasting models enhance the theory and practice of highway construction cost forecasting and help cost engineers and capital planners prepare more accurate bids, cost estimates, and budgets for highway projects.

J	Gholizadeh, P; Esmaeili, B; Goodrum, P				Gholizadeh, Pouya; Esmaeili, Behzad; Goodrum, Paul			Diffusion of Building Information Modeling Functions in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; INNOVATION DIFFUSION; BIM ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; REQUIREMENTS; VISUALIZATION; SELECTION; SCHEDULE; ISO-9000	While advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled architects, engineers, and contractors to reduce project time and cost and to improve quality, the diffusion of ICTs has typically been very slow in the construction industry. However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions. Furthermore, the diffusion models showed that the shop-drawing process and facility management functions had the lowest saturation rate in 2014 (below 50%) but have a greater potential for being adopted in coming years. The findings of this study advance knowledge for both researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption process of different BIM functions and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diffusion patterns of ICT innovations in the construction industry.

J	Lahdenpera, P				Lahdenpera, Pertti			Formularising two-stage target-cost arrangements for use in practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Early contractor involvement; Incentive contracts; Price determination; Principal-agent theory; Relational contracting; Target cost		Purpose - Early involvement of the project team with the construction resources seems to be gaining popularity as it aims to improve the cost efficiency of a project as there is significantly more potential to influence the project solution at that point in time. The missing price during early involvement/selection and the principal-agent setting, however, tend to leave the project owner in doubt of the reasonableness of pricing when it is fixed only later after the joint design phase involving the service provider and the owner. The purpose of this paper is to find a solution for this challenge. Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage target-cost (2STC) arrangement has been proposed as the solution. In this model the service provider earns a bonus by suggesting a lower target cost than the reference set at the time of the involvement of the provider. The amount of bonus also impacts the cost over-run risk transferred to the service provider to avoid overly optimistic promises. Besides the initial conceptualisation of the idea, earlier research has also produced a framework for developing and assessing alternative formulations of the 2STC model. By means of mathematical modelling and optimisation and critical review the work seeks to provide formulations that meet the set requirements. Findings - The study establishes concrete formulations that are believed to function as intended with certain reservations. Two potential mechanisms, the constant and variable share models, are generated and presented, and recommendations are given for their use in practice. In the former, the extent of cost efficiency improvement in the development phase has no impact on percentage shares, but in the latter the service provider's relative development bonus and share of cost over-runs are the bigger, the bigger the improvement. Research limitations/implications - The study suggests piloting the formulations in carefully selected projects in order to discover their practical feasibility. Originality/value - The 2STC model is a unique concept and no comparable construct is known to exist. The study produced concrete formulations for a 2STC construct while ensuring and illustrating their functioning to avoid surprises in their use. The study presented in this paper forms the third stage in the overall 2STC development process focussed on benefiting project owners and the industry.

J	Oladinrin, OT; Ho, CMF				Oladinrin, Olugbenga Timo; Ho, Christabel Man-Fong			Embeddedness of codes of ethics in construction organizations	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Ethics; Factor analysis; Organizations; Construction; Embeddedness	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CORPORATE CODES; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTRACTORS; BEHAVIOR; CLIMATE	Purpose - The existence of codes of ethics in most organizations does not seem to have reduced unethical behaviour especially in the construction organizations due to lack of effective ethics management such as embeddedness of ethical codes. The purpose of this paper is to bridge the current knowledge gap by highlighting the principal factors determining the embeddedness of codes of ethics in construction organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires detailing 30 factors determining ethical code embeddedness were sent to professionals in construction organizations in Hong Kong. In total, 160 valid responses were analysed by mean score and exploratory factor analysis. Findings - Based on the mean score, "protecting anyone who exposes alleged wrongdoing", "managers acting as role models" and "giving code standards with explanation to new employees" are the three factors that ranked highest. From the results of factor analysis, six factors were extracted, including; process of code internalization, identification and remover of barriers, process of enacting value, process of accountability, process of coding and process of monitoring. These are processes that enable proper integration of codes of ethics within construction organization. Research limitations/implications - While this study has provided useful information regarding ethical codes, the limitation is inherent in the population of the study in that, percentage representation of construction organizations in Hong Kong could not be presented. This was due to the sensitivity of ethics as perceived by construction practitioners. The authors, at the initial stage, sent invitation letters to several organizations inviting them to participate in the research but they all declined. Therefore, the data collection approach discussed earlier was adopted and the questionnaire was made strictly anonymous which made it difficult to classify organizations that are represented. Nevertheless, it is hoped that this paper will engineer a change in research direction and open up new discussion channels. Originality/value - The results presented in this study provide sufficient evidence and useful pointers to clarify some misconceptions about factors determining code embeddedness. These findings help to clarify what the high-prioritized factors are, and could also be used as an assessment tool to evaluate performance of an organization regarding codes of ethics and thus help to identify areas requiring improvement.

J	Mostaan, K; Ashuri, B				Mostaan, K.; Ashuri, B.			Challenges and Enablers for Private Sector Involvement in Delivery of Highway Public-Private Partnerships in the United States	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Innovative project delivery; Innovative financing mechanisms; Highway procurement; Transportation funding and financing	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INFRASTRUCTURE; PROJECTS; COSTS	Involvement of the private sector in financing and delivery of highway public-private partnerships (P3s) in the United States has experienced various limitations and challenges. The implementation of existing P3 project delivery frameworks by the public sector have neglected the private sector's interests and have resulted in lack of alignment among public and private sector stakeholder institutions across P3 project planning, procurement, and administration. Further, the public sector's variability in P3 program maturity and P3 implementation have entangled the emerging U.S. P3 market into a challenging environment. The purpose of this study is to determine and analyze the underpinnings of private sector involvement in U.S. P3s in the following areas: (1)the major issues and challenges faced by private sector stakeholders in the U.S. P3 market due to the variability in public agencies P3 project delivery process and (2)solutions and strategies for enhancing alignment of public and private sectors and standardizing the public sector's P3 project delivery process. Following a comprehensive content analysis process, 25 P3 experts are identified and selected from organizations that are active in the U.S. P3 market. A structured and consistent interview protocol is utilized to conduct interviews and document the study results. Results indicate that among the identified challenges, regulatory uncertainty and inability of the private sector to be involved in predevelopment phases of transportation projects, lack of a programmatic approach for P3 project development in the public sector, significant transaction costs for P3 projects that involve private financing, and slow shift in mindset and required business processes in transitioning from conventional project delivery to P3 were recognized as primary issues hindering private sector involvement in highway P3s. Among the identified enablers, establishing a P3 program/unit with adequate project finance and procurement expertise, incorporating alternative funding and innovative financing considerations in the planning phase, allowing the use of factoring and asset-based financing methods, and utilizing appropriate performance bond vehicles were recognized as primary recommended opportunities for the U.S. P3 market. The outcome of this study can help state departments of transportation (DOTs), transportation planners, contractors, and financial institutions make more informed decisions when engaging in P3 arrangements.

Travis			BIM-enabled sustainability assessment of material supply decisions	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						TOPSIS; Life cycle assessment; BIM; Supply chain management; Curtain wall; Project constraints	MATERIAL SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; SYSTEMS; CHAIN; LOGISTICS; CONCRETE; CRITERIA; WASTE; MODEL	Purpose - Enhancing sustainability of the supply process of construction materials is challenging and requires accounting for a variety of environmental and social impacts on top of the traditional, mostly economic, impacts associated with a particular decision involved in the management of the supply chain. The economic, environmental, and social impacts associated with various components of a typical supply chain are highly sensitive to project and market specific conditions. The purpose of this paper is to provide decision makers with a methodology to account for the systematic trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social impacts of supply decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a novel framework for sustainability assessment of construction material supply chain decisions by taking advantage of the information made available by customized building information models (BIM) and a number of different databases required for assessment of life cycle impacts. Findings - The framework addresses the hierarchy of decisions in the material supply process, which consists of four levels including material type, source of supply, supply chain structure, and mode of transport. The application is illustrated using a case study. Practical implications - The proposed framework provides users with a decision-making method to select the most sustainable material alternative available for a building component and, thus, may be of great value to different parties involved in design and construction of a building. The multi-dimensional approach in selection process based on various economic, environmental, and social indicators as well as the life cycle perspective implemented through the proposed methodology advocates the life cycle thinking and the triple bottom line approach in sustainability. The familiarity of the new generation of engineers, architects, and contractors with this approach and its applications is essential to achieve sustainability in construction. Originality/value - A decision-making model for supply of materials is proposed by integrating the BIM-enabled life cycle assessment into supply chain and project constraints management. The integration is achieved through addition of a series of attributes to typical BIM. The framework is supplemented by a multi-attribute decision-making module based on the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to account for the trade-offs between different economic and environmental impacts associated with the supply decisions.

J	Baalousha, Y; Celik, T				Baalousha, Yousef; Celik, Tahir			INTEGRATED WEB-BASED DATA WAREHOUSE AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS SYSTEM FOR UNIT PRICE ANALYSIS WITH INFLATION ADJUSTMENT	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						web data warehouse; unit price analysis; artificial neural networks; inflation; MATLAB	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; MODEL	Estimating is a fundamental part of construction projects. Accurate cost estimate is the single most important element involved in the series of events that leads to a profitable completion of a contract in construction industry. The success or failure of a project depends on the accuracy of cost estimation. A cost estimate becomes more difficult and more complicated under inflationary medium. An unpredictable inflation rate and long progress payment delay during this period makes the budgeting function very difficult, if not impossible. The cost estimation process uses lots of data. The availability of the appropriate data at the appropriate time is one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the cost estimation. As the complexity of the estimating task increases computerized system becomes increasingly important. The estimator should develop a good system of estimating forms and procedures that exactly meet the requirements of the project, and that is understood and accessible by all team members. This system should provide the ability to define material, labor hour and equipment hour quantities required for the project. Material, labor, and equipment unit costs are then applied to the bill of quantities. This paper presents An Integrated Web-Based Data Warehouse and Artificial Neural Networks Model for Unit Price Analysis with Inflation Adjustment system called "DANUP". Web facilities and database management capabilities of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 are applied to create a data warehouse which is mainly aimed to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous databases and other information sources. The System also supports integrated cost index for adjusting the effect of inflation during estimating process. An artificial neural network model for forecasting the cost indices in Turkey for the project period has been developed. A construction project takes relatively long time to complete, effective communication among the project participants during the project period is important. A web based system is developed to facilitate the collection of construction cost information and communication. The web based system focuses on demonstrating the potential of data centric web data bases in enhancing the communication process during project execution. End users can access the database through the interne and perform certain transactions according to their authorization.

J	Aibinu, AA; Dassanayake, D; Chan, TK; Thangaraj, R				Aibinu, Ajibade A.; Dassanayake, Dharma; Chan, Toong-Khuan; Thangaraj, Ram			Cost estimation for electric light and power elements during building design A neural network approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multiple regression analysis; Prediction; Modelling; Estimating; Cost estimates; Neural net	REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; ESTIMATING MODELS; PROJECTS	Purpose - The study reported in this paper proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) as viable alternative to regression for predicting the cost of building services elements at the early stage of design. The purpose of this paper is to develop, test and validate ANN models for predicting the costs of electrical services components. Design/Methodology/Approach - The research is based on data mining of over 200 building projects in the office of a medium size electrical contractor. Of the over 200 projects examined, 71 usable data were found and used for the ANN modeling. Regression models were also explored using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics Software 21, for the purpose of comparison with the ANN models. Findings - The findings show that the cost forecasting models based on ANN algorithm are more viable alternative to regression models for predicting the costs of light wiring, power wiring and cable pathways. The ANN prediction errors achieved are 6.4, 4.5 and 4.5 per cent for the three models developed whereas the regression models were insignificant. They did not fit any of the known regression distributions. Practical implications - The validated ANN models were converted to a desktop application (user interface) package - "Intelligent Estimator." The application is important because it can be used by construction professionals to reliably and quickly forecast the costs of power wiring, light wiring and cable pathways using building variables that are readily available or measurable during design stage, i.e. fully enclosed covered area, unenclosed covered area, internal perimeter length and number of floors. Originality/value - Previous studies have concluded that the methods of estimating the budget for building structure and fabric work are inappropriate for use with mechanical and electrical services. Thus, this study is unique because it applied the ANN modeling technique, for the first time, to cost modeling of electrical services components for building using real world data. The analysis shows that ANN is a better alternative to regression models for predicting cost of services elements because the relationship between cost and the cost drivers are non-linear and distribution types are unknown.

There is currently no framework for implementing lean construction specifically tailored to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) construction industry. Existing lean construction frameworks are focussed on other countries and are less applicable in the KSA due to differences in socio-cultural and operational contexts. Design/methodology/approach This study employs the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique for data collection and analysis. First, following a survey of 282 construction professionals, 12 critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing lean construction in the KSA construction industry were identified by Sarhan et al. (2016). Second, 16 of these professionals who have 15 years or more experience were exclusively selected to examine the contextual relationship among the 12 CSFs. A row and column questionnaire was used for a pairwise comparison of the CSFs. A matrix of cross-impact multiplications (MICMAC) was applied to analyse the questionnaire data to develop an ISM model that can serve as a framework for implementing lean construction. Third, the framework was subjected to further validation by interviewing five experts to check for conceptual inconsistencies and to confirm the applicability of the framework in the context of the KSA construction industry. Findings The findings reveal that the CSFs are divided into four clusters: autonomous, linkage, dependent and driving clusters. Additionally, the findings reveal seven hierarchies of inter-relationships among the CSFs. The order of practical application of the CSFs descends from the seventh hierarchy to the first hierarchy. Originality/value The new framework is a significant advancement over existing lean construction frameworks as it employs an ISM technique to specify the hierarchical relationships among the different factors that contribute to the successful implementation of lean construction. The primary value of this study is the development of a new framework that reflects the socio-cultural and operational contexts in the KSA construction industry and can guide the successful implementation of lean construction. Therefore, construction industry operators such as contractors, consultants, government departments and professionals can rely on the framework to implement lean construction more effectively and successfully.

J	Nielsen, KR				Nielsen, KR			Risk management: Lessons from six continents	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Globally, the need to construct new pipelines is increasing dramatically, both on shore and off shore. So too are the risks that are faced in attempting to meet project and stakeholder goals. Not meeting such goals has even greater consequences as a result. Project execution from potential identification of its need through execution and in-service use to decommissioning requires project management processes and tools at all stages of this timeline. Today, global project management standards are being developed, Promulgated, taught, and applied. The reason is obvious. Project management is an essential function that is the single greatest means of assuring that a project is successful in meeting all objectives from cost to functionality. It also is the single greatest means of assuring that a party with a role in the project execution (developer, owner-employer, engineer-constructor, contractor-subcontractor, vendor, operator-User, etc.) achieves its commercial, professional, and related goals. Project management is the most widely found cause for failure to meet project objectives and goals. Within today's project management bodies of knowledge, risk management techniques are evolving as a key tool to maximize achievement of goals, yet application of risk management in pipeline projects is not focused on a broad spectrum of the risks being experienced throughout the project. Ultimately, risk management application provides the ability to identify risks, determine characteristics of risk emergence, allow measurement through control systems, and apply enhanced project management methods for improved achievement of project and stakeholder goals throughout the life of a pipeline project. Risk management is essential to recognize and develop input to meet the different needs for the project and respective stakeholders' Success throughout the seasons of a pipeline project's life-a project's spring season (from the identification of a possible need that may become a project to its financing/funding), a project's summer season (project execution), a project's fall season (project use), and a project's winter season (sustainable recycling). This paper develops the types of risks for eight categories of risk factors being experienced, tools being used, application options and successes, and the contexts needed for Success. The basis for these approaches is the global project management experience of the writer over the last three decades, on six continents (on-shore and off-shore), including oil and gas, water, and wastewater.

J	Alshorafa, R; Ergen, E				Alshorafa, Raif; Ergen, Esin			Determining the level of development for BIM implementation in large-scale projects A multi-case study	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integration; Case study; Building information modelling; International practice; Information and communication technology (ICT) applications	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; ADOPTION	Purpose Proper definition of level of development (LOD) is one of the significant issues in building information modeling (BIM) applications; however, it is still not adequately addressed during BIM implementations. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and describe the current practice in defining the LOD in large-scale BIM-based projects and identify the challenges and solutions that were provided. Design/methodology/approach Four case studies were performed at four different types of large-scale projects to depict the current practice in determining the LOD and the required properties of elements that are going to be included in a BIM model. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were performed to collect information from six professionals from four international firms. Findings The findings of the case studies revealed that defining LOD is an ambiguous process and requires high-cumulated experience. The results provide the challenges, adopted solutions and lessons learned. It was highlighted that the cost of including an element or related information in the model should be compared to the benefit of having that information in the model from the perspective of defined BIM uses. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on the projects that were performed in three developing countries. However, the main contractors were international companies and the construction management firms were well-known companies in the USA. In the future, additional case studies can be performed in other countries to identify similarities and regional differences. Practical implications - The results of this study can be used to highlight the current needs in determining the LOD and guide the efforts for developing standards and policies in the AEC sector to streamline BIM adoption process in practice. The practitioners can utilize the findings of this study to increase their efficiency in adopting BIM and to decrease the time loss and cost overruns. Originality/value Most of the previous studies investigated the benefits and challenges when adopting BIM, and few of them considered LOD definition as a core part of this process. This study specifically investigated the current practice in determining the LOD and the required properties of elements that are going to be included in a BIM model. It also described the applied solutions and lessons learned in the case studies.

J	Loosemore, M; Higgon, D; Osborne, J				Loosemore, Martin; Higgon, David; Osborne, Joanne			Managing new social procurement imperatives in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration; Intermediary; Social value; Social procurement; Social innovation	SECTOR; ENTERPRISES	Purpose This paper responds to the need for more construction project management research in the emerging field of social procurement. It contributes by exploring the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and project-based intermediation in meeting new social procurement imperatives. Design/methodology/approach A thematic exploratory case study analysis is presented of seventy-three interviews undertaken with stakeholders involved in a unique project-based intermediary developed by a major Australian construction company to leverage the power of cross-sector collaboration in response to social procurement imperatives on its projects, based on semi-structured interviews with 33 disadvantaged job seekers, 40 organisational stakeholders (employment agencies; not-for-profits, Indigenous, disability and refugee support organisations; training organisations; subcontractors; government agencies and departments; community organisations) and observational and documentary data over the duration of a unique project-based intermediary called a Connectivity Centre, developed by a major Australian contractor to deliver on its emerging social procurement requirements. Findings The results show that cross-sector collaboration within the construction industry can produce highlight numerous cognitive, behavioural, health, situational and affective social impacts for the project community and shared-value benefits for the range of organisations involved. However, it is found that cross-sector collaboration through project-based intermediation in a construction context is challenging due to the fragmented and dynamic nature of construction project teams and the communities they have to engage with. Encouraging people and organisations to collaborate who operate in industries and organisations with different and sometimes competing institutional logics and objectives (even if they are linked by common values) requires a set of knowledge, competencies and relationships not recognised in current global project management competency frameworks. Originality/value This research contributes new insights to the emerging but embryonic body of research into construction social procurement by demonstrating the value of emerging theories of social procurement, social value, cross-sector collaboration and intermediation in enhancing our currently limited understanding of the complex challenges involved in responding to new social procurement requirements in the construction industry. It explores and documents the potential value of project-based intermediaries in developing and managing the new cross-sector relationships, roles, relational competencies and practices, which are required to effectively respond to and measure the impact of emerging social procurement policies in the construction industry. These findings have a potentially significant social impact by providing new insights for policymakers and the construction industry, to optimise the industry's response to emerging social procurement policies.

J	Mok, KY; Shen, GQ; Yang, R				Mok, Ka Yan; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Yang, Rebecca			Stakeholder complexity in large scale green building projects: A holistic analysis towards a better understanding	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder; Case study; Social network analysis; Green building project	SOCIAL NETWORK; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	Purpose In response to the world's rising awareness on sustainability, industry players and policymakers are devoting great efforts to bolster green building developments. Every green building project (GBP) involves numerous stakeholders and potentially incompatible concerns. Despite the associated environmental, economic and social benefits, GBP developments have often confronted managerial barriers which are actually emerged from stakeholders - the actual key determinants of a project. Holistically analyzing the complexity of stakeholders in GBPs is, therefore, crucial to improving GBP management and achieving greater sustainability for all involved. The purpose of this paper is to analyze stakeholder complexity in large GBPs using a holistic framework which integrates both empirical and rationalistic analytical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The complexity of stakeholders in GBPs can be considered from three aspects - identifying stakeholders, assessing stakeholder interactions and analyzing stakeholder concerns. The proposed stakeholder analysis framework uses both empirical methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and rationalistic methods (e.g. chain referral sampling and social network analysis) to analyze GBP stakeholder complexity. Case study of a lab-enabled commercial GBP in Hong Kong was undertaken to illustrate the framework. Findings The framework enables a holistic, objective and effective stakeholder analysis; leading GBP leaders toward a complete understanding of project stakeholder complexity. The case study findings bring managerial insights to GBP leaders on the general SNA-related stakeholder dynamics and the important stakeholder concerns, of large Hong Kong GBPs. The findings diagnose general connectivity structures of GBP stakeholders, identify influential and peripheral actors in GBP information exchange, and suggest clues to improve their dynamics. In addition, ten key stakeholder concerns were identified, including comprehensive governmental standards and procedures, clear sustainability goals at the outset, effective stakeholder engagement, adequate design flexibility, and a can-do attitude of contractors and consultants - which are all vital for successful GBP development. The underlying reasons of these concerns and recommendations to addressing them were also discussed. Originality/value Many existing GBP stakeholder studies appear to use a single analytical perspective to assess project stakeholder complexity, but this may not gain a full understanding. The holistic stakeholder analysis framework used herein combines empiricism and rationalism. It helps to bring GBP leaders and implementers toward a more informed project decision making, a more thorough understanding of stakeholder complexity, as well as a more effective engagement of stakeholders.

J	Nath, ND; Behzadan, AH; Paal, SG				Nath, Nipun D.; Behzadan, Amir H.; Paal, Stephanie G.			Deep learning for site safety: Real-time detection of personal protective equipment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Personal protective equipment (PPE); Construction safety; Deep learning; Transfer learning; Image dataset; Real-time object detection	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONSTRUCTION; OBJECTS; MODEL	The leading causes of construction fatalities include traumatic brain injuries (resulted from fall and electrocution) and collisions (resulted from struck by objects). As a preventive step, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) of workers (e.g., hard hat and vest) at all times. This paper presents three deep learning (DL) models built on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture to verify PPE compliance of workers; i.e., if a worker is wearing hard hat, vest, or both, from image/video in real-time. In the first approach, the algorithm detects workers, hats, and vests and then, a machine learning model (e.g., neural network and decision tree) verifies if each detected worker is properly wearing hat or vest. In the second approach, the algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and verifies PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In the third approach, the algorithm first detects only the workers in the input image which are then cropped and classified by CNN-based classifiers (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception) according to the presence of PPE attire. All models are trained on an in-house image dataset that is created using crowd-sourcing and web-mining. The dataset, named Pictor-v3, contains similar to 1,500 annotated images and similar to 4,700 instances of workers wearing various combinations of PPE components. It is found that the second approach achieves the best performance, i.e., 72.3% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 11 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a good candidate for running on light-weight mobile devices. The closest alternative in terms of performance (67.93% mAP) is the third approach where VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception classifiers are assembled in a Bayesian framework.

J	Davies, A; MacAulay, S; DeBarro, T; Thurston, M				Davies, Andrew; MacAulay, Samuel; DeBarro, Tim; Thurston, Mark			Making Innovation Happen in a Megaproject: London's Crossrail Suburban Railway System	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						megaproject; innovation; action research; strategy; engaged scholarship; project management	PROJECTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; STAKEHOLDERS; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; COMPLEXITY	Isolated pockets of innovation can be found in projectssuch as the novel solution used to redesign the Velodrome roof during the London 2012 Olympicsbut there have been few, if any, systematic efforts to manage innovation in a megaproject. This paper presents the initial findings of an ongoing three-year (2012-2014) action research project between Crossrail and researchers at Imperial College London and University College London. Action research is well suited to a setting where an intervention is required to diagnose and solve an organizational problem and produce scientific findings (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Van de Ven, 2007). Undertaken in collaboration with practitioners, the aim of action research is to transform the research setting through a process of critical inquiry and action. Our engagement with Crossrail aimed to formulate and implement an innovation strategy to improve the performance and outcomes of the project. We identified four stagesor windows of opportunityto intervene to generate, discover, and implement innovation in a megaproject: (1) the bridging window during the front-end when ideas, learning, and practices from other projects and industries can be used to create an innovative project process, organization, and governance structure; (2) the engaging window, when tendering and contractual processes can be used by the client to encourage contractors and suppliers to develop novel ideas and innovative solutions; (3) the leveraging window, when all the parties involvedclients, delivery partners, and suppliersare mobilized to develop novel ideas, new technologies, and organizational practices to improve performance; and (4) the exchanging window at the back-end, when ideas and resources for innovation can be (re)combined with those of other projects in the wider innovation ecosystem to improve performance. The first two stages had largely occurred when we became involved in the Crossrail project in 2012. Our intervention addressed the final two stages, when we assisted in the development and implementation of an innovation strategy. Core to this strategy was a coordinated mobilization of the innovative capabilities across the project supply chain. Though, to be successful, this approach had to be open enough to span organizational boundaries beyond the supply chain, reaching into the broader ecosystem. The four windows provide a valuable new heuristic for organizing innovation in megaprojects, pointing to areas where project managers can craft targeted innovation interventions and compare their efforts with those of others.

J	Lahdenpera, P				Lahdenpera, Pertti			Preparing a framework for two-stage target-cost arrangement formulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Early contractor involvement; Incentive contracts; Price determination; Principal-agent theory; Relational contracting; Target cost	DESIGN SCIENCE; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; RISK; TRUST; COOPERATION; PERFORMANCE	Purpose - Early involvement of the project team with the construction resources seems to be gaining popularity as it aims to improve the cost efficiency of a project as there is significantly more potential to influence the project solution at that point in time. The missing price during early involvement/selection and the principal-agent setting, however, tend to leave the project owner in doubt of the reasonableness of pricing when it is fixed only later after the joint design phase involving the service provider and the owner. The purpose of this paper is to find a solution for this challenge. Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage target-cost (2STC) arrangement has been proposed as the solution. In this model the service provider earns a bonus by suggesting a lower target cost than the reference set at the time of the involvement of the provider. The amount of bonus also impacts the cost over-run risk transferred to the service provider to avoid overly optimistic promises. The proposition encompassed just the basic idea, and did not really delve into actual model formulations and their functioning under practical realities. Therefore, the required work is presented here in the form of a conceptual, discursive study focusing on relevant theories and empirical findings from major investment projects. Findings - The study produces a requirement framework for the 2STC model to allow functioning models to be formulated and tested. The framework incorporates numerous requirements, constraints and a suggested path forward. For instance, while the model may not be manipulatable, it must incentivise the service provider to seek more cost-effective project solutions, be feasible also from the view of the project owner and adapt to various project risk profiles and ranges of efficiency improvements. Research limitations/implications - The study suggests more concrete model formulations to be provided under the guidance of the presented framework. Originality/value - The 2STC model is a unique concept and no comparable construct is known to exist. Besides the requirement framework, the study also strengthens the foundation of and need for the 2STC model by a thorough survey of its theoretical linkages. Accordingly, the study presented in this paper forms the second stage in the overall 2STC development process focused on benefiting project owners and the industry.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for determining the duration for rural bituminous surfaced road projects. Design/methodology/approach - Data for 22 completed bituminous surfaced road projects from the Department of Feeder Roads (rural road agency) were collected and analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) and ANN techniques. The data collected were final payment certificates which contained payment bill of quantities (BOQ) of work items executed for the selected completed road projects. The executed quantities in the BOQ were the total quantities of work items for site clearance, earthworks, in-situ concrete, reinforcement, form work, gravel sub-base/base, bitumen, road line markings and furniture, length of road and actual durations for each of the completed projects. The PCA was first employed to reduce the data in order to identify a smaller number of variables (or significant quantities) that constitute 81.58 percent of the total variance of the collected data. The ANN was then used to develop the network using the identified significant quantities as input variables and the actual durations as output variables. Findings - The coefficient of correlation (R) and determination (R-2) as well as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained show that construction professionals can use the developed ANN model for determining duration. The study shows that the best neural network is the multi-layer perceptron with a structure 3-38-1 based on a back propagation feed forward algorithm. The developed network produces good results with an MAPE of 17.56 percent or an average accuracy of 82.44 percent. Research limitations/implications - Apart from the fact that the sample size was small, the developed model does not incorporate the implications of other likely factors that may affect contract duration. Practical implications - The outcome of this study is to help construction professionals to fix realistic contract duration for road construction projects before signing a contract. Such realistic contract duration would help reduce time overruns as well as the payment of liquidated and ascertained damages by contractors for late completion. Originality/value - This paper proposes an alternative way of determining the duration for road construction projects using the total quantities of work items in a final payment BOQ. The approach is based on the PCA and ANN model of quantities of work items of completed road projects.

J	Mahalingam, A; Kashyap, R; Mahajan, C				Mahalingam, Ashwin; Kashyap, Rahul; Mahajan, Charudatta			An evaluation of the applicability of 4D CAD on construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						4D CAD; Commercial projects; Infrastructure projects; Benefits; Visualization; Constructability; Project progress review		4D CAD models that integrate physical 3D elements with time, have been used to visualize construction processes in several projects worldwide. 4D models have been used and have been shown to have benefits over processes that span the entire lifecycle of a project such as collaboration with stakeholders, making design decisions, assessing project constructability, identifying spatial conflicts in construction and so on. Despite these benefits, several organizational and project-specific barriers have hindered the widespread adoption of 4D CAD. In order to reconcile the theoretical benefits of 4D models with the practical difficulties faced in implementation, there is an urgent need to explore the implementation of 4D models on construction sites as well as the perceptions of intended users/beneficiaries towards this implementation. This paper aims to address this need and contribute to our understanding of how 4D models must be introduced, positioned and implemented on construction sites, so as to maximize both their acceptability and their usefulness. We describe two 4D models of infrastructure projects and two 4D models of commercial projects that have been built and implemented. Through a process of structured and unstructured interviewing the paper gauges the response of project participants across various organizational levels on each of these projects as to the usefulness of 4D in project planning and control. Through qualitative and statistical analysis of the data we establish that 4D CAD is likely to be most beneficial in the project shaping or planning stage and in the construction stage. In the project shaping stage, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in communicating construction plans and processes to clients, while during the construction phase, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in comparing the constructability of work methods visually in order to detect conflicts or clashes, and as a visual tool for contractors, clients, subcontractors and vendors to review and plan project progress. Further, upper management and site workers are more likely to use and derive benefits from the visualization of processes using 4D given their lack of site related knowledge or skills, while construction professionals who are more construction-savvy are more likely to appreciate and benefit from the analytical and planning aids that 4D simulations provide during the construction phase. However, it is likely that despite these benefits 4D CAD models might not diffuse through the construction industry unless 4D modelling and analysis is integrated into existing project planning approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on future 4D software development that seeks to bring about such integration and leverages the benefits of 4D CAD to bring about improved operational efficiencies on construction sites.

J	Badi, SM; Pryke, SD				Badi, Sulafa M.; Pryke, Stephen D.			Assessing the quality of collaboration towards the achievement of Sustainable Energy Innovation in PFI school projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Alignment of objectives; Complex Product Systems (CoPS); Effectiveness of communication; Private Finance Initiative (PFI); Project-collaboration quality; Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI)	RENEWABLE ENERGY; CONSTRUCTION; USER; PARTICIPATION; TECHNOLOGIES; PARTNERSHIPS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the quality of collaboration towards Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI) in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects. While the capacity of PFI to encourage collaboration towards innovation is largely advocated by its proponents; however, it remains to be supported by empirical evidence. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting the Complex Product System (CoPS) innovation management model, the authors assess the quality of collaboration at the interface between the innovation superstructure of public sector clients and users, and the innovation infrastructure of private sector designers, contractors and operators. Two interactional elements are examined upon which the quality of collaboration is assessed: openness of communication and alignment of objectives. The authors apply the model to four new-built PFI school projects within the context of the UK government Building Schools for the Future Programme. Semi-structured interviews with total of 50 key stakeholders were used as the primary data collection method. Findings - PFI has introduced a number of problematic issues weakening collaborative efforts towards innovation in the project environment. Particularly, the study underlines the restricting internal contractual relationships within the integrated Project Company and the misalignment of Design-Construction-Operation sustainability objectives. It also highlights ineffective communication with public sector clients and users brought in by the restricted nature of PFI engagement processes as well as the misalignment of public sector-private sector sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative nature of the chosen research methodology limits the ability to generalise. The research findings need to be confirmed or rejected by means of quantitative research as representative of all PFI projects. Practical implications - The study emphasizes the public authority's role in relation to providing the necessary conditions for the creation of a collaborative environment conducive to SEI in PFI projects. Originality/value - The study was able to expand the understanding of innovation and collaboration management processes in PFI projects in three respects: First, addressing the limited attention to innovation in PFI research, the study is the first to examine the quality of collaboration in PFI projects towards the implementation SEI. Second, examining the quality of collaboration in PFI projects through the lens of CoPS provides a new understanding of sustainability innovation and strongly indicates that the CoPS model should be expanded to account for the dynamics of innovation processes in the procurement of sustainable CoPS. Third, the explorative nature of the study was useful in generating research hypotheses that can form the basis for future research on SEI in PFI projects.

J	Sospeter, NG; Rwelamila, PMD; Gimbi, J				Sospeter, Nyamagere Gladys; Rwelamila, Pantaleo M. D.; Gimbi, Joaqium			Project management challenges for post-disaster reconstruction projects in Angola: a public sector perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Angola; Challenges; Post-disaster reconstruction (PDR); Project management; Public sector	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION; BUILDING BACK; DISASTER; INFRASTRUCTURE; RECOVERY; PROCUREMENT; EARTHQUAKE; LESSONS; ACEH	Purpose Despite the extensive research on post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP), there is a paucity of studies that examine critical challenges for the project practices in post-war-developing countries, particularly, Africa. The purpose of this research is to investigate the key project management challenges impacting the post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP) during the construction and planning stages in Angola, with an aim to fill the knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach The primary data was collected from 130 project management practitioners working with planning, provincial government organisations including consultants, and contractors within the Angolan public sectors organisations. Response data was subjected to descriptive statistics, mean scores, and inferential statistics (One samplet-tests) and Kendall's concordance. Findings The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of the ranking of the 21challenges affecting the PDRP among the groups; with statistically significant differences amongst the 10 challenges. Based on the overall sample, 6 out of 10 critical challenges are between (24-25) levels of agreement close to the mean. The results of the mean score ranking indicate that "working with poor or restricted access to location", "project culture that fits the needs of local people"; "improving the capacity of local government", "minimizing the negative effects of local people" and "relocation issues by establishing property rights during the reconstruction project" were the five critical challenges to managing PDRP whereas "improving information and communication processes", "securing adequate resources (material and machinery)", "dealing with rising costs of materials and labour" were considered to be the least critical. Research limitations/implications The study was restricted to one province and Country (out of 18) namely, Luanda, Angola. Therefore, the findings may not be generalized to public sector organisations operating in different countries with different contexts, political settings and disaster complexities. Practical implications The establishment of challenges in PDRPs helps the key stakeholders by providing the foundation to project teams to address the challenges during planning and construction stages, and thus improving project delivery in the future. Understanding the uniqueness of PDRPs and interdependency of project management from the implementing organization is of particular value for the managers of future projects and other decision-makers, especially in the emerging countries. Moreover, the findings could be used to reflect on the need to formulate policies appropriate to post disaster environments, which among other issues could address building policies, which could include land ownership regulations and procedures together with property rights. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge on the subject within a previously unexplored post-war context with a focus on public organizations perspective. The study provides insights on the challenges affecting the post-disaster reconstruction across the Angolan public sector.	[Sospeter, Nyamagere Gladys; Rwelamila, Pantaleo M.

J	El Hajj, C; Montes, GM; Jawad, D				El Hajj, Claudette; Martinez Montes, German; Jawad, Dima			An overview of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa developing countries	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modeling; BIM; Barriers; Limitations; Construction industry	INNOVATION; IMPLEMENTATION	Purpose In an attempt to attain a better understanding of the research work on building information modeling (BIM) adoption, this study aims to examine the criticality of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) developing countries from the lens of the sociotechnical theory. Further, the study investigates the differences in the perceptions of various constructions players (owners, contractors and designers) to BIM barriers, as well as possible discrepancies in the perception of BIM users and non-BIM users to the significance of the perceived constraints. Design/methodology/approach To reach this aim, the study starts with a systematic evaluation and a critical review of the literature on BIM barriers. A set of 22 BIM adoption limitations was drawn from the literature which was used to design the survey. To capture a broad perception, a mixed approach was used, and data were collected through an interview study and a survey involving Architecture, Engineering and Construction professionals in the MENA construction sector. The collected data were analyzed using the mean score, standard deviation and nonparametric tests. The further principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the barriers to uncover the latent factors of BIM barriers. Findings The actors ranked the barriers as follows: lack of knowledge and BIM awareness, commercial issues and investment cost, lack of skills and BIM specialist, interoperability and lack of client demand. The examination of the PCA resulted in four underlying BIM limitation factors namely: human, technological, structural and financial. The analysis of the ranking indicated that 16 of the 22 barriers are considered critical in the MENA area. The results of the Mann-Whitney test indicated that there is a statistically significant difference in perceptions of BIM users and nonuser for seven barriers, pointing out that users care most about the financial barriers; however, nonusers are mostly concerned with structural and technological barriers. However, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there is no statistically significant difference in the perceptions of the three categories of stakeholders in ranking all BIM barriers. Practical implications The outcomes will back policymakers and construction participants with the knowledge to develop policy propositions that can positively affect BIM adoption in the construction industry. The significance of this study lies in being one of the very first explorative investigations that comparatively and empirically explored BIM adoption barriers across the whole MENA developing countries. Originality/value While several research studies have examined BIM adoption barriers in various countries, none to the best of the authors' knowledge have attempted to study the whole MENA region as one entity, and none highlighted the impact of user's roles on their perception of adoption barriers within their community. The results contribute to the discussion of the relationship among practitioners' level of involvement in BIM projects and their perception of adoption barriers which is underrepresented in extant studies. The above can assist with prioritizing the barriers that are considered to be more significant given the characteristics of the community under study. The result revealed the value of the structural and human attributes in prioritizing BIM adoption barriers within the MENA construction industry.

J	Menassa, C; Mora, FP; Pearson, N				Menassa, Carol; Mora, Feniosky Pena; Pearson, Neil			Study of Real Options with Exogenous Competitive Entry to Analyze Dispute Resolution Ladder Investments in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Change orders; Claims; Construction costs; Cost analysis; Dispute resolution; Benefit-cost ratios; Mathematical models		Architecture, engineering, and construction industry participants often find it pragmatic to implement a project-specific dispute resolution ladder (DRL) as a managerial tool to assist in the prompt resolution of claims and change orders (CCOs) that might arise during the project construction phase. This project-specific DRL consists of a single or multiple alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques that require capital expenditures to cover the expenses incurred by the owner's/contractor's employees and third-party neutrals. If a project-specific DRL is properly chosen, then the capital expenditures are outweighed by the expected benefits from the DRL implementation; namely, prompt resolution of the CCOs without incurring excessive cost overruns on an already financially stressed project budget, as well as avoiding the escalation of the claims to a dispute that requires long protracted litigation for final settlement. Typically, the decision as to which ADR techniques to include in the project-specific DRL is undertaken during the project planning phase prior to the actual occurrence of the CCOs. In this case, the project owner decide to invest in a DRL in exchange for the expected savings in the project. This decision regarding the project-specific DRL is usually done based on the experience of the project parties with the ADR techniques. However, such a decision needs to be guided by a financial tool that allows the project owner to evaluate alternative DRLs and choose the most economically feasible alternative based on the project and ADR characteristics. In this paper, a financial model is developed to evaluate DRL implementations in construction projects by drawing analogies from real option theory with exogenous competitive entry. More specifically, the occurrence of a given CCO will result in a reduction in the value of expected savings in the project due to DRL implementation. This is similar to the reduction in the gross value of a capital investment project in a commercial property due to competitive entry by another similar commercial property developer in the market. At the same time, the CCO resolution due to an effective DRL implementation will allow project owner to recover part of the losses in the expected savings in the project due to the DRL implementation. The model presented in this paper takes into account the characteristics of the various ADR techniques included in the project-specific DRL, and the characteristics of the CCOs occurring during the construction phase of the project. A case study of a real construction project is used to illustrate the practical implementation of the model. The results indicate that for this case project and from a financial point of view, the investment in the chosen project-specific DRL was not worthwhile because of the high uncertainty in the project, and the low effectiveness of the selected DRL. These conditions did not provide the owner with the anticipated advantage of the DRL implementation in reducing the value of the CCOs occurring in the project. At the same time the cost of the DRL implementation exceeded the actual savings attained in the project.

J	Kassem, MA; Khoiry, MA; Hamzah, N				Kassem, Mukhtar A.; Khoiry, Muhamad Azry; Hamzah, Noraini			Theoretical review on critical risk factors in oil and gas construction projects in Yemen	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction project; Oil and gas; Yemen; Risk factors	COST OVERRUNS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; DELAY; TIME; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; MODEL	Purpose The oil and gas construction projects are affected negatively by the drop in oil price in recent years. Thus, most engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies are opting to optimize the project mainly to mitigate the source of risks in construction to achieve the project expectation. Risk factors cause a threat to the project objectives regarding time, cost and quality. It is additionally a vital component in deviating from the client's expectation of productivity, safety and standards. This research aims to investigate the causes of risk in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review from various sources including books, conference proceedings, the Internet project management journals and oil and gas industry journals was conducted to achieve the objectives of this study. This initial work was predicated strictly on a literature review and the judgments of experts to develop the risk factor framework for the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Findings The authors found a few studies related to risk factors in oil and gas construction projects and shared a similar view about general construction projects. However, only a fraction of the factors accepted have included the variances of other studies on a regional basis or specific countries, such as the Yemen situation, due to the differences between the general construction industry and oil and gas industry. Moreover, the factors of these attributes were still accepted due to their applicability to the oil and gas industry, and no significant variances existed between countries. Research has indicated that 51 critical factors cause risks in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Such risk factors can be divided into two major groups: (1) internal risk factors, including seven critical sources of risks, namely client, contractor, consultant, feasibility study and design, tendering and contract, resources and material supply and project management; and (2) external risk factors, including six sources of critical risk factors, namely national economic, political risk, local people, environment and safety, security risk and force-majeure-related risk factors. A risk factor framework was developed to identify the critical risk factors in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to the oil and gas construction projects. Practical implications Practically, this study highlights the risk factors that cause a negative effect on the success of oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. The identification of these factors is the first step in the risk management process to develop strategic responses for risks and enhance the chances of project success. Social implications The identification of risks factors that cause the failure of construction projects helps develop response strategies for these risks, thereby increasing the chances of project success reflected in the oil and gas sector, which is a main tributary of the national economy in developing countries. Originality/value This research is the pioneer for future investigations into this vital economic sector. Given the lack of resources and studies in the field of construction projects for the Yemeni oil and gas sector, the Yemeni government, oil companies and researchers in this field are expected to benefit from the results of this study. The critical risk factors specific to the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen should be further investigated with focus only on Yemen and its oil and gas industry players.

J	Alade, K; Windapo, AO				Alade, Kehinde; Windapo, Abimbola Olukemi			Developing effective 4IR leadership framework for construction organisations	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						4IR; 4IR leadership; Construction; Effective leadership; South Africa	EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE; TRAITS; STYLES; PERSONALITY	Purpose Globally, the business organisations are experiencing a transformation due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The need for an effective 4IR leadership has placed new demands on organisations to develop and select leaders to effectively lead the organisations in the 4IR era. Hence, it becomes important to understand the attributes for an effective 4IR leadership. This study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. The hypothesised relationships from the framework were tested using a survey of 416 senior construction executives across the nine provinces of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the study objectives, an online survey was sent to construction firms across the nine provinces of South Africa. "Construction", for the purpose of this study comprised building and civil engineering firms listed on the construction industry development board (cidb) register of contractors in South Africa. The target group was the upper echelon executives, i.e. Chairman, CEOs, managing directors and chief operating officers, and the survey was directed to contact e-mail of the study samples. The professional service providers (architects, consultants and surveyors) were not part of the survey sample. The database of the organisational leaders was obtained from the cidb. The online survey was created on the 23rd of August 2019 and closed on the 23rd of April 2020, thereby making the duration of the survey eight months. The total number of respondents at the time of closure of the survey was four hundred and sixteen (416). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of the results. Findings This study validates the effective 4IR leadership framework as proposed by Alade and Windapo (2019) by empirically examining relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership. The findings from this study have shown that effective 4IR leadership is positively associated with leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Hence, an effective 4IR leader must spread the knowledge and understanding of the 4IR opportunities and threats in the organisations. The leader must ensure that the executives in the construction organisation become change conversant and ensure that the employees acquire 4IR skills. Multiple leadership intelligence is essential to effective 4IR leadership. These multiple intelligence are the ability to adapt knowledge and skills to different situations, ability to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, a high level of understanding, ability to process and analyse information and ability to utilise knowledge from many disciplinary boundaries. Research limitations/implications This study is focused on construction business organisations in South Africa. As such, similar studies on 4IR leadership effectiveness can be carried out in other countries and across other organisations. Future studies should also consider using a case study approach specifically focused on organisations with high implementations of 4IR technologies. Interacting with the leaders of such organisations and their employees will give a broader perspective in understanding the reasons of their effectiveness. Practical implications The leadership of construction organisations must partner with the academia, industry players and team members in their efforts to implement 4IR in their organisations. Also, the existence of a positive association between leadership traits and effective 4IR leadership implies that to ensure a 4IR-driven work process in construction organisations, the leadership must embrace disruption and quickly respond to change. Further, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that appropriate leadership styles are required for effective 4IR leadership. The appropriate leadership style for effective 4IR leadership requires the leadership of construction organisations to delegate some of the 4IR function. The 4IR function must be performed based on the challenges that are associated with 4IR. The positive correlation between leadership intelligence and leadership styles makes it possible to conclude that the competencies of leadership of construction organisations in a 4IR-driven change depend on the level of leadership intelligence of the executives of construction organisations. It is evident that 4IR will change the business environment; hence, leadership intelligence is required to adapt construction organisations to the change dynamics. This study has provided information on what 4IR leadership entails in construction organisations. The study has contributed a framework for ensuring effective and smooth flow 4IR implementation in construction organisations through a purposeful leadership that combines leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Social implications This research will be useful to government agencies and board members of construction organisations, in appointing leaders to see the construction industry and organisations perform better in the 4IR era. Young individuals who are also aspiring to take on leadership role in the industry will benefit from this study. Originality/value This study is a new and original research that seeks to investigate the need for an effective 4IR leadership in construction business organisations. Construction as an industry is usually criticised for her slow response to change. Since leadership is required to drive the change agenda, this study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised.
