Prototype experiments and analysis were performed to test the data mining using information from a typical Taiwanese local construction procurement unit. The application of the data-mining algorithm to this construction procurement management model improves government procurement effectiveness and efficiency. By complying with this governmental procurement information system and revealing the information required by the World Trade Organization and the Government Procurement Agreement, the model has the potential to improve government procurement and industry effectiveness and efficiency. It also provides a platform for government access to the international community.

Specifically, we focus on the leading role that government-controlled enterprises (GCEs) played in the standardization, and how the Chinese government supported GCEs. The case study findings advance current knowledge on how governments support standardization efforts in a catching-up context. We found that, under strong government support and with GCEs' leadership, a latecomer country such as China, with certain technological capabilities and in economic, social, and institutional contexts that favor indigenous innovation, can pursue path-breaking innovation with complex technological systems. Governments should engage in various tactics to support GCEs that lead the standardization process. Most importantly, governments should intervene in scoping decisions on technological systems and research and development forces in the standard development stage, and offer moral suasion in the standard diffusion stage. We provide practical implications for governments that support GCEs in technology catching-up.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Government projects; Characteristics; Performance	COST OVERRUNS; MEGA-PROJECT; MANAGEMENT; DELAY	Government projects and programs contribute to national growth at a great magnitude. However, records show that they are not well managed, even when project teams follow established project management principles. As a result, this study aimed at identifying key characteristics of government projects and programs, and recommending how they can be used to improve performance. This paper analyzed 39 public projects undertaken in the U.S., UK, and Australia and reviewed officially by the national audit offices and government agencies, including the Los Angeles Metro, London Heathrow's Terminal 5, and the fatal Australia's Homeowner Insulation Program. Based on this analysis the paper suggests six key characteristics, 17 practical recommendations, and six research propositions. These findings can support government project managers to utilize project management approaches according to project characteristics. This paper can support policy makers and government officials in improving the approaches for the management of government projects and programs (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Design/ methodology/approach -This study used a sequential data collection approach by employing an in-depth semi-structured interview and questionnaire, respectively. Based on insight from the literature review, interviews were held with participants to solicit their perceptions about the failure of Ghanaian Government projects. A questionnaire was developed based on the results from the interviews in order to determine the relative importance of the various failure criteria used as the evaluation tool. Findings -Six main criteria were identified and used as the assessment framework for Ghanaian Government project failure. The findings indicated that Ghanaian Government projects fail on all the six failure criteria; however, the extent of failure differs from criterion to criterion. The worst failure criterion is meeting the projected timescale. This is followed by cost, requirement, stakeholder satisfaction, national development and contribution to the sector where projects are implemented, respectively. Practical implications -From this study, government project practitioners and policy makers will be able identify the failure areas ( criteria) on which to focus during government project implementation. Originality/ value -Though extant literature has been devoted to the success/ failure criteria, attention has not been paid to comparison of the extent of failure within these criteria in government projects. Therefore, this study extends the literature in this regard as well as government project failure literature in general.

J	Wang, YL; Cui, P; Liu, JC				Wang, Yinglin; Cui, Peng; Liu, Jicai			Analysis of the risk-sharing ratio in PPP projects based on government minimum revenue guarantees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP projects; Reciprocal preference; Minimum revenue guarantee; Risk sharing ratio	MORAL HAZARD; RECIPROCITY; COOPERATION; INCENTIVES; MOTIVATION; ALLOCATION; TOLL	Public-private partnership (PPP) projects have been widely applied in infrastructure construction. A suitable risk distribution strategy is crucial for promoting negotiations between the government and investors. The government usually provides guarantees to investors to distribute risk. However, an excessive guarantee increases the government's financial burden, whereas an insufficient guarantee reduces the confidence of the investors participating in the project. In a minimum revenue guarantee (MRG), the government subsidizes the investors the difference between the actual revenue and the government guarantee line if there is a loss. In PPP power plant and highway projects, investors' revenues come from two sources: government guarantees and the project company's self-sale. To support project companies and to optimize the projects' benefits, the government should set a reasonable benchmark for purchase amounts. Based on the traditional principal-agent model, this paper introduces the reciprocal preference theory to analyze the risk-sharing ratio most suitable for the government. Then, an optimal incentive mechanism is established to guarantee the project's income. The results indicate that by setting a different guarantee strategy for different participants, the government can utilize reciprocal preference to incentivize investors to exert more effort during a partnership and avoid moral hazard.

J	Damoah, IS; Kumi, DK				Damoah, Isaac Sakyi; Kumi, Desmond Kwadjo			Causes of government construction projects failure in an emerging economy: Evidence from Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Construction; Government projects	HOUSING CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; SUCCESS; PERSPECTIVE; SATURATION; DELAYS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that cause government construction projects failure in a developing economy. Design/methodology/approach The study used the sequential data collection approach through an in-depth semi-structured interview (16 participants) and questionnaire survey (230 participants) to solicit their perceptions from project management practitioners (PMP), contractors and client (government officials) about the factors that lead to Ghanaian Government construction projects. The relative importance index was used to determine the relative importance of the factors identified. This was followed by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement among the participants on their perceptions. Findings In total, 34 factors were identified as the main factors that lead into Ghanaian Government construction projects failure. The top ten most important factors that cause Ghanaian Government construction projects failure are: political interferences, delays in payment, partisan politics, bureaucracy, corruption, poor supervision, lack of commitment by project leaders, poor planning, starting more projects than the government can fund and change in government. The failure factors were grouped into four main themes and found that the most important failure factors are leadership. This is followed by management and administrative practices, resources and external forces, respectively. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to only the public sector, and therefore the findings may not be applicable in the private sector. Practical implications Policy makers and construction PMP would be able to use the findings as a guide during the implementation of government projects in order to reduce and/or avoid government construction projects failure. Originality/value Construction projects failure in developing countries is high. Accordingly, the extant literature has been devoted to identifying the factors that lead to failure; however, they have mainly been discussed from a generic point of view or individual case studies. Researches that focus exclusively on government construction projects in developing countries are rare despite the dynamics in which these projects are implemented. This research extends the construction project management literature by focussing on government construction projects in a developing economy, where there are weak public institutional systems coupled with partisanship politics and bad cultural orientation towards government sector work inherited from a colonial rule.

Government accountability within infrastructure public-private pat partnerships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPPs; Accountability; Government; China		Public private partnerships (PPPs) have been widely used to deliver infrastructure projects. However, PPPs are being plagued with controversy as some of them were subjected to project overruns and/or poor operations. An underlying issue contributing to unsatisfactory performance of PPPs was a result of an ambiguous accountability of the government. Despite this, limited empirical research has been undertaken to identify the government's accountability within PPPs. Thus, a conceptual framework of the accountability of the government of PPPs is developed in this paper and then examined by conducting a case study of a Chinese PPP project. The findings indicate that the government's accountability in PPPs should shift to enhance the effectiveness of quality services and the efficiency of use of public resources for asset end-users and general population. This paper provides the governments embarking on PPPs with an insight into their accountability, ensuring Value for Money is delivered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Based on the perspectives of government's administrative supervisory functions, this paper analyses the issue of strategic choice for opportunistic behaviour by the government and private investors during the operational period of projects using evolutionary game theory. The results show that there is not a single set of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) between the government and the investors. The end results of the evolutionary game are related to the initial states of the system. Conditions that would dissuade investors from adopting an opportunistic behaviour, and settings that would encourage government to supervise closely, are explored. Punishments set by the government, which would then lead to different ultimate choices made by these two parties, are also discussed. Finally, the paper proposes a few policy recommendations for government supervision on the basis of parametric analysis. The findings also serve as a reference for the decision-making process of the government and the investors.

The aim of this study was to identify the variables that are associated with energy consumption in government-owned buildings and to propose a predictive model based on those variables. The proposed approach selects relevant variables using the RReliefF variable selection algorithm. The support vector machine (SVM) method is used to develop a model of energy consumption based on the identified variables. The proposed approach was analyzed and validated on data for 175 government-owned buildings derived from the 2003 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database. The experimental results revealed that the proposed model is able to predict the energy consumption of government-owned buildings in the design phase with a reasonable level of accuracy. The proposed model could be beneficial in guiding government agencies in developing early strategies and proactively reducing the environmental impact of a building, thereby achieving a high degree of sustainability of buildings constructed for government agencies.

The investigated supplierbuyer chain is modeled using two different approaches including: 1) the traditional selling cycle (TSC) in the open market without considering the governments incentives; and 2) the modern selling cycle (MSC) in the organized market considering the governments incentives. In the TSC approach, a Stackelberg game model is proposed for deteriorating products by considering the shortage inventory, the leftover inventory, and value-added tax (VAT) plan. The stochastic demand is dependent on the retail price, freshness degree of the fresh-product item, and marketing efforts. To develop a model for the MSC approach, we have extended the model of a TSC approach considering the governments incentives including short-term tax breaks and a single-window system. Finally, the proposed models are approved with a dataset from a real-life case study.

Moreover, the results of conducted sensitivity analyses help governments to accurately adjust the VAT rate and commission percentages in TSC and MSC approach, respectively.

This study solicits the perceptions of project management practitioners (14), contractors (6), government officials (clients; 5), and the general public (5) on the subject. The findings indicate that corruption influences government project failure on all the failure criteria that were used for the evaluation. However, corruption influences failure at two different levels: project management and product phase. At the project management level, corruption has direct influence, while at the product phase level, the influence is indirect.

The current problems with the float return on investment guarantee are analysed and a guarantee approach with embedded motivatio nal behaviour is presented as an alternative. A pricing method option is then introduced as the motivation-embedded return guarantee has similar characteristics to real options. From this, a valuation model is developed that provides the basis of a new systematic method for calculating the government guarantee value.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on insights from a literature review, interviews were held with relevant staff to identify barriers. These were verified and their relative significance was determined through the use of a questionnaire, before being reflected upon and compared with literature findings. Findings - The research identified 37 barriers to local governments using PPPs in road development projects and showed that four barriers consistently stand out. First, the application of PPPs requires local governments to adapt their current working methods, which amounts to a large impediment to local governments applying PPPs. Second, local government employees believe that applying PPPs might effectively exclude local contractors from involvement in projects. Finally, local governments experience the whole PPP approach (the third barrier) and the PPP contract (the fourth) as overly complicated. Practical implications - To increase the use of PPPs for infrastructure provision at the local level, one has to focus on removing dominant local barriers as identified in this research. Originality/value - Although local-level PPPs have seen increasing interest, this is one of the first studies paying attention to the barriers to using PPPs for local road development projects.

A framework is introduced that records the legislation, guiding principles and policies influencing government clients towards new professional practices embracing dynamic interactions between people, process and technology. The framework is used to analyse case studies related to two US government client organizations: the General Services Administration (GSA) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The study finds that GSA and NREL are actively seeking innovation and influencing their consultants, contractors and other US government agencies through their policies and programmes, notably by piloting new professional practices associated with integrated project delivery and open communication. The initiatives and their effectiveness are further studied in a broader, international context of emerging best professional practices. Government clients are key agents for leading and motivating change, particularly through capacity-building in other professional services firms and contractors. Government clients can further expand their sphere of positive influence specifically in the assessment and integration of emerging technologies and in the extension of professional service contracts related to building performance and occupant engagement.

We focus on the narratives of innovation articulated by Government as part of industrial policy and the responses thereto by senior managers in project-based firms. Our research setting is a major project-based sector: UK construction. 45 narrative interviews were conducted in addition to the content analysis of the Government reports on construction innovation. We find that project-based firms respond to the Government narrative for the need for innovation to improve performance by developing and enhancing their innovative capabilities and generating their own narratives of innovation. The model developed shows how narrative interaction between the Government and project-based firm levels impact on meaning-making of innovation by (re)articulating collective identities, and shaping innovation strategies.

Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) is a relationship-based procurement model that allows the client, the designer, and the contractor to work collaboratively, which results in improved performance. Previous ECI research has focused on its implementation in private projects and public projects managed by the Federal and State Governments. This research investigates the implementation of ECI in Local Government projects in Sydney, Australia. Interviews revealed that the main challenges are probity, developing principle project requirements document, running ECI workshops, changing the attitudes of project participants, and the time-consuming nature of ECI process. When these challenges are overcome, Local Government projects can reap the benefits of ECI, such as collaborative work relationships, better constructability, innovation, cost certainty, improved risk management, and better value for money. It is concluded that ECI is a suitable procurement model to improve project performance in the Local Government context.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the government efforts for driving BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US, so as to develop appropriate roadmaps for increasing BIM implementations in other countries. Design/methodology/approach This study performs a review on the government efforts and roles in BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US. Findings Through cross comparison with existing literature, it is found that Singapore and the UK adopt a government-driven approach and a phase-by-phase development pattern is observed. The first phase focuses on the building sector to rapidly increase the use of BIM and the government generally plays the role of an initiator. In the second phase, BIM is expanded to other implementation areas, e.g. smart city. The importance of the initiator role decreases and more attention is paid to supporting roles such as researcher, educator and regulator. In contrast, an industry-driven approach is adopted in the US. The main role of the government is that of a regulator, with research institutions actively supporting the BIM implementation. Research limitations/implications General roadmaps of the two mandating approaches are presented. The results can provide a useful reference for countries and regions that intend to develop roadmaps to increase their BIM maturity level and enhance readiness to accept and implement BIM. Originality/value This study is one of the first studies that investigate the step-by-step roadmaps for implementing BIM from the perspective of changing government roles.

J	Wang, YL; Liu, JC				Wang, Yinglin; Liu, Jicai			Evaluation of the excess revenue sharing ratio in PPP projects using principal-agent models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP projects; Excess revenue sharing; Government guarantee; Fairness preference	GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES; OPTION; FAIRNESS	In PPP projects, a reasonable risk-sharing system determines whether project financing will be successful. It is often necessary for the host government to provide investors with certain guarantees that relieve some of the risk shouldered by the private parties in order to attract investment. For instance, a minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) supplied by the government reduces the market risk taken by the investor. Based on the principle that the benefits one receives should be fairly equal to the risks taken, governments have the right to share any excess revenue the investors gain equal to the difference between the actual revenue gained by the investors and the cap of the expected earnings. As a result, an excess revenue sharing ratio has to be determined. This paper integrates the fairness preference theory with the traditional principal agent model in order to calculate optimal incentives when principals (governments) employ agents (investors) who have fairness preferences. This study shows that sharing ratio of the excess revenue is related to the fairness preferences and the effort cost coefficient of the investors. Furthermore, governments can obtain more expected revenue when hiring investors with higher fairness preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	DOUTRIAUX, J				DOUTRIAUX, J			HIGH-TECH START-UPS, BETTER OFF WITH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS THAN WITH SUBSIDIES - NEW EVIDENCE IN CANADA	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Developing a strong high-technology base has been one of the goals of many governments in the past decade. Some have tried to do it with tax advantages and subsidies, others have supported their high-tech start-ups by asking them to supply goods and services. This study analyzes the relationship between early growth and the type of government support/contract received by a firm at start-up. It is based on the observation of 73 microelectronics and communication high-tech firms founded between 1965 and 1980 in various parts of Canada. The main conclusion is that firms starting as government suppliers do significantly better than firms receiving other types of government support at start-up, that they tend to be better organized than these firms, are more export-oriented and generally use technologies and serve markets similar to those of a previous employer. And government contracts for goods and services are more important to the future growth and success of the firms than contracts for R&D and other R&D support mechanisms.

In order to curb this kind of behaviour, this article analyses the selection of government supervision mode based on evolutionary game theory taking the perspective of government supervision. The results show that government supervision mode is closely related to the probability of identifying investors' speculative behaviour through outcome-oriented supervision. When the probability of identifying such behaviour is relatively high, the equilibrium strategy of investors and governmental supervision institutions is (not to behave opportunistically, outcome-oriented supervision). In contrast, if the probability is relatively low, there is no set of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS); rather, a periodic behavioural pattern is formed. In this scenario, the strategies ultimately chosen by both sides relate to initial states and the payoffs of the options. Furthermore, determinants and some recommendations for government supervision are proposed, providing a reference for efficient governance.

In order to do so, we deployed it in an emulated architecture for evaluating its performance under various realistic conditions. Our results show that the deployed system is able to meet the requirements, both in terms of throughput and transaction speed. Moreover, it shows clear advantages in terms of usability and synchronization between all entities.

J	Catalao, FP; Cruz, CO; Sarmento, JM				Catalao, Francisco Pinheiro; Cruz, Carlos Oliveira; Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda			Exogenous determinants of cost deviations and overruns in local infrastructure projects	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Local government; public infrastructure; cost deviations; cost overruns; endogenous models; exogenous variables	PUBLIC-SERVICES; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNMENT; DECENTRALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; DELIVERY; PRIVATISATION; CORRUPTION; EFFICIENCY; DESIGN	There is a significant concern about cost deviations and overruns in public projects, particularly by the local governments. The magnitude of expenditure on these infrastructure projects justifies the search for cost deviation reasons, particularly cost overruns. The existing literature also identifies a tendency towards cost overruns in infrastructure projects. However, the analysis of cost overruns determinants has mostly focused on endogenous project characteristics. This research uses a dataset of 4,305 public infrastructure projects, of which 3,338 are local projects, carried out in Portugal between 1980 and 2012. Exogenous determinants (e.g. political, institutional and governance, and economic-related) are also considered in the analysis. An average cost overrun of 19% (9 billion Euros in volume, with a 1 billion Euros overrun) is identified. It is found that central governments incur on an average cost overrun of 23% and local governments on 6%. The analysis confirmed that projects developed by local governments tend to perform better regarding cost deviations and overruns and that exogenous determinants (particularly the political, institutional and governance environment ones) have a strong impact on cost deviations and overruns. These findings on exogenous factors can help local governments to make better management decisions, enhancing governance and institutional frameworks to improve the decision-making process when launching new infrastructure.

J	Ho, SP				Ho, S. Ping			Model for financial renegotiation in public-private partnership projects and its policy implications: Game theoretic view	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS	Today, government is no longer considered the sole provider of public works or services. Public-private partnership (PPP) has been recognized as an important approach to solving problems for governments in providing infrastructure systems. However, the joint ownership or partnership in PPP complicates the administration of PPP projects. Too often, in PPP, many serious problems occur mainly because of bad administration policies. In particular, the fact that government may rescue a distressed project and renegotiate with the developer causes major problems in project procurement and management. This paper aims to study when and how government will rescue a distressed project and what impacts government's rescue behavior has on project procurement and management. A game-theory based model for government rescue dynamics is developed. Propositions, corollaries, and important policy implications are then derived from the model. This pilot study, the writer hopes, may provide theoretic foundations to policy makers for prescribing effective PPP procurement and management policies and for examining the quality of PPP policies. The study can also offer researchers a framework and a methodology to understand the behavioral dynamics of the parties in PPP.

While the newly constructed buildings may be energy efficient, the existing buildings, which account for more than 85% of the total building stock, were built prior to the time when energy rating systems was put in practice and are consequently energy inefficient to a large degree. Reducing the energy consumption in existing government buildings is essential, as it will not only reduce the costs and environmental impacts, but also show governments' strong commitment towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. Furthermore, successful building energy retrofit projects are the showcases to the general public, encouraging other sectors (e.g. commercial) to conduct building retrofits for energy savings. Recognising these benefits, several state governments in Australia have introduced building energy efficiency policies and programs. This paper reviewed the energy efficiency policies/programs in five States in Australia: Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland in terms of respective policies and targets, implementation methods and current progress. The lessons learned from these programs were also discussed. This research revealed that the key factors for a successful government building energy retrofitting program are 1) having a properly enforced energy efficiency mandate with clear energy saving targets, 2) establishing an expert facilitation team and 3) implementing suitable financing and procurement methods.

The governments of various countries have encouraged firms to adopt OGD to develop innovative products and services to bring about social and economic benefits. This paper examines the factors influencing the adoption of OGD among firms in Taiwan to fill a gap that prior studies do not adequately address. Based on the sociotechnical perspective, we developed a research model that integrates the following factors that are central to adoption decisions of firms: top management support, government support, competitive pressure, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We examined this model through survey data from firms with experience in OGD adoption in Taiwan. The results show a significant positive relationship among top management support, competitive pressure, and the adoption of OGD by firms. This paper serves as a first attempt to contribute to advancing knowledge on OGD adoption at the firm level via empirically testing a research model that integrates factors within social and technical systems. This paper has significant implications for practitioners of enterprise information management and creates a valuable reference for other countries in the early stages of OGD initiatives.

History, practices, and future of earned value management in government: Perspectives from NASA	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						earned value management; government; NASA; performance measurement; lessons learned		The goal of this research is to explore the history, practices, and future of the earned value management (EVM) method in government, and seek opportunities and suggestions for wider implementation of EVM for managing, measuring, and controlling project performance and progress. First, this study reviews the historical background and evolution of EVM implementation in government. Then, current practices for implementing EVM are discussed through examination of EVM adoption and implementation at NASA. The research shows that NASA receives substantial project management value from its implementation of EVM, promotes consistent practices across the agency, and provides effective training on leadership, scheduling, EVM, and data analysis. This study also provides recommendations to improve and broaden the applications of current EVM and project management practices to other government programs and projects. Findings of this research contribute to the management of performance of future projects and programs and encourage the project management community to review and advance the application of EVM.

The asset involved in the project becomes the property of the government on its transfer. Thus, extending the concession period means an opportunity cost for the host government. By using an option-pricing model, this paper proposes a methodology for valuing the impact on the public budget arising from this option. This method can be of use in different transportation infrastructure projects, such as motorways, tunnels, and bridges. A case study is provided to show how the proposed methodology can be applied. The results confirm that the opportunity cost for the government may be high, and the main drivers behind this cost are the extension period, the base interest rates, and the risk premium of the government.

The main points of the agreement and barriers affecting price competition are illustrated. Award prices for subcentral government civil engineering projects are compared before and after the law went into effect. The result suggests that civil engineering prices have decreased significantly since the introduction of the law, that the transparent and open-tendering system enforced by the law has led to an increase in competition, and that tender prices decreased during the initial period. During the same period, construction companies' average rate of profit on sales moved from positive to negative. It is concluded that severe bidding competition is expected after Taiwan completes accession to the agreement.

Based on findings from a national survey of government and university R & D lab directors, this study examines perceptions of advantages and disadvantages. Four points stand out. First, laboratory directors, regardless of sector, are generally optimistic about the payoffs from technology transfer, at least in the sense that they cite more significant advantages than significant problems. Second, there is surprisingly little difference between university and government laboratory directors' views. Third, the research mission of the laboratory is related to directors' assessments of the problems and benefits accruing from technology transfer activity. Finally, laboratories stressing development research encounter fewer disadvantages from technology transfer activity than labs involved chiefly in basic or applied research orientated laboratories. The benefit most commonly cited by both government and university laboratory directors is increased public visibility for the laboratories' activities. Both government and university laboratory directors indicate that the greatest problem is time taken away from the laboratories research activities.

Public authorities may enhance the marketability of PPP projects by offering revenue guarantees. However, government revenue guarantees can pose significant fiscal risks for the issuing government, particularly during economic crises. This paper presents a new type of revenue risk hedging contract, the dynamic (flexible) revenue insurance contract, which can be offered as an alternative to the conventional government guarantees. This new contract gives PPP stakeholders other than the government the opportunity to participate in the revenue risk coverage. Potential revenue risk insurers include international financial institutions, export credit agencies, and private insurance companies. The key feature of these new contracts is that they facilitate the pooling of project revenue insurers by accommodating insurer financial and risk preferences. These contracts are modeled as multiple exercise options and priced by using two different Monte Carlo methods, the multiple exercise boundary method and the multiple least-squares method. Because of its inherent flexibility, the dynamic revenue insurance contract offers risk coverage similar to the conventional revenue guarantee at much lower cost to the government. A numerical example on a build operate transfer toll road project shows the substantial cost reduction sustained by the government. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Whether the government needs to participate in the PPP special purpose vehicle (SPV) as an equity coinvestor is a critical issue in PPP development. This research aims to examine the influence of government equity investment on PPP performance by taking public-private communication as an intermediate variable. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was adopted as the main research method. PPP practitioners with extensive experiences from both the public and private sectors were targeted respondents. The survey results were subsequently analyzed using statistical data analysis method. Findings Based on the results from the questionnaire survey, this research indicates an inverted U-shaped relationship between the ratio of government equity and performance in PPP projects. In addition, communication plays a mediating role between government equity investment and PPP project performance. Originality/value This research explicates the relationship between the equity structure in a PPP SPV and the project performance. It provides important guidance and reference for PPP practitioners to structure the SPV and associated financial and commercial arrangements. It also offers valuable insights into the development of PPP policy, especially regarding the structuring of PPP models in China and elsewhere.

The government, as the policy maker, creates incentive policies to encourage developers and customers to choose prefabricated housing. This paper aims to analyze the subsidy mechanism to theoretically confirm the subsidies' scopes, amounts and end times through an evolutionary game model and simulation. In the game model, government subsidies affect the interactions between developers and customers in the decision-making process. The findings are as follows: 1) The developer housing subsidy can lower the housing price, while the customer housing subsidy can increase the price; 2) The government should first offer the developers a larger subsidy amount during the early development stage and then offer the customers a smaller subsidy amount later; 3) The government should determine the end time based on the proportion of developers and customers who choose prefabricated housing; 4) A higher prefabrication ratio may not always improve the development of prefabricated housing, and there is an optimal production scale that creates the best development situation. The empirical analysis shows that this model can help the government develop reasonable and optimal subsidy policies within the limit of budget to stimulate developers and customers.

J	Jin, HY; Liu, SJ; Liu, CL; Udawatta, N				Jin, Hongyu; Liu, Shijing; Liu, Chunlu; Udawatta, Nilupa			Optimizing the concession period of PPP projects for fair allocation of financial risk	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; Concession period; Financial risk allocation; Public-private partnership	REVENUE GUARANTEE; MODEL; EXPERIENCE	Purpose Targeting public-private partnership (PPP) projects, the purpose of this paper is to help decision makers fairly allocate financial risk between governments and private investors through a properly designed length of concession period. Design/methodology/approach On the one hand, the length of the concession period should be long enough to help private investors to achieve their expected profits. On the other hand, the length of a concession period cannot be decided without agreeing on an upper limit, since an overlong concession period takes too much time for governments to recover their investment and leads to an overly lucrative condition for private investors. Following this logic, the concession period decision range is decided, which defines the lower and upper limits for the length of the concession period. The net present values (NPVs) for governments and private investors are estimated via Monte Carlo simulation to better reflect the uncertainties. To further decide on the optimal length of the concession period, the principle of fair risk allocation between governments and private investors is adopted. The concession period, as an important project parameter, should help to minimize the financial risk gap between governments and private investors. Findings The developed concession period determination process is validated using a numerical example of a PPP transportation project. The analysis outcomes show that the proposed methodology is capable of determining the length of the concession period so as to control private investors' profit within a reasonable range while achieving a fair allocation of financial risk between governments and private investors. The outcomes also indicate that, before determining the optimal length for the concession period, governments may need to make a choice between better financial risk allocation or stringent profit control for private investors. Originality/value The concession period for a PPP project is an important parameter and it is a common practice for governments to predetermine the length of the concession period before inviting tenders. The existing models for determining the concession period focus too much on the simulation of NPVs for project parties and neglect the importance of risk allocation in signing and maintaining a long-term contract. There is also a lack of research to evaluate the influence of governments' preferences on the length of the concession period. To overcome the limitations of the existing models and enrich the methodology for concession period determination, this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by developing a concession period determination process which can help governments to make better decisions. The financial risk is expected to be more evenly shared between governments and private investors with the concession period derived from the proposed process. This determination process is also capable of evaluating the influence of governments' preferences on the length of the concession period.

J	Raz, G; Ovchinnikov, A				Raz, Gal; Ovchinnikov, Anton			Coordinating Pricing and Supply of Public Interest Goods Using Government Rebates and Subsidies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracts; environmental economics; government; supply chain management	OUTPUT	This paper presents a stylized framework for analyzing the design of government incentives for public interest goods (goods with externalities, such as electric vehicles.) We extend the newsvendor model with pricing to account for the consumption externality inherent in public interest goods and analyze the governments ability to coordinate their pricing and supply through the use of rebates and subsidies. Our model allows for goods with both positive and negative externalities, and considers three government intervention mechanisms: the joint mechanism that uses both subsidies and rebates, and two simplified mechanisms that use only rebates or only subsidies. The goal of the intervention is to coordinate the system in order to achieve the maximal welfare, which in our model consists of the firms profit, consumer surplus, and externality benefit net the government cost. We find that the joint mechanism coordinates the system, but results in a negative subsidy (i.e., a tax) unless the externality is very small. The simplified mechanisms mostly result in positive rebates and subsidies, but generally do not coordinate the system. We apply our model to the case of Chevy Volt, a leading electric vehicle in North America manufactured by General Motors. We estimate all model parameters from industry data and present a comprehensive numerical study that compares the current government incentives with those suggested by our model. We find that while the current incentives are structurally suboptimal, the resultant welfare loss under the rebate-only mechanism is very small, while under the subsidy-only mechanism it is quite large.

In order to attract financing, governments often provide fiscal support ranging from availability payments (APs) to minimum revenue guarantees (MRGs) to flexible-term contracts when demand and thus the financial viability of a project are uncertain. However, a government's inability to evaluate these alternatives can lead to either surplus fiscal support ex ante or unexpected liabilities ex post. The authors propose a quantitative methodology to guide governments' decisions when choosing among the fiscal support mechanisms. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we establish a two-dimensional framework to evaluate fiscal support alternatives by comparing their effects on the financing costs of a project and the risk retained by a procuring government. We use a stochastic revenue projection model to quantify the revenue risk and the framework's measurable indicators. We apply our framework using a hypothetical case study. The case results demonstrate that flexible-term contracts do little to increase project leverage, MRGs are most applicable to projects with significant revenue volatility, and APs are more appropriate in projects with lower revenue volatility. The framework allows governments to make more informed decisions about revenue risk sharing mechanisms to improve public budgeting and deficit control. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Although PPP has become a matured topic in construction management, research on evaluation of restrictive competition in PPP projects remains surprisingly scarce. With real option theory, this paper analyzes government's guarantee of restrictive competition in PPP projects, and constructs an evaluation model for restrictive competition. The results illustrate the significance of the valuation to both host government and investors, and provide them with a clear reference when negotiating on the level of restrictive competition.

As the privatization process developed, the National Centre became the potential solution to both the Government's need and the construction industry's aspiration. This paper discusses the National Centre for Construction (NCfC) concept and chronicles its development, Government and industry responses and the eventual rejection by Government of the proposal. The NCfC concept and objectives broke new ground and established a reference for evaluating current and future national construction research and technology policy and implementation strategies.

During the 1980's, governments of most advanced industrial economies introduced a range of programs designed to facilitate the introduction of advanced manufacturing technologies. This paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of these policies from the literature on the transfer of technology and outlines the pattern of policy evolution that has occurred as policymakers have become more aware of the determinants of the diffusion process. The paper illustrates the principal features of typical government programs in Europe with case studies from the United Kingdom and (West) Germany. These cases are presented as a means of illustrating how different governments have translated basically similar principles into alternative policy mechanisms for promoting the transfer of technology. The paper argues for the continuing need for government support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for firms in more traditional sectors and concludes with some reflections on lessons learned during the 1980's that might usefully inform future policy development into the 1990's.

Therefore, this paper explores the issues that have enhanced low-cost housing (LCH) demand-supply gap from the government housing planners perspective and proffer possible solutions via qualitative insight. This was achieved through a phenomenology type of qualitative approach that covered eight urban states across Malaysia. The study found that government role in ensuring sufficient supply of LCH has not been significantly demonstrated from pre-development to post-development despite various LCH policies. Among the recommendations is the imposed three acres via cumulative ruling on housing developers, enforcement of computerised open registration for eligibility of applicants, and government to establish a sustainable finance scheme to enhance access to housing-loan for only LIEs. The paper concludes that government should enforce engrave of land title deed such that only LIEs would be eligible to possess LCH while the rent-to-own scheme should be managed by an independent agency, and coordinated via the joint task force. This paper contributes to an understanding that could be provided for policymakers and developers for a better implementation of LCH provision.

Given the high risk of the project, to attract private investors the bid documents stipulated that the government would offer risk-mitigation mechanisms such as subsidy payments and a minimum demand guarantee (MDG). Because an MDG has option-like characteristics, the real-options approach is used to analyze the effect of these incentives on the value and the risk of the Metro Line 4 concession project, and their cost and risk to the government. The results indicate that the incentives proposed are effective in reducing the risk, and increase the net value of the project by 36% at a cost to the government of 5% of the total value of the project. Additionally, it is shown that for a given cost, the most effective risk-reduction mechanisms are the ones that include a higher portion of minimum demand guarantees relative to the subsidy payment. The approach developed can assist transportation authorities in designing optimal incentive mechanisms. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000095. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Findings It is found that for private firms (private contractors and builders) lack of experience is the major factor for failure of the business as against lack of managerial experience is a critical factor in case of a government contractor. Practical implications The outcome of the present study will be used to guide the policymakers during the implementation of governmental and private projects in order to lessen the construction project failures. Originality/value Construction company failure is an important aspect in developing countries like India. The limited studies were available in literature which shows failure factors for government and private firms and distinguished them. Hence, the present study extends the construction company failure literature by focusing on government and private firms. Also, the study provides some theoretical guidelines for management to avoid construction company failure in India.

J	Yuan, HP; Yang, Y				Yuan, Hongping; Yang, Yu			BIM Adoption under Government Subsidy: Technology Diffusion Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling; Information technology; Adoption; Diffusion; Government subsidy	BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INNOVATION; IMPLEMENTATION; ACQUISITION; RIVALRY	Although building information modeling (BIM) holds the promise of significantly advancing the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) market worldwide, its widespread acceptance and adoption is still an unsolved issue. From a technology diffusion perspective, this paper proposes a game theory-based model including two firms who both are potential BIM adopters under support from the government (i.e., subsidy). Two influential factors affecting AEC firms' BIM adoption decisions are identified, including BIM adoption efficiency and adoption incentives. Through analyzing the model with a backward-induction method, AEC firms' best responses of joining time and the government's optimal subsidizing strategies are discussed. The findings show that the government subsidy is effective in promoting BIM adoption because the subsidy can both bring forward the joining time and enhance BIM adoption efficiency by offsetting firms' setup costs. Under the government's subsidy policies, AEC firms that are originally negative toward BIM adoption can become positive, which demonstrates the occurrence of BIM technology diffusion. Theoretical and practice implications are also discussed. This study contributes to a new perspective for understanding BIM adoption behaviors among AEC firms. In addition, the study for the first time introduces game theory into explaining BIM adoption and diffusion, which may benefit BIM implementation and enhance the effectiveness of policies aiming at promoting BIM application practices.

To overcome this issue, an option-pricing framework is developed that enables financial assessment of different types of road projects in the presence of different government support mechanisms. However, this paper focuses on evaluation of highway projects under the presence of PACs. By providing a framework for calculating the value of government support mechanisms and long-term material and energy contracts, this model can help road agencies and contractors with choosing effective hedging strategies.

J	Wibowo, A; Kochendoerfer, B				Wibowo, Andreas; Kochendoerfer, Bernd			Selecting BOT/PPP Infrastructure Projects for Government Guarantee Portfolio under Conditions of Budget and Risk in the Indonesian Context	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Infrastructure; Build/operate/transfer; Guarantee; Chance-constrained goal programming; Budget-at-risk; Indonesia	GOAL; VALUATION	Guarantee provision in privately financed infrastructure projects implemented as build-operate-transfer/public-private-partnership (BOT/PPP) arrangements is not uncommon in many countries, and Indonesia is no exception. But, given that the government budget is, in most if not all cases, not unlimited, there must be a selection of BOT/PPP projects posing proposals for seeking government guarantees. This paper presents a project selection methodology under the chance-constrained goal-programming framework in the context of the Indonesian BOT/PPP infrastructure industry. The ultimate objective of the selection is to result in a portfolio of guaranteed projects that brings maximum welfare gain to the economy as a whole, maximum total net change in financial net present value but, at the same time, puts the government at the lowest fiscal risk for a given budget constraint. The proposed methodology allows the government to examine relationships among the expected total payment, budget-at-risk allocated, and a desired confidence interval of actual payment not exceeding the budget-at-risk. The government can also compare two or more alternative scenarios and choose the optimal one that delivers the highest value for the money. To illustrate the model application, without sacrificing the generality of the proposed methodology, a much-simplified hypothetical case is presented, examined, and discussed.

J	Sha, KX				Sha, Kaixun			Professionalism in China's building sector: an economic governance perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; construction industry; governance; integrity; professionalism; uncertainty; China		As the third force beside markets and governments, professionalism emerged to protect the interests of civil society, and it has played a unique role in the building sector. By conceptualizing professionalism as a community-based governance structure, an economic governance perspective is adopted to examine professionalism in China's building sector. The development of professionalism in China's building sector is reviewed, and both its achievements and its weaknesses are assessed. Root-cause analysis reveals that the primary impediment to building professionalism is the imbalanced relationship between markets, governments and professionals. It is argued that the success of professionalism in China's building sector is dependent ultimately on whether the government can change its overly dominant role in the economy. To address the concern of creating an independent, vibrant professional culture that contributes to the long-term public interest, the following are recommended: separating professional associations and relevant bodies from government agencies completely; improving the administrative system for both practice qualification and market access; and increasing the proportion of non-government investments to change the imbalanced relationship between professionals and public clients.

J	Delgado, L; Shealy, T; Garvin, M; Pearce, A				Delgado, Laura; Shealy, Tripp; Garvin, Michael; Pearce, Annie			Framing Energy Efficiency with Payback Period: Empirical Study to Increase Energy Consideration during Facility Procurement Processes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LOSS AVERSION; ECONOMICS; EXPERTS	The federal government is the country's largest energy user and government facilities are responsible for 40% of total energy emissions, yet traditional energy-efficiency methods are not reducing emissions at the federal government's annual goal of 2.5%. Behavioral science states decision makers do not always understand or anticipate outcomes of possible choices because of time or processing capability, and cognitive biases (i.e.,loss aversion and anchoring) reduce consideration for energy efficiency. The hypothesis is that choice architecture, the structure of procurement options, influences facilities management decisions. In this study engineering and building science students (n=56) were presented with scenarios varying in cost and energy efficiency. The control group received the current government facilities procurement form, and the intervention group received a modified version of the government form prompting them to calculate the payback period prior to choosing an option. The prompt for payback period framed the decision as comparing longer gains rather than upfront costs. The results indicate statistically significant differences (p=0.0003) between participants in the control who did not choose the more expensive, more efficient option and those in the intervention group who frequently did choose this option. These results demonstrate potential applications for choice architecture to improve government facilities management energy-reduction decisions. This behavioral approach complements what are often costlier investments in technology and holds promise for less intrusive solutions compared with legal and economic policies for energy reduction.

Dueling Stakeholders and Dual-Hatted Systems Engineers: Engineering Challenges, Capabilities, and Skills in Government Infrastructure Technology Projects	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Enterprise systems; government; infrastructure; systems engineering	INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; ORGANIZATIONS; OPPORTUNITIES; INTEGRATION; VIEW	Systems engineering projects that support government enterprises face substantial challenges due to demands from diverse stakeholders and rapidly changing technologies. In this paper, we present findings from the analysis of five case studies of systems engineering projects for large government enterprises. We focus on what can be learned from systems engineers, their essential role, and their engineering practices. As they work to establish interoperability across preexisting and new technologies, thereby evolving an infrastructure, the engineers commonly face "agonistic" tensions between groups of stakeholders. Temporal pacing conflicts are especially prevalent, such as those between some stakeholder groups concerned with fast-paced streams of innovation and others concerned with current operations. In response, many engineers are following an evolutionary approach, developing new capabilities for incremental modularization and re/integration of technologies and associated practices across organizational (stakeholder) boundaries. Additionally, engineers are leveraging their professional role and developing new skills of influence to support these capabilities for addressing stakeholder tensions. We close by discussing implications of our findings for the management of infrastructure technology projects, for organizational design and engineering of government enterprises, and for the changing role of systems engineers.

Our results, based on an examination of 54 Chinese High-Tech industrial parks in the period of 2002-2008, suggest that government taxation affects industrial parks' R&D expenditure in a U-shaped way over time. Although government taxation incentives have a direct impact on R&D expenditure, the R&D expenditure growth patterns are different for industrial parks with high tax incentives and low tax incentives. Moreover, instead of finding that R&D expenditure has a direct influence on innovation performance as indicated by the previous literature, our study shows that the effect is time-lagged. This paper augments the current literature by providing empirical evidence and a theoretical understanding of regional innovation motivation.

J	Gann, D				Gann, D			Should governments fund construction research?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						public policy; competitiveness; regulation; research policy; R&D; construction industry; technical change	FIRMS	This paper considers the role played by government in stimulating innovation to improve quality, profitability and competitiveness in construction activities. It questions whether governments should fund research and development in construction, and if so, what level and types of support might be appropriate to meet emerging needs. It addresses this with reference to the current debate on the public funding of science, citing Kealey and Pavitt. The author considers specific construction-related issues and changing conditions, indicating the need for more, rather than less funding by both private and public sectors. In conclusion, the author develops a third way, different from Kealey's and Pavitt's approaches. Construction requires a strong and vibrant research base, partly funded by government. Simultaneously, the state requires a research and knowledge base in order to fulfil its roles such as for governance of technologies in the built environment. A complementarity effect arises from both public and private funding - which is therefore greater than the sum of the parts.

However, many PPP projects encounter crises and are even terminated before the expiration of the PPP contract due to a variety of factors that differ from general risks. Based on 23 selected PPP projects in China, this paper uses a multicase study to identify and analyze factors that influence early termination. Eleven influencing factors are identified as the main causes of the early termination of PPP projects in China. Among them, government decision error and government payment default are the most common factors. Counterstrategies are proposed to mitigate the impact of these factors. The results are expected to serve as a reference and provide inspiration for the host governments and private sectors of PPP projects.

This model focuses on three primary dimensions of online innovation: perceived need, technical capacity, and risk mitigation. It is hypothesized that these three dimensions will have the greatest influence on the development of pre-adoption interest in a new on-line innovatiom This model is then used to examine a single online innovation, personalization of online government information and services. Data from a survey of local governments is used to test the theory. A regression model was estimated from the survey data. Results suggest that perceived need, financial costs, and the ability to mitigate the risks associated with privacy issues each influence the level of interest in personalized online services. The results suggest that Public organizations. must find reliable means of determining external demand for online innovations, as well as reducing the risks associated with each specific type of online innovation prior to adoption.

J	Cooper, I				Cooper, I			The UK's changing research base for construction: the impact of recent government policy - Factors are identified which may destabilize the capacity and capability of the UK construction R&D base	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						R&D; research policy; research infrastructure; research funding; public policy; trends; privatization; UK		Recent government policy on construction R&D in the UK is presented as having been a contradictory amalgam involving, simultaneously, government intervention and disengagement. Confusingly, both parts of the policy appear to have been aimed at the same purpose - increasing the responsiveness of the sector's R&D activities to market forces. Given the noted reluctance of the UK's private sector to assume responsibility for such activities over the past two decades, there is little to suggest that this policy will prove successful. A more likely outcome, in the short to medium term at least, is that the speed and extent of apparent government retreat from funding could, in combination with other current changes, destabilize bath the capacity and the capability of Britain's construction R&D base.

Design/methodology/approach Real option principles are applied to assess the public-private investment proportions and the expected return rates of the private sector in a non-competitive guarantee and analyse their effects on the public-private benefit and risk allocations as well as the success of the project. Instead of granting direct capital support, this research accomplishes the compensation of non-competition guarantee by adjusting the project benefit distribution ratios between the government and the private sector to achieve the option value of the guarantee. An empirical example with alternative scales, which is developed from an existing rental village in Geelong, is used to numerically verify the research process. Findings The results illustrate that the option value of the non-competition guarantee plays an important role in supporting the implementation of the PPP rental retirement village projects. The option value of the non-competition guarantee has a close relationship with the guarantee level and the government guarantee cost, which is positively correlated with the guarantee level and negatively correlated with the government guarantee cost. To reduce the government guarantee cost, the government should carefully determine the public-private investment proportion, appropriately control the return rate of the private sector and approve the construction of the new project after the investment recovery of the private sector. Originality/value This research is the first attempt to investigate the government compensation and costs of non-competition guarantee for PPP rental retirement village projects and will enhance the understanding of the nature of PPP applications. The evaluation process and the implementation of the compensation through the adjustment of benefit distribution provides a comprehensive method to analyse the non-competition guarantee of PPP projects and help the parties negotiate in good faith to agree on a method of redress.

This paper provides a useful tool to define a proper value of public subsidies. In particular, we develop a methodology to calculate the optimal values of the revenue floor (the minimum amount of revenue secured by the government in the minimum revenue guarantee) and revenue ceiling (the upper threshold of revenue that defines the excess revenue to be shared in the revenue sharing) in a way that creates a "win-win" condition for the concessionaire and the government and fairly shares risk between them. The proposed methodology operationalizes minimum revenue guarantee and revenue sharing as real options. The resulting real option-based model is applied to a real case, namely the Strait of Messina Bridge in Italy. The application shows the usefulness of the model in supporting: (a) the government's decision-making process on assessing values of public subsidies needed to make the project attractive to private investors; and (b) both public and private parties during the negotiation in finding the fair values of the revenue floor and ceiling.

J	Seaden, G				Seaden, G			The future of national construction research organizations - Scenarios for the changing roles, functions, research agendas and funding	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						R&D; trends; research organizations; public policy; research policy; construction industry; globalization		The pressures for change on National Construction Research Organizations (NCROs) are identified and linked to changes occurring in the construction sector and the role of government support for construction. Reduced government funding for research has meant NCROs are now dependent on both public and private sector funding. The implications are research priorities are shifting to the shorter-term problems confronting industry NCROs are under pressure to collaborate internationally and to develop narrower expertise to survive. The dangers of globalized research contracts and shout-term contracting with an emphasis on price competition would be to add to uncertainty with each NCRO, undermine long-term benefits, reduce the number of NCROs and their overall research quality. The future of NCROs is discussed as being best situated at a national level with a cove funding by government. The requirement of stability for a long-term relationship between governments and NCROs is necessary to maintain and develop knowledge, expertise and excellance as well as capabilities for policy related and emerging issues. Far from being a 'mature' industry, construction has a positive and active role to play in presenting the case for significant government support of R&D for improved living standards, economic growth, user needs and responding to a changing agenda.

However, efficient management of risks in these projects remains problematic. While there have been many studies that have examined risks associated with PPPs in China, the experience of local governments with risks has received little or no attention in the literature. Moreover, the stages at which the risks are significant and how these risks are interrelated have not been researched. This paper examines risks as experienced from the local government's perspective and how they manifest across five PPP stages: (1) feasibility, (2) procurement, (3) construction, (4) operation, and (5) transfer. The interrelationship between the risks across the PPP stages is also examined. Data was collected via questionnaire surveys and interviews, and it was analyzed using quantitative and qualitative analysis. The findings reveal critical risk for local governments and how their impacts vary across project stages. Some of the risks influence other risks both within and across the five PPP stages. The findings provide significant insight into the dynamic nature risks in PPP water projects, which has important implications for practitioners when developing risk mitigation strategies.

While privatization has allowed governments to relieve their financial difficulties, users have taken on such risks in the form of high rates and poor service. When compared to other infrastructures, water and sewer systems generate somewhat stable revenue. However, water and sewer systems are also characterized by the hardly predictable operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses. Such characteristics make it difficult to devise a proper contract that satisfies the interested parties, such as governments, private operators, and users. By investigating the deficiencies of previous privatization contracts, this study presents a real option-based contract model to ensure appropriate risk sharing between private entities and governments. Simulation results based on three different O&M expense scenarios (best, moderate, and worst) indicate that the proposed contract model would provide a win-win situation for all related parties.

In the context of emission reduction and resource recovery, the authors analyze the impact of current carbon quota allocations and government subsidies policies on manufacturers' profits and recovery rates in a closed-loop supply chain. A simplified model consists of two manufacturers, one retailer and a third-party recycler. The study found that carbon quotas and government subsidies can both promote the improvement of recovery rates under certain conditions, and have similar effects in regulating interest distribution between manufacturers. The combination of the two methods can effectively realize the targets of recycling and carbon emissions reduction.

Typically, valuation models for these guarantees assume that traffic volume follows a geometric Brownian motion under the Real Options Approach. However, this is often done without testing whether this assumption is reasonable or not. In this article, statistical tests are applied to check the validity of this assumption and show how toll road traffic can be modelled under alternate models, such as Mean Reverting processes, if the geometric Brownian motion assumption is rejected. In that sense, this approach is applied to the case of a toll road concession in Colombia where a Mean Reverting process is used to model the traffic. Finally, it is showed that this model is a valid tool for defining the fair value of the minimum amount of revenue secured by the government.

The role of government influence to bridge LCH demand-supply gap cannot be over-emphasized as evident in countries that have recorded success in LCH development. This conceptual article investigates the moderating effect of the role of government support policy, as the moderating effect on the relationship between Malaysian low-cost housing leakages (MLCHL), high development and construction cost (HDCC) and LCH demand-supply (LCHDS). This would be achieved via Partial Least Square-SEM method of key stakeholders across the Malaysian housing sector. The proposed framework suggests that GSP possibly will moderate the relationship between MLCHL, HDCC and LCHDS. This is significant to policymakers and housing regulatory agencies, and the need for policy reform in the housing sector to enhance the better flow of LCH units from the housing developers. The generated discussion would mitigate the paucity of literature, especially in LCH leakages. The article concludes that government should lead and implement more pro-poor homeownership policies and reforms that would plug LCH leakages and mitigate high development and construction cost so that low-income earners house-buyers can gain access to homes.

J	Winistorfer, SG				Winistorfer, SG			Product champions in government agencies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	Innovation can bring productive change to the way business is done-a concept not easily accepted by government agencies. Barriers combine to stifle innovation and include the difficulty in providing services and programs to customers with competing interests, the leadership void created with recurrent turnover in top management, an emphasis on risk avoidance, and a focus on internal processes. Product champions are individuals who are committed, dedicated, willing, and able to take an innovation and carry it through the barriers that exist with the bureaucracy of government agencies. Only through active participation of product champions at all levels of the organization can productive innovation take place: top managers as the chief executive product champions, midlevel managers as the business innovation product champions, and employees at all levels as the technical innovation product champions.

The replication has implications for both the public and private sectors. A promising new finding is that 'in some environments (with stable strategies and central oversight) projects make some contribution to the realisation of strategic goals'.

J	Chang, CY; Chou, HY				Chang, Chen-Yu; Chou, Hui-Yu			Transaction-Cost Approach to the Comparative Analysis of User-Pay and Government-Pay Public-Private Partnership Systems	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Governance structure; Build-operate-transfer; Transaction cost economics; Contracting	CONCESSION CONTRACTS; RISK ALLOCATION; RENEGOTIATION	Government-pay and user-pay public-private partnership (P3) systems have been employed as the main conduits for channelling private capital to finance the provision of public services throughout the world. In efficiency terms, they are suited to different types of projects. This paper develops a model to illuminate the condition under which one route would perform better than the other. If both of them are instituted into law, governance alignment should emerge in the long run. However, in Taiwan government-pay P3 systems are not a lawful route, forcing the government to employ user-pay P3 systems regardless of project types. This gives researchers an unusual opportunity to examine what would happen as a result of an inappropriate choice of P3 models. This paper makes a theoretical innovation in the identification of a conflict of interest indicator as an attribute for differentiating the relative efficacy of two types of P3 systems. This result sheds light on the way value for money assessment should be conducted for user-pay P3 projects. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Drawing on the resourcebased view theory, this study examines the moderating effects of government support on the relationships between adhocracy culture, market orientation and sustainable construction among 172 large contractors in Malaysia, using a 61 item instrument. Both mailed and personally administered survey methods with structured questionnaires were used to collect the data. Using a partial least squared - structural equation modelling for the data analysis, we found a significant positive relationship between the adhocracy culture and sustainable construction. Similarly, the results also indicated that market orientation had a significant positive relationship with sustainable construction. The study also found a significant but negative relationship between government support and sustainable construction. As expected, government support was found to moderate the relationship between adhocracy culture and sustainable construction, while an insignificant interaction effect was found between market orientation and sustainable construction. Implications for practice and future research were also discussed.

This paper presents a continuous stochastic process derived from the risk factor forecast, thereby providing a more realistic and flexible model. A new valuation approach is developed by using a finite-difference method based on this continuous stochastic process. In a numerical example with one risk factor, it is shown that this new valuation tool is 100 times faster than the existing simulation-based approach. Its superior speed presents the opportunity to examine different contractual configurations, and as a result, design a more cost effective guarantee contract. Exercise strategies are derived for a multiple-exercise (Australian) guarantees structure. This new approach can be used by a government to reserve budget for the guarantees. Finally, the continuous underlying random process and exercise strategy enable this method to value more complex guarantee structures. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This research confirms that enabling firms to access emerging technology, acquire financial support, and touch customers and/or suppliers are critical to foster the emergence and development of industries. Moreover, the primary contribution of this study is to emphasize the support of the local government in the development of emerging industries on the perspective of the creation of a large-scale market demand. The creation of large-scale market demand may inspire actors to be proactive in responding to these incentives; thus, public and private actions may help increase the accessibility to technology, infrastructure, and finances. Hence, a market-oriented policy that incentivizes the creation and expansion of market demand among diverse public and private actors should be seen as the key issue for the emergence and growth of emerging industries. Policies should also be adopted promptly with the development of the market.

J	Lee, CH; Yu, YH				Lee, Chien Hsien; Yu, Yue-Hwa			Service delivery comparisons on household connections in Taiwan's sewer public-private-partnership (PPP) projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership; Sewer; Household connection; Risk allocation		With the aim of raising wastewater treatment rate more efficiently than before, the Taiwan government introduced the concept of public private partnerships (PPP) to develop sewer projects. A sewer project typically involves three components: household connections, collection systems, and the wastewater treatment plant. The household connection is the last-mile of the whole sewer system. Two sewer PPP projects were selected for service delivery comparisons in this paper. While both projects have their similarities and differences, the most significant distinction is that in Case A the responsibility of the household connections resides with the concessionaire, whereas in Case B this is the government's responsibility. To the government, Case A simplifies the interfaces in a PPP project, and subsequently increases the overall wastewater treatment rate as expected, and is one of the ultimate goals for the Taiwan government. Nevertheless, from the investors' perspectives, close to 50% of the anticipated income which was the wastewater volume based in Case A, would be the major factor in financial risk considerations.

J	Chen, C				Chen, Chuan			Can the pilot BOT Project provide a template for future projects? A case study of the Chengdu No. 6 Water Plant B Project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build Operate Transfer (BOT); Infrastructure; Water sector; China; Project finance	CHINA	The Chengdu No. 6 Water Plant B Project is a central government promoted pilot Build Operate Transfer (BOT) project in Chinese water sector, but the mode of the Chengdu project has not been well applied to the following BOT water supply projects. First hand data about the Chengdu project was collected focusing oil project development process and organization, and lessons learned were identified in terms of factors impacting project viability as well as their re-applicability towards future BOT water supply projects in China. Main factors include (1) flagship project status with strong commitment of the central government, local government and an international multilateral organization; (2) local government taking multiple risks and responsibilities; (3) engaging lenders in decision making; (4) procurement of local products and services in construction and maintenance; (5) utilization of proven and cost saving technology; and (6) time-consuming project development process and complex approval system. Why the following BOT water supply projects are often of small size and how the mode of the Chengdu project can be applied to future projects of similar or larger size are discussed. The study provides implications for governments to re-define their role and improve the institutional settings for BOT project delivery and for infrastructure developers and investors to better understand and participate into the enormous Chinese water market through the BOT method.

J	Wang, LG; Zhang, XQ				Wang, Liguang; Zhang, Xueqing			Determining the Value of Standby Letter of Credit in Transfer Stage of a PPP Project to Control Concessionaire's Opportunistic Behavior	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Letter of credit; Principal-agent model; Opportunistic behavior; Public-private partnership (PPP); Transfer	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION; MECHANISM; CLIENTS; PERIOD; MODEL; GAME	Most public-private partnership (PPP) projects would be transferred back to the government at the end of the concession period. To pursue maximum profit, the concessionaire may overuse the facilities without proper maintenance during the concession period. Such opportunistic behavior is likely detrimental to public interests. To address this issue, a common practice is the government requiring a standby letter of credit in the transfer stage (SLOT) from the concessionaire to guarantee the project's performance during the warranty period. If operational accidents occur during the warranty period, the government will issue a performance bond to cover the damages according to SLOT. A higher value of SLOT will prevent the concessionaire from behaving opportunistically (i.e., the compatibility constraint is satisfied) but may cause the concessionaire to refuse the contract (i.e., the participation constraint may not be met), and vice versa. In this study, a principal-agent model was developed to determine the reasonable value of SLOT by analyzing the incentive compatibility constraint for the concessionaire and the participation constraint for the government. This model offers a useful reference for the government to undertake business negotiations with the concessionaire toward the objective of avoiding opportunistic behavior and improving project performance. A case study was conducted with a PPP waste-to-energy incineration project located in Nanjing, China, to illustrate the model.

J	Meier, SR				Meier, Steven R.			Best Project Management and Systems Engineering Practices in the Preacquisition Phase for Federal Intelligence and Defense Agencies	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						acquisition practices; project management; systems engineering; federal government		The analysis of several government defense and intelligence agency large-scale acquisition programs that experienced significant cost and schedule growth shows that several critical factors need to be addressed in the preacquisition phase of the acquisition cycle. These include overzealous advocacy, technology readiness levels, life-cycle cost, schedule details, requirements maturity, acquisition and contract strategy, program office personnel tenure and experience, risk management, systems engineering, and trade studies. The results of this study-which incorporated data from industry responses, government and industry executive interviews, numerous studies, and reports-indicate that early preacquisition activities executed in a rigorous fashion can significantly reduce the risk of cost and schedule growth. In this paper, the root causes of the cost and schedule growth are discussed as well as techniques and alternatives to improve program performance.

These include unstable and insecure employment, financial instability, a bias towards urban development, and an erratic approach to integrating the construction industry within overall government policy. To achieve the objectives of its Reconstruction and Development Programme, the South African government initiated a process to create an effective strategy for its construction industry within a national agenda of social and economic transformation. The process of creating a cooperative framework and specific strategies for the structured engagement of public- and private-sector stakeholders is described. Structured policy debate, analysis and implementation have fostered a new culture through government and industry partnership and created the foundation for establishing the South African Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB).

However, in developing countries, some of these projects fail through abandonment but researchers have not paid attention to the effects that these abandoned construction projects have on stakeholders associated with such projects. This study, therefore, investigates the effects of abandonment on key stakeholders associated with such projects. Using sequential data collection approach through focused group discussions, questionnaire and an in-depth semi-structured interview, 26 effects of construction projects abandonment on stakeholders are identified. The top 10 most important effects are: unemployment, bad image for the government, government sector underdevelopment, slow economic growth, financial institutions lose confidence in the state, discourages investment, loss of revenue by state, pollution, loss of properties and loss of revenue by the citizens. The effects were grouped into four main themes and the most important effects are the economic, social, political and psychological respectively. The findings also suggest that some of these effects are direct whilst others are indirect; and they are cyclical in nature.

J	Xiong, W; Zhao, XB; Wang, HM				Xiong, Wei; Zhao, Xianbo; Wang, Huanming			Information Asymmetry in Renegotiation of Public-Private Partnership Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Renegotiation; Game theory; Information asymmetry	BAYESIAN PLAYERS; CONTRACTS; GAMES	Public-private partnerships (PPPs) use long-term contracts between the government and the private-sector partner to deliver public infrastructure or service. Due to unexpected contingencies, renegotiations have been common in PPP projects and significantly influenced efficiencies. In the renegotiation game, the private contractor has to decide whether to initiate a renegotiation or not, while the government has to decide whether to accept a renegotiation or not. The criteria for each to make such decisions are private, which causes information asymmetry. This study proposes a game theoretical model to study the influence of information asymmetry on the decision making of renegotiations in PPP projects. It is shown that the renegotiation decision making considering information asymmetry is a Bayesian game, and thus Bayesian Nash equilibrium is applied for solutions. This study provides the decision-making rules for renegotiations, identifies the opportunistic behaviors of players, and improves the renegotiation game through eliminating information asymmetry. The results show that (1)the private contractor can achieve the best outcome by sharing its private information with the government, (2)the government is willing to share its private information with the private contractor only if it has been informed of the private contractor's private information, and (3)the sharing of the government's private information will not increase the payoffs of either player. Different from previous studies, the proposed model in this study for the first time takes into consideration the information asymmetry in renegotiations of PPPs, thus contributing to the body of knowledge. In addition, the findings of this study help enhance the decision making of renegotiations, thereby contributing to practice.

Build-operate-transfer (BOT) is a delivery/financing system that can be a solution to this problem. In this system, a private sponsor finances the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of a public project for a specified concession period, at the end of which it transfers ownership to the government agency, hopefully after recouping its costs and achieving profits. A questionnaire survey of large municipalities and state departments of transportation was conducted to determine the extent to which they are using BOT in their large projects, to investigate the implementation of BOT, and the reasons why some government agencies avoid using BOT. The findings indicate that very few agencies use BOT. The reasons why most do not use BOT were reported by the respondents to be the availability of proven alternatives and enough funds, the existence of political barriers, and resistance to change both on the part of government agencies and private sponsors. When government agencies and private sponsors explore the use of BOT, they should avoid the pitfalls perceived by the respondents in this study.

Inefficiencies in dealing with resource shortages in the aftermath of a catastrophe can trigger economic and environmental impacts on the affected areas. Based on data collected from field research in China, Indonesia, and Australia, three types of resource-led reconstruction strategies are compared: government driven, donor driven, and market driven. Conventional interventions from the Chinese government (e.g. price restrictions and discouraging profiteering to regulate the market) were unable to meet the long-term reconstruction needs after the Wenchuan earthquake (2008). Complexity inherent in both internal and external environments in Indonesia compromised donors' efforts in post-tsunami (2004) resource procurement. Market-oriented resourcing processes in Australian bushfire (2009) reconstruction are unlikely to succeed without facilitated solutions from the government and institutions. The answer to effective resource management for post-disaster reconstruction lies in the appropriateness of the responses and improvements to address resourcing challenges. The success of resourcing depends on multi-stakeholder collaboration and the development of polices, plans, and tools to allow market flexibility, donor management, and government intervention.

In addition, the positive effect of CSR practices on social sustainability performance (SSP) is examined. Design/methodology/approach A framework of hypotheses between barriers, CSR practices and SSP is established. Using a survey questionnaire, empirical data are collected from 17 construction firms in Vietnam. PLS-SEM is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that organizational and industrial barriers negatively affect CSR practices. This study also finds that education and training and government support could enable construction firms to reduce the impact of such barriers. Research limitations/implications The data are collected in Vietnam; thereby the findings are only applicable in developing countries. Further research should also be conducted in other countries to improve the generalizability of the theoretical framework. Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that construction firms could apply several strategies (e.g. providing their employees with CSR training and education; embedding CSR into their firm policy, mission and vision) to mitigate the impact of CSR barriers and, accordingly, ensure the success of adopting CSR practices. Originality/value This study is one of the first efforts in the construction industry that empirically investigates the impact of barriers on CSR practices and the moderating effects of training and education as well as government support.

J	Simmons, R				Simmons, Richard			Constraints on evidence-based policy: insights from government practices	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						governance; policy formation; outcomes; evidence-based policy; built environment; public policy		Insights are offered into UK government built environment policy-making processes through an insider's perspective (based on experience of being the chief executive of a public body, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment - CABE) on three empirical examples. The government's mandate was for policies to be evidence based. There was no shortage of demand for evidence, but it was fed into political and bureaucratic domains where less- or non-evidence-based influences were also at work. The questions considered are how much the evidence really influenced the content of policy; and whether making a policy 'evidence based' led to its acceptance across government, causing departments to commit to its delivery. It is found that evidence (1) is powerful for defining issues to which policy should attend, (2) captures the attention of policy and decision-makers, but only if presented succinctly, and (3) is essential for testing outcomes. Supposedly evidence-based policy is not always truly evidence based. Many subjective forces counterbalance objectivity. The most significant reasons for this are mooted. Advice is offered on how to make evidence a more effective part of a process that will always be partly technical and objective, but also political and subjective.

The theory of planned behaviour was used to develop the theoretical framework that investigated G-7 contractors operating in Malaysian construction industry. A review of relevant literature and questionnaire was adopted in order to identify the factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes (individual factors). A total of 119 personal structured questionnaires were considered for the analysis with the response rate of 94%. In addition, a structural equation modelling approach was employed to examine the direct and the moderating relationship as drawn by the hypotheses. In addition, with quantitative research design following positivist research paradigm, the methodology was designed to focus on the research questions and the objectives. The questionnaire was designed by using closed interval measurement scale with proper care taken in designing the survey instruments. SPSS 20.0 and SmartPLS 3 for structural equation modelling were utilized in confirming the hypotheses developed for the study. The results of this study through structural equation modelling opined that government policy and individual factor have a positive and significant influence on contractor's risk attitudes.

Social network analysis was then adopted to outline the value conflict network based on data drawn from focus group discussions. Finally, 24 value conflicts between local government and private sector were analyzed through another 13 semi-structured interviews in an abductive approach. Findings Results show that value conflicts between local government and private sector are dynamic and intertwined within and across three project phases, based on which six exchange rules, rationality, Altruism, power consistency, competition, group gain and reciprocity, are identified. Two sets of situational factors which potentially influence exchange rules adopted by the two parties are revealed, namely, urgency and professionality for local government and short-term interests and long-term interests for private sector. A summary of paired exchange rules is provided to predict if value conflicts between the two major stakeholders will be resolved or not. Originality/value One strength of the study is in the concentrated analysis of a single case which allows for a deep understanding of value complexity between local government and private sector in SPPP projects from a dynamic and networked perspective. A guideline is provided for both parties when a value conflict is found hard to resolve. Besides, this study is also among the first that addresses value issues in SPPP projects.

Quantitative SWOT Analysis of Public Housing Delivery by Public-Private Partnerships in China Based on the Perspective of the Public Sector	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Public housing; Strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT); Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Strategy China	POLICY; INFRASTRUCTURES; PARTICIPATION; AFFORDABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; REFORM; MARKET	Facing the challenges of the global financial crisis, the Chinese government planned to build far more public housing than can be provided by the government alone. Meanwhile, the capability of Chinese governments to provide quality public housing on their own is being questioned and reassessed at various levels and in different forms. Accordingly, the introduction of private sector into the development of public housing should be promoted by the Chinese public sector by adopting the public-private partnership (PPP) model. In order to help the Chinese government formulate an appropriate strategy to develop PPP housing in a complex political, financial, legal, and regulatory environment, 16 strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) factors are identified on the basis of an extensive literature review. A structured questionnaire survey from the perspective of the public sector is conducted to analyze and integrate its perceptions of the SWOT factors. On the basis of a survey on SWOT factors, the methodology of quantitative SWOT analysis composed of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to analyze strategy for the Chinese government to develop public housing by PPPs. The results indicate that the strongest facilitating factors are "solving the problem of public sector budget restraint" and the "huge needs for public housing," and the strongest hindering factors are "low profits for the private sector to participate in PPP housing" and the "inadequate legal framework and unclear responsibility for both the public and private sectors." The public strategic direction and intensity are consequently determined according to the results of the proposed method. Furthermore, an aggressive and active strategy formulation is carried out to help government facilitate the construction of public housing. The proposed suggestions to the public sector would be viewed as guidelines for the public sector to adopt PPPs in public housing appropriately, and also can be used to encourage the private sector to participate in public housing development.

The theoretical discourse on governance, in the context of projects and programmes, is not fully mature, although is now sufficiently well developed to warrant an increased scholarly focus on practice. This paper aims to contribute to the empirical literature through a study of assurance routines in the UK Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). Design/methodology/approach A framework analysis approach to the evaluation of a subset of GMPP database generates original insights into (1) the framing of assurance review recommendations, (2) the treatment of assurance review data and (3) the subsequent tracking of the implementation of actions arising from the assurance review process. Findings The analysis reveals that the "delivery confidence" of the major projects and programmes included in this study improves during the time that they are assured on the GMPP. This would suggest that "enhanced" governance routines are desirable in programmes and projects that exhibit high degrees of complexity and scale. Originality/value The research findings contribute to the wider conversations in this journal and elsewhere on project governance routines and governance-as-practice in the context of government and public services.

J	Shang, G; Pheng, LS; Hui, WJ				Shang, Gao; Sui Pheng, Low; Jia Hui, Wee			Drivers and barriers for multiskilling workers in the Singapore construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Barriers; drivers; foreign construction workers; institutional theory; multiskilling	SKILLS CRISIS; LABOR; PERSPECTIVE; IMPACT	Construction in Singapore has always been perceived as a low productivity sector, given the slow labour productivity growth. To address the issue, the Singapore government introduced the Multiskilling Scheme (MS) in 2012, aiming to develop competent workers who are versatile in multiple skillsets. This study attempts to assess the extent of adoption of the MS in Singapore's construction industry by recognizing the benefits, drivers, and barriers of multiskilling workers. This study has a two-phased research design consisting of a survey and interviews with industry employers and government. The empirical findings indicate the strong influence of regulatory impetus towards adoption of the MS, where an incentive of lower foreign levy was granted. The significant drivers highlighted were government compliance with regulations, employers' perception of the importance of multiskilling workers for productivity improvement, and usefulness of the MS for upgrading worker's skills. Barriers to the MS were perceived to be insignificant in terms of hindering adoption, especially with firms heavily incentivized and driven by government. It is concluded that multiskilling in Singapore's construction industry has its own features. In terms of contributions, the drivers and barriers of the MS formulated under Scott's Institutional Framework are mapped, and recommendations are proposed for improvement of the MS.

While great efforts have been concentrating on the interpretation and the implementation of the 'smartness', the incentives for SC development are ignored. Understanding the incentives would clarify the goals of SC development and thereby boost its development efficiency. By exploring existing researches and cases of Nanjing, China, 15 factors were identified using a proposed physical-human society-cyber (P-H-C) space model. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted among different stakeholders in Nanjing to investigate their attitudes towards these factors. In factor analysis, these factors are grouped into three dimensions: technology push, government pull, and user-driven. Results show that currently SC development is mainly pushed by the technical progress and innovations. Meanwhile, government plays a significant role in pulling SC development especially at the initial stage. In addition, requirements to enhance the experience of end-users including government, companies, citizens etc. are critical for SC development. This paper provides insight on the incentives of SC development, research findings could be used as guidelines for the SC development in cities worldwide.

Our research purpose was to answer (1) What are the challenges to developing collective competence in public-private partnerships? and (2) How can these challenges be overcome to achieve project success? We found that the potential for conflict due to differing goals, resource scarcity, and interdependence of tasks was the greatest challenge for Bygga Villa's ability to develop collective competence while the partnership overcame this challenge through (1) co-developing a clear project charter, (2) recruiting a project leader with strong knowledge broker skills, (3) conducting joint problem-solving tasks using boundary objects, and (4) ensuring an understanding of the "big picture" through continuous open and balanced communication. Moreover, the project was successful due to members' ability to embrace conflict and turn it into creative conflict through dialogue while ensuring a high level of project satisfaction by the partnership's individual members.

Previous research focuses on the structure of project portfolio governance and is relatively silent on micro-practices of governing. This paper intends to respond to this gap. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study draws upon practice approaches and the theoretical lens of organisational routines. The empirical inquiry is conducted across six major transformation portfolios in two UK central government departments. The data are collected through conducting semi-structured interviews and gathering documentary reports and analysed by adopting an abductive approach. Findings The findings highlight that two governing practices that have not been previously discussed in the literature: structuring the policy relationship and structuring the business relationship. These practices can be associated with the complex ownership system of the UK central government. The findings also show that in complex ownership systems owners may have different governing and supporting orientations. The micro-dynamics of these governing practices illustrate that the ecology of governing practices is complex, both in terms of the co-existence of complementary and competitive relationships between practices, and in terms of bundles of practices enacting different control regimes. Originality/value The paper adopts a governance-as-practice approach and examines governing major transformation portfolios.

J	Lai, YT; Wang, WC; Wang, HH				Lai, Yu-Ting; Wang, Wei-Chih; Wang, Han-Hsiang			AHP- and simulation-based budget determination procedure for public building construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						budget; cost; simulation; analytical hierarchy process; public building construction project	MODEL; UTILITY	Public construction project budgets account for a high percentage of annual government budgets. Thus, objectively determining project budgets is of priority concern for effectively allocating these budgets by government officers. However, Taiwanese regulations for setting construction project budgets only qualitatively describe the governmental administration process. Without a systematic quantitative method, government officers typically determine project budgets based on their personal experience; thus, budgeting results can be unreliable. This study presents a novel procedure for determining construction project budgets. The proposed procedure integrates an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based multi-criteria evaluation model with a simulation-based cost model. The AHP reflects officer evaluations with respect to budget determination criteria. Cost items are variables. The cost model generates a cumulative cost distribution for establishing project budget boundaries. The merits of the proposed procedure are demonstrated through its application to a Taiwanese project. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, a structural model is presented and calibrated using market data to estimate the default probability of a project company in a PPP project, which lays the foundation for determining the CDS premium. Second, the CDS is priced using the risk-neutral valuation method. Third, sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of project parameters including capital structure, asset rate of return and volatility, bankruptcy loss rate, and tax rate on the default probability and CDS premium. This study concludes that it is beneficial to governments, project companies, and bond holders to implement bond financing in PPP projects with a fairly priced CDS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Decreased government involvement and affordability issues set thresholds for seniors to enter the appropriate retirement housing such as rental villages. Public-private partnership (PPP) is widely used to construct public infrastructure by integrating public welfare and commercial projects. PPPs have, however, not yet been studied or put into effect for rental villages. Concession rent is one of the key factors that affect the success of PPP rental villages. This article proposes PPP as an initiative for rental villages that meet seniors' need for appropriate retirement housing, then develops a framework for rent determination of PPP rental villages and examines this framework based on an invented example. The framework is established for PPP rental villages based on cost-benefit analysis in order to set the rent in consideration of the key factors such as government subsidy, operation cost, concession period and expected rate of return. Two scenarios under the PPP process with different government subsidies are presented for comparison with the conventional approach. An empirical example, developed from an existing rental village in Geelong, is used to numerically verify the framework. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impacts of three variables on the rent: the operation cost, the number of occupied units and the percentage of rental income, and then to discuss scenarios whereby the government's early investment during the construction period can result in a lower rent. The results show that, compared to the conventional approach, the construction of rental villages by applying PPP can effectively reduce the rent to improve affordability for seniors. The development of PPP rental villages could have long-term prospects when well integrated with a government subsidy. The research findings will significantly facilitate the rent determination process of PPP rental villages and satisfy the interests of the government, private sectors and the seniors. The article highlights the importance of PPP rental villages and also provides a guide to other similar PPP projects such as social housing and aged care facilities.

A purposive sampling was performed to get stakeholders' perception comprehensively involved the government, the private sector and the community. A total of 218 samples was collected and analyzed using mean, reliability analysis, ANOVA and posthoc tests. It was found that eight attributes were considered relevant to measure the toll road project design. Meanwhile, the design performance level was considered moderate. Finally, there was no significant difference in perceptions between the government and the private sector regarding the attributes, but there was a difference in perception between the community, the government and the private sector. These findings can help the stakeholders to understand good design application from the community perspective which can be used to improve toll road design performance for delivering a better project social benefit (PSB) to the community.

In order to increase the attractiveness of projects for investors, governments usually provide several types of guarantees such as Minimum Revenue Guarantees (MRGs). In many cases, challenges associated with the valuation of this uncertainty force governments to provide excessive guarantees, placing an increased burden on the public budget. Based on this problem, a real-option-based model is presented for the identification of optimum upper and lower boundaries of compound MRG and Maximum Revenue Cap (MRC) options which establish a fair risk allocation structure. The proposed model uses an optimization approach in which high levels of guarantees in initial years are compensated by the transfer of excess revenues obtained by the private investor in late years. The optimum upper and lower boundaries of compound MRG and MRC options are identified using the proposed model. Results reveal that the emerging net guarantee amount generated by using any pair values of the MRG and MRC that remain in the identified interval not only maintains the attractiveness of project for private investors but also restrains government contingent liabilities. Thus, the identified interval of MRG and MRC enables the structuring of a flexible bargaining environment for both parties.

J	Vassallo, JM; Ortega, A; Baeza, MD				Manuel Vassallo, Jose; Ortega, Alejandro; de los Angeles Baeza, Maria			Impact of the Economic Recession on Toll Highway Concessions in Spain	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Economic recession; Toll road; Traffic estimates; Concession contract; Spain; Public-privatepartnership		After joining the European Union in 1986, Spain experienced steady economic growth that enabled the country to grow at a greater pace than other European countries. During this period, the government of Spain opted for major investments in public infrastructure by taking advantage both of the funding provided by the European Union and of several types of public-private-partnership (PPP) approaches. Within this framework, the government of Spain between 1996 and 2004 procured a series of toll highway concessions. These concessions entered into operation a few years before the global economic recession made itself felt in Spain. The concession contracts signed between the government and some private consortia allocated most of the risks (expropriation, construction, and traffic) to the private sector. In this paper the impact that the economic recession has had on the business performance of the concessionaires is assessed, and the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the government to help the concessionaire to avoid bankruptcy is analyzed. It was found that some of the guarantees offered by the legal framework to the concessionaires in case of bankruptcy are prompting an outcome that could negatively affect the users. In addition to that, some suggestions as to how to better allocate risk in toll highway concessions in the future are provided. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000108.

J	Chang, CY; Chen, S				Chang, Chen-Yu; Chen, Shi			Transitional Public-Private Partnership Model in China: Contracting with Little Recourse to Contracts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; China; Informal control mechanism; Procurement time; Private finance initiative (PFI); Contracting	CONCESSION CONTRACTS; RISK ALLOCATION; INCENTIVES; GOVERNANCE; RENEGOTIATION; SYSTEM; COSTS; POWER; PPP	Since 2013, the Chinese government has attempted to make a transition from user-pay public-private partnership (PPP) to government-pay PPP systems with the aim of facilitating infrastructure investment and government transformation. Whereas the application of government-pay PPP systems can considerably expand the areas where PPPs are suitable, the lengthy procurement time experienced in the implementation of similar systems [e.g.,private finance initiative (PFI)] presents a tough challenge to Chinese procuring authorities who are under increasing pressure to get the earmarked PPP projects off the ground swiftly in order to stem the downward pressure in the economy. The first PFI-like project in China, the Anqing Urban Road PPP project, has been successfully tendered in May 2015 with an impressive record on procurement time. Through the scrutiny of this project, it is found that speedy procurement is achieved by leaving some of the major risks ill-defined and vaguely allocated in the tender document. However, this apparent high-risk exposure did not deter investors. This research maintains that the greater risk tolerance revealed among state-owned enterprise (SOE) investors should be attributed to the power structure embedded in China's administrative system. While leveraging this mechanism can reduce transaction costs, it could hold back the participation of private investors in future Chinese PPP projects.

J	Guo, J; Chen, JL; Xie, YJ				Guo, Jian; Chen, Junlin; Xie, Yujie			Determining a reasonable concession period for risky transportation BOT projects with government subsidies based on cumulative prospect theory	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Build-operate-transfer (BOT); Government subsidy; Concession period; Monte-Carlo simulation; Cumulative prospect theory; Loss-averse behavior	PPP PROJECTS; PUBLIC-WORKS; MODEL; DEMAND; COST	Purpose This paper explores the impact of both government subsidies and decision makers' loss-averse behavior on the determination of transportation build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession periods based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT). The prospect value of a transportation project under traffic risk can be formulated according to the value function for gains and losses and the decision weight for gains and losses. As an extra income for investors, government subsidy is designed for highly risky aspects of BOT transportation projects: uncertain initial traffic volumes and fluctuating growth rates. Design/methodology/approach A decision-making model determining the concession period of a transportation BOT project is proposed by using the Monte-Carlo simulation method based on CPT, and the effects of risky behaviors of private investors on concession period decision making are analyzed. A subsidy method related to the internal rate-of-return (IRR) corresponding to a specific initial traffic volume and growth rate is proposed. The case of an actual BOT highway project is examined to illustrate how the method proposed can be used to determine the concession period of a transportation BOT project considering decision makers' loss-averse behavior and government subsidy. Contingency analysis is discussed to cope with possible misestimating of key factors such as initial traffic volume and cost coefficients. Sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the impact of CPT parameters on the concession period decisions. An actual BOT case which failed to attract private capital is introduced to show the practical application. The results are then interpreted to conclude this paper. Findings Based on comparisons drawn between a concession period decision-making model considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers and a model not considering them, the authors conclude that the concession period based on CPT is distinctly different from that of the loss-neutral model. The concession period based on CPT is longer than the loss-neutral concession period. That is, loss-averse private investors tend to ask for long concession periods to make up for losses they will face in the future. Government subsidies serve as extra income for investors, allowing appointed profits to be secured sooner. For the benefit side of contingency variables, the normal state of initial traffic volume, average annual traffic growth rate and bias degree and the government subsidy need to be paid close attention during the project life span. For the cost side of contingency variables, the annual operating cost variable has a significant impact on the length of predicted concession period, while the large-scale cost variable has minor impact. Originality/value With an actual BOT highway project, the determination of transportation BOT concession periods based on the psychological behaviors of decision makers is analyzed in this paper. As the psychological behaviors of decision makers heavily impact the decision-making process, the authors analyze their impacts on concession period decision making. Government subsidy is specifically designed for various states of initial traffic volume and fluctuating growth rates to cope with corresponding high risks and mitigate private investors' loss-averse behaviors. Contingency analysis and sensitivity analysis are discussed as the estimated values of parameters may not be authentic in actual situations.

In order to improve the project management performance of PIP, the government is searching for a method to build a construction management supervision system. This paper introduces the background and the connotation of agent construction system (ACS), and analyzes the supervision mechanism of construction agent quality management under the two-stage agent mode, puts forward a quality self-control, and government cosupervision mechanism. It consists of a two-dimensional framework of vertical agent self-control and horizontal government cosupervision. For the purpose of better supervision, based on the mechanism, the article introduces rough set theory and questionnaire survey into the research; a quality evaluation model is established. The model builds an information decision table; a heuristic attribute reduction algorithm is applied to reduce the index and helps to get the supervision points. The regulatory authorities can use the evaluation results, and make quality control plan to ensure the effective PIP supervision.

J	Hu, H; Zhu, YH				Hu, Hao; Zhu, Yinghua			Social Welfare-Based Concession Model for Build/Operate/Transfer Contracts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OPERATE-TRANSFER SCHEME; PERIOD; PROJECTS	The concession period is one of the critical factors in the arrangement of a build-operate-transfer contract. For infrastructure that has major strategic, economic, and social effects, the concession period should balance the interests among the private investors, the government, and the users. However, existing research has more frequently discussed economic benefits rather than social welfare. In this regard, this paper proposes an improved model based on the traditional concession model by taking into account the case that the government might lower the service price in the posttransfer period to increase social welfare. This paper also introduces the optimal pricing methods for both concession and posttransfer period. The proposed methodology suggests a narrower concession interval, which helps improve the negotiation efficiency between the government and the private investor to a certain extent. The application of the proposed model is demonstrated by a case study of Western Harbor Tunnel in Hong Kong, and the outcome shows that a significant improvement was made when taking into account social welfare.

The simulation produced a range of concession period for the private sector and government to negotiate. Bargaining game theory was employed in an attempt to find a specific concession period. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, two Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) road projects in the Philippines were used as case studies. The resulting concession period was found to be longer than the actual concession period granted to the private sector indicating the impact of risks in the cash flow. With the proposed methodology, the government could further enhance its policies in processing BOT projects with the end in view of increasing private sector participation in infrastructure development.

Underpricing in Social Infrastructure Projects: Combating the Institutionalization of the Winner's Curse	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Auction; Bid; Brazil; Infrastructure; Procurement; Underpricing; Winner's curse	AUCTIONS; TENDERS; PRICES	Research examining underpricing in social infrastructure projects has been limited (e.g., schools), yet this is a reality that confronts many governments worldwide. The upshot of underpricing is often contractual claims and delays, which can harm the social and economic well-being of citizens. Cognizant of experiencing potential cost overruns, this paper demonstrates that agencies within the Brazilian public sector institutionalized the winner's curse to ensure their infrastructure projects did not exceed their budgets. This action resulted in contractors abandoning works before they were completed and, in doing so, being subjected to contractual sanctions. For the government agencies, this led to increased costs because an alternative contractor was required to complete works. The decision to accept a low bid, therefore, had the opposite of the desired effect because the final project costs exceeded their budgets. It is proposed that government agencies introduce an irresponsible bid threshold, which acts as a benchmark for determining a bid's disqualification to address the winner's curse phenomenon.

J	Wang, B; Cui, QB; Zhang, SB				Wang, Bing; Cui, Qingbin; Zhang, Shuibo			Evaluation of the contract reliability for alternative infrastructure project delivery: a contract engineering method	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						infrastructure development; contract design; contract reliability; guarantee provision; contract engineering	GOVERNMENT REVENUE GUARANTEES; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP; HIGHWAY PROJECTS; RISK; INVESTMENT; CAPACITY; QUALITY; DEMAND; IMPACT; TOLL	Governments at all levels are increasingly motivating the private sector to participate in infrastructure development using alternative project delivery methods to relieve financial burden. When designing contracts, governments usually offer incentives while requiring cost or time guarantee to balance project attractiveness to the private sector and fair protection of public interest. However, a practical and critical problem is how to properly design these provisions. Although previous studies have investigated the value of these provisions, a knowledge gap still exists with respect to methods of fairly and effectively designing such provisions. This study fills this gap by developing a methodology that analyzes the appropriateness of guarantee or warranty provisions for contracts. In this study, a contract reliability index is constructed, and a process of evaluating contract reliability is proposed. The New Mexico Highway 44 project, in which three warranty provision arrangements are investigated, is used as a case study to illustrate the analysis process. Results show that although a ceiling clause can effectively motivate the private sector to participate in the project, it sacrifices a significant amount of public benefits. By contrast, although a warranty option can protect public benefits, it cannot effectively incentivize the private sector. A combination of the ceiling clause and the warranty option will therefore result in improved contract provision design. The proposed methodology in this study is especially useful for governments in properly determining contract clauses in infrastructure development.

Economic restructuring and political uncertainty in Hong Kong, resulting in the mass emigration of manufacturing operations and the professional elite, have prompted a traditionally noninterventionist state to selectively complement the invisible hand of market forces. The Hong Kong government has supported knowledge building and diffusion and helped to create public goods such as electronic commerce, but it has stopped short of guiding or directly subsidizing IT innovation efforts. Emerging IT issues and policy options are considered as Hong Kong becomes part of the People's Republic of China (PRC) under the principle of "one country, two systems." Free trade and information flows, efficient telecommunications, property rights protection, and technology management expertise are identified as critical factors if Hong Kong is to remain an attractive conduit for and recipient of technology transfer, and if its businesses are to sustain their fast-follower and focus strategies, synergize technological innovations from China and the West, and capitalize on the vast new domestic market.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to first examine the factors that enter into government's attitude, value for money (VFM) and PPP-based waste management projects (WMPs) in Ghana. Further, this study examines the relationship between PPP-based waste management and VFM, along with the mediating role of government's attitude. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey questionnaire from four metropolitan municipal assemblies of Ghana. This study's sample consisted of 230 respondents, and structural equation modeling was employed to conduct an empirical analysis.The structured model had evaluated the critical success factors (CSFs). Subsequently, the measurement model helped in the path analysis of the proposed model. Findings The authors found a nonpositive relationship between PPP-based WMPs and VFM; however, government's attitude will influence the achievement of VFM. Reliance on quality targets is ranked as the highest CSF in PPP-based WMPs in Ghana. Also, incentives for private sector participation and effective private sector participation are ranked as the least CSFs. Limitations Most of the questionnaire's items were self -rated by employees of municipal assemblies who were not policymakers. This must have increased the possibility of common method bias. In addition, the study was limited to Ghana (a developing economy); therefore, the generalization of the results should be done with much caution. Practical implications This study suggests to develop a network of private sector consortiums considering international and national participants who are engaged in PPPs in order to ensure successful delivery and hence valuing for money. Originality/value This study offers a novel perspective to investigate the relationship of PPP-based WMPs and VFM and shows how the government's attitude mediates this relationship.

J	Liu, SJ				Liu, SJ			Industrial development and structural adaptation in Taiwan: Some issues of learned entrepreneurship	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						entrepreneurship; industrial competition; intellectual property; market governance; structural change; Taiwan	GROWTH; MIRACLE	The industrialization of Taiwan has been a remarkable phenomenon. This paper discusses recent changes in Taiwan's manufacturing industries and the response of both government and private enterprises to the challenges presented by a dynamic environment and by global competition. Several cases are discussed in light of the activities and adjustments on the part of government and of the public sector, of small and medium business, and of high-tech industries. Government participation over the last four decades has been and will remain pivotal in economic growth and in achieving adjusted positioning. Taiwan's personal computer and IC industries have evolved from an infant stage through an accelerated growth period and are now extending to other technologically associated industries. The small enterprise sector is in a transitional stage of upgrading competitive niches. The unsuccessful stories of biopharmaceuticals and automobiles are discussed in terms of what they reveal about government intervention and the performance of public research institutes. Active patenting activities by Taiwan enterprises and public research institutes illustrate the accumulated technological capability found on this island. The accelerated sociopolitical movements toward democracy, the bureaucratic management of public issues, and the political and economic interactions between Taiwan and China, exert significant effects on the industrial structure and on government's role in directing the industrial evolution. This article presents an integrated reasoning of Taiwan's economic success, It reveals that the neoclassical doctrine of market efficiency is fundamentally valid, and that the effective commercialization of national technological capability has created Taiwan's industrial evolution. Market governance proved to be an efficient short-term policy instrument when the latecomer strategy of cost leadership was applied. A conceptual model of industrial competition and technology commercialization is also proposed to facilitate the methodological analysis. This study concludes that learning capability and human capital will determine the endurance of Taiwan's industrial success, and that entrepreneurship must be learned by the state, as well as by the private firms.

However, it is difficult to predict traffic demand and cost accurately, which may lead to high profit risks for the private sector or increase the fiscal burden for the government. This paper proposes an effective methodological framework for the probabilistic evaluation of the excess profit allocation between the government and the private investor, as well as the corresponding subsidy mechanism. First, an annual profit function is introduced, taking particular care to include factors associated with uncertainties. Then, by applying Monte Carlo simulation to a proposed dynamic quantitative model, the excess profit allocation ratio and subsidy ratio are determined. The model was verified using SH 130, a PPP toll road in Texas, for which a sensitivity analysis was conducted to illustrate the impact of different risk factors. This paper provides a knowledge base so that decision makers can recognize the importance of accurately forecasting profit risks in order to provide a reasonable and fair profit redistribution mechanism to facilitate PPP contract design.

As a precursor to its reduction, or elimination, this paper examines the reasons for B2G corruption by identifying the causes and their relative influence in the tendering process. To do this, a total of 24 causes were first identified through literature review and through the results of semistructured interviews with nine top construction enterprise managers in China's construction market. An opinion questionnaire survey was used further to rank and analyze the causes. A factor analysis also was used to reveal six major underlying causal dimension of B2G corruption, comprising: (1)flawed regulation systems, (2)negative encouragement, (3)lack of professional ethics and codes of conduct, (4)illegitimate gains, (5)lack of competitive and equitable bidding practices and procedures, and (6)the influence of guanxi. Concluding remarks include the study's potential contribution to practice and regulations in the fight against corruption in the Chinese construction industry.

Chinese Contractors in Africa: Home Government Support, Coordination Mechanisms, and Market Entry Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Africa is a traditional overseas market for Chinese contractors. Since the launch of "going out' national strategy in the new century, and with the support and control of the government and subordinate agencies, associations and banks, and innovative approach such as Angola Mode, Chinese contractors' presence in the emerging African market continues to grow. Based on original empirical data collected through interview and questionnaire surveys, this paper analyzes the mechanisms the Chinese government has established to facilitate Chinese contractors' entry into Africa and the perspectives of Chinese contractors about the African market in terms of opportunities and threats. Regression analysis based on existing datasets indicates that despite perceived opportunities and threats, Chinese contractors' performance in Africa in terms of business revenue actually hinges upon the availability of construction capital. The study also reviews the market entry modes used by Chinese contractors, concluding that they prefer to establish a long term presence and opt to commit large resources. Overall, the paper summarizes evidence about the status and innovative approaches of Chinese contractors in penetrating the African construction market, and also characterizes the potential of the African construction market for Chinese contractors.

Despite the worldwide experience has shown that PPP can provide a variety of benefits to the government, to fully gain them several critical aspects related to a PPP project need to be managed, among these the determination of the concession period. This paper provides a methodology to calculate the concession period as the best instant of time that creates a 'win win' solution for both the concessionaire and the government and allows for a fair risk sharing between the two parties. In other words, the concession period is able to satisfy the private and the government by guaranteeing for both parties a minimum profit, and, at the same time, to fairly allocate risks between parties. In order to take into account the uncertainty that affects the PPP projects, the Monte Carlo simulation was used. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) port project in Italy has been used as case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Horne, R; Maller, C; Dalton, T				Horne, Ralph; Maller, Cecily; Dalton, Tony			Low carbon, water- efficient house retrofits: an emergent niche?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy efficiency; homeowners; housing; low carbon; retrofit; water; water conservation; water-energy nexus	SYSTEMS; POLICY	Rising carbon and water footprints of housing present a significant policy challenge across the Westernized world, and this has led to a growing range of government policies and programmes designed to promote greater residential energy and water efficiency. An analysis of low carbon/energy renovations is presented based on interviews with homeowner renovators and project managers in Australia. The renovators included self-declared green renovators' and other, more typical general' renovators. The project managers included a range of builders, designers, coordinators and retrofitters who provided specialized low carbon/water renovation services. Using the idea of niches and multilayer perspective (MLP), the analysis reveals both the limits to government initiatives promoting low carbon/water renovations and the importance of aspirations and relations in the low carbon/water housing renovation niche. The use of deep enquiry using semi-structured interviews reveals a detailed picture of these relations that cross the supply' and demand' sides of housing renovation. These relations reveal interdependence and tensions that profoundly shape low carbon/water renovations. Such relations should be explicitly accounted for in the design of government programmes and regulations.

J	Sun, H; Wang, YN; Meng, J				Sun, Hui; Wang, Yuning; Meng, Jia			A trading and pricing method of expansion options for BOT freeway projects in China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; Real options; Value management	MINIMUM REVENUE GUARANTEE; REAL OPTIONS; GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES; VALUATION; RISK; UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a trading and pricing method of expansion option (EO) model to solve expansion problems of build-operate-transfer (BOT) freeway project. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes an ex ante mechanism through trading the EO to avoid the transaction costs. By editing the paths generated from binomial option pricing model, this paper establishes an American real option binomial lattice model and evaluates the value of EO. Data are collected from Liaoning province in China and the model is practiced in the context of a BOT freeway in Liaoning province. Findings Supported by empirical evidence, this study finds out that there exists a minimum price at which the government can sell the EO and a maximum price that the private sector is willing to pay. When the minimum price is negative, the government should transfer the EO to the private sector free of charge to avoid the transaction costs. Otherwise, the government should sell the EO at a reasonable price to protect public interests. Originality/value This paper builds a trading EO model to solve expansion problems instead of renegotiations. In addition to reducing the transaction costs for the whole society, trading EO can also raise the respective payoffs of both public and private sectors. An EO trading framework and algorithm is further developed. It realized an American option model, making the owner can exercise the option whenever he wants. Thus, the whole model is adapted to best fit BOT highway practice.

The study aims to find an answer to this research question: "How is the organizational design and management of a megaproject that has been alive in a confrontational socio-political environment and whose national strategic importance is high?" Design/methodology/approach Organizational theory and critical theory perspectives are used in this study. Istanbul's grand airport is chosen as the case study. Interview, focus group and document analysis methods are used together. The research yields data from qualitative resources. Verbal and written materials are organized into three major themes and 27 key subjects for content analysis. Findings A top level of organizational management can be attained in the state in order for the mega projects with high national strategic importance to survive without problems and with high performance. The top government-level organizational structure implemented at Istanbul's new airport has reduced complexity, risk and uncertainty; increased performance and product quality; and strenghtened inter-organizational compatibility and communication within the megaproject organization. However, this structuring also increased centralization, reduced transparency and direct public participation in the decision-making process. Originality/value This empirical research widens and deepens the theoretical foundations of top government hands-on megaproject management. The study, which includes a process analysis, allows to better understand the philosophy, nature, success, planning process, social organization and dynamics of megaprojects and to explain them through the values and strategies of organizations.

J	Xu, JW; Jiang, L; Moon, S				Xu, Jiang-Wei; Jiang, Li; Moon, Sungwoo			Determination of the Optimal Concession Period for BOT Contract Projects Based on a Discrete Stochastic Process Model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build-operate-transfer project; Concession period; Discrete stochastic process; Utility function; Contracting		The concession period is one of the most important issues in the contractual arrangement of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects. When planning a BOT project, the government should aim for a trade-off between the concerned government's satisfaction and the private concessionaire's profit. The objective of this paper is to present a discrete stochastic process model to obtain an optimal concession period considering the trade-off. The process model is developed for a highway project by analyzing the actual traffic data. The net present value (NPV) is calculated for use as a constraint condition that indicates the boundary of risk preference in a utility function. Using a utility function, this paper estimates the duration of concession periods at which the government can both attract investments from private concessionaires and satisfy public opinion. A numerical simulation is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology presented. The result of the simulation shows that the discrete stochastic process model contributes to a better understanding of trade-offs in determining the optimal concession period.

However, because many PPP projects will be transferred back to the host governments upon expiry of the concession period, problems related to the subsequent management of PPP projects have not yet been thoroughly studied. Residual value risk (RVR) is a critical concern when the projects revert back to the public sector. Through an extensive literature review and an open-ended questionnaire survey, the perception of RVR in PPP projects is elaborated in this paper, which aims to present a precise definition and meaning of RVR in PPP projects. The survey results indicate that RVR is viewed as an important concern by professionals and academics. The definition of RVR can be phrased as the risk that on expiry or earlier termination of the service contract, the asset (tangible or intangible) is not in accordance with the value originally estimated by the government at which point the private party agreed to transfer it to the government; as a result, public sectors may suffer the loss of the residual value, and the private sector partner may also suffer the loss of compensation from the government owing to a different residual value. Six critical risk factors leading to RVR are identified in this paper: (1)downfall of product or service performance; (2)functional problems; (3)decrease of profitability and low possibility of refinancing; (4)deterioration of maintainability; (5)decline in operability; (6)failure of sustainability. On the basis of the proposed RVR model, the cumulative effects of the interaction of different risk factors are identified. The proposed RVR definition and its associated RVR risk factors in PPP projects can be considered for use by the public sector to better regulate and manage PPP projects and to facilitate the development of PPP projects from the perspectives of regulatory and financial planning.

The project was divided into three main phases: literature review, creation and execution of an organizational culture survey, and the development of a project management model compatible with GR&D organizations. It was found that, although there are cultural gaps between the GR&D and project management cultures, it is possible to bridge these gaps by a combination of training, organizational structure, and the application of project management techniques blended to match the type of research project and fundamental cultural assumptions.

A lack of available benchmark metrics has made it difficult, if not impossible, for organizations to identify areas to target for process improvement. A significant factor that has been found to contribute to poor organizational and project performance is rework. Using the results of a questionnaire survey, the paper presents and discusses a series of benchmark metrics for the causes and costs of rework for 161 construction projects. A generic framework for benchmarking rework at the interfaces of a project's life cycle is proposed, and unstructured interviews are used to subject the proposed framework to validation by industry practitioners.

J	Winch, GM				Winch, GM			Institutional reform in British construction: partnering and private finance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						professional system; partnering; private finance; movement for innovation; public sector procurement; British construction; institutional change; UK		The British construction industry is presently going through a period of rapid change. A combination of government-led reform initiatives, changes in government procurement strategies, and increasing exposure to international competition is focusing minds and shifting positions. This paper provides an analysis of the institutional aspects of these changes, identifying the root of the problems that the reforms are tackling, and indicating what the prospects of success might be. The paper starts with a historical overview of the evolution of what is here called the professional system, which has dominated the British industry for 150 years. This provides the context for the exploration of the two principal forces for change in the industry - the reform of contractual relations, especially the diffusion of partnering, and the shift of government procurement towards concession contracting in the shape of the Private Finance Initiative. In conclusion, the prospects for success are discussed, noting that the British construction industry is relatively successful in international markets, but that it shares many traditional problems of other sectors of British industry - the predominance of personal capitalism has meant a failure to develop organizational capabilities - the most notable symptom being the continuing reliance on self-organizing gangs of workers for actual production.

Considering the psychological characteristic of decision makers' fairness preference, this study innovatively introduces the inequity aversion theory into the concession model, which provides a novel perspective to investigate the distribution of benefits and risks. In the improved model, the decision makers' investment utility involves their economic benefits as well as their disutility due to inequity. Furthermore, the equilibrium principle of benefits and risks in this model has changed to minimize the gap between the investment utility-risk ratios of the government and the private sector. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, this study verifies the application of the model to a BOT road project in China. The results show that the concession period with fairness preference can effectively narrow the gap between the investment utility-risk ratios of the government and the private sector, thus guaranteeing the fair distribution of benefits and risks in the BOT road project.

Addressing the factors influencing labor productivity is crucial for improving the productivity performance of the sector. A theoretical structural model is developed to understand the influence of six key factors on construction labor productivity and their links to labor productivity performance on a project. A structural equation modeling technique is used to analyze data collected via a questionnaire survey of 185 respondents consisting of government authorities and construction actors. The final model adapts 29 attributes across six labor productivity factors, namely, management and control, workforce, financial, external, project, and material and equipment. The outcomes of the final structural equation model confirm the significance of management team competency level and workforce quality in enhancing labor productivity. Moreover, client support and efforts by government authorities are found to be significant for labor productivity improvements. Despite the limitations of the study, it is hoped that the research outcomes will significantly contribute to improve the labor productivity performance in the Malaysian construction industry for faster delivery of construction projects with lower cost and higher quality.

The terms and conditions of a production sharing contract (PSC) between the government and international oil companies (IOC) are usually finalized prior to the commencement of operations and with partial knowledge of the reserve level. In addition, hydrocarbons have several potential uses. This paper formulates an optimization model that assists the government in these challenges. Given an initial estimated reserve volume and hydrocarbon price, the model determines values for both the PSC's key parameters and the allocation of the government share into different uses to generate the maximum benefit to the state while providing an acceptable rate of return for the IOC. The model is applied to Lebanon. We find that an optimal PSC for Lebanon involves no royalty for all reasonable values of potential reserves, and a high cost recovery and profit share for low reserve volumes. In addition, sensitivity analysis indicates that the preferred export mode is via the Arab pipeline, due to the low level of the current gas price and high cost of the alternative liquefied natural gas export mode.

The paper reports on the first phase of the ongoing European Union IntelCities integrated project that seeks to integrate electronic governance of cities and urban planning. The background to the project in terms of the e-Europe Action Plan is explored and the outcome of surveys of user needs and requirements carried out in the cities of Marseilles (France), Siena and Rome (Italy), Helsinki (Finland), Leicester and Manchester (UK), and Dresden and Bertin (Germany) are explained. The outcomes identify a range of implications for digital or electronic planning in terms of increasing the efficiency in e-urban planning and the need to develop digital methodologies for widening public participation. Thus. the importance of e-skills development in new forms of e-planning for planners, developers and citizens is highlighted and shown to be important for achieving a wider e-enabled sustainable knowledge society.

J	Subprasom, K; Chen, A				Subprasom, Kitti; Chen, Anthony			Effects of regulation on highway pricing and capacity choice of a build-operate-transfer scheme	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						build/operate/transfer; pricing; transportation networks; highways; regulations; China	ROAD NETWORK; DESIGN	The build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme is being used increasingly by governments in their drive to privatize major public transportation projects. In a BOT scheme, the main objective for the private investors in determining the viability of a BOT project is profit, whereas the main objective for the government is whether the construction of the BOT project will give a positive social welfare to the society. These two objectives are often seen to conflict with each other. In this paper, modeling and analysis of highway pricing and capacity choice of a BOT scheme are provided to illustrate the tradeoff between the two objectives. Regulation is normally imposed by the government to ensure that the BOT project satisfies certain requirements. Five cases of the BOT network design problem are analyzed: (1) BOT without regulation; (2) BOT with positive performance measures; (3) BOT with a maximum toll charge level; (4) BOT with a minimum roadway capacity; and (5) BOT with a maximum toll charge and a minimum roadway capacity. Numerical results using a case study of the intercity expressway in the Pearl River Delta Region in China are provided to examine the various effects of regulation on a BOT project.

J	van der Vooren, A; Alkemade, F				van der Vooren, Alexander; Alkemade, Floortje			Managing the Diffusion of Low Emission Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agent-based simulation; consumer adoption; infrastructure development; sustainability; technological change	NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; INCREASING RETURNS; MARKET-STRUCTURE; LOCK-IN; INNOVATION; MODEL; COMPETITION; HETEROGENEITY; TECHNOLOGIES; TRANSITION	There is significant uncertainty among technology providers, governments, and consumers about which technology will be the vehicle technology of the future. Governments try to stimulate the diffusion of low emission vehicles with diverse policy measures such as purchase price subsidies. However, the effect of such support measures on the speed and direction of technological change is unclear as different vehicle technologies might be preferred under different policy conditions. Decision makers, such as firm actors involved in green technology management, are thus strongly dependent on government policy when making strategic decisions. For these firm actors, determining their strategy regarding low emission vehicles is a complex task in a changing environment of coevolving consumer preferences, technology characteristics, and green technology policies. This paper presents an agent-based model of the competition between several emerging and market-ready low emission vehicle technologies and the dominant fossil-fuel-based internal combustion engine vehicles. The simulations illustrate the effects of different policy measures on technological change and their implications for the strategic actions of firm actors. More specifically, collaboration and standardization strategies can lead to synergies that contribute to technological change without risking early lock-in.

Performance objective-based dynamic adjustment model to balance the stakeholders' satisfaction in PPP projects	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						satisfaction; stakeholder; public-private partnerships; performance objectives	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; CONCESSION PERIOD; BOT CONTRACTS; METHODOLOGY	Aiming to balance the interests of the principal stakeholders (the private sector, the government and the general public) in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) projects, the satisfaction of stakeholders were researched thoroughly in this paper. A satisfaction evaluation model was structured based on authors' prior questionnaire survey focusing on the performance objective indicators (POIs) of different stakeholders. The parties' preferred POIs were identified as follows: all three parties emphasize the objectives of construction quality, service quality, cost, time, and lifecycle cost very much. Individually, the private sector prefer the objectives of profit making and government support, the government prefer the objectives of budget saving and risk transfer, and the general public prefer the objectives of toll rate and the facilities' quantities. Furthermore, a satisfaction adjustment model was proposed based on the interrelationships of the adjusting POIs and their impact on the stakeholders' satisfaction by using the feedback loops of System Dynamics (SD). An illustrative case was also introduced, the results of which indicated that the satisfaction evaluation and adjustment model could be well applied to balance the interests of stakeholders and also improve the general performance of the project.

J	Zhang, XL; Bao, HJ; Wang, HD; Skitmore, M				Zhang, Xiaoling; Bao, Haijun; Wang, Hongdi; Skitmore, Martin			A model for determining the optimal project life span and concession period of BOT projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Build-operate-transfer; Project life span; Concession period; Optimization	OPERATE; BUILD	The concession agreement is the core feature of BOT projects, with the concession period being the most essential feature in determining the time span of the various rights, obligations and responsibilities of the government and concessionaire. Concession period design is therefore crucial for financial viability and determining the benefit/cost allocation between the host government and the concessionaire. However, while the concession period and project life span are essentially interdependent, most methods to date consider their determination as contiguous events that are determined exogenously. Moreover, these methods seldom consider the, often uncertain, social benefits and costs involved that are critical in defining, pricing and distributing benefits and costs between the various parties and evaluating potentially distributable cash flows. In this paper, we present the results of the first stage of a research project aimed at determining the optimal build-operate-transfer (BOT) project life span and concession period endogenously and interdependently by maximizing the combined benefits of stakeholders. Based on the estimation of the economic and social development involved, a negotiation space of the concession period interval is obtained, with its lower boundary creating the desired financial return for the private investors and its upper boundary ensuring the economic feasibility of the host government as well as the maximized welfare within the project life. The outcome of the new quantitative model is considered as a suitable basis for future field trials prior to implementation. The structure and details of the model are provided in the paper with Hong Kong tunnel project as a case study to demonstrate its detailed application. The basic contributions of the paper to the theory of construction procurement are that the project life span and concession period are determined jointly and the social benefits taken into account in the examination of project financial benefits. In practical terms, the model goes beyond the current practice of linear-process thinking and should enable engineering consultants to provide project information more rationally and accurately to BOT project bidders and increase the government's prospects of successfully entering into a contract with a concessionaire. This is expected to generate more negotiation space for the government and concessionaire in determining the major socioeconomic features of individual BOT contracts when negotiating the concession period. As a result, the use of the model should increase the total benefit to both parties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the history of the virtual agency concept and its important characteristics. The paper identifies the potential benefits and associated risks involved in managing R&D within a virtual agency. Three cases are examined where the virtual agency concept has been applied to R&D programs: the High Performance Computing and Communications initiative, the Next Generation Internet, and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. The case studies indicate that the R&D process is attempting to balance formal process controls with the agility to adapt rapidly to new research opportunities. Virtual agencies can be used to improve organizational efficiency, improve knowledge transfer, increase interoperability through standards, provide better alignment of agency missions with national policy, and introduce increased flexibility into the R&D process. At the same time, the virtual agency concept has major risks including inefficiencies due to organizational complexity, the danger of collective myopia, the problem of adopting standards too early, the difficulty of reaching objectives in a loose organizational structure, and the problem, of properly balancing the tension between agency mission objectives and national policy agendas.

J	Meng, XH; Zhao, Q; Shen, QP				Meng, Xianhai; Zhao, Qi; Shen, Qiping			Critical Success Factors for Transfer-Operate-Transfer Urban Water Supply Projects in China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Transfer-operate-transfer; Critical success factor; Water supply; China	BUILD; MODEL	Over the years, build-operate-transfer (BOT) has continuously attracted research interests. Many studies on BOT have been carried out. Variations of BOT such as build-own-operate-transfer and build-own-operate have also been reported in some relevant publications. However, few investigations thus far have been conducted for transfer-operate-transfer (TOT). Therefore, there is a knowledge gap in this particular field. TOT is a new model that is suitable for existing infrastructure and public utility projects formerly funded by the governments and currently operated by state-owned enterprises. It refers to the transfer of a running public project to a foreign business or domestic private entity. Based on four case studies carried out in the Chinese water supply industry, this paper examines why there is an increasing need for TOT projects and identifies the distinctive features of TOT practice in China. This is followed by an introduction of a framework of critical success factors (CSFs) for TOT projects. The most important factors include project profitability, asset quality, fair risk allocation, competitive tendering, internal coordination within government, employment of professional advisors, corporate governance, and government supervision. The identification of CSFs provides a useful guidance to project parties planning to participate in TOT practice. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000058.

GIS-based engineering management service functions: Taking GIS beyond mapping for municipal governments	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								A geographic information system (GIS) is found to be a platform of choice for meeting the needs of several core engineering functions. However, there is a dearth of GIS usage for engineering management service functions (EMSFs), which typically are specific to individual jurisdictions. This study outlines a simple approach for automating EMSFs on a GIS platform and demonstrates its efficacy. In the first phase of this research, a review of GIS applications in various municipal government functions is conducted. The review indicated that most municipal governments have currently employed GIS for a variety of general administrative services such as revenue collection, data archival, and information dissemination purposes. The proposed approach is demonstrated by developing a GIS model for a sanitary sewer reimbursement (GIS-MSSR) program at a fast-growing urban municipality. Data modeling issues related to representing complex management tasks within the context of a relational database model are discussed. Development of functional requirement specifications for GIS models and their implementation are also discussed. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by highlighting productivity gains resulting from the development of GIS-MSSR. The research concluded that several complex engineering service management functions can be automated on GIS platforms to realize substantial productivity gains. Automating multiple tasks, however small they might be, in an integrated environment can increase the productivity even further.

However, the development of Chinese distributed PV systems has failed to meet expectations because of their irrational profit and cost allocations. In this study, the methodology for calculating the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for PV is thoroughly discussed to address this issue. A mixed-integer linear programming model is built to determine the optimal system operation strategy with a benefit analysis. An externality-corrected mathematical model based on Shapley value is established to allocate the cost of distributed PV systems in 15 Chinese cities between the government, utility grid and residents. Results show that (i) an inverse relationship exists between the LCOEs and solar radiation levels; (ii) the government and residents gain extra benefits from the utility grid through net metering policies, and the utility grid should be the highly subsidized participant; (iii) the percentage of cost assigned to the utility grid and government should increase with the expansion of battery bank to weaken the impact of demand response on increasing theoretical subsidies; and (iv) apart from the LCOE, the local residential electricity prices remarkably impact the subsidy calculation results.

By utilizing MATLAB software, the analysis of the influence of agent coupling degree, group size, and government policies on the stable evolution of university-industry collaborative innovation is taken into account, while simulating. Our findings indicate that, first, agent coupling degree is positively and nonlinearly related to the stable evolution of university-industry collaborative innovation; second, when an enterprise's size is equal to university's, group size is more significant to the stable evolution of university-industry collaborative innovation than agent coupling degree; third, when a group size of an enterprise and university is different, the combinations of agent coupling degree and group size have various effects on the stable evolution of enterprise group and university group; and fourth, government policies have a significantly positive impact on the stable evolution of university-industry collaborative innovation, and incentive measures are more effective than punitive ones. Research conclusions have developed the relationship among university-industry collaborative innovation agents, expanded the boundary of the stability study of collaborative innovation, and provided new ideas for improving the effectiveness of government innovation policies.

Because CAD project has different attributes during wartime and peacetime states, it's necessary to comprehensively consider the project performance under different states to conduct scientific performance measurement. This paper focuses on the process of construction, operation, and handover of CAD PPP project to construct a unified project performance measurement indicator system, then a system dynamics (SD) model is established to carry out dynamic performance measurement and simulation of CAD PPP project under different social states respectively. A case study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SD model, model validation, sensitivity analysis and result analysis were included as well. The study result can make the project performance management of CAD PPP more scientific and reasonable, and help decision-makers to formulate effective performance improvement strategies. It's found out that government plays an important role in CAD PPP projects, when resources are limited, the government should give priority to measures such as reducing tax rates and increasing subsidies to ensure project benefits. The research methods can also provide reference for performance measurement of other PPP projects.

The elderly population being less familiar with IT implies that issues pertaining to their acceptance of information systems (IS) deserve special attention. However, the IS and gerontology literatures seldom explore IS acceptance among the aged. Attempting to address this gap, a research model is developed by integrating relevant antecedents from previous literature and empirically tested in the context of an e-Government service tailored for senior citizens. Our findings reveal that consistent with previous technology acceptance studies, senior citizens' use intention is driven by their perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the service. Additionally, their Internet safety perception impacts the acceptance of this online financial service. Furthermore, resource savings and self-actualization determine senior citizens' usefulness perception, whereas computer anxiety and computing support are antecedents of perceived ease of use. Of these antecedents, self actualization and computer anxiety appear particularly relevant for the elderly as compared to younger working professionals in most previous literature for whom these antecedents have not been important. The study contributes by providing an integrative model of IS acceptance among the aged, which may facilitate theory development and practice.

In these cases, the financial dispute must be resolved by key stakeholders such as the government, private investors, and end users; otherwise, the project will terminate early. Despite numerous reports of financial disputes, the literature lacks a comprehensive model for analyzing stakeholder strategies and examining the outcomes of PPP projects. In order to fill this research gap, this paper uses a three-player non-zero-sum game to extract the potential results of interactions among them. Then, using the concepts of game theory, the expected payoff players are calculated in the best individual strategy and cooperation terms, and the optimal outcomes are presented. The proposed model, on the one hand, examines the impacts of early termination, including the compensation mechanism of the government, the investment value of the private investor, and alternative services for users. On the other hand, it measures the expected payoff of players from participation in the project rescue. Applying this model can support strategic renegotiations and provide a fair and optimal structure to readjust contract variables (concession period, tolls, and government subsidy), which will facilitate and expedite the decision-making process in resolving financial conflicts.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; SECTOR	With the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the desperate demand for infrastructure developments has created bottlenecks in the country's sustainable development. Infrastructure investment could not be funded completely by the government alone. Taking Beijing as an example, there will be about 2,400 infrastructure projects to be developed during 2006-2010 with a total investment of over RMB 470 billion, which may impose budgetary pressure on the government. As a result, public-private partnership (PPP) could be considered as a favorable option to help provide these rapidly demanded public works and services. In order to investigate the potential for adopting PPPs in the People's Republic of China, this paper aims to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) necessary to conduct PPP projects. The views from Chinese experts were collected via an empirical questionnaire survey. The respondents were invited to rate a total of 18 CSFs that contribute to the success of PPP projects as gleaned from the contemporary literature. The results of this survey were analyzed by the factor analysis technique. The findings showed that the 18 CSFs could be grouped into five underlying factors including: Factor 1-stable macroeconomic environment; Factor 2-shared responsibility between public and private sectors; Factor 3-transparent and efficient procurement process; Factor 4-stable political and social environment; and Factor 5-judicious government control.

Yet little attention has been paid to macro-level accident situations of the entire industry. Therefore, this study develops a comprehensive assessment model on accident situations of Chinese building industry, aiming at assisting the government to better understand and improve accident situations of the entire industry. Based on China conditions, six indicators related to accident situations are firstly selected to establish an indicator system; then structure entropy weight method is proposed to determine indicator weighs, with dynamic classification method to explore the characteristics of accident situations. The results demonstrate that the provinces with poor accident situations account for 53% of all provinces, and they are mainly distributed in the central and western regions of China where there exist the underdeveloped economy. Meanwhile, some provinces experience poor accident situations that could be out-of-control, especially for Hebei. Provinces in the southeastern and northeastern regions of China perform relatively well, but they still have much improvement room for accident situations. The findings validate the rationality of the developed model and can provide valuable insights of safety regulation strategies for the government from the macro-level perspective.

The procurement method used in the sector is mainly traditional methods. However, the road sector has been characterized by cost and time overruns and quality concerns. On the other hand, public-private partnership (PPP) has become increasingly popular among governments as alternative procurement method than the traditional public-sector financing. The current government of Ethiopia has also understood the need for mobilizing resources from different sources in order to meet the growing demand for public infrastructure. Nonetheless, rushing to implement PPP projects without careful study of enabling environment may end up with projects being terminated in later stages. Therefore, this research examined the critical success factors of PPP road projects in Ethiopia. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed. The findings revealed that for effective implementation of PPP road projects in Ethiopia, the government should ensure at least the presence of an enabling specific PPP policy, well organized and committed public agency, stable political and social environment, favourable legal frameworks and good governance. It is also recommended that the PPP procurement process indicated in the PPP proclamation should be properly regulated with sector specific laws, guidelines, standard bidding documents and contract models for PPP road projects.

Many initiatives relating to governance are generated by a need for improvement of organizational performance and ability to implement and adapt to change. These generally take the form of projects and programs encouraging a variety of project management implementations in the public sector. This article reports on examination of the expectations and realization of value from investment in project management in four Australian public-sector organizations with particular reference to the government context, the perspective of public value management (PVM), and the support that project management provides in meeting the demands of public-sector governance.

The governance of major public projects has been an important subject of inquiry in project management, as researchers have investigated governance frameworks for public projects as a tool to enhance performance. Yet, while performance is traditionally seen as improved efficiency, other aspects need consideration. Using phronetic and abductive theory building, this conceptual article investigates the relevance of a governance framework for major public projects along three dimensions: those of greater government efficiency, legitimacy and accountability. The main contribution of this article is to enrich existing theory on the governance of major public projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Examined are the project costs, project savings, benefit/cost ratio, and operational performance improvement for Six Sigma projects conducted over a seven year period. Projects in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing (administrative and service-related) applications were examined. The analysis demonstrated that Six Sigma projects are very cost effective, achieving a median benefit/cost ratio of 2.66 for the Six Sigma program for the contractor. The results also demonstrated that process improvements for Six Sigma projects in nonmanufacturing operations achieve gains comparable to improvements in manufacturing operations, and demonstrate that significant gains can he achieved through Six Sigma programs.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Public transportation; Pricing; Government; Vehicles; Regulation; Supply chains; Stakeholders; Fairness concern; pricing; ride-hailing platform; shared economy; social welfare	SUPPLY CHAIN; DECISION-MAKING; DEMAND; CHANNEL; IMPACT	The rapid development of ride-hailing platforms has a substantial impact on urban transportation ecosystems, which raises the issue of fairness concerns both vertically and horizontally. To investigate the effects of dual-fairness concerns on the ride-hailing platform, this article studies a taxi and ride-hailing system, which captures the vertical interactions between the ride-hailing platform and the ride-hailing driver with vertical fairness concern, and the horizontal competition between the ride-hailing driver and the taxi driver with horizontal fairness concern. Two incentive strategies (i.e., revenue and demand sharing strategy and ride-hailing fare subsidy strategy) for the ride-hailing platform are designed to relieve the negative impact of fairness concerns. Government's regulation on taxi fare is also discussed in this article. By analyzing the dynamic game models that involve these stakeholders, we find that: 1) both the vertical and the horizontal fairness concerns will lower the utility of the ride-hailing platform; 2) the revenue and demand sharing strategy and the ride-hailing fare subsidy strategy can enhance the utility of the ride-hailing platform by relieving the negative impact of horizontal and vertical fairness concerns, respectively; and 3) with the government's regulation on taxi fare, the negative impact of dual-fairness concerns can be relieved, and a higher social welfare can be achieved.

J	Smith, SD				Smith, Simon D.			Safety first? Production pressures and the implications on safety and health	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Productivity; economy; performance improvement; safety; health	INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT; CONSTRUCTION; GROWTH; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; WORKLOAD; INDUSTRY	The prominence of production, schedule, cost and economic wellbeing in government policy and review is explored and contrasted with the status of safety. The connection between productivity as an objective and safety as a constraint is reviewed, though it can be concluded that in spite of widespread belief of a connection there is very little empirical causal evidence for high production pressure causing negative effects on safety. Nevertheless, the inverse is mooted, that high levels of safety has had a negative impact on productivity in construction. This possibility is discussed in the context of government rhetoric which tends to be highly critical of construction's economic shortcomings yet quite silent on the matter of its safety successes. The essay concludes with a possible vision for the future that allows safety and productivity to be re-positioned in terms of their potential symbiosis.

However, many projects have been abandoned or canceled owing to an insufficient understanding of risk factors, lack of awareness of the financial consequences of risk, and a limited understanding of risk bearers' capacity to handle risks. Using a mixed research method, this study identified critical risks in PPP toll road projects in Vietnam that affect the projects' financial viability, determined the PPP partners capable of managing these risks, and explored the causes to these risks and their management strategies. Empirical data collected from quantitative and qualitative studies revealed 22 risks critically affecting toll road projects' financial viability in Vietnam, either by inflating projects' cash outflows or reducing projects' cash inflows in a commonly used net present value (NPV) analysis model. This confirms the important role of government support and guarantees in the mitigation of the risks in developing countries and indicates that governments need to actively get involved in managing these risks and planning for the associated government support. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of risk management in PPP toll road projects in Vietnam, which will not only benefit public management, policy consultants, and investors, but also academics interested in studying PPP projects in developing countries.

Prior studies have investigated the financial impact of including noncompete provisions in public-private partnership (PPP) contracts to ensure project attractiveness to private entities, although the potential impact of such provisions on the public interest has not been well documented. This study contributes to the literature by incorporating social benefits into an evaluation model to balance the protection of public and private interests. Three contract design alternatives-strict noncompete, compensation for competing facilities, and compete without compensation-are evaluated and compared. This study demonstrates these alternatives with the I-77 Express Lane project in North Carolina and provides several insightful results. First, a strict noncompete provision often worsens congestion, negatively affecting the public interest, and should be avoided. Second, both public and private organizations may benefit from inclusion of a compensation provision that eliminates a prospective monopoly while offering compensation for competing facilities. Third, public benefits from competing facilities present a convex curve over time, suggesting optimal timing for the government to build the competing facility. The results illustrate the significant effect of the noncompete provision on the public interest, and provide governments with a reference to balance protection of the public interest and attractiveness to private investors when designing the noncompete provision.

J	Jin, HY; Liu, SJ; Li, J; Liu, CL				Jin, Hongyu; Liu, Shijing; Li, Jun; Liu, Chunlu			A game-theoretic approach to developing a concession renegotiation framework for user-pays PPPs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Concession renegotiation; public-private partnerships; bargaining game; coalitional game; revenue uncertainty	CONTRACTS; PROJECTS; PROCUREMENT; PERIOD; MODEL	In public-private partnership (PPP) contracting, a common practice for the hosting government is to fix the contractual clauses before signing a concession agreement with private investors. If there is no negotiation stage in a tendering process, the critical contractual parameters, e.g., the concession period, are usually stipulated by the government at the pre-contractual stage. However, due to the incompleteness of PPP contracts, the practice of presetting contractual parameters often leads to ex-post renegotiation or even project failure. Revenue uncertainty has become one of the most significant sources of PPP contract renegotiation, especially for user-pays PPPs such as highways and tunnels. In order to facilitate renegotiation between project parties in a user-pays PPP project, this paper develops a concession renegotiation framework targeting three critical contractual parameters, i.e., concession period, concession price and government guarantee, to control the revenue risk for project parties. Game-theoretic modelling is the approach used to determine the optimal adjustment values for the critical contractual parameters. The bargaining game model is developed to find the optimal adjustment values for the concession period and government guarantee when a renegotiation process is initiated, while the coalitional game model is employed to discuss renegotiation of the concession price. This study contributes to the theoretical foundation for understanding the renegotiation framework of user-pays PPP projects. Project JG is taken as a numerical example to validate the proposed model. The project parameters are extracted from the historical data for a local highway PPP in Yunnan, China and analysed using the econometrics software MATLAB. The renegotiation outcomes show that to control the revenue risk for private investors, the concession period needs to be extended to 34 years or the concession price adjusted to a number ranging between 4.38 and 5.13 USD. The data analysis outcomes also suggest that to control overly lucrative conditions for private investors, renegotiation of the concession price is a better choice.

The budgetary estimate is the main basis for the Chinese government to verify the highway project investment, which is estimated mainly based on the quota and price information issued by government but still lacks systematic cost indices to measure its rationality. The highway engineering cost of different regions in China varies greatly, and the accumulated cost data are not insufficient. This paper chooses the gray relation analysis-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GRA-LASSO) hybrid method, which has significant advantages in dealing with high-dimensional small sample data and multiple correlation variables, to establish the highway engineering budgetary estimate prediction model so as to examine the rationality of estimated investment at the initial stage of construction. Using budgetary estimate data on 121 highway projects that have been approved by the Chinese government and various macroeconomic data, the key cost drivers are identified through gray relation analysis (GRA) quantitatively, and 10 high-correlation indexes are selected as input variables. Then, the relationship among engineering characteristic variables, economic factors, and highway engineering budget are established by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The empirical test results show that eight indexes have significant impact on the highway cost, including earthwork quantities, route length, number of lanes, bridge-tunnel ratio, protection works quantities, highway construction investment, producer price index (PPI) and purchasing manager's index (PMI) of construction industry. Compared with ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and LASSO method alone, the GRA-LASSO combined method has better performance in error evaluation index and stronger model accuracy and generalization ability. The study result can be mainly used for government to rapidly audit, forecast, forewarn, monitor, and manage the highway engineering cost, and also help investors and designers to pay close attention to the influence of design parameters and external environment on cost. Moreover, it provides a reference method or model for establishing a highway engineering cost index.

Developing a Fuzzy Risk Allocation Model for PPP Projects in China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantitative risk allocation; PPP projects; Fuzzy set; Fuzzy synthetic evaluation; China	CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE	Equitable allocation of risks between the government and the private sector in concession agreement is essential to the success of public-private partnership (PPP) projects. The decision-making process, based on the established risk allocation principles expressed in linguistic terms, requires qualitative judgment and experiential knowledge of construction experts. However, it is subjective, partial, and implicit in actual application. This paper aims to develop a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model for determining an equitable risk allocation between the government and the private sector. By doing so, it assists the PPP project practitioners to transform the risk allocation principles in linguistic terms into a more usable and systematic quantitative-based analysis using fuzzy set. Twenty-three principles and influencing factors for risk allocation were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Nine critical risk allocation criteria (RACs) that evaluate the risk carrying capability of project participants were further identified, validated, and compiled based on the experts' knowledge via face-to-face interviews. On the other hand, the weighting for each critical risk allocation criterion was determined through a two-round Delphi questionnaire survey. A set of knowledge-based fuzzy inference rules was then established to set up the membership function for the nine RACs. Based on the research findings, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model was finally established to determine an equitable risk allocation between the government and the private sector.

J	da Cruz, NF; Marques, RC				da Cruz, Nuno Ferreira; Marques, Rui Cunha			Rocky Road of Urban Transportation Contracts	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Good governance; Public service contracts; Service delivery models; Urban transportation	PUBLIC TRANSPORT; GOVERNMENT AGENCIES; BUS SERVICES; ORGANIZATION; EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS; PPPS	The provision of urban transport services entails several challenges. Past research has been concerned with economic (e. g., tariff setting and financial sustainability), technological (e. g., different modes or energy sources), social (e. g., the impact of public transportation on social cohesion), and even institutional or policy issues (e. g., privatization). However, few studies focus on governance issues or on the scrutiny of the contractual relations between the competent authorities (local governments) and the operators. The current paper attempts to address this gap in the literature. The objective is to assess the rationale behind each governance structure and the quality of contracting procedures. To accomplish this, the authors consider the Portuguese regulatory framework and analyze six contracts signed between the local governments and the operators, corresponding to three different governance models: municipal companies, mixed companies, and concessionary companies. All cases present serious governance problems, especially regarding the initial decision-making process, the access to the market of private investors, and the clear definition of objectives monitored through output-oriented indicators. The case-study analysis shows that municipal companies are prone to being politically steered, and the complex web of contracts of mixed companies fails to protect the public interest. Although the contract design lacks development, in concessions the conflicts of interest are attenuated and the roles of the public and private partners are better understood.

There are more than 50,000 buildings in Hong Kong over 30 years old and which may require extensive refurbishment under the Mandatory Building Scheme. Additionally, most new owners/tenants tend to renovate their premises before moving in. Hence, there is an urgent need in Hong Kong, to explore strategies and measures to enable the development of effective refurbishment and renovation (R&R) waste management for such projects. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the process of R&R for identifying the perceived barriers and thereby the strategies for minimisation and management of R&R waste in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach Desktop study, semi-structured interviews, site observations and document reviews were used as the data collection methods to achieve the objectives of this research. Considering the nature and characteristics of the industry structure, the snowball sampling process was deployed for data collection. Thematic analysis and content analysis were used for data analysis. Waste minimisation and management strategies for R&R projects were then discussed and developed by the research team and a focus group meeting was held to validate the research findings. Six strategies were then proposed to the government. Findings R&R projects contribute 10-20% of the construction and demolition waste. The barriers to recycling of R&R waste can be grouped into six major categories: (1) lack of sorting and storage spaces, (2) high cost, (3) insufficient government supporting policy, (4) complicated recycling processes, (5) immature recycling market and (6) insufficient public education. Also, six strategies are proposed in this study, which include (1) pre-refurbishment audit, (2) development of recycling market, (3) sea reclamation, (4) incineration, (5) government support and (6) education and research. Originality/value The strategies and measures proposed in this research could most adequately serve as reference for the government officials, building professionals and academic researchers. Such knowledge would make possible the development of effective strategies and measures for minimising and managing R&R waste.	[Yu, Ann T. W.; Mok, Kelvin S.

The adoption of OSC has been slower in developing countries such as China than in developed countries, and research on the barriers inhibiting the sector's growth is inadequate. This paper aims to investigate the major factors inhibiting the adoption of OSC with reference to the Chinese construction market. Thirty factors influencing the use of OSC were identified through a literature review, questionnaire survey, and face-to-face interview with professionals in the construction industry. A questionnaire was sent out to developers in China, and 83 completed questionnaires were retrieved. Ranking analysis was used to identify 18 critical factors. The top three barriers are absence of government regulations and incentives, high initial cost, and dependence on traditional construction methods. Factor analysis enables grouping of the 18 critical factors into five categories, namely, government regulations and policies, technological innovation, industry supply chain, cost, and market demand. The paper also indicates that the most dominant of the five groupings pertains to regulations and policies. These findings provide a valuable reference for the developers to understand the major barriers to their decision making and for government bodies aiming at promoting OSC in the construction industry to put forward relevant policies and incentives.

However, the successful implementations of large PPP projects are hindered by huge capital investments and high uncertainties. To solve this challenge, hosting governments may choose to offer public funds, including public equity and government subsidy, to the financing of special purpose vehicle (SPV) on the purpose of strengthening projects' financial viability and increasing transparency of SPV's operation. The involvement of public funds reforms the traditional equity capital structure and needs to be carefully studied. To facilitate relevant decision-making for both private and public sector, this research developed a genetic algorithm based model to simultaneously optimize private equity, public equity and government subsidy for PPP projects. The effects of risk factors are incorporated by utilizing Monte Carlo simulation. The Beijing No. 4 Metro Line project is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Optimization results show that the proposed model achieves balance between satisfying project's financial viability and saving public funds. And it will significantly facilitate both private and public sector in determining an optimal equity capital structure which are involved with public funds.

At the heart of achieving these procurement objectives and others is the capacity of public procurement institutions. Whereas previous reports have hinted that there are deficiencies in procurement capacity in Nigeria, insights regarding critical aspects of organisational capacity deficiencies among different tiers of government agencies is limited. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical gaps in the procurement capacity of state and local government agencies involved in the procurement of public infrastructure in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a survey of public infrastructure procurement personnel which yielded 288 responses. Findings - Among 23 operationalised items that are related to organisational procurement capacity, none is perceived to be adequate by the procurement personnel. Additionally, among 14 procurement objectives only 1 is perceived as being attained to at least a high extent. Originality/value - The findings underscore the acuteness of organisational procurement capacity weaknesses among public procurement institutions within Nigeria's governance structure. It is, thus, imperative for policy makers within state and local government to formulate, resource and implement procurement capacity building initiatives/programmes to address these deficiencies. Additionally, the organisational procurement capacity items operationalised in this study could serve as a useful blueprint for studying capacity deficiencies among public infrastructure procurement agencies in other developing countries, especially within sub-Saharan Africa where several countries have been implementing public procurement reforms.

Numerous studies have identified the factors of private participation in infrastructure projects, but the results have rarely focused on the willingness of the private sector to participate in infrastructure PPP projects. This research examines the factors of the private participation in a PPP with the consideration of the willingness to participate as a function of internal (e.g., the firm's nature) and external factors (e.g., institutions, the government's behavior, and project characteristics). Using the logistic regression model and the data from a questionnaire survey, this research found that nine variables have a significant coefficient, e.g., profitability, political connections, government intervention, government support, project complexity, and project experience; in particular, those companies with more project experience, more political connections, and higher profitability are more likely to be willing to participate in PPP projects. In contrast to previous studies, this research finds no support for the effect of the institutional environment and public support on a firm's willingness to participate in PPPs. These findings can serve as a valuable reference in shaping the private sector's motivation to participate in PPPs. The factors of private participation in PPP projects are explained and discussed in the context of the Chinese PPP experience and practice. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Public administration (PA) plays a strong role in influencing the implementation of RL in the construction industry through policy and laws. While much research identifies PA as an important driver in RL, no research yet describes how this occurs. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted on the theme PA in RL with 93 relevant publications retrieved. Findings Six strategies used by PA to promote RL were extracted: (1) legislation, (2) government subsidies, (3) landfill disposal fee, (4) government inspection, (5) use in public construction works and (6) penalties and fines. Moreover, a typology built on these six strategies was developed, mapping 15 interactional relationships between strategies, according to three levels of influence: (1) encouragement (2) requirement and (3) regulation. Practical implications It was found that legislation and government subsidies prove to be the more effective strategies, with the remaining strategies greatly neglected. Importantly, however, this study reveals that a combination of strategies are most effective when appropriately combined. Originality/value This study confirms the importance of PA in RL, in construction, while documenting the extent of current research. The resulting proposed typology, along with 15 identified future research priorities, is expected to be of value to academics and policy makers looking to advance understanding in this domain.

While the optimal capital structure and equity capital structure of the project company have been extensively investigated, few studies have examined how to allocate equity shares among different private participants. Considering both public and private benefits, this study focuses on the optimal equity structure between construction contractor (CC) and operating contractor (OC). A game model is used to analyze how quality benefit and marginal contribution of CC and OC's effort affect the optimal equity structure. The findings reveal that the private consortium expects the party (CC or OC) with higher marginal contribution of effort to own more equity shares, while government expects the party (CC or OC) with lower marginal contribution of effort to own more equity shares. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between the optimal equity structure and government's bargaining power is found. The results also manifest that the quality benefit of construction on operation is a nontrivial factor when designing the equity structure. If unconsidered, the CC's optimal equity ratio will be either undervalued (when a higher construction quality can reduce the operating cost) or overvalued (when a higher construction quality can increase the operating cost). These findings can provide some insights into designing the equity structure for PPP projects in the bidding process.

J	Li, XT; Liu, YS; Wilkinson, S; Liu, TT				Li, Xintong; Liu, Yisheng; Wilkinson, S.; Liu, Tingting			Driving forces influencing the uptake of sustainable housing in New Zealand	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Driving forces; Sustainable housing; Sustainability; New Zealand	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; GREEN BUILDINGS	Purpose Sustainable houses remain at a low rate among the housing stock in New Zealand. Government, industry and the public are wanting to deliver homes that are energy and water efficient, healthy and adaptive to the climate. The purpose of this paper is to find out the driving forces influencing the uptake of sustainable housing in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach Comparative case studies of Hobsonville Point, Wynyard Quarter and Long Bay were adopted as the primary research method. Semi-structured interviews and an online survey were both conducted for data collection to increase the validity of the research. Findings Central and local governments were the most effective driving forces for encouraging sustainable housing. Corporate brand and leadership were critical drivers for public-owned companies, whereas private-owned companies were mainly driven by local governments' policies and strategies. Social awareness and client demand were increasing to influence the sustainable housing, but there was still room for improvement. Research limitations/implications - The developers can learn from the sustainable development frameworks to set the sustainability goals. Policymakers can draw lessons from the public sectors' experiences to carry out new policies and inspire the private sectors to follow. Besides, the basic framework could help the further study to use a larger sample size and more rigorous statistical analysis to explore the synergies among the identified drivers. Originality/value - This paper provides the useful information on how to promote the uptake of sustainable housing in New Zealand.

J	Spence, R				Spence, R			Risk and regulation: can improved government action reduce the impacts of natural disasters?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						disaster mitigation; disaster planning; governance; public policy; public safety; regulation; risk mitigation		From an examination of national policies for risk mitigation, the paper asks what types of laws are successful and should be more widely adopted, and what does not work. Three types of regulations are considered: ( 1) regulations for constructing new buildings and code enforcement; ( 2) regulations for intervening in/upgrading the existing building stock; and ( 3) regulation of the insurance industry. When applied, improved codes can substantially reduce the impacts of natural disasters. However, unnecessary complexity is shown to compromise implementation and enforcement. The widespread destruction of buildings in the earthquakes of Kocaeli, Turkey, in 1999 and Gujarat, India, in 2001 was not due to inadequate codes. Destruction occurred because codes were not generally adopted. Improving the application and enforcement of codes in developing countries are necessary key measures. For the strengthening of existing substandard buildings, some regulations exist and some successful programmes of evaluation and strengthening are in progress. However, lessons from the US experience indicate legislation is needed to back such programmes, and further incentives for action are needed. Several national insurance schemes for natural catastrophe losses ( US programmes for flood, New Zealand programmes for earthquake, and French programmes for all catastrophic natural hazards) have considerable potential to stimulate mitigation activity. Ultimately, coercion by government is only part of the answer. The success of any government action depends equally on the development in society of a 'safety culture' in which citizens both understand the risks they face and are prepared to participate in the management of them.

J	Hammond, D; Dempsey, JJ; Szigeti, F; Davis, G				Hammond, D; Dempsey, JJ; Szigeti, F; Davis, G			Integrating a performance-based approach into practice: a case study	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						constructed assets; facility assessment; functionality; integrated decision-making process; performance indicators; serviceability; suitability; value chain; United States		Organizations in both the public and private sectors are increasingly focusing on performance and results, on outcomes rather than on outputs, or on the ends rather than the means to accomplish their mission(s). In the US, the federal government actually embedded this focus in the Government Performance and Results Act, 1993. Since then, US federal government agencies have been in the process of a major shift in their management procedures. The paper illustrates how the US Coast Guard (USCG) is implementing these procedures. USCG missions are clearly defined in 'legal authorities' by the US Congress. These missions in turn are also responding to external public and industry drivers and trends. The USCG is highly dependent on its logistical assets to support its operational units and accomplish its missions. Therefore, the Civil Engineering Program, which is that part of the organization responsible for the most stable and long-lasting assets, namely constructed assets, has been commissioned to create and implement a far-reaching Shore Facility Capital Asset Management system, including Regional Strategic Plans. The design of this integrated system is part of a Framework for Integrated Decision-Making for the USCG as a whole. It is performance based and results oriented. It includes metrics that will allow the USCG to measure objectively and transparently how it performs against the requirements of its missions and strategic goals. All parts of this integrated system are presented, with emphasis on the suitability metrics that most directly link assets to missions.

J	Dou, YD; Sun, XL; Ji, AK; Wang, YN; Xue, XL				Dou, Yudan; Sun, Xiliang; Ji, Ankang; Wang, Yuna; Xue, Xiaolong			Development strategy for prefabricated construction projects: a tripartite evolutionary game based on prospect theory	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Development strategy; Prefabricated construction; Tripartite evolutionary game; Prospect theory; Case study	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGIES; DIFFUSION; DECISION; BARRIERS	Purpose Owing to multiple superiorities to traditional counterparts, prefabricated construction (PC) has gained increasing attention worldwide. The development of PC projects reflects the effects of both policy supervision and PC practice, which aids the government in reasonably identifying the key issues of PC's promotion and rationally improving the policy deployment. However, existing studies fail to address this aspect, especially lacking quantitative exploration. This study explores the micro mechanism of PC's promotion, from the perspective of developing PC projects. Design/methodology/approach A tripartite evolutionary game model based on prospect theory of the government, developers and contractors is constructed. After rigorous theoretical deduction, this study adopts Changchun in China as a case city and collects the data using the Delphi technique, policy documents and literature analysis. Findings Results indicate that contractors are generally willing to implement PC projects and the government chooses to actively supervise PC's promotion. The negative investment behavior of developers is the main obstacle to promote PC in Changchun currently. Practical implications The conclusions are applicable to other comparable regions. This study is of value to promote PC with high efficiency and effect. Originality/value The tripartite evolutionary game model based on prospect theory proposed in this study is conducive to reveal the essence of PC's promotion. This is an important breakthrough in extant studies, with a broad applicability in the PC domain beyond China.

Risk-Neutral Pricing Approach for Evaluating BOT Highway Projects with Government Minimum Revenue Guarantee Options	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Real options; Infrastructure; Build-operate-transfer; Risk management; Stochastic models; Toll roads; Public-private partnership; Government guarantees; Risk-neutral valuation	REAL OPTIONS; VALUATION	Build-operate-transfer (BOT) is a public-private partnership (PPP) project delivery system for the financing, development, and operations of highway projects around the world. Uncertainty about future traffic demands is one of the most important risk factors in the operations phase of a BOT project. There is a considerable amount of evidence indicating that the improper consideration of this uncertainty contributes to the financial failure of BOT projects. The inherent limitation of conventional economic analysis methods contributes to this uncertainty; most notably the net present value (NPV) approach that is typically used in the economic valuation of BOT projects. In addition, the NPV approach is insufficient to determine the correct market value of minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) options. The government offers MRG options to the concessionaire as a revenue risk-sharing strategy in BOT projects. The authors apply the real options theory from finance/decision science to explicitly price MRG options in BOT projects. This real options model has several prominent attributes that make it different from NPV models. It uses a market-based option pricing approach called risk-neutral valuation method to determine the correct value of MRG options. Unlike the other models, this approach treats the risk of underestimating future traffic demands internally and adjusts for the traffic market risk in the valuation of MRG options. The authors' approach also describes a procedure for characterizing the concessionaire's economic risk profile under uncertainty about future traffic demands. In addition, it uses real options analysis to price MRG and traffic revenue cap (TRC) options as compound options and determines their effects on the concessionaire's economic risk profile. The probability distributions of when the concessionaire may request MRG and when the public sector may receive additional revenues as TRC options are also presented. Further, the distributions of the number of times that the concessionaire may request the MRG option and the number of times that the public sector may receive additional revenue are characterized. Finally, this model identifies the probability distributions of the present value of MRG options and the present value of total additional revenues recalled by the public sector. The proposed model can help public and private sectors better analyze and understand the economic risk of BOT projects under uncertainty about future traffic demands. The private sector can use this proposed model to make better entry decisions to BOT highway projects considering the level of support provided by the government. The government can also use this proposed model to identify the appropriate MRG levels to encourage private investments without comprising future budgetary strength.

Twelve research propositions are raised and empirically tested by using Structural Equation Model. The result shows that four key factors affect the intended implementation of Green Mining by improving a corporations efficiency and reputation. The diffusion of Green Mining technology has direct positive influence on the intended Green Mining implementation; Stakeholders' green appeal has a positive influence on the decision makers' attitude and values. The empirical study provides support for the government to establish a reasonable regulation and control mechanism to improve enterprises' enthusiasm for Green Mining. Four Green Mining incentive policies are raised to regulate and motivate the coal mining enterprises to improve their environmental behaviors. The government can adopt piece(s) of them to change the enterprises' roles from traditional passive to modern initiative.

However, it is not known how, and how much, current public participation practice can enhance project-related and social accountability (SA). Based on this study's survey of 158 various stakeholders in public projects in South China, underlying relationships are revealed between project decision-making accountability (PDMA) and project implementation accountability (PIA) and their association with SA. Further, partial least-squares (PLS) path analysis indicates that PDMA has a long-run mediating role in the establishment of SA, while PIA does not. These results and findings not only enhance a deep understanding of the overall effects of public participation forms in the theoretical domain but also provide useful, practical guides to improve China's local government and practitioner practices.

To satisfy the foregoing objective, the Department of Rapid Transit System (DORTS) set the following criteria for tendering contracts. Civil works that did not require a high level of technology were channeled to domestic firms. More complex projects were assigned to private and government-owned companies that had accumulated a higher level of expertise because of joint ventures and their active involvement in international projects during the past three decades. The most technically challenging projects are given to international consortia in the form of either joint ventures or technical collaboration agreements with domestic companies. This paper discusses the goals of DORTS during the past several years as they relate to promoting (1) increased domestic input, (2) technology transfer, and (3) a higher level of achievement.

Value for money analysis is used to assess the viability of these ventures. This research aims to investigate the contribution of the PPP critical success factors to value for money viability analysis. Relevant data were collected through a questionnaire to establish the PPP critical success factors and value for money success criteria. Data were collected from 92 participants. The data obtained were analyzed using mean score, t-test, and regression analysis. The research found that government guarantees, macroeconomic conditions, shared authority between the public and private sectors, social support, and transparent procurement process contributed positively to value for money viability analysis. The results imply that practitioners should consider these key indicators for improving the value for money viability of PPP projects.

Like most North American cities, Santa Monica's civic administration had dealt with environmental issues on an ad-hoc basis, with individual departments designated to respond to particular issues as they arose. After extensive public consultation, and initial work by the guidelines team, the project was expanded beyond simple design advice, to modify existing city programmes and ordinances; and to create new ordinances aimed directly at critical aspects of environmental sustainability. Perhaps more important, the co-operation and co-ordination that marked the guidelines project from the beginning has continued since, possibly heralding a new way that city operations will address sustainability issues that inherently cross administrative boundaries.

In this research, a large database of PPP projects in China was firstly built to explore the spatio-temporal evolution in terms of regional differentiation, sectors, investors and contract types. It was found that China's PPP projects have undergone four stages with the characteristics of fluctuations along with time series, spatial differentiation and paradox of application. The mechanism behind these changes mainly include the momentum of economic development and impact of national policies, local settings, especially the local governments' motivation, preference, competency and reliability, as well as the feasibility and management of PPP projects. This paper tries to make its contribution in providing Chinese cases for international comparison, while helping Chinese national and local governments make customized policies, as well as laying foundation for further in-depth empirical and theoretical PPP research.

A potential mitigation strategy for the revenue risk is a governmental revenue guarantee, where the government secures a minimum amount of revenue for a project. Such a guarantee is: (1) only redeemable at distinct points in time; and (2) more economical if the government limits the guarantee's availability to the early portions of a BOT's concession period. Hence, a guarantee characterized by this type of structure takes the form of either a Bermudan or a simple multiple-exercise real option, depending upon the number of exercise opportunities afforded. The multi-least-squares Monte Carlo technique is presented and illustrated as a promising approach to determine the fair value of this variety of real option. This method is far more flexible than prevailing approaches, so it represents an important step toward improving risk mitigation and facilitating contractual and financial negotiations in BOT projects.

J	Wakeman, TH				Wakeman, TH			Building sustainable public policy decisions through partnerships	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Sustainable resolution of complex and controversial environmental issues by government agencies in the public policy arena can hinge on the success of the decisionmaking process. Governmental partnerships can assist in building resilient decisions. A decision closure framework that targets decision-making closure and is composed of human factors, operational characteristics, and organizational structure are used as a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of three government partnerships. The analysis proceeds to use a single region's partnerships to minimize the influence of human factors. Nevertheless, several of the key factors identified in successful decision making from the three partnerships stemmed largely from the contributions of the human qualities. The procedural characteristics most helpful in decision closure included establishment of clear roles and responsibilities, preparation and ratification of partnership documents such as vision statements and work plans, and regular assessments of performance. The analysis suggests that a two-tiered organizational structure with compartments for input from ''subjective'' and ''objective'' sources is successful for information exchange.

The management of disaster waste is revealed as an area of least concern yet it presents momentous challenges for those with inadequate capacities due to the large volume and hazardous constituents created, specifically in developing countries. This paper aims to report the findings of post-disaster waste management strategies and challenges identified in Sri Lanka. Data was gathered through interviews with government and non-government organisations at national and local level. The lack of an established hierarchy and single point of responsibility, mandatory and enforceable rules and regulations; inadequate capacity and funds, and lack of communication and coordination were identified as gaps in post-disaster waste management. This enabled the identification of post-disaster waste management strategies, highlighting gaps that need to be addressed for effective C&D debris management for Sri Lanka's future resilience.

The developing business system has played an increasingly important part in regulating the relations between various actors in the building sector, but the disordered situation in the construction market has fully revealed the shortcomings of the system. Using international experience and practice for reference, China is making efforts to promote the construction business system with Chinese characteristics. The institutional change involves reforms in legislation, property rights, price mechanism and the investment system. The crucial issue lies in deregulation, but this is difficult to realize for a government-led reform. Only if government's control and intervention are decreased enough can the construction market and related professional bodies play their proper roles so that the development platform of China's construction industry can be gradually perfected.

Centralized bid evaluation for awarding of construction projects - A case of India government	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Goal programming; Contractor selection; Project management	CONTRACTOR SELECTION; MODEL; PROCUREMENT; AUCTIONS; PROPOSAL; UTILITY	Reviewing the procedures of contractor selection in government departments in various countries and in the Rural Development Department (RDD) in India, this paper brings out several weaknesses of the current contractor selection procedure. It suggests a centralized contractor evaluation process with the inclusion of three new selection attributes along bid price. The suggested attributes are: (1) time quoted to complete the project, (2) warranty period quoted, and (3) past performance score of the contractor. To solve the resulting multi-objective decision-making problem, the paper proposes a binary goal programming model. When tested with the existing contractor selection procedure for six past projects in RDD, the model yields the same results as those taken by RDD in the past, confirming the credibility of the model. When tested with the suggested procedure, the model yields much superior results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.	[Padhi, Sidhartha S.; Mohapatra, Pratap K.

The prolonged lifecycle and heterogeneous stakeholders of megaprojects have posed great challenges for the governance of the economic, social, and environmental issues involved. Hence, this study has elaborated on a conceptual governance framework to answer such crucial question: How to govern megaproject social responsibility? To be specific, the concept and characteristics of the governance of megaproject social responsibility have been proposed. Furthermore, a systematic framework of societal governance beyond corporate governance and public governance has been developed based on the "Business Government Society" view regarding megaproject social responsibility. We conclude that an integrative mechanism of corporations, the government, and the public is essentially required to facilitate and maintain efficient and effective societal governance, thus creating shared and sustainable value for all stakeholders throughout the megaproject lifecycle.

J	Zhang, XQ; Li, YS; Wu, D				Zhang, Xueqing; Li, Yashuai; Wu, Di			Developing an Underground Utility Occupation Index for Efficient Urban Utilities Planning	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Underground utilities planning; Urban development; Occupation index; Sustainability	WATER; SPACE	In almost all modern cities, various utility pipelines and cables often form a maze of underground utility network. Mismanagement of underground utility incidents could cause serious consequences including unavailability of services, property damages, and personnel injuries and fatalities. Since one major reason for mismanagement is unsuitable urban utilities planning, it is a challenging task to plan urban utilities in an efficient way. This paper proposes an underground utility occupation index (UUOI), which serves as an indicator of urban utilities development. With the statistical information of existing utilities in the predefined polygons, UUOI provides planning information, including underground space already occupied, and space available for future utilization by analyzing from multiple perspectives: by utility, by zone, by road category (footway and carriageway), and by city district. UUOI supports utility companies and governmental authorities in their decision-making at both the microlevel and macrolevel. At the microlevel, UUOI provides the necessary utility and space information for utility companies to share information in making long-term and short-term development plans to partially avoid conflicts between utilities belonging to different companies and adopt suitable construction methods to minimize damages to existing utilities. At the macrolevel, the UUOI can be used to extrapolate from a small scale to a large scale to facilitate government authorities in urban planning and development. The consolidated UUOI enables the differentiation and prioritization of areas of different levels of utility density and facilitates government authorities in formulating guidelines for future urban development, establishing strategic development areas and issuing permits for underground works. The improved practices of both government authorities and utility companies will also reduce disturbance to the general public. An illustrative example has demonstrated the applicability and usefulness of UUOI.

J	GOVER, JE				GOVER, JE			STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF UNITED-STATES MICROELECTRONICS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article								U.S. competitiveness problems have not been due to a lack of research; rather, they stem from difficulties in sustaining competitiveness when commercialization is dominated by product and process improvements. Partial shifting of R & D investment by the private sector from innovative new products to improvement of manufacturing processes will help correct these deficiencies, but it may not be sufficient to regain competitiveness in areas where U.S. industry has fallen behind foreign competition. National programs are believed to be required where catch-up situations prevail. In order for the United States to catch up with Japan in all areas of microelectronics, it is recommended that industry-wide, catch-up consortia be established or continued in the six areas where the United States is rapidly becoming noncompetitive. In addition, it is recommended that the United States establish programs managed by consortia for microelectronics research integration, application, simulation, and modeling. These consortia would be managed by an industry-led Microelectronics Alliance (perhaps SEMA-TECH) whose establishment would be coordinated by a federal agency designated by Congress. Annual funding of $1 000 000 000 for this consortia complex would increase the U.S. microelectronics R & D investment by 25% and within seven years restore the competitiveness of the U.S. microelectronics industry in all areas. Where appropriate, consortia work would be delegated to U.S. universities and U.S. government-owned laboratories with government bearing the full cost of consortia management. Funding of consortia work at industrial facilities would be negotiated with the government offering increased R & D tax credits, accelerated equipment depreciation schedules, and partial R & D funding to consortia members. These consortia would be operated according to the success principles determined from Japan and U.S. consortia experiences.

This question has become more important to manufacturing industries as environmental concerns are escalating, particularly in emerging economies. We examine the effects of green process innovation on the financial performance of manufacturing industries with a focus on the moderating effects of government subsidies versus industries' own absorptive capability. Using sulfur dioxide emissions as an environmental index, we establish a dynamic model using ten years panel data from 28 industries in China where environmental concerns have been severe and government subsidies have been commonly believed to be instrumental. The results show that clean technologies and end-of-pipe technologies are positively related to financial performance at the industry level, thus it pays to be "green." Furthermore, strong absorptive capacity tends to enhance this relationship, but surprisingly green subsidies turn out to weaken this relationship. We also find the effects are different between clean technologies and end-of-pile technologies, which leads to finer grained insights into these two types of technologies and their adoption. We conclude that manufacturing industries can benefit more from green process innovation by leveraging their internal absorptive capability, as opposed to replying on external government subsidies as commonly believed. Our findings provide finer grained insights on the benefits of green process innovation, and shed light on the study of green process innovation in other emerging economies.

However, actual empirical research studies in this research area are rather limited. This paper reports the second stage of a funded research study, which aims to develop a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model for assessing the risk level of a particular critical risk group (CRG) and the overall risk level associated with PPP projects in China. At the first research stage, thirty-four risk factors were identified through a comprehensive literature review and 3 new risk factors were proposed during a two-round Delphi questionnaire survey. The most critical 17 risk factors were selected through the calculation of normalized values. The correlation of these 17 critical risk factors (CRFs) was further analyzed via factor analysis and 6 CRGs were formulated, namely: (1) Macroeconomic Risk; (2) Construction and Operation Risk; (3) Government Maturity Risk; (4) Market Environment Risk; (5) Economic Viability Risk; and (6) Government Intervention. On the basis of the research works conducted at the first research stage, the weightings for each of the 17 critical risk factors (CRFs) and 6 CRGs were determined through the two-round Delphi questionnaire survey. A set of knowledge-based fuzzy inference rules was then established to set up the membership function for the 17 CRFs and 6 CRGs. The empirical research findings showed that the overall risk level of PPP highway projects is between "moderate risk" and "high risk". Hence it could be construed that investment in PPP highway projects in China may be considered as risky. In fact, the Delphi survey respondents perceived that "Government Intervention" is the most CRG; with "Government Maturity Risk" being the second; "Economic Viability Risk" the third; "Market Environment Risk" the fourth; "Construction and Operation Risk" the fifth; and "Macroeconomic Risk" the last. These findings revealed that government intervention and corruption may be the major hurdles to the success of PPP highway projects in China. These may be caused by inadequate law and supervision system and poor public decision-making process. Although the fuzzy synthetic evaluation model was primarily developed for PPP projects in general, the research method could be replicated in a specific type of PPP project, such as water treatment projects and hospital projects, to produce similar models for inter-type comparisons. By doing so, it provides an opportunity for practitioners to assess the risk level of different types of PPP projects based on objective evidence rather than subjective judgment. The most CRG for different types of PPP projects could be identified and both precautionary and remedial actions could be taken as soon as possible. Such an extension would provide a deeper understanding of managing different types of PPP projects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Yeung, John F. Y.; Chan, Albert P. C.; Chan, Daniel W.

In spite of some promising early evidence on the benefits of BIM, the momentum of this top-down drive should build upon after-implementation empirical evidence. Through the structural equation modeling analysis of survey returns from 145 Chinese BIM-enabled projects, this research demonstrates that BIM's degree of implementation can positively affect the acceptability of integrated project delivery (IPD) in the future via increased perception of the need for supply chain incentivization and improved communication quality enabled by BIM. Rolling out BIM on a wider scale may yield an additional benefit in lowering the barrier to the implementation of IPD systems. This finding can serve as evidential support for government mandates that require the compulsory adoption of BIM in public projects. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The macroeconomic environment plays a critical role and influences the factors that can lead to the successful delivery of a PPP project. Despite the importance of the macroeconomic environment, limited attention has been paid to ex-ante (that is, before the event, or forecast) evaluation. A review of the normative literature was undertaken, aiming to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) of PPP success. The KPIs were validated by using a vector error correction model. It is suggested that the developed KPIs can be used to evaluate the suitability of the macroeconomic conditions in which a PPP project will be implemented. These KPIs can provide governments and stakeholders with a platform to conduct an effective ex-ante evaluation of PPP projects that will be significant in policy and decision making.

The construction industry in the Gaza Strip has involved a diverse range of stakeholders. This research aims to evaluate the most common factors affecting the stakeholder management process in construction projects. A literature review was conducted on topics related to stakeholder management. A questionnaire survey was carried out among professionals in the construction industry. Ninety-eight questionnaires were distributed to experts from government, municipality, and non-government organizations. Sixty-seven questionnaires were received, with a 68% response rate. The mean and relative importance index were used to analyse the questionnaire results. The main factors affecting the stakeholder management process are hiring a project manager with high competency, transparent evaluation of the alternative solution, ensuring effective communication between the project and its stakeholder, setting common goals and objectives for the project, and exploring the stakeholders' needs and expectations.

Developing venues have captured much of governments' attention due to the potential benefits the industry would bring to the community. However, venue development requires considerable capital and operating costs, unique standards of design and complicated operational issues. Public Private Partnerships were introduced by governments as innovative delivery models to bring forward venue projects. This paper presents comparative case studies of two PPP venue projects in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and New Zealand aiming to investigate key challenges for using PPPs in venue development and propose strategies to address the problems and assist future planning and organization for venue PPPs. The research shows that for a successful venue PPP, the following are critical features: (1) sound business case development; (2) streamlined financial arrangements; (3) robust tendering; (4) effective governance structure and partnership-based consortium; and (5) realistic risk allocation.

In this context, the U.S. government has reiterated the Administration's position that nuclear is an important part of its energy portfolio. However, because there has been a lull in new nuclear power plants constructed in the U.S. for over 30years, the U.S. nuclear construction industry not only lacks experience in nuclear construction but also in the development of construction technologies for nuclear plants. This paper introduces the analysis of technologies adopted in constructing recent nuclear construction projects, and surveys the perceptions of U.S. nuclear experts on those technologies to develop a rubric for identifying established, emerging, and opportunity technologies for the U.S. nuclear construction industry. It is expected that this paper will provide a guideline for developing technologies, which can successfully deliver future nuclear power plants in the U.S.	[Wright, Erik R.; Hastak, Makarand] Purdue Univ, Div Construct Engn & Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cho, Kyuman] Chosun Univ, Sch Architecture, Kwangju 501759, South Korea	Cho, K (corresponding author), Chosun Univ, Sch Architecture, Kwangju 501759, South Korea.	wrigh112@purdue.edu; cho129@chosun.ac.kr; hastak@purdue.edu						18	2	2	0	8	ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS	RESTON	1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA	0742-597X	1943-5479		J MANAGE ENG	J.

Longitudinal trends are established using further surveys from 1993, 1998 and 2000 as well as comparing national strategies from five European Union countries (the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France and Finland). Results indicate that efforts in sustainable management are misplaced with emphasis on procuring new buildings, not on operation and maintenance. Several barriers at the policy and strategy level are identified, especially the perceived costs of implementing environmental management, the lack of market demand and the poor capture of benefits. Special recommendations for government, housing associations and occupants are based on the findings-widening the focus of issues on sustainability, emphasizing the existing building stock, increasing the use of voluntary agreements, recognizing different capabilities in scale of housing associations and creating market demand.

There are three closely related CLSC models consisting of a manufacturer who also recycles used products and a collector of the used products. The first CLSC is a centralized model with the vertical integration of the manufacturer and the collector. The second CLSC is a decentralized model with the manufacturer as the leader and the collector as the follower in a Stackelberg game. The third CLSC is a decentralized model with government subsidy and fee. In addition, we formulate a nonrecycling model as a benchmark for comparison. Under this modeling framework, this paper shows the impacts of supply chain centralization/decentralization as well as government subsidy and fee on these two factors and their environmental consequence in terms of the disposal quantity at landfills. Throughout the paper, numerous managerial insights and policy implications are provided.

Y.; Li, Shan			Using social network strategy to manage construction projects in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Networking; Guanxi; Relationships; Social network; Strategy	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; EXCHANGE; GOVERNANCE; FIRM	Due to its unique culture, besides adopting established project management practices, the question is whether social network strategy is relevant for managing projects in China. The research aims to ascertain the relevance of social network strategy and identify the important network practices that foreign and local architectural, engineering or construction (A/E/C) firms adopt when managing construction projects in China. 82 sets of data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The results show that both local and foreign firms adopt practices relating to social network strategy to a significant extent. However, they do not collaborate with competitors even though this could add value to their products/service. Foreign firms also do not make enough use of political resources, relying neither on their home country governments nor the Chinese government. Foreign firms lag behind Chinese firms in not joining consortiums or enlarging the number of partners in their networks, suggesting a 'do it alone' stand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.

In most cities, a special project management mode called "Agent Construction Model (ACM)" has been adopted to manage and govern these projects under the same umbrella of administrative standards. The ACM integrates all available government resources to complete the urbanization projects but meanwhile it faces great challenges from overwhelming complex information and information processing. This study presents the development of a city-level multiproject management information system to decompose the information processing complexity in the context of ACM management mode. The complex adaptive system and two specific development techniques adaptive project framework and modularized functional design method are introduced for the system development. The system was validated at a typical urbanization city in Changchun, China. This research complements the existing project information system by adopting complexity design principles and it also provides practical value for managing large-scale urbanization projects.

Preferred risk allocation in China's public-private partnership (PPP) projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Risk allocation; Public-private partnership (PPP); China	POLITICAL RISKS; MANAGEMENT	As part of a comprehensive research into PPP implementation, a two-round Delphi survey was conducted with experienced practitioners to identify the preference of risk allocation in China's PPP projects. The results show that the public sector would take sole responsibility for the risk "Expropriation and nationalization", and take the majority of responsibility for 12 other risks related to government or government officials and their actions. Fourteen risks which neither the public nor private sector may be able to deal with them alone are preferred to be shared equally. The private sector would take the majority of responsibility for 10 risks that are at the project level. Interestingly, no risk fell into the category that should be solely allocated to the private sector. Further analysis of the reasons behind these allocation preferences was then conducted. Recommendations on commercial principles and contract terms between the public authorities and private consortia are also made. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Using a systems approach, this study examined a number of construction innovation system scenarios and policy interventions within the context of four future plausible Russian construction industry transition pathways (i.e. business as usual, market forces, conservative development and innovation power). An integrated participatory systems modelling approach was employed to develop the system dynamics model incorporating the main actors of the construction innovation process, namely, industry, government and university. Construction innovation diffused more rapidly and seeded more innovators than imitators for the innovation power transition pathway, whereby increasing government R&D support was coupled with extensive reductions in barriers. The market forces and state-led conservative development transition pathways showed similar levels of innovation outcomes within the modelling horizon, but predominately yielded innovation imitators. The extensive scenario analysis findings culminated in the formulation of policy recommendations for enhancing innovativeness in the Russian construction industry.

We asked what specific dimensions of PM practices have been most helpful to project and program managers of Test and Evaluation (T&E). This paper focuses on T&E PM within the Federal Aviation Administration, an agency of the US government. The objective was to identify the critical dimensions of PM that contribute to successful T&E execution and determine how these critical dimensions could be unified with technical processes to achieve customer satisfaction. By combining the expressive abilities of the Boardman Soft Systems Methodology with a case study approach, we identified a set of critical dimensions and created a conceptual model that unifies PM practices with T&E processes. We concluded with a set of critical project management practices that have impact for a T&E organization. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Although several literature reviews of PPP research have been conducted, there still appears to be a lack of quantitative and visualized investigation and multidisciplinary scrutiny of the structure and evolution of this field. This paper applied a scientometric approach to map a visual document cocitation network and conducted cluster analysis to identify the intellectual structure and knowledge domains of PPP research. Next, the development path of each cluster, the pivotal points, and the citation history of the representative documents were identified by timeline visualization of the cocitation network. Finally, through burst analysis, some emerging trends, such as risk allocation, real option-based evaluation, contract design, and government guarantees, were summarized, which offered insights into future PPP research.

Some have published BIM guides. Most of these are technical specifications that are useful at the project level, but they provide no support for the organization-level adoption effort. On the basis of a literature review, action research and case studies of five large UK government facility agencies, a BIM adoption impact map (BIM AIM) is proposed. It describes a set of possible relationships between the actions taken by public facility agencies, the intermediate outcomes of their actions and the eventual achievement of value for the occupants of the facilities they build. BIM AIM can be used by public facility agencies with a wide variety of construction project types to analyse and visualize the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities in their BIM adoption efforts, potentially enabling them to focus on social impacts and outcomes rather than on the technological or management actions that intermediate stakeholders promote.

Based on prior studies on negotiation terms and risk of BOT contracts, this paper incorporates risk attributes of the BOT project into the formulation of a contractual-negotiation model. The proposed model allows the government and the sponsor to reach a consensus on the terms should the financial return as well as the risk of the project be determined. The pro forma cash flow of a BOT project is developed and used to generate the probability distribution of net present values (NPV) from the owner's viewpoint by using Monte Carlo simulation. High- and low-risk scenarios are obtained to determine whether the contractual-negotiation models vary in accordance with risk levels. Results show that, given the expected NPV, the sponsor should be offered more favorable concessional terms for projects with high risk than that with low risk. We suggest that the government and industry practitioners embody the risk attributes of the project in the automated contractual-negotiation model.

J	Aziz, AMA				Aziz, Ahmed M. Abdel			Successful delivery of public-private partnerships for infrastructure development	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PROCUREMENT	Two common approaches have been used by governments for the implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs): a finance-based approach that aims to use private financing to satisfy infrastructure needs, and a service-based approach that aims to optimize the time and cost efficiencies in service delivery. The implementation of PPPs, however, may suffer from legal, political, and cultural impediments. In the United States, the federal government enabled a number of acts to ease the impediments and promote PPPs for infrastructure development. Based on a detailed analysis of PPPs in the United Kingdom and British Columbia, Canada, this paper describes principles that would characterize the implementation of PPPs at the program level (e.g., whether the implementation is successful). The principles pertain to the: availability of a PPP legal framework and implementation units; perception of the private finance objectives, risk allocation consequences, and value-for-money objectives; maintenance of PPPs process transparency; standardization of procedures; and use of performance specifications. Guidelines for successful implementation are explained and discussed in the context of the United States PPPs experience and impediments.

J	van den Hurk, M; Verhoest, K				van den Hurk, Martijn; Verhoest, Koen			The governance of public-private partnerships in sports infrastructure: Interfering complexities in Belgium	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Managing projects; Sports infrastructure	MANAGEMENT; PROJECT; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS; POLICY	Although public private partnership (PPP) in infrastructure development has gained foothold in Flanders (the northern part of Belgium) over time, dissimilar results are evident and the controversy around PPP remains. This paper investigates the contradictory achievements of the Flemish Sports Infrastructure Program. It shows that the form of governance as applied by the Flemish Government was inadequate and led to interferences of political, multi-actor, and technical complexities, which in turn compromised the performance of the Program. A mismatch is revealed between the complicated governance approach and the relatively straightforward infrastructures that were developed, hence the argument that a better sense of contingency is required in future PPP programs. Moreover, governments across the globe are recommended to think twice before embarking on PPP programs which include bundled procurement and mandating agreements: severe complexities are likely to emerge and convincing evidence on the merits of bundling and mandating has not yet been delivered.(2) (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper reports the results of an 18-year analysis of JCEM between 1985 and 2002. The analysis focused on such data as author information (affiliations and home countries), as well as the research topics of the technical papers. The paper summarizes the data extracted from the journal and use it to analyze construction research trends. Construction trends reveal that U.S. writers contributed the most papers by that there has been an increasing number of international submissions to the journal. The top research topical areas relate to scheduling, productivity, constructability, simulation, cost control, planning, safety, and computer systems as described in this paper show that research is increasing throughout the world and topics are changing as current needs change. However, there is a need to increase research collaboration between industry and academia, government and academia, and industry and government to advance the construction industry.

J	Dhal, M				Dhal, Manoranjan			Labor Stand: Face of Precarious Migrant Construction Workers in India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor stand; Migrant labor; Construction; Precarious work; Trade union; Government	TO-URBAN MIGRATION; WOMEN; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES	The construction sector of India is the best representation of the informal workforce, which employs 36.12 million workers. These laborers flock together in a particular place on early morning every day in order to find a wage provider for them. It is a sale of labor for the day, where workers stand and make themselves available for a day to be hired by contractors or individual house owners. These places are known as labor stands, a stop for finding daily laborers for construction work, which is the distinctive addition of this research to the scant literature. This paper tries to explore the labor process among these unique informal construction workers' labor assemblies consisting of 15,000 laborers per day and explore their employment conditions and labor relations. The paper also aims to examine the role of various actors of industrial relations such as trade unions and the government in regulating this employment relationship. The paper is based on a field study encompassing the transcribed records of observation, field interaction with 84 migrant construction workers, and 118 still photographs. The data were analyzed by using qualitative analysis software and adopting open thematic coding and later by developing categories and hierarchy and doing comparative analysis. The findings reveal that these laborers experience precariousness and are challenged by nonavailability of regular work, shortages of food, burden of large family size, and social evils of living in a slum, and also face being harassed by goons as well as contractors with minimal support from trade unions and government. Employers are apathetic toward their legal obligations. With labor stands being a primary source of labor supply to the construction sector, the findings of this paper will help in enriching labor relations and policy measures for its regulation.

Design/methodology/approach Literature review and expert interviews were conducted to identify the key factors. These factors were quantitatively evaluated via a questionnaire survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the underlying structure of these variables and organize the factors into a systematic framework. Findings Resource, clarity of policy problem and goal, legitimacy, acceptance of targeted group and environmental concern of public are the five top variables, which should be emphasized in the selection of CDW policy. The respondents with experience in policymaking and those without experience had slightly different views on the importance of these variables. A total of six latent factors were identified and organized into a framework. Research limitations/implications The questionnaire survey was conducted with government staff via a snowball sampling method, which may affect the representativeness of conclusions to a certain extent. Practical implications This study provides a useful reference for local government to choose appropriate policies to address the CDW problem. Matching attributes of policy instruments with the policy goal and the problem is the starting point in choice of the CDW policy. The matched instruments will be further narrowed by social context, i.e. environmental concern and socioeconomic situation. The final selection must undergo bargaining between policymakers and targeted groups. Originality/value Policy instruments choice is a complicated process, which is shaped by the interaction of many influential factors. However, the impact of these factors on CDW policy choice is largely overlooked. This study will contribute to the knowledge body pertaining to policy selection in the CDW field.

As a construction management innovation, the ACS improves the management performance of public projects. As the supervisor of public projects, the Chinese government issued a series of policies to demonstrate its determination to solve supervision problems. Based on the practice of the ACS in China, in this paper we study the issue of supervision, in which the government supervises the agent. We describe a supervision mechanism to decrease the risk caused by information asymmetry. The mechanism's contribution includes (1)two dimensions of longitudinal self-control and a lateral regulatory system; (2)a five-goals-oriented framework; and (3)contract is take as the core. The main goal of this paper is to elaborate on these three components. According to the five-goals-oriented framework, in this article, we determine that the progress supervision mechanism research produces higher results than agent management. In addition, we give some practical advices to apply the mechanism.

J	Deng, XM; Ding, SZ; Tian, Q				Deng, XM; Ding, SZ; Tian, Q			Reasons underlying a mandatory high penalty construction contract bonding system	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; contracts; public works; public policy; economic analysis		Mandatory high penalty conditional bond in public works features the current U.S. construction contract bonding system, which is unique to the low penalty unconditional bond, a more popular choice on the international market. The diversity of construction contract bonding practices puzzles many transitional economies in their globalization processes, when they are to establish or reform their construction contract bonding system. Based on the research into surety bonding mechanisms, this paper illustrates that the penalty requirement is a controlling factor, and that only high penalty conditional bond and low penalty unconditional bond can bring a state of equilibrium to the market. The conditional bond is fairer, and a high penalty conditional bond is a more functional choice than the low penalty unconditional bond. However, lack of enough demand and experienced sureties hampers the application of high penalty condition bonds. Being the nominal owner of public works, the government can always save its money from construction contract bonding system and start up the demands. Therefore, a mandatory surety bonding system in public works with a high penalty requirement should be a good public policy choice for the government.

From an institutional perspective, this study scrutinizes the structure, elements, and dynamics of the governance system of infrastructure mega-projects and then proposes an integrative framework based on the inductive case study of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge mega-project. Multiple evidences of archives, field studies, and interviews related to the case project are triangulated to further analyze the institutional effects, specifically those with government logics and market structures, on the design and operation of the three-level governance system. Results reveal that the co-evolution between governments and markets in China has shaped the vertical levels of the mega-project governance system and has further affected their evolution and operation across various stages of project development. This study contributes to the rapidly emerging research on complex system governance by proposing a systematic model of three-level mega-project governance to enhance the timely delivery of infrastructure mega-projects within budget.

J	Carr, PG; Beyor, PS				Carr, PG; Beyor, PS			Design fees, the state of the profession, and a time for corrective action	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								There has been considerable consternation over the years about the disintegration of the status of civil engineers, as well as significant distress over the profitability of engineering firms in view of a continuing decline in the compensation of civil engineers relative to other professionals. This paper studies the impact of government agencies' use of outdated percentage of construction fee schedules for determination of professional compensation. Research has found that, due to the application of stagnant fee curves without adjustment for the effects of inflation on project costs, fees over the last several decades have dropped on the order of 20% or more. Prior to the early 1970s, fee Curves published by the professional societies were regularly updated to reflect inflationary trends in project costs. However, since that time, few government agencies have adopted any meaningful deviation from the fee curves of the pre-Justice Department antitrust settlement with the professional societies. The settlement agreement was that the professional societies would no longer publish minimum fee curves to establish appropriate compensation of their members. The paper discusses the erosive financial implications of these policies for the design professions' compensation.

To reduce the damage caused by climate change, adaptation activities are being initiated, such as expanding the capacity of social infrastructures, and each stakeholder wants these adaptations to work in his or her favor. Therefore, a methodology is needed to determine adaptation measures that are most beneficial to all members of society. In this paper, a framework is proposed for producing an adaptation strategy that minimizes conflict between stakeholders. This framework casts the process of organizing climate change adaptations as a game and defines each community member as a stakeholder, each adaptation measure as a strategy, and the minimization of loss from future climate change as a payoff. In a case study involving sea level rise in Suncheon Bay, Korea, this framework is used to generate an optimal plan for minimizing conflicts while considering the losses of the central government, local governments, and local communities. The game theoretic results from the proposed framework enable a balanced distribution of responsibilities among stakeholders to achieve infrastructure adaptation to climate change.

J	Wang, HM; Liu, YH; Xiong, W; Song, JB				Wang, Huanming; Liu, Yuhai; Xiong, Wei; Song, Jinbo			The moderating role of governance environment on the relationship between risk allocation and private investment in PPP markets: Evidence from developing countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Control of corruption; Regulation; Government effectiveness; Rule of law; Private investment; Risk allocation	POLITICAL RISKS; PROSPECT-THEORY; PARTNERSHIPS; SECTOR; WATER; PARTICIPATION; PROJECTS; REFORM; INSTITUTIONS; VARIABLES	PPPs have become a popular way to supply infrastructure around the world. However, compared with developed countries, most developing countries have failed to attract private investment over the past years. Risk allocation and governance environment (e.g., the extent of public participation, the level of political stability, the quality of public services, the ability of regulations, abiding the law, and the extent of corruption) may be important factors. To test the hypotheses, using about 4560 PPP projects in 138 developing countries from 2002 to 2015, this paper applies the Tobit regression model to investigate the interaction effect of governance environment and risk assumed by private partners on private investment. Results indicate that private partners assume that less risk can attract more private investment, and that a higher level of governance (control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule of law) reduces the negative influence of risk assumed by private partners on private investments.

J	Seaden, G; Manseau, A				Seaden, G; Manseau, A			Public policy and construction innovation	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						governance; innovation; public policy; R&D; research policy	INDUSTRY; BUILDERS; SYSTEM	The particular roles played by governments through their policies and programmes are considered within a comparative context in order to gain an understanding of construction innovation systems and processes. The analysis of this question is grounded in a framework which develops: a typology of construction related activities, a precise definition of innovation, the measurement of innovation, and models linking R&D and innovation. Comparative findings suggest that the political and social structures of individual countries do not create radical differences in their national approaches to innovation. However, government structure, the type of national innovation system and the nature of construction institutions influence the choice of specific policy instruments. A summary of findings from a task group is presented which reviews various national policies towards innovation in construction. Country specific observations are drawn from case studies of 15 countries in Europe, North and South America, South Africa and Japan. Often public policy instruments in support of innovation have not been of real benefit to the construction industry. Recommendations are made to improve the focus and utility of future policy initiatives for innovation, including: the creation of collaborative arrangements with industry initiated research and emphasis on performance and sustainability.

Increasing VFM in PPP power station projects - Case study: Rudeshur gas turbine power station	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP; BOO; Risk allocation; VFM; Power station		In the past, public sector most often invested in power station projects, however, rapid increases in electricity demand, especially in developing countries, and limited financial resources of governments have recently led them to resort to private sector investment. Furthermore, increasing Value for Money (VFM) of the output/service through using the advantages of private sector efficiency is highly sought. To achieve these objectives, long-term partnership between the public and the private sector entities through Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreements are used. In the ideal PPP, risks should be allocated to the party who is the best entity to manage them in the most cost-effective way. Using Rudeshur gas turbine power station case study, this research explores how and to what extent the Iranian Government (IG) could achieved the above-mentioned objectives. While Rudeshur agreement can answer IG's urgent need for electricity demand in short-term, due to poor market and revenue risks allocation, it cannot contribute to competitive market conditions and thus, cannot achieve VFM in long-term by contracting such the Rudeshur agreement.

State and local governments are required to develop transition plans to upgrade inaccessible pedestrian facilities to fully comply with all accessibility requirements. This paper presents the development of a novel model that is capable of optimizing the scheduling of pedestrian facilities upgrade projects to maximize compliance with accessibility laws and regulations. The model provides original contributions to support decision makers in (1) quantifying the impact of upgrading noncompliant pedestrian facilities on people with disabilities; (2) identifying near-optimal trade-offs among the three optimization objectives of minimizing total number of interrupted pedestrian trips, minimizing total upgrade duration, and minimizing annual upgrade budget; (3) generating detailed schedules for upgrading noncompliant pedestrian facilities to satisfy ADA transition plan requirements; and (4) creating graphic maps of the generated near-optimal transition plans. A case study of a real-life city that includes 4,178 noncompliant pedestrian facilities was analyzed to evaluate the performance of the model and illustrate its novel and unique capabilities.

Initially, a framework of challenges was developed via literature review. We then ranked the importance of these challenges and categorized them based on interview data and analytical hierarchy processing analysis. Interviews were conducted with procurement experts from three major ID project stakeholder groups: donor organizations, host country government policymakers, and project implementation units. The most important categories of challenges were those related to project management capacity/capability, and ethics. More specifically, the challenges deemed most important were those related to improper project planning, undue practices in procurement implementation, government bureaucracy and interference in procurement, and inexperienced procurement staff. This paper contributes to the ID project procurement literature by identifying the critical challenges to procurement, which differ from those of other project-related areas. The findings may assist the multibillion-dollar ID project procurement industry in Bangladesh by highlighting the major issues that require effective management by all stakeholders. Ultimately, this may improve procurement outcomes and overall project performance.

However, most PPP schemes incorporate long-term debts in the capital structure due to huge initial investments and long recovery periods. An optimal capital structure, meaning the financing mix between debt and equity, maximizes the value of the PPP project. The terms and conditions of the debt are subject to negotiations between the private sponsor and the financiers, given the concession agreement between the host government and the sponsor. Debt ratio is a key term in the project finance funding agreement. This study contributes to the project preparation of PPP schemes by developing a simple model to determine the optimal debt ratio for financing PPP projects and to establish the relationship between debt ratio and hurdle rates of projects' financial indices. Results suggest that the hurdle rate of financial net present value determines the lower limit of debt ratio and the hurdle rate of times interest earned decides the upper limit of debt ratio in the Taiwan high speed rail project.

Rethinking healthcare building design quality: an evidence-based strategy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						quality assurance; strategy; design quality; standards; design guidance; outcomes; assessment tools; healthcare buildings; public policy	ORGANIZATION; INNOVATION	Healthcare buildings play a significant role in delivering healthcare services and outcomes (e.g. quality, suitability, cleanliness, patient experience, value for money and risk mitigation). However, the current diffusion of responsibilities in England between central government and healthcare trusts has created gaps and weaknesses in the evidence base, knowledge, skills and tools for creating and assessing healthcare building design quality. How can a national healthcare building design quality improvement strategy be created? This question is explored in relation to policy, strategy and organizational issues. Four evaluation studies and four action research studies indicate the complexity and responsibilities in defining a design quality improvement strategy. It is found that the interdisciplinary development of national standards and tools requires centralized investment to facilitate nationwide learning and improvements in evidence and outcomes. In addition, the inevitable health policy changes made by successive governments require a sustainable and strategic response. The creation and maintenance of capacity and capabilities will require a dedicated team of professionals and a wide interdisciplinary network of long-term contributors who are motivated by a long-term desire to improve healthcare building design quality.

Involvement of not only national governments but also all other stakeholders including local governments is important to promote sustainable development and to achieve the goals. The question arises, therefore, of what methods should be used to best implement and assess sustainability issues at a local level. In this light, a new version of Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), CASBEE for Cities, is introduced for assessing the sustainability of cities and communities around the world based on SDG indicators and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The tool allows users to understand the sustainability of cities and communities based on quality (Q) and environmental load (L) perspectives. The sustainability assessments show that cities in developed countries tend to have good grades for Q, but bad grades for L, while cities in developing countries tend to have the opposite trend. This will assist cities and communities in both developed and developing countries to understand urgent problems and to identify effective solutions for sustainable development.

In the United States, existing transportation infrastructure is aging and new infrastructure is underfunded. PPPs are considered one way to help meet this looming need. Although PPPs have a long history, interest in modern PPPs is renewed. The current debate over PPPs lacks theory and research to support the various views of PPPs. Promoters say they bring needed financing, technology, management, and risk sharing to infrastructure development. Detractors say government agencies are better positioned to finance and own infrastructure and protect the public interest. The unique contribution of this paper is to provide the results of a national survey on the state-of-practice of PPPs in transportation in the United States, and to provide a comprehensive overview of research on U.S. transportation PPPs in the areas of economics, law, and public opinion. Additionally, a path forward is offered to help organize and guide research in U.S. transportation PPPs in the future. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000050.

The interorganizational diffusion of PC technology transcends organizational boundaries to achieve resource sharing, which transforms technology from theory to practice and from innovation to economic benefits. Existing research mainly focuses on developing and applying PC technology but ignores its interorganizational diffusion process. Understanding the interorganizational diffusion of PC technology is important for government policymaking. This paper looks at how PC technology is diffused among PC companies. A two-stage evolution framework was proposed based on social network theory. Using China's PC-related cooperative patent data, macro diffusion characteristics and micro partner selection mechanisms underpinning its evolution were explored. The results revealed the scale-free feature of the interorganizational diffusion of PC technology and provided preferred collaborators for PC companies. This study advances theoretical systems of both PC and technology diffusion and can assist government and PC companies in improving diffusion performance.

Negative factors in implementing public-private partnership in Indian road projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						India; negative factors; public-private partnership (PPP); roads	PPP; TRANSPORT; SUITABILITY	For the Government projects, Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is an important parameter based on which the project is procured through a private-sector. The objective of this paper was to identify and evaluate the perception of respondents for negative factors affecting Indian road projects undertaken by PPP. Thirteen negative factors were identified through a literature survey and validated with experienced professionals from the public-sector, private-sector and researcher. A questionnaire survey was conducted among major PPP project participants and researchers of Indian PPP road projects to investigate the most important negative factors. Identified factors were grouped into four categories: lack of experience, high cost, project's effectiveness and high risk using factor analysis. The four most important negative factors of Indian PPP Road Projects were identified using the Importance Index Method, which is: excessive restriction on participation, lengthy delays in negotiation, confusion over government objectives and evolution criteria, and fewer employment opportunities. The perception was analyzed with various statistical tools. This paper gives recognition of very important negative factors in the PPP road sector in the Indian context which will help consider road projects under PPP during the development phase itself.

To identify a new model with better prediction of business failure of the construction contractors, this study utilized long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The financial ratios of the construction contractors in the United States were collected, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Tomek links were employed to obtain a balanced data set. The proposed LSTM RNN model was evaluated by comparing its accuracy and F1-score with feedforward neural network (FNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models for the optimized parameters selected from a grid search with five-fold cross-validation. The results successfully demonstrate that the prediction performance of the proposed LSTM RNN model outperforms FNN and SVM models for both test and original data set. Therefore, the proposed LSTM RNN model is a promising alternative to assist managers, investors, auditors, and government entities in predicting business failure of construction contractors, and can also be adapted to other industry cases.

It is one solution to saving private investors from severe traffic demand risk and the government from heavy fiscal burden, while ensuring the private investor a reasonable but not excessive rate of return in a public-private partnership (PPP) concession contract. This research models TAM as a real option to assess the value of flexibility of the right (but not obligation) to toll adjustments. A hypothetical case study derived from a real-life project (the Western Harbour Crossing in Hong Kong) is illustrated in detail to demonstrate the application of the framework developed and to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the framework. Outcomes of the research can help the government to design reasonable concession contracts and help the private investors to make sound investment decisions through effective management of the traffic demand risk. Therefore, a win-win prospect can be achieved in PPP concession contracts for both parties.

When making safety policy changes, legislative bodies and construction stakeholders alike try to successfully predict the impact such reformative actions will have on emergent safety patterns. Identifying optimal strategies for improving the market's safety climate is a difficult task to achieve given the complex interactions between the various parties involved. An agent-based model is developed and presented in this case study that mimics the interactions among project stakeholders at the market level within the context of construction safety during both bidding and construction phases. In addition to incorporating various behavioral patterns and financial attributes of contractors and owners, the model makes use of insurance premium models and government fines to simulate safety climate patterns at the project and market levels. The model is shown to be capable of realistically depicting emerging safety patterns in a given environment when reformative actions are initiated by various stakeholders. The model is promising as a tool for policy makers to identify optimal strategies for improving the market safety climate. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To examine the inter-organizational networks that form to coordinate resources for infrastructure reconstruction, we employed social network analysis in 19 communities in the Philippines following Super Typhoon Haiyan, at 6 and 12 months post-disaster. To build these networks, we analysed interview, field observation and documentation data collected from non-governmental organizations, local governments and communities. A survey questionnaire was also administered to organizations working in selected communities to validate networks. Results from network analysis established that information was the most commonly shared resource by organizations, followed by financial, material and human resources. Government agencies had the highest actor centralities; however, qualitative data suggest that these roles were the result of obligatory consultations by international organizations and lacked legitimacy in practice. Findings further demonstrate that networks become more decentralized over time as actors leave and roles become more established, influenced by short-term expatriate contracts and the termination of United Nations supported cluster coordination. Findings could help organizations strengthen humanitarian response efforts by attending to resource allocation and knowledge sharing with other organizations.

Accordingly, the (actual and potential) roles of a wide range of stakeholders associated with the integration of disaster risk reduction into the (re-)development of the built environment are examined. A review of literature, government data and interviews with key stakeholders in England highlights that despite regulatory intentions to increase local resilience through the use of public and private sector stakeholders, a number of structural and operational obstacles exist. A range of strategies can be employed to overcome these obstacles: revisions to building codes, tightening planning policy, improving professional training, clarifying roles and missions, enabling complementary bottom-up and top-down approaches, and the provision of good-practice guidance about the broad range of structural and non-structural risk reduction measures. Many of the operational challenges are non-structural and require a coherent, overarching strategy: changing and aligning the social understandings and practices in civil society, government and built environment stakeholders.

J.; Luo, Jian			Incentive mechanism for inhibiting investors' opportunistic behavior in PPP projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP projects; Opportunistic behavior; Principal-agent; Incentive mechanism	PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS; POLICY; SUCCESS	In public-private partnership (PPP) projects, private investors may engage in opportunistic behavior to pursue self-interest. In this paper, based on the contractual relationship between the government and private investors in PPP projects, principal-agent models in the presence of opportunistic tendencies in private investors were constructed to analyze the incentive mechanism for inhibiting investors' opportunistic tendencies in PPP projects. The results show that investors with opportunistic tendencies would be more inclined to invest an optimal level of productive efforts after acquiring a higher proportion of benefits allocation in the project output. Likewise, an increase in incentive intensity would help to lower the level of opportunistic behavior adopted by investors. For investors who are armed with opportunistic tendencies, there exists an optimal level of opportunistic behavior in order to maximize their benefits, and contrary to intuition it is not always the case that a higher level would be better for them. The findings contribute new insights into the development of incentives mechanism between the government and the private investors to collectively work toward creating a "win-win" contract and curbing potential opportunistic behavior.

The questions of how energy benchmarking is currently conducted, and how it might be improved using rapidly growing quantities of self-reported data, are examined. A case study of commercial office buildings in New York City demonstrates how the rapid growth in self-reported data presents both new opportunities and challenges for energy benchmarking for buildings. A critique is presented for the scoring methodology and data sources for Energy Star, one of the largest and most successful benchmarking certification schemes. Findings from recent studies are examined to illustrate how this certification currently works in the marketplace. Self-reported building energy data are rapidly growing in Portfolio Manager (the user interface to Energy Star) due to mandatory energy benchmarking laws, and can be used to improve Energy Star's current scoring methods. These self-reported data are tested and improved for analysis by applying theories and methods of data quality developed in computer science, statistics and data management. These new data constitute a critical building block for the development of energy efficiency policies, and will affect how government, consultants, and owners measure and compare building energy use.

J	Liu, JC; Gao, RL; Cheah, CYJ				Liu, Jicai; Gao, Ruolan; Cheah, Charles Yuen Jen			Pricing Mechanism of Early Termination of PPP Projects Based on Real Option Theory	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnership; Early termination; Pricing mechanism; Real option	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CONCESSIONS	The early termination of public-private partnerships (PPP) frequently occurs in large infrastructure projects. Studies have analyzed the issue of compensation arising from early termination; however, most have ignored optionality in managing the risks and uncertainties embedded in these settings. Using real option theory, this paper examines pricingmechanisms for early termination under two different scenarios, namely, those of excessively high or excessively low cash flows, wherein early termination of PPP projects occurs during the stage of the operation prior to the final stage of asset transfer. The results show that while the pricing of early termination is mainly determined by the actual cash flow profile, it is also related to the level of total investment and return on investment. The final value of compensation agreed upon is also dependent on the bargaining power of each party. These findings contribute new insights into the pricing mechanisms of early termination used by governments and private investors. The quantification and derivation of early termination prices up front serves as a valuable benchmark and a good starting point for both governments and investors during negotiations and addresses the issue of compensation for early termination in a fair and reasonable manner.

However, its full functions are yet to be explored for the performance of government-sponsored infrastructure projects due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties that arise from their unique socioeconomic perspective in developing countries. Therefore, this research investigates the dimensions of project governance (i.e., portfolio direction; sponsorship effectiveness and efficiency; and disclosure and reporting) effects on project performance through the correlation of stakeholder management. Based on the stakeholder theory, a moderation model was proposed and a survey questionnaire was designed to get feedback from the respondents of the government policy and planning departments of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was the core statistical technique for testing the hypotheses. The findings of moderation analysis show that project governance has a positive relation with project performance at medium and higher regression coefficients values of stakeholder management. Inversely, at low regression values, this relationship is negative and insignificant. This research contributes to the literature as the significant interaction of stakeholder management could amplify the effect of project governance, subsequently enhancing the performance of public infrastructure projects.

M.; Cheung, Esther; Ke, Yongjian			Drivers for Adopting Public Private Partnerships-Empirical Comparison between China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The private sector has long been involved in delivering public sector projects, whether its role has been as a partner or just as a contractor for the government. Over recent years the interest in adopting public private partnerships (PPPs) has increased internationally. Many research studies have presented positive reasons for the governments and the private sector to welcome this form of procurement, rather than continue adopting the traditional options. This paper aims to explore and compare the key drivers for adopting PPP in China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (referred to as Hong Kong from here onwards). An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted in both of these administrative systems and survey respondents were invited to rate their perceptions on the importance of 15 different drivers identified. Eighty-seven completed survey questionnaires were returned for analysis. The findings indicated that respondents from China rated economy-related drivers higher, whereas Hong Kong respondents tended to rate efficiency-related drivers higher. China's demand for more public infrastructure and services has imposed great pressure on the government's budget, and therefore economic drivers were rated higher. On the other hand, with adequate financial reserve in hand and budget surplus over recent years, Hong Kong has tended to prefer paying for projects upfront, and hence efficiency was regarded more significantly. Among the 15 drivers, both of the respondents from China and Hong Kong selected, "provide an integrated solution (for public infrastructure/services)" and " solve the problem of public sector budget restraint" to be within the top three drivers. Despite the general agreement on the ranking pattern, the results of independent two-sample t-test showed that China and Hong Kong shared very different views on the driver" reduce the total project cost." This driver was ranked rather high by the mainland Chinese respondents, but much lower by the Hong Kong respondents. This finding can be construed that economic drivers are in general rated higher in China as compared to that in Hong Kong.	[Chan, Albert P. C.; Lam, Patrick T. I.; Chan, Daniel W.

Therefore, Nigeria's COVID-19 scenario may hinder sustainable development goals projects connected with the construction sector. Hence, this study investigated the challenges faced during the pandemic and proffer feasible solutions through the stakeholders' perspective to direct the post-COVID-19 recovery phase into a sustainable path for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) connected to the construction sector. This was conducted in sequence. First, the face-to-face interviews and results from the qualitative phase were further analysed through a questionnaire survey within Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. Findings suggest management efficiency improvement, construction companies accelerate rollout and adoption of digitalisation technologies with government support, new skill-building on new tools and technologies, and government should increase the budget on infrastructure facilities as part of the feasible solutions to direct the post-COVID-19 recovery phase to achieve SDGs. In conclusion, the outcome of this paper will shed light on how collaboration with relevant stakeholders and the use of 4IR technologies can stir up attaining the SDGs associated with the sector in the post-COVID-19 recovery era.

To achieve this, data were collected via in-depth oral interviews. Phenomenological type of qualitative research and snowball type of non-probability sampling technique was adopted respectively. MAXQDA 2018 with the support of thematic analysis was employed to analyze the three themes generated, and five major cities in Nigeria were covered. The study found that rural-urban migration, unemployment, high cost of the rental fee, inability to access housing loan and shortages of LCH were the reasons people engaged in squatting. From the findings, weak institutional framework, corruption, inadequate LCH policy, political will, and absence of national housing database emerged as the major hindrances to the implementation of LCH programmes that could have mitigated squatting. Nigerian Government should strengthen public housing institutions via a strong institutional framework for the sustainability of LCH programmes and tackle corruption head-on. This can be achieved if the government sees LCH provision as one of the major pillars and synergy with other constructs of welfare.

Literature on building environmental assessment has examined how these tools are interpreted by stakeholders in design and construction, but less attention has been paid to their interpretation and usage as objects of policy - despite this being a channel through which they have a potentially huge impact. Based on a case study of the emergence of green building in Israel, and drawing on socio-technical literatures, this paper explores the meanings attributed to building environmental assessment in the policy context. It finds that these meanings include a platform for divergent environmental goals and a proxy measure for greenhouse gas abatement. The analysis suggests that for policy-makers, the significance of green building lies not in its constituting a set of environmental benchmarks but as a standard that gains currency as a black-boxed policy object. An open discussion is needed on the various logics driving the use of green building tools in public policy, and what they hope to achieve.

In this paper, a swing option, which can hedge the underlying risk in two directions above and below expectations, is introduced to model a revenue risk allocation contract in PPP projects. In the contract, a minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) and excess revenue sharing (ERS) are integrated. The contract is fair for the public and private partners in that it covers and balances the MRG and ERS. Moreover, the contract embeds the incentive and flexibility by granting the concessionaire swing rights. The contract is priced using a least-squares Monte Carlo simulation. Through a demonstration case of a highway in China, the contract values for different allocation parameters are obtained, providing a reference for negotiations between the government and the concessionaire; the optimal strategies for exercising the swing rights are also presented, according to which the concessionaire can decide when to exert the swing rights. The new revenue risk allocation mechanism developed by the swing option method could enrich the revenue risk allocation theory of PPP projects.

Alternative framework for assessing sustainable building funds: Green Building Fund	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						second-order moment; buildings; low carbon; Australia; payback; Green Building Fund (GBF); uncertainty; Markov chain	SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; PROGRAM-EVALUATION; APPRAISAL; BENEFITS; PERT	The Green Building Fund (GBF) established in 2008 as part of the Clean Business Australia initiative is aimed at mitigating the risk of climate change by forming close partnerships between government, business and industry. It is specifically targeted to reduce the impact of the built environment on Australia's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by reducing energy consumption through the operation of commercial office buildings. As part of the selection process, projects are assessed against three merit criteria: the potential reduction in GHG emissions, demonstration of potential, and quality of project design and management. An alternative framework is proposed that contributes more rigour to the current selection process. In particular, it contends for the use of second-order moment and Markov chain to establish the present worth and feasibility of green investment where the underlying parameters of interest/discount rate and cash flows (in terms of savings) are uncertain. This framework will be useful not only to AusIndustry (the funding body of the GBF) and other government departments worldwide responsible for awarding green building funds but also to owners who are keen on strengthening their application by improving the demonstration of project feasibility.

Although the rise in concern for ` triple bottom line' sustainability is now embedded in many government and corporate policies, it is still not integrated into UK property investment practice. Whilst the last decade has seen progress towards ` green buildings', there has not yet been a ` sea change' in market behaviour. In developing this premise, it draws on the third of three surveys undertaken by the authors spanning a decade and tracking investor attitudes towards ` green' and sustainable buildings. Stakeholders' attitudes towards a potential range of fiscal measures that might incentivize market movement towards the adaptation of more sustainable behaviour. The business case for investment in sustainable property currently rests on risk reduction, not proven return advantage. There is support among respondents for a range of fiscal incentives. Although challenges to implementation undoubtedly exist, they are, in the authors' view, worthy of further research and investigation. There is potential to stimulate, via the fiscal system, measures to reward sustainable practices in property investment and management which can be facilitated through a more open dialogue with government bodies.

The risk assessment of PPP projects is essential in ensuring project success. The objective of this study is to develop an Analytic Network Process (ANP) based risk assessment model for hydropower investments, and a tool to facilitate quantification of risk ratings based on this model. The results show that the three most important risk factors that affect the overall risk rating of a PPP hydropower investment are legal risks, contractor/subcontractor risks, and operator risks. In addition, the three most important risk clusters were identified as stakeholders, government requirements, and resources, whereas market was the least important cluster. The tool that measures the risk rating of a PPP of hydropower project was tested on ten real cases, and satisfactory results were obtained in terms of its predictive capability. The contributions of this research include (1) identification of the risk factors and clusters of factors associated with PPP hydropower investments; (2) determination of the priority of each risk factor and cluster; (3) development a tool that guides the investors through the risk assessment of PPP hydropower investments.

J	Janda, KB; Topouzi, M				Janda, Kathryn B.; Topouzi, Marina			Telling tales: using stories to remake energy policy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						buildings; energy policy; retrofit; social context; research challenges; storytelling; public policy; performance gap	FEEDBACK; PROFESSIONALISM; PERFORMANCE	To benefit and protect the populace, government policies often promise aspirational changes to current practice. Different kinds of narratives are important in the framing, explanation, motivation, and understanding of policies and strategies. For example, the UK government's 2008 Climate Change Act proclaimed that all new homes will be zero carbon by 2016. This 'hero story', where society is 'saved' by clever technologies, is inspiring, positive and familiar. An alternative is the 'learning story', where things are not quite as simple as they first seemed. In a learning story, protagonists are normal people who need to overcome a challenge. In energy policy, the learning story could address the gap between the technical potential and what is achieved in practice. Three real-world examples from retrofit and new-build projects are used to show how implicit narratives can create conflict when the tellers (e.g. researchers) have to tell one kind of story but have data for the other. Recommendations are provided for a balanced approach to the deployment of different kinds of tales by policy-makers, researchers, implementers and users. Harnessing the learning story and developing a 'caring story' could motivate policy-makers and the public to invest effort in building performance.

This study also evaluated two nearly identical projects and used expert interviews and surveys to determine which factors influence the cost premiums. The projects represented a rare opportunity to compare projects that had the same end requirement: method of execution and acquisition, design/build and firm-fixed price; and location but differed by government construction agent. In addition to identifying the 28 factors that moderately or largely influence cost premiums, five overarching cost-premium themes emerged: failing to balance risk, additional public-sector requirements, stifling or not applying innovation, selection of construction specifications, and parameterization of the execution process. Additionally, once complete, two nearly identical projects differed by over a year of construction time and $7million in spite of the contract requirement similarities. Research frequently cites federal laws and policies as the primary cost-premium driver; however, this research demonstrated that internal construction agent policies also cause increased cost premiums. Mitigating the causes of internal cost premiums could improve public-sector construction cost performance.

J	Teo, EAL; Chant, SL; Tan, PH				Teo, Evelyn Ai Lin; Chant, Swee Lean; Tan, Peh Hua			Empirical investigation into factors affecting exporting construction services in SMEs in Singapore	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The Singapore government is encouraging construction enterprises to venture abroad for exporting their services and become global players since the local construction pie is shrinking and the global market is growing. The Building and Construction Authority of Singapore has revamped the contractors registration system with the hope of bringing about merger and acquisition of companies for improving the local contractors' standing in the global construction scene. To diversify into new markets in a new environment, which is very different from local environment, requires diversification vis-a-vis exporting strategy. This study examines the attitudes and views of contractors, operating in Singapore (excluding foreign contractors), on how the strategic move should be focused for diversification vis-a-vis exporting services. The aim of this study is to establish the survival skills necessary for Singapore's construction small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to venture abroad. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted and the results show that local construction SMEs who have diversified have reaped the benefits derived from diversification into new markets abroad. The main conclusions are that construction SMEs have to export their services in order to survive and they can enhance their export capabilities by forming a consortium with the help of local government.

P.; Wang, Shou Qing; Ke, Yongjian			Empirical Study of Risk Assessment and Allocation of Public-Private Partnership Projects in China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships (PPP); Risk assessment; Risk allocation; Risk management; China	POLITICAL RISKS; MANAGEMENT; PPP	Earlier research studies on public-private partnership (PPP) indicated that an objective, reliable, and practical risk assessment model for PPP projects and an equitable risk allocation mechanism among different parties are crucial to the successful implementation of these PPP projects. However, actual empirical research works in this research area are limited. This paper reports the first stage of a research study, which aims to identify and assess the principal risks for the delivery of PPP projects in China and to address their proper risk allocation between the private and public sectors. An empirical questionnaire survey was designed to examine the relative importance of different risk factors and to analyze the allocation of risk factors to different parties in PPP projects. A total of 580 questionnaires were sent out, and a total of 105 valid responses were obtained for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to investigate whether significant difference in perception existed first between the private and public sectors and second between industrial practitioners and academics in China. The empirical findings show that the three most important risk factors for PPP projects in China are (1) government intervention; (2) government corruption; and (3) poor public decision-making processes. These findings reveal that the Chinese government intervention and corruption may be the major obstacles to the success of PPP projects in China. A major cause for these risks may be attributed to inefficient legislative and supervisory systems for PPP projects in China. After conducting the Mann-Whitney U test on the 105 survey respondents, the empirical findings indicate that the perceptions of all 34 risk factors in China between the private and public sectors were not significantly different. Similarly, there were no significant differences between academics and industrial practitioners except that the former perceived the problem of government corruption to be more severe than did the latter. For risk allocation, the empirical results indicate that the public and private sectors were in general consensus with most of the risks identified. The major risks that the public sector preferred to accept are within the systematic risk category, especially political, legal, and social risks. The private sector preferred to retain the principal risks within the specific project risk category, especially construction, operation, and relationship risks, in addition to economic risks within systematic risk category. The remaining risk, environment risk, is preferred to be shared between the two sectors. This research study enables international construction companies to better understand how risks should be assessed and allocated for PPP projects in China. It also assists in risk response planning and control for future PPP projects in China. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000049. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Yeung, John F.

The relational nature of social procurement policies requires construction firms to develop new collaborative partnerships with organisations from the government, not-for-profit and community sectors. The aim of this paper is to address the paucity of research into the risks and opportunities of entering into these new cross-sector partnerships from the perspectives of the stakeholders involved and how this affects collaborative potential and social value outcomes for intended beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach This case study research is based on a unique collaborative intermediary called Connectivity Centre created by an international contractor to coordinate its social procurement strategies. The findings draw on a thematic analysis of qualitative data from focus groups with 35 stakeholders from the construction, government, not-for-profit, social enterprise, education and employment sectors. Findings Findings indicate that potentially enormous opportunities which social procurement offers are being undermined by stakeholder nervousness about policy design, stability and implementation, poor risk management, information asymmetries, perverse incentives, candidate supply constraints, scepticism, traditional recruitment practices and industry capacity constraints. While these risks can be mitigated through collaborative initiatives like Connectivity Centres, this depends on new "relational" skills, knowledge and competencies which do not currently exist in construction. In conclusion, when social procurement policy requirements are excessive and imposed top-down, with little understanding of the construction industry's compliance capacity, intended social outcomes of these policies are unlikely to be achieved. Originality/value This research draws on theories of cross-sector collaboration developed in the realm of public sector management to address the lack of research into how the new cross-sector partnerships encouraged by emerging social procurement policies work in the construction industry. Contributing to the emerging literature on cross-sector collaboration, the findings expose the many challenges of working in cross-sector partnerships in highly transitionary project-based environments like construction.

J	Shooshtarian, S; Caldera, S; Maqsood, T; Ryley, T; Khalfan, M				Shooshtarian, Salman; Caldera, Savindi; Maqsood, Tayyab; Ryley, Tim; Khalfan, Malik			An investigation into challenges and opportunities in the Australian construction and demolition waste management system	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainable procurement; Waste policy; C&D waste regulation; Overregulation; Recycled waste materials; Circular economy	IMPLEMENTATION; PROJECTS	Purpose The literature shows that the current Australian waste management framework does not meet industry and government expectations. This study, therefore, seeks the key construction and demolition (C&D) stakeholders' insights on various issues identified. It aims to understand the main barriers to effective C&D waste management, examining the role of the federal government and exploring perceptions around waste regulations, policies and schemes. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted in 2019 to capture stakeholder perceptions. One hundred and thirty-two participants from various industries and government agencies representing Australian jurisdictions took part in the survey. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Findings The results show that the main barriers are "overregulation, tough acceptance criteria and increased testing requirements", "lack of local market" and "culture, poor education and low acceptance". The main areas of improvement include "providing a guideline that determines the accepted level of contamination for reusing C&D waste", "preparation of guidelines on requirements of using recycled C&D materials in different industries" and "setting a target for reduction, reusing and recycling C&D waste". Research limitations/implications Some research findings may not be generalisable beyond Australia, but there are interesting insights for an international audience. The results inform policy development within the Australian states and territories context, to support the design and implementation of a circular economy model in the construction industry. The findings are evidence for a broader discussion to solve prevailing issues in C&D waste management, notably in the context of construction materials' end of life management. Practical implications The study highlights that policy development needs to be further expanded to include new/current waste management schemes including manufacturer's shared responsibility of waste generation, subsidies for C&D waste recycled materials and the proximity principle. Originality/value This paper provides a clear insight into C&D waste management stakeholders' perceptions towards the current waste management system in Australia.

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; procurement; public sector procurement; China	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONCESSIONAIRE SELECTION; TRANSACTION COSTS; CONTRACTS	Procurement models play a key role in determining the success of a public-private-partnership (PPP) project because they can help the government select the best bidder. Yet, few studies have systematically examined the selection of different procurement models. A content analysis is performed to discuss the institutional and legal framework along with the features of different procurement models in China. A multinomial logistic regression model is then applied to empirically investigate the relationship between the selection of different procurement models and the internal characteristics of the projects, including the investment, duration, operation mode, sector and region. Besides, a questionnaire survey to Chinese officials participating in PPP project procurement is conducted to identify the critical factors affecting the selection preferences. The regression analysis shows that the PPP project procurement model selection in China varies significantly with the internal characteristics of the projects. Moreover, the three most important factors identified are the laws and regulations, internal characteristics of the projects and advice from consultant agencies. These results indicate that the PPP project procurement model selection in China does matter. Helpful policy suggestions for the governments of China and other countries are also provided.

J	Trigunarsyah, B				Trigunarsyah, Bambang			Organizational culture influence on client involvement	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture; Public sector organizations; Saudi Arabia; Structural equation modelling; Project delivery; Client involvement	CONSTRUCTION	Purpose - Lack of client involvement in construction of public projects has been identified as the main cause of many operational problems. Organizational culture (OC) plays a major role in guiding and shaping behavior of organizations, which could lead to the lack of client involvement. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of OC on client's involvement in construction project delivery. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was distributed to various government agencies of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modeling is used to determine the significance of the impact of OC factors on the involvement of clients in construction projects. Findings - This study suggests that OC plays a major role in influencing and increasing the client involvement in construction projects by emphasizing team orientation, which includes team contribution and team accountability. In addition, it is also important to value employee's idea. Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to government agencies as clients in construction projects, i.e. only public sector construction projects (not private sector projects). Therefore, researchers are encouraged to investigate client involvement in the private sector projects. Originality/value - This paper provides empirical evidence of the relationships between OC and the client involvement in construction projects by emphasizing team orientation.

J	Cohen, R; Bordass, B				Cohen, Robert; Bordass, Bill			Mandating transparency about building energy performance in use	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						governance; energy policy; energy benchmarking; building energy use; energy efficiency; operational rating regulation; energy performance; energy rating		In 2002, the European Union Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was ratified. This paper uses the lens of one policy measure triggered by the EPBD - Display Energy Certificates (DECs) for non-domestic buildings - to describe the difficulties experienced in capitalizing on a policy intention to use transparency about actual energy performance to drive better energy management and focus energy efficiency investment on things that really work in practice. It reviews the history and precedents of UK Building Regulations and European building energy efficiency policies to identify what helped and hindered progress towards buildings that use less energy in operation; and compares and contrasts building energy certificates based on asset and operational ratings. It also looks at the development paths of operational rating schemes in the US and Australia. It identifies a tendency of regulators to focus on one part of the problem, the so-called 'regulated loads'; an unhelpful split of government ownership of the topic between various ministries and agencies; a neglect of follow-through, enforcement and feedback; and a political rhetoric that favours an abdication of central government responsibilities to market forces. Based on this evidence, it identifies a number of lessons for improvements to future policy outcomes.

Exploring Key Indicators of Residual Value Risks in China's Public-Private Partnership Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships (PPPs); Residual value risk (RVR); Key risk indicators (KRIs); Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); Questionnaire survey	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; FINANCIAL RISKS; PPP PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; ALLOCATION	sPublic-private partnerships (PPPs) are gaining popularity in China because of governments' increasing budget constraints and the urgent need to develop infrastructure since 2014. However, residual value risk (RVR) is a significant threat to the success of PPP projects and challenges the governance capability of China's government, where key risk indicators (KRIs) can be used as a measure to reveal the potential presence, level, or trend of RVR. To help the public sector obtain estimated value as specified in a concession agreement when the projects are transferred back to the government at the end of the PPP agreement or in earlier termination due to RVR, this paper proposes and refines a KRI conceptual model composed of seven risk dimensions and 61 indicators. A structured questionnaire survey with PPP experts investigated the relative significance of those 61 KRIs for RVR management in PPPs. Although the survey results show that all KRIs are important, seven risk dimensions contribute differently to the exposure of RVR. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the proposed conceptual model fit the observed set of collected data in a predictable way by goodness-of-fit indices, and to further consolidate the KRIs. The refined KRI model uses 41 KRIs based on survey and CFA results, indicating that residual value (RV) of a PPP project is strongly influenced by effective maintenance, long-term sustainable development, and reasonable profitability and refinanceability. The KRIs including high-quality design work in the early stages of PPP projects, construction quality and public service quality, comparatively low operation costs during the operation period, and feasible technologies adopted by private sectors have a greater value in corresponding dimensions. These 41 KRIs have the ability to indicate trends of losses of RV in PPPs, control weaknesses for RVR management in PPPs, and obtain long-term and sustainable development through PPP projects.

In such an environment, building failures can pose a serious threat. Unauthorized building works, which are constructed without prior approval and consent from the government, are responsible for certain building-related accidents. In particular, those unauthorized building works attached to the external envelopes of buildings endanger the lives not only of their occupants, but also of passers-by and they cause damage to properties themselves. An overview of the proliferation of unauthorized building works in Hong Kong is provided followed by the first known empirical study on this topic. After inspecting 323 apartment buildings in two districts, the factors affecting the proliferation of unauthorized building works were analysed. It was found that buildings with amenities incorporated into their designs generally had fewer unauthorized building works on their external envelopes. However, owners associations or property management companies did not have any influence on unauthorized building work numbers for their buildings. These findings have far-reaching implications on the formulation of government policies for building safety. The formation of statutory owners associations or the engagement of property management companies is not effective in containing the unauthorized building work problems in Hong Kong. Community education and stricter law enforcement would be more effective.

Training, motivation, and performance: The case of human resource management in construction projects in Mashhad, Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human resource management; Construction; Performance; Earthquake; Mashhad; Iran		An enterprise's productivity is closely correlated with its people and strategies; therefore, a forceful human resource management system is the most valuable asset of the current century construction companies. Purpose/design/methodology/approach: Based on a combination of literature review and questionnaire surveys, this paper explores the execution of construction workers training and motivation methods in HRM practices by the survey respondents' companies and the effects on the companies' performances. The research was conducted by sending 120 sets of questionnaires to the nominated companies and firms in Mashhad, Iran. A quantitative research approach was adopted requiring the development and dissemination of a questionnaire survey. The analysis method in this research is mainly descriptive and the type of investigation is co-relational study. Findings: The research exposes some barriers in the training and motivation of the construction workers and provides solutions for the government and companies in Iran. Also, it reveals the effects of unskilled labour on the quality of construction projects in Mashhad. Research limitations/implications: Future research should be under taken to address how companies and governments adapt to and shape the environmental and organizational settings in such a way that the context optimally stimulates workers motivation and participation in training courses and effects on increasing the quality of construction.

In particular, the author discusses the risk of perverse incentives of the types typically found in the development aid sector that results in counterproductive outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a simple conceptual framework based on agency theory. A qualitative, case-based approach with purposive sampling was chosen for the empirical part of the study. Eight Norwegian projects were selected because incentive problems were to be expected, and one development aid project served as a reference case. Findings The paper finds that low strategic project success corresponded well with the terms of financing. There were clear indications of agency problems, in three cases to the extent that the incentives turned perverse. The paper concludes with a discussion of relevant measures to prevent the emergence of perverse incentives. Originality/value The paper contributes to an improved understanding of the incentives related to public project initiation and selection, which is an under-researched topic and generally not included in formal project governance schemes. The research should therefore be useful to scholars as well as practitioners within the field of project governance.

Over the last decade, however, several major PPP projects have incurred significant cost and schedule overruns, which have marred their use as a mechanism for delivering much-needed infrastructure. The paucity of performance measurement frameworks has contributed to the difficulty of proactively managing the effective and efficient delivery of PPPs, particularly during operations and maintenance. With this in mind, a lifecycle and stakeholder-oriented performance measurement framework (PMF) is conceptualized within the context of social infrastructure PPPs. The opinions of 160 practitioners about the proposed measures and their core indicators were solicited using a questionnaire survey. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the significance of proposed measures and their relevant core indicators (CIs) for measuring the performance of PPP projects throughout their lifecycle. The analysis reveals that the proposed PMF is a reliable and robust tool that can be used to assist with ensuring that social infrastructure PPPs can be delivered successfully throughout each phase of their lifecycle. The developed PMF provides governments and private consortiums with a robust and practical tool to measure and control the performance of their future projects.	[Liu, Junxiao; Love, Peter E.

Such assessment and disclosure could introduce a market mechanism that can be expected to provide city governments with strong incentives to improve their city conditions and also recognizes that local policy and strategy can be the most appropriate way to address specific urban and environmental problems. The latest Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) tool, referred to as CASBEE-City, is presented. Designed specifically for city assessment, it supports local governments and other stakeholders in identifying the environmental, social and economic characteristics of their city and in quantifying the effectiveness of their city-wide policies. CASBEE-City is based on the concept of environmental efficiency and it provides a combined evaluation of a city embracing two aspects: the environmental load imposed by the city on the wider environment outside its boundary, and the quality of life (environmental, social, economic) inside the city. A city with low environmental load and high quality receives a high Built Environment Efficiency (BEE) value and is regarded as a sustainable city within the CASBEE framework.

Energy and environmental appraisal of domestic laundering appliances	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						appliances; consumer habits; domestic laundering; energy consumption; housing; indoor air quality; inhabitant behaviour; plug loads	PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION	At a time when UK and Scottish governments are aiming for zero-carbon housing, there are two key issues for domestic laundering: passive indoor drying, affecting heating use and the indoor environment (addressed elsewhere); and energy and environmental impacts of appliances. Relevant findings are reported on the 2008-2011 study 'Environmental Assessment of Domestic Laundering', drawing on monitored data from 22 case studies out of 100 dwellings surveyed in Glasgow. Differing consumer traits and habits, combined with variable technical performance, provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of a wide estimated annual consumption range. Actual usage and energy consumption averaged less than UK predictions; and values did not necessarily correspond with manufacturers' energy ratings. In a wider discussion, case study median and mean extrapolations of electricity consumed by laundering (105 and 174 kWh/person-year) prove significant relative to the proportion of what could be available to a dwelling achieving the German Passivhaus standard. The potential for heat recovery from 'grey' water is posited along with other options for mitigating power consumed by appliances. Renewable technology to offset consumption in shared facilities is discussed as a means of easing the performance of individual homes. The foregoing aspects are among key conclusions directed at housing occupiers, providers, national and local governments, and industry.	[Porteous, C. D. A.; Sharpe, T. R.; Menon, R.

J	Zou, PXW; Zhang, GM				Zou, Patrick X. W.; Zhang, Guomin			Comparative Study on the Perception of Construction Safety Risks in China and Australia	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY	Safety is a major concern in the construction industry because fatalities and injuries from construction work bring great losses to individuals, organizations, and societies as a whole. This paper aims to understand how construction personnel perceive safety risks in China as compared with those in Australia. Postal questionnaire surveys were used to collect data on safety risk perceptions from the two nations. The safety risk factors were assessed using a risk significance index based on the likelihood of occurrences and the impacts on safety performance. The survey results revealed that in China the main perception of safety risks came from human-and/or procedure-related issues, with "low/no safety education" paramount, followed by "inadequate fire prevention and electrical prevention procedures," etc. In contrast, the major safety risks perceived in Australia were related to the environment and physical site conditions with "contamination of land, water and air" ranked first, followed by "unforeseen excavation of soil," etc. To minimize construction safety risks in China, this paper suggests that the government should develop collective legislation and safety protection procedures, and enforce safety education and training to all site participants. Risks related to environmental and site conditions were generally realized by the Australia construction industry, which were not highly acknowledged in China. This may also bring imminent attention in this regard to the Chinese government.	[Zhang, Guomin] RMIT Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Chem Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Zou, Patrick X.

J	Jiang, FF; Jiang, X				Jiang, Feifei; Jiang, Xu			The Contingent Value of Resource Complementarity for Alliance Performance: Evidence From Chinese Manufacturing Firms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Alliance performance; institutional view; resource complementarity; resource-based view (RBV); transaction cost economics (TCE)	STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PARTNER SELECTION; EMERGING ECONOMIES; ENTRY STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; INSTITUTIONS; ASSETS; TRUST; PROTECTION; INNOVATION	Despite its critical role in ex ante alliance formation decisions, the impact of resource complementarity on alliance ex post performance, particularly in emerging economies, remains underexplored. Informed by the resource-based view (RBV), this study extends this line of research by examining when resource complementarity matters to alliance performance in an emerging economy. Specifically, drawing on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the institutional view, we examine how a partner-specific transactional attribute (behavioral uncertainty) and the institutional environment (featuring subnational institutional development and government support) condition the value of resource complementarity. Using a sample of manufacturing firms in China, we find that the positive effect of resource complementarity on alliance performance is reduced when partners' behavioral uncertainty increases transaction costs. The positive effect becomes stronger when relevant subnational institutions have a high index of marketization. Moreover, the effect of resource complementarity on alliance performance is shown to be strongest with moderate government support. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how firms can benefit from utilizing resource complementarity, highlighting the importance of incorporating TCE, and the institutional view in analyzing alliance-related resource issues when considered along with the RBV.

The first is the long-cherished desire to supply low-cost housing for low-and middle-income families, and the second is the problem of high vacancy levels attributable to low-level sales rates. Governments have been continuously implementing various supply policies intended to distribute houses evenly and to keep supply and demand in balance. However, it is difficult to satisfy consumers, owners, and suppliers because of conflicting needs and requirements. This paper therefore applies a system dynamics methodology and offers an integrated model that encompasses the for-profit behavior of each market participant, analyzes supply policies, and suggests appropriate and effective policies. Utilizing the case of the Korean housing market, the proposed model simulates future trends in house prices, balances between supply and demand, construction companies' earnings, and vacancy rates when various housing supply scenarios are applied. With extensive studies with the results from the simulation model, the authors recommend using private construction companies to stabilize housing distribution rates and the private supply system and ensure a balance between supply and demand.

J	Catalao, FP; Cruz, CO; Sarmento, JM				Catalao, Francisco Pinheiro; Cruz, Carlos Oliveira; Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda			The Determinants of Time Overruns in Portuguese Public Projects	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time overruns; Public projects; Public work contracts; Project management	COST DEVIATIONS; CONSTRUCTION; PROCUREMENT; DELAY; PERFORMANCE; DURATION	Infrastructure project delivery is a central topic in construction and project management. Time overruns are a critical dimension of successful project delivery. A significant body of knowledge exists regarding the understanding of time overruns. However, the literature has focused on endogenous determinants (project-related characteristics). This research expands the existing literature by explicitly analyzing exogenous determinants, such as the economic environment, governance and institutional quality, and legal and political frameworks. The paper analyses a set of 250 projects and attempts to understand the patterns and determinants of time overruns through an innovative approach based on the incorporation of exogenous determinants, examples being political, legal and regulatory, and economic ones. The findings confirm the hypothesis that time deviation distributions exhibit right skewness. In the used sample, the weighted average time deviation is 42.6%, and the mean time deviation is 36.7%, with a standard deviation of 32.9%. The results show that exogenous determinants have a substantial impact on time deviations (particularly political, institutional, and governance environment ones), as well the legal and institutional environment and economic context. Local government projects have more time deviations than those developed by the central government. Furthermore, no evidence was found to support that larger projects are more prone to time deviations than smaller ones.

Despite the industry's far-reaching technological capabilities, BIM has primarily assumed productivity improvement by individual firms, which has not lead to a systemic change in the Finnish architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) business ecosystem. A field study of the Finnish AEC industry has resulted in a critical understanding of why successful and intensive R&D at a national level and wide adoption of BIM technology in Finland has not led to the expected systemic evolution of its AEC business ecosystem. Additionally, a methodology based on inductive grounded theory and historical analysis has been used to capture and identify the evolving and dynamic relationships between various events and actors between 1965 and 2015, which, in turn, has aided in the identification and characterisation of the knowledge and innovation ecosystems. The research findings provide insights for BIM researchers and governments in terms of establishing new policies that will better align BIM adoption with the systemic evolution of business practices in the AEC business ecosystem.

Design/ methodology/ approach -The paper provides a general review of the characteristics of small-scale PPPs and identifies overarching concerns. Findings -The paper finds for small-scale PPPs constraints with respect to the definition, government processes and procedures, transaction costs, public capacity and institutional structure; important issues of transaction costs, minimum size requirement and increasing popularity and recommendations for further development. Practical implications -Since most small PPPs are conducted by cities and regional governments, many local bodies would benefit from a better understanding of small-scale projects, helping to develop standard documentation, which is especially relevant for small-scale projects given their relatively large transaction and bid costs, supporting the long-term growth of small PPPs. Originality/ value-Small-scale PPPs have different characteristics compared with large projects and these characteristics should be studied separately. Although the benefits of small-scale projects are undeniable, relatively few have been undertaken relative to the substantial requirement. A more thorough understanding of the constraints related to developing small-scale PPPs and how to reduce them would help the subset of small projects to reach its full potential. This paper serves as a first step, clearing the ground for further research in specific areas.

J	Othman, AAE; Mahmoud, NA				Othman, Ayman Ahmed Ezzat; Mahmoud, Nouran Abdeltawab			Public-private partnerships as an approach for alleviating risks associated with adaptive reuse of heritage buildings in Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Heritage buildings; conservation; adaptive reuse; risk allocation; public private partnerships		The status of heritage buildings in Egypt has remained threatened for decades as a result of many factors such as negligence, ignorance and lack of resources, which consequently led to degradation. Hence, opportunities to utilize these buildings efficiently are wasted. Adaptive reuse of heritage buildings has proven to be a beneficial, yet risky approach in Egypt. Additionally, the pressuring demands on the government to conserve these heritage buildings and satisfy other public demands have been growing even more recently. Accordingly, there is a need for the involvement of the private sector to aid the government in its adaptive reuse initiatives and managing its associated risks. Public-private partnerships (PPP) for heritage conservation have been successfully conducted in various developed countries. However, such an approach has received little attention in Egypt and developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of PPPs between the public sector (governmental bodies) and the private sector (mainly Architectural Design Firms (ADFs) and heritage developers) as an approach towards alleviating risks associated with adaptive reuse of heritage buildings in Egypt. The research contributes to the field of study by identifying and analysing a set of adaptive reuse risks of heritage buildings that could be used by governmental authorities and architects/developers to understand and manage such risks through risk sharing in PPPs.

The instrumented bicycle senses road conditions through the sensor logger along with the mobile app and cloud server. The sensor logger consists of a microprocessor, accelerometers, a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, battery, computer board (Arduino board), and Wi-Fi device paired with a smartphone via the Instrumented Bike mobile app. All real-time data is immediately transferred to the mobile app and the cloud server, where all data is analyzed using a data processing technique (the window interpolation method). Potential hazards (such as potholes, severe cracks, and bumps) are identified, georeferenced, and displayed in Google Maps to allow bicyclists (road users) and governments/authorities (road managers) to review prior to their cycling or decision-making for day-to-day maintenance. The paper concludes that the instrumented bicycle and its sensing technology presented in the paper allows cycling activities to effectively and immediately reflect and communicate the real-time road conditions to the bicyclists/governments who share/manage the bike routes, market and promote bike mobility, and recruit more participants in cycling data collection.

Toward Sociotechnical Transition Technology Roadmaps: A Proposed Framework for Large-Scale Projects in Developing Countries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; Developing countries; Technology management; Technology planning; Roadmaps (technology planning); Industries; Government; Complex systems; developing countries; large scale projects; sociotechnical transitions; technology roadmaps	MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; INNOVATION; PRACTITIONERS; RETHINKING; EVOLUTION	Governments and industries continuously engage in large-scale projects aiming to unlock economic potential for commercial and social benefits of a country and its people. In the case of developing countries, where the dynamics of innovation ecosystems differ from those in developed countries, the need for sociotechnical transition projects are often quite high. The aim of this article is to propose a standardized framework suitable for developing countries for the technology roadmapping of large projects aimed to bring about systemic sociotechnical transitions. The framework is developed through the integration of existing generic technology roadmapping approaches with transition management theory and complex systems theory and was illustrated against a successful sociotechnical transition program that is characterized by Big Fast Results (BFR) requirements. Data were collected from qualitative interviews as well as from the critical analysis of relevant documents. The proposed sociotechnical transition technology roadmap accurately captured the key elements of the BFR project it was benchmarked against and even identified key elements that were not included in the BFR methodology. An advantage of the proposed sociotechnical transition technology framework is the fact that it makes use of a standard technology roadmapping process with few customizations that are ideal for use in developing countries.

J	Shen, LY; Lu, WS; Peng, Y; Jiang, SJ				Shen, Liyin; Lu, Weisheng; Peng, Yi; Jiang, Shijie			Critical Assessment Indicators for Measuring Benefits of Rural Infrastructure Investment in China	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rural infrastructure; Investment; Critical assessment indicators; Monte Carlo simulation; Fuzzy set theory; China	COMPETITIVENESS; PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH	Rural infrastructure is of vital importance for agricultural growth, economic development, and poverty alleviation, particularly in developing countries such as China. In line with the implementation of a Coordinated Urban-Rural Development Strategy, infrastructure investment in China has consciously been tilted to rural areas. An urgent need exists to assess whether the investment has induced the benefits as expected. Existing research on rural infrastructure investment assessment focuses primarily on economic return while neglecting its social and ecological benefits. This paper identifies a set of critical assessment indicators (CAIs) that can be used to evaluate the multifaceted benefits of rural infrastructure investment in China. Research data were collected through a questionnaire survey given to three groups of experts, including government officers, professionals, and business practitioners who are working in China's housing and urban-rural development sector. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to generate additional data to supplement the data set from the questionnaire survey. The fuzzy set theory, which appreciates the fuzziness of data from the questionnaire survey, is used in the selection of CAIs. The CAIs can help the local governments in China to make better decisions in investing in rural infrastructure. These critical indicators can also be generalized to provide valuable references for the investigations of rural infrastructure investment in other developing countries.

J	Avetisyan, H; Skibniewski, M; Mozaffarpour, M				Avetisyan, Hakob; Skibniewski, Miroslaw; Mozaffarpour, Mohammad			Analyzing sustainability of construction equipment in the state of California	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction equipment; greenhouse gas emissions; sustainability index; sustainable construction		Construction equipment encompasses highly polluting machines adversely affecting the environment. Management tools are necessary for sustainability assessment of construction equipment fleets to allow contractors to reduce their emissions and comply with local or federal regulations. In addition to management tools, there is a need for a metrics that will allow companies to accurately assess the sustainability of their construction equipment fleets. The State of California USA is adopting innovative approaches to reduce adverse impact of humans on the environment. Once successfully implemented, the chances are that such practices attract other states to adopt similar approaches. This paper presents an evaluation of construction equipment fleets and data analysis. When measured and recorded, such results can be used along with decision-support tools for selection and utilization of construction equipment. The metrics for construction equipment evaluation as well as the tool for sustainable decision-making are developed based on readily available data from manufacturers or maintenance shops without a need for additional effort by contractors or government agencies for their adoption. The metrics developed and the decision support tool incorporate logical strategies of supply chain management for optimal selection of construction equipment for construction site while taking into account the availability, cost, and mobilization related constraints.

Acknowledging the diverse and sometimes conflicting interests of the stakeholders, decision makers must identify a viable scheme that could satisfy public accountability, commercial interests, and social consideration of the government, investor, and community, respectively. However, because each decision item could have several possible values or states, it is difficult for decision makers to come up with different PPP schemes by adopting the conventional analytical methods. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian network (BN) techniques to imitate human reasoning and conduct multiobjective decision making. By establishing a decision network that connects the decision items, evaluating criteria, and the ultimate objectives (i.e.,the satisfaction of the three main stakeholders), evaluation can be conducted through the BN and the noisy-OR gate concepts. A weighted score approach is applied to combine the objectives of the three stakeholders into a single value. This enables decision makers to evaluate and compare different PPP alternatives and identify a suitable strategy that could minimize the conflict, thereby ultimately increasing the chance of success of a PPP scheme.

J	Soomro, MA; Zhang, XQ				Soomro, Mohsin Ali; Zhang, Xueqing			Roles of Private-Sector Partners in Transportation Public-Private Partnership Failures	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Transportation management; Private sector; Partnerships; Project delivery; Transportation; Public-private partnership (PPP); Failure drivers; Failure mechanisms		Public-private partnership (PPP) models for public infrastructure delivery are becoming popular among government institutions around the world, due to their embedded potential value for money (VFM) to the public and governments themselves. The experience with infrastructure PPPs internationally have demonstrated many problems and partnership failures, where both the public and private sectors suffered huge losses. Motivated by a number of these failures, this study investigates the actions and decisions of private-sector partners by evaluating 35 failed transportation PPPs around the world. This paper identifies a set of drivers responsible for the failures of transportation PPPs, discusses the causal relationships between them, and finally evaluates a set of failure mechanisms initiated by the private-sector partners. It sheds light on the role of private-sector partners in terms of triggering failure mechanisms in transportation PPP failures. The identification of failure mechanisms discloses the fact that inappropriate decisions and actions of private-sector partners (i.e.,failure drivers) have created problems for other project partners, which ultimately caused the PPP failures. The failure mechanism model suggested here provides insight into the existing failure trends associated with private-sector partners in transportation PPPs. These findings will help private-sector partners to safeguard partnerships more effectively and provide public-sector PPP practitioners with a better understanding of their partners' actions and decisions and their influence on project success.

Although there are a large number of studies that explore the success determinants of PPP projects with numerous publications, research on the root causes of the failure of PPP projects is scarce. Such research is all the more important in view of the many failed PPP projects that suffered from disastrous consequences, including some that were abandoned by sponsors and some bailed out by the host governments, resulting in substantial controversy, criticism, and conflict. Through a systematic research approach that combines literature review, case studies, a questionnaire survey, and statistical analysis, this study (1) categorized six types of water PPP failure, (2) identified 33 failure drivers occurring in different stages of the PPP life cycle, (3) evaluated the relative significance of the 33 failure drivers, and (4) formulated an overall failure map that integrates 24 failure mechanisms, each resulting in a certain type of failure. Outputs of this study would facilitate stakeholders in monitoring the failure drivers in different PPP stages and developing reactive as well as preventive measures to effectively remove or mitigate their impacts toward the successful development of water PPP projects.

Empirical comparison of critical success factors for public-private partnerships in developing and developed countries A case of Ghana and Hong Kong	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Critical success factors; Ghana; Public-private partnership; Developing countries; Developed countries	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; TRANSPORT PROJECTS; PPP PROJECTS; AUSTRALIA; BOT; IMPLEMENTATION; EFFICIENCY; DELIVERY; OPERATE; CHINA	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the similarities and differences of critical success factors (CSFs) for public-private partnership (PPP) projects in developing and developed countries, using Ghana and Hong Kong as examples. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted with experienced PPP practitioners in Ghana and Hong Kong. Survey responses were analysed using Kendall's concordance analysis, mean score ranking, quartile groupings analysis and Mann-Whitney U test. Findings - The results indicate that a favourable legal and regulatory framework is very critical in both jurisdictions. Further, technology transfer, technological innovation, public/community participation and coordination and government providing financial support are of low importance in both jurisdictions. The non-parametric test shows that 16 CSFs are of different importance in Ghana and Hong Kong. Specifically, CSFs related to the socio-political and economic conditions of PPP projects are very critical in Ghana, whereas CSFs directly related to the organisation and relationship of PPP projects are very critical in Hong Kong. Originality/value - The outputs of this study add to the international best practice framework for successful PPP implementation. Further, international private investors and governments who are yet to adopt the PPP concept would be considerably informed of the investment strategies to employ when engaging in PPP arrangements.

Exploring critical influencing factors for the site selection failure of waste-to-energy projects in China caused by the "not in my back yard" effect	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Critical influencing factors; Waste-to-energy project; Site selection failure; "Not in my back yard" effect	INCINERATION INDUSTRY; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; DEMATEL APPROACH; NIMBY; ACCEPTANCE; MODEL; PLANT; FRAMEWORK; IDENTIFICATION	Purpose This study aims to explore the critical influencing factors that lead to the site selection failure of waste-to-energy (WtE) projects in China under the influence of the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) effect, which can provide references to improve the decision-making process of similar projects in the future. Design/methodology/approach The fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to propose an analytical framework for exploring the critical influencing factors affecting the site selection failure of WtE projects. The causal relationship between different influencing factors is finally determined on the basis of the opinions of 12 experts from universities, government departments, consulting units, planning and design units, construction units and WtE enterprises. Findings Results showed that six crucial factors resulted in the site selection failure of WtE projects from the NIMBY effect perspective: "Insufficient public participation," "Near the place of residence," "Nonstandard government decision-making processes," "Low information disclosure," "Destroys the surrounding environment," and "Imperfect compensation scheme." Originality/value Results can determine the priorities and causal relationships among the various influencing factors. The decision-making optimization suggestions can provide reference for decision- makers, thereby possibly promoting the scientific and standardization of site selection decision process.

J	Gransberg, DD; Barton, RF				Gransberg, Douglas D.; Barton, Ronald F.			Analysis of federal design-build request for proposal evaluation criteria	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROJECTS	This study's objective is to identify the benefits federal owners are seeking through the design-build process by analysis of research data gathered from 110 requests for proposal (RFP) evaluation plans issued for $1.5 billion of federal work by 11 different agencies. The output from this study was then compared to a 1996 study whose authors sought to analyze the reasons cited by owners to use design-build project delivery. That study included a survey of 108 owners of public and private projects, which represented over $12.5 billion of construction. The goal of comparing the 1996 survey with the results of the new research project is to discover correlations between owner attitudes and the selection criteria identified in government RFPs. The comparison produced some interesting results. First, although owners in 1996 cited schedule as the most significant reason for selecting design-build delivery, the federal RFP content analysis found it to carry a very low average weight. Another finding shows that federal RFPs give price a very heavy weight in the government selection processes, again differing significantly from the previous survey of owner attitudes. Finally, the current study found that the qualifications of the firms and individuals that formed the design-build team were significantly more important than the proposed technical design approach. Thus, this paper concludes that the typical federal agency was looking for a low price from a well-qualified design-build team.

J	Wooldridge, SC; Garvin, MJ; Miller, JB				Wooldridge, SC; Garvin, MJ; Miller, JB			Effects of accounting and budgeting on capital allocation for infrastructure projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								During the decline of public funding over the past three decades, infrastructure modernization has become increasingly dependent upon new strategies for managing the asset collection, and these strategies place a renewed emphasis upon condition assessment, alternative financing, and project delivery methods. Evaluation of these strategies and their impacts on public infrastructure operating and capital budgets presents a significant opportunity for engineers and planners seeking to optimize the capital allocation process. Accounting and budgeting data are the most tangible of decision factors considered by decision makers. As such, this data plays a critical role in how decision makers address the key components of the capital allocation process. These key components include condition assessment, planning, financing, and acquisition. Beginning with a review of accounting and budgeting definitions, this paper describes the role of financial information among these components. Case studies of infrastructure development and recent applications of a decision-support system that assists engineers and planners with the analysis and comparison of infrastructure production strategies provide the basis for characterizing the effects of accounting and budgeting on capital allocation. Findings at the local government level suggest that the common usage of cash-basis accounting and line-item budgeting and the lack of cost accounting do not adequately support decision makers in effectively executing the capital allocation process. However, recent changes in local government financial reporting standards and applications of activity-based costing methods seek to improve accounting and budgeting practices for public managers and outside interests involved in capital investment decisions.

P.; Jin, Xiaohua; Ginige, Kanchana			Delivery of Transport Infrastructure Assets: Decision-Making Model to Ensure Value for Money	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Transport infrastructure; Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs); Value for money (VfM) assessment; Decision making; Case study	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; DISCRETE-CHOICE MODELS; RAIL TRANSIT PPPS; PROJECTS; PROCUREMENT; LESSONS	Transport infrastructure is pivotal for economic and social development. Over the past decade, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have been widely adopted for its delivery in developing and developed economies due to increasingly limited public budgets. Therefore, deciding whether to use PPPs is a critical topic for governments and relies on an essential criterion that is referred to as value for money (VfM). However, the complexity of transport infrastructure projects renders the current VfM-oriented decision-making tool (i.e., public sector comparator) to be a less-than-comprehensive assessment. Thus, a total of five case studies of transport PPPs in Australia are undertaken in this paper to interpret existing practice. The empirical evidences indicate that the VfM-based assessment being widely used is ineffective in capturing: (1) key stakeholders' (e.g., client and asset end-users) expectations, and (2) the underlying dynamics of complexities of transport projects. Accordingly, a novel decision-making model that emphasizes asset service quality and usage is mathematically developed. Relevant implications for improving current practice have also been discussed. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge in terms of ex-ante evaluation of infrastructure projects and can be useful for enhancing the effectiveness of government's decision-making about the employment of PPPs for transport assets.

J	Jin, RY; Chen, Q				Jin, Ruoyu; Chen, Qian			Overview of Concrete Recycling Legislation and Practice in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Solid waste management (SWM); Concrete recycling; Sustainability; Questionnaire survey; United States	DEMOLITION WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT	Recycling concrete waste helps reduce the negative environmental impacts of construction activities. Worldwide, concrete recycling rates and available applications for recycled concrete vary widely. A deep understanding of the current status of concrete recycling in individual countries or regions would allow development of applicable and effective strategies for improvement. This empirical research on concrete recycling in the United States consists of two parts: a qualitative study of the legislation, regulation, and practice of solid waste management (SWM) and concrete recycling in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and a questionnaire survey of practitioners' views of concrete recycling in Ohio and California. Based on the qualitative analysis, the studied states and district were grouped into three categories, representing advanced, average, and below-average SWM practices, with the majority of states having average to below-average practice and so being in need of improvement. The survey results showed that practitioners in the two selected states have positive, consistent perceptions of the practice and benefits of and recommended methods for concrete recycling and identified no major difficulties except for a lack of government awareness and support. This research not only provides an updated understanding of concrete recycling legislation and practice but also offers useful strategies for government and industry to work together to promote concrete recycling.

J	Rebeiz, KS				Rebeiz, Karim S.			Public-Private Partnership Risk Factors in Emerging Countries: BOOT Illustrative Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnership; Build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT); Infrastructure; Risk; Power plant; Emerging market; International construction	MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRIES; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRUCTION	A public-private partnership (PPP) is an agreement between a host government and a private entity in which the private sector supplies infrastructure assets and services that are traditionally provided by the government. The popularity of PPP projects has been steadily on the rise over the past few years. This upward trend is in large part driven by governmental fiscal austerity, particularly in the aftermath of a prolonged global economic recession. The perceived attractiveness of PPP projects is particularly acute in emerging countries because of population growth and increased urbanization. PPP projects are usually highly complex in nature. They require large capital expenditure, they have long durations, and they usually utilize sophisticated technology. For a construction firm willing to expand its services internationally, a PPP project represents a unique opportunity to leverage its core competency and achieve competitive advantage in both domestic and foreign markets. Risk, however, increases with foreign penetration because of unfamiliarity with the geography, the supply chain, the local codes, and the business practices. Using an illustrative case study of a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) thermal power plant project, this paper addresses the salient risk factors facing the construction firm undertaking a PPP in an emerging country.

J	Sarmento, JM; Renneboog, L				Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda; Renneboog, Luc			Anatomy of public-private partnerships: their creation, financing and renegotiations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Concessions; Public-private partnerships; Renegotiations; Transports	TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE; LATIN-AMERICA; CONTRACTS; RISK; CONCESSIONS; MONEY; PPPS; EXPERIENCE; SUBSTANCE; MARKETS	Purpose - As public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become more widespread, doubts and criticisms about this type of infrastructural projects have emerged. The authors describe the PPP framework, discuss the financial structure and risk-sharing processes, and dissect the structure and organisation. The authors address the following questions: what are the main organisational characteristics of PPPs? How does the private sector structure and finance PPPs? And why and how are PPP contracts renegotiated? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on extensive theoretical and empirical research, which is presented in a literature overview on PPPs and their renegotiations. A comprehensive review is carried out and two case studies are developed to investigate the reasons behind success and failure of PPPs and the renegotiation of contracts. Findings - Incomplete contracts and the long duration of concessions can bring uncertainty and change to PPPs. Joint decision making can be difficult due to different parties involved. Renegotiation outcomes tend to rely on the position of the government. In Fertagus, the private sector asked for financial help led to a very balanced agreement. Conversely, Lusoponte renegotiations were initiated by the government, which significantly changed the project. Instead of relying solely on commercial revenues, Lusoponte was substantial financed by public funds. Research limitations/implications - Incomplete contracts and the long duration of concessions bring about much uncertainty to PPPs. Ex post decision making in PPPs in the wake of changing risks is difficult as it necessarily involves negotiations between the public sector and the private firm. The paper shows that marked differences in renegotiation outcomes emerge. In one case study, the private sector asked for financial help and the negotiation outcome was a very balanced agreement. Conversely, renegotiations in a second case were initiated by the government mainly for political reasons, resulted in a significant change in the PPP's structure, risk, financing, and returns, and yielded a large public losses. Practical implications - Contrasting successful and unsuccessful PPPs enables the reader to examine the opportunities and pitfalls in case of PPP renegotiations, which frequently occur. He can gain insight in the determinants of negotiation outcomes and the importance of a governmental PPP entity as well as of an independent monitor such as a court of audits. Originality/value - This paper should be useful for both academics and practitioners and should help increase the understanding of the several stages, structures, and renegotiation processes associated with PPPs.

J	Bayiley, YT; Teklu, GK				Bayiley, Yitbarek Takele; Teklu, Getachew Kahsay			Success factors and criteria in the management of international development projects Evidence from projects funded by the European Union in Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						European Union; International development projects; Success criteria; Success factors	LIFE-CYCLE; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the results of a survey that aims to explore and identify the European Union (EU) Development Cooperation project success factors and criteria and explain the relationship between the critical success factors (CSFs) and project success as perceived by the project managers and team members of the organizations participated in the survey. Design/methodology/approach - The research followed interpretive research philosophy, abductive approach, survey as a strategy, a cross-sectional time horizon and questionnaire as data collection instrument. It also employed exploratory design to identify CSFs and explanatory design to explain relationships between success factors and project success. Both primary and secondary data were used to gather data. Unstructured interviews were conducted with the project team members of EU delegation to Ethiopia, government organizations and NGOs while the secondary sources of data included extensive review of literature. Findings - Using principal component analysis the study identified a specific set of four CSFs for projects funded by EU: intellectual capital, sound project case, key manpower competency and effective stakeholder engagement. Moreover, the descriptive statistics of the survey highlighted five critical success variables: clear policy of donors and recipient government, strong local ownership of project, effective consultation during planning, high motivation and interest, and compatible rules and procedures. The study ranked relevance, impact, effectiveness, sustainability, and efficiency according to their level of importance by the participants of the survey. Research limitations/implications - The research is temporally, spatially, and contextually delimited to EU funded projects from the period 2010 to 2014 that are completed and still ongoing. Moreover, the current study focusses only on aid projects funded by EU in Ethiopia which might limit its generalizability into ID projects in developing countries funded by bodies other than EU such as World bank, United Nations and its different bodies, African Union, Japanese government to mention some. Social implications - The current study has clearly identified intellectual capital which covers social capital as the most important success factor for projects funded by EU in Ethiopia. Accordingly, the study underscored the importance of securing continuous support from all stakeholders and holding effective consultations of stakeholders during planning, implementation and closing phases of EU funded projects. Originality/value - The study identified new CSFs specific to projects funded by EU and the incompatibility in the perceived importance of project success criteria among different stakeholders implicating differences in the priority they set.

J	Cheung, SO; Shen, L				Cheung, Sai On; Shen, Lu			Concentration Analysis to Measure Competition in Megaprojects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Megaprojects; Concentration; Competition	INDUSTRY; MARKET; SHARE	The 2008 financial turmoil hit hard on many economies. Many countries and regions have since instigated major infrastructure developments to boost their economies. In this connection, the Government of Hong Kong began the Ten Mega Projects program. However, significant differences between tender prices and budget estimates have been reported, with the increases far exceeding the inflation factor. In view of the relatively large contract value and the available contracting capacity, lack of competition might have been one of the causes leading to the increase in tender price. This study investigates this phenomenon. To evaluate market concentration, four-firm concentration ratios (CR4) and the Herfindahl-Hershamann Index (HHI) are used. Employing data from the Ten Mega Projects market and drawing insights from competition laws on concentration thresholds, it is found that the CR4 results indicate a moderately concentrated market and HHI results suggest that the market is unconcentrated. The final results show an apparent firm size inequality. As such, the megaproject market displays a two-tier structure with a few large firms operating as oligopolies while numerous fringe firms act as price takers in perfect competition. A number of two-level entry barriers are also identified to account for this market structure, including product differentiation, capital requirements, switching costs for buyers between suppliers, government policies, and the size of incumbent firms. Compared with HHI, CR4 is considered a more informing approach. It is also suggested that a similar concentration evaluation can be performed for other construction markets.

J	Song, JB; Song, DR; Zhang, DL				Song, Jinbo; Song, Danrong; Zhang, Danlin			Modeling the Concession Period and Subsidy for BOT Waste-to-Energy Incineration Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build-operate-transfer; Waste-to-energy incineration; System dynamics; Fuzzy sets; Prospect theory; Quantitative methods	DEPARTURE TIME CHOICE; SYSTEM DYNAMICS; INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; REPRESENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; UTILITY	Build-operate-transfer (BOT) arrangements are increasing in popularity with the development of the waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration industry in China and many other countries. For BOT WTE incineration projects, decision-making regarding the concession period and the subsidy is critical for balancing the potential interests of the government, the private sector, and the public. However, the public's concerns with and influence over the decision-making process of BOT projects have been omitted in recent research. The aim of this paper is to propose a reasonable, systematic, and multiobjective model for determining the concession period and subsidy for BOT WTE incineration projects based on system dynamics and prospect theory. By applying the system dynamics approach, a revenue model is constructed and simulated considering the causal relationship and mathematical formulations among the influencing factors, and some acceptable alternatives for the concession period and subsidy are obtained. To gain the support of the public, the public perception is measured and quantified using prospect theory and fuzzy set theory, and a fuzzy multiobjective model is proposed to identify the most feasible and satisfactory alternative for the concession period and subsidy. Finally, the proposed model is verified by a real BOT WTE incineration project in China. This research is helpful for creating a multiwins' mechanism for the government, the private sector, and the public in a BOT WTE incineration project. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Xiong, W; Zhang, XQ; Chen, HY				Xiong, Wei; Zhang, Xueqing; Chen, Hongyu			Early-Termination Compensation in Public-Private Partnership Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Early termination; Compensation; Market value; Uncertainties; Contracting	CARLO-SIMULATION METHOD; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; FINANCIAL VIABILITY; RISK; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; DEMAND	Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been widely applied around the world in the provision of public works and services. Although a large number of PPP projects in different sectors have been successfully developed with increased value for money to governmental departments and the general public, concessions of many other projects in both developed and developing countries have been terminated before the originally scheduled date because of various unforeseen risks. To address the key issue of compensation to the concessionaire in such an early-terminated concession, this paper develops a compensation estimation framework and a corresponding mathematical model through a market value approach. A compensation model is developed using the discounted cash flow technique, which integrates multiple input and output variables and probabilistic techniques, such as regression analysis, maximum likelihood analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation, to analyze and tackle the uncertainties of social-economic variables and project performance variables. An example is provided to illustrate the applicability of this compensation estimation model; it shows that this model can take advantage of historical data from early-terminated projects and improve accuracy in measuring uncertainties associated with social-economic variables and project performance variables. This compensation model provides a fair compensation system to safeguard the benefits of both the concessionaire and the host government of the PPP project. It is expected that this model will assist the host government and concessionaire in effectively solving the compensation issue in future early-terminated PPP projects in a fair way.

J	Wibowo, A				Wibowo, A			CAPM-based valuation of financial government supports to infeasible and risky private infrastructure projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						privatization; infrastructure; capital costs; feasibility studies; investments; financial management		Driven by acute fiscal problems and disenchantment with the performance of publicly delivered quality services, many governments in both industrial and developing countries are now relying on the private sector to deliver infrastructure services. In the context of private infrastructure financing, the provision of governmental support is not uncommon. The present paper discusses the theoretical framework of the valuation of the financial impact of support on the cost of debt, cost of equity, the expected return on equity (ROE), and the project's net present value (NPV), based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) within a single-period context. Special focus is placed on a minimum revenue guarantee, a direct cash subsidy, and a subsidized subordinated debt. This paper shows that a guarantee reduces the cost of debt and can increase or decrease the cost of equity depending on the leverage, while a subsidy increases only the cost of equity. A subsidized subordinated debt increases both the cost of senior debt and the cost of equity. For all cases, all the supports improve the NPV because the expected increase of ROE can more than sufficiently offset any change in the cost of equity. This paper is of interest to academics because it provides the theoretical analysis of how a support can affect the rates of return expected by debt and private equity investors from risky and, probably, infeasible privately financed infrastructure projects. Practitioners, particularly those from the public sector, can also benefit from research findings that may inform decision makers about what support to provide.

J	Xiong, W; Zhang, XQ				Xiong, Wei; Zhang, Xueqing			The Real Option Value of Renegotiation in Public-Private Partnerships	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Renegotiation; Real options; Contracting	INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; TRANSACTION COSTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; OWNERSHIP; CONCESSIONS; PROJECTS; RISK; GAME	Public-private partnerships (PPP) are contracts with a long-lasting period, huge relationship-specific investment, and great uncertainties. In many PPP projects, it is difficult or even impossible to write a complete contract that specifies all contingencies, so a renegotiation-allowed contract could be better than a renegotiation-proof one. Under a renegotiation-allowed PPP agreement, renegotiations can significantly influence the interests of both the private party and the government, so they have to evaluate the benefit and cost of renegotiations ex ante and consider them in the tender price. This study considers renegotiations as real options that are embodied to provide flexibilities for PPP contracts, and develops a model to capture the value of renegotiation based on real option theory. The model is proposed in three steps, including modeling underlying risk, bargaining renegotiation payoffs, and determining real option value. An illustration case is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model. The case study shows that if a renegotiation-allowed contract is used, then (1)contractor-led renegotiation is very likely to occur, especially at the early stage of concession while government-led renegotiation is less likely to occur, and if any, it should occur at the middle stage of concession; (2)one party could use opportunistic renegotiation to hold the other party up and ask for excessive compensation, so renegotiations must be regulated; and (3)renegotiation in a PPP project may have a huge real option value, and the higher the uncertainty, the higher the renegotiation value.

Despite the increasing attention on the role of the construction industry in disaster resilience, CSR reporting on resilience issues among construction practitioners has yet to be explored. The present study adopted the concept of disaster risk management and stakeholder theory and first established a CSR-resilience evaluation framework with 20 resilience issues and 46 indicators through a modified Delphi technique. Thereafter, a sample of 295 international contractors was selected from the Engineering News-Record (ENR) list from 2014 to 2018, and a systematic content analysis approach was conducted to analyze their CSR-related reports and compare the corresponding results among regions. Results indicated that Asian and Middle Eastern contractors have the highest and lowest levels, respectively, of CSR reporting on resilience issues. Clients' and governments' concerns were given the top priority by all regions, except Chinese contractors emphasized the client's and community's concerns. Asian and Chinese contractors showed a higher emphasis on the community's and employees' concerns than those of partners and suppliers, whereas the European, US/Canadian, and Middle Eastern contractors showed otherwise. The present study contributed to filling in the gap to establish a CSR-resilience indicator system for the construction industry and provided a useful reference to comprehensively understand and measure the CSR reporting on resilience issues by the construction industry.

Pursuing "Fit for Purpose": An Industry Practioner's Experience With Roadmapping	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tools; Organizations; Power industry; Standards organizations; Technological innovation; Data visualization; electric utility; government; maturity model; roadmapping; university-industry collaboration	TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; SECTOR	Since 2006, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Technology Innovation (TI) Office has applied roadmapping processes to help articulate the federal wholesale electric utility's technology research agenda. The TI Office team has evolved its tools, templates, and process steps considerably over the years in response to implementation challenges, shortcomings in deliverables derived from the process, and maturation opportunities enabled by data management and visualization software. Practioners within the TI Office have sustained their commitment to roadmapping during an era of significant evolution of the practice within industry and academia. The practice came out of product manufacturing environments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Increasingly since the early 2000s, roadmapping has been applied outside this "traditional" realm, requiring trial, iteration, and customization of processes, tools, and deliverables to meet different requirements. The TI Office's use of roadmapping is one "nontraditional" variant because the agency is not in the business of generating profits by creating products in response to market demands. Instead, the TI Office has used roadmapping to communicate the agency's technology research, development, and demonstration agenda to the broader community-national laboratories, universities, manufacturers, etc.-so these external organizations can respond with proposals delivering products with the desired technology characteristics. These products, in turn, enable BPA to continue to fulfill its public service mission as an electric utility and government entity in providing safe, cost-effective, and reliable electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

The study adopted the qualitative research approach to meet the study objectives and aims. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to interview participants from emerging contractors with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Grading one (1) to four (4) in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. Qualitative content analysis for the collected data by grouping the responses into themes and frequency and percentage derived for the various themes. The main findings of the study revealed that the challenges affecting emerging contractors are the lack of financial support from the commencement of projects and during project execution; the extraordinary level of competition among the pool of emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client which have impacted their business operations. The study was done on emerging construction companies that are in the Gauteng Province of South Africa only, but the results may be applicable in other provinces, even beyond South Africa. The empirical results confirmed that the challenges and risk factors which have been identified as lack of financial support from financial institutions in the initial stage of projects and during project execution; high level of competition among emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client faced by emerging contractors have an impact on their operations and sustainable growth in the construction industry.

This trend has become known as the new governance'. This paper brings together 50 new-governance instruments to understand better this new governance for low-carbon buildings, and what may be expected from it. It finds that new-governance instruments fall short in exactly the same areas as do traditional instruments. It argues for a change in the application of new-governance instruments along three paths to improve their performance.

Our typology is founded on two key variables: [1] the proximity of the target and [2] the capacity to generate projects. We can then identify four distinct models of PPP: situational, elementary, symbiotic, and forward-looking. The management challenges, the risks, and the major issues particular to each type of PPP are described in order to enlighten management teams and contribute to the production of useful knowledge in the field.

The authors hope that Chinese constructors will learn from this case study. This article assesses the political risk for Chinese contracted projects at three levels and studies their countermeasures to this emergency and the effects of political risks on Chinese constructors in Libya. The research finds that Chinese constructors are not good at political risk management due to their traditional attitudes toward risk and the attitudes of the Chinese government toward overseas losses of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, Chinese SOEs are more experienced than private-owned enterprises in dealing with emergencies.

J	Murguia, D; Demian, P; Soetanto, R				Murguia, Danny; Demian, Peter; Soetanto, Robby			Systemic BIM Adoption: A Multilevel Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM) adoption; User; Firm; Project coalition; Systemic innovation; Middle-out diffusion	BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; ACCEPTANCE; ANTECEDENTS; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; DIFFUSION	Systemic innovations require multiple interdependent actors to change their practices simultaneously in order to realize the benefits of the innovation. Building information modeling (BIM) has been classified as a systemic innovation that is adopted by building projects, firms, and users. However, the slow diffusion of BIM in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector has maintained the gap between BIM visions and actual BIM practice. Some governments are planning to enact policies to promote BIM adoption in construction. However, in some countries, BIM adoption has already started with large construction organizations (i.e., the middle-out diffusion approach). To learn from previous experience and before enacting top-down interventions, policymakers require a model to stimulate systemic BIM adoption for entire supply chains with fragmented project and organizational structures. The current paper investigates the systemic adoption of digital innovations in construction and is aimed at formulating a model of systemic BIM adoption (MSBA). Three primary datasets consisting of 133 BIM users, 30 chief executive officers, and 20 project managers were collected in Peru and collectively analyzed using cross-classified multilevel modeling (CCMM). It was found that MSBA has five user-, three firm-, and two project-level factors, explaining 28%, 75%, and 50% of the variance in users' BIM adoption, respectively. The proposed model would provide useful guidance for corporate decision makers and government policymakers to develop BIM-diffusion policies to accelerate adoption. It would also provide a useful practical implementation framework as the industry progresses toward a digital mode of working and could underpin further digitalization of the sector worldwide.

This research seeks to answer three questions: first, what KSAEs are required in a team operating under RC, second, which of the identified KSAEs are more important to enable an integrated team to perform effectively and third, how do these required KSAEs correspond to the major role clusters identified in Belbin's team role model? Design/methodology/approach In-depth interviews with 25 experts and key management representatives in infrastructure construction in Australia were conducted to enable detailed discussion of the research questions. Findings Sixteen behavioural traits and four knowledge and experience areas were identified. The findings highlight that in RC, team members and especially leaders and managers need to be competent in people-oriented roles, above all others. Research limitations/implications This research mainly captured the perspectives of personnel working in state government infrastructure departments. Further research is recommended to explore the perceptions of employees in private construction companies. Practical implications By aligning the roles required for RC with the team role clusters of the Belbin's team roles assessment tool, this study will be useful for identifying suitable members to form high-performance project teams. Originality/value The findings of this paper can inform government infrastructure organisations and construction companies as to which roles are more critical when selecting fit-for-purpose teams to successfully deliver large infrastructure projects procured under the RC method.

However, an asymmetry of information and conflicts of interest exists between the government and the private sector. The moral hazard and the opportunistic behaviors of the private sector present significant challenges to the operational efficiency of UWETP-PPP. To encourage the private sector to operate UWETP-PPP with its real capability and further improve and supplement the incentive contracts, the reputation theory is introduced in this study to design the incentive mechanism of UWETP-PPP in a contract to integrate short-term incentives with long-term incentives and finally to realize a win-win situation between two parties. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) A two-period dynamic incentive model for UWETP-PPP is constructed by introducing a reputation mechanism. (2) The effective conditions for exerting the reputation incentive effects are explored to realize the government's effective incentive to the private sector. (3) The incentive effects of the explicit and implicit reputation incentive on the private sector are analyzed, and the incentive models with and without reputational concerns are compared. (4) The change rules of the private sector's effort level and marginal incentive coefficient with the change in related variables that affect the model are revealed. The incentive contract of UWETP-PPP can be optimized using the proposed dynamic reputation incentive mechanism. This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners concerned with the design of incentive contracts.

The transportation of agricultural products in Thailand relies mainly on roads because of its extensive network and convenience. However, with the limited capacity, traffic congestion, air pollution, and high fuel prices, this transportation mode becomes less effective. The government, then, attempts to develop and promote multimodal transportation, especially rail and water modes, to reduce the logistics costs and increase the transportation network efficiency. This study extracts five key factors influencing multimodal transportation efficiency of agricultural products in Thailand, namely Multimodal Transportation Infrastructure, Operation, Multimodal Service Provider, Market, and Road Constraints factors, as well as examines their interrelationships using the structural equation modeling method. The results show significant direct and indirect relationships among the five key multimodal transportation efficiency factors. It is found that with better multimodal transportation-related operations, multimodal transportation market is improved through less use of road transportation and more multimodal service providers in the market. Moreover, policymakers should focus on improving multimodal transportation-related infrastructures, such as container yards, access roads to train station and port, and transshipment equipment, in order to increase multimodal transportation efficiency and encourage the use of multimodal transportation. Engineering managers can use the study results in decision-making of transportation mode selection. Policymakers in government sector may apply the study results to establish effective policies to achieve a sustainable transportation system, which, in turn, gives rises to national industrial competitiveness on a global scale.

Design/methodology/approach The approach has been to marshal the extant literature about the construction industry, construction industry productivity and the economic value of the built environment. Whilst there are many lenses that are used to understand the industry, different ways to measure productivity performance and differing practices between nations, it has been determined that construction industry productivity improvement significantly lags behind other industries. Findings There is a strong argument that construction productivity improvement correlates to advances in a nation's economy. Nonetheless, it is the decisions about the nature of infrastructure, the standardisation of infrastructure and the effect upon labour productivity that will have the greatest implications for a nation's economic future. These economic improvements will be inhibited by legacy infrastructure, particularly in densely populated areas. If substantial innovation occurs, the nations currently holding the highest stock of infrastructure might be economically constrained. Research limitations/implications The construction industry is highly fragmented and has the uncertainties of a cyclic industry. It is, therefore, necessary for governments to identify standards and facilitate innovation. The implications for short- and long-term economic performance require that the industry is a fundamental at the highest level of government. Originality/value Scholars can use the propositions to further analyse construction productivity improvement and the provision of different types of infrastructure with regard to a nation's economic performance. Hypotheses are offered to support future research.

Meanwhile the capacity of the Chinese government to provide public services on its own in an effective and efficient way is being questioned and reassessed at various levels. Accordingly, the involvement of private investors in the development of Metropolitan Transportation Systems (MTS) has been promoted by the Chinese public sector by means of adopting the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. However, China's dynamic and complex political, financial, legal and regulatory environment makes the private sector adjust to accommodate the existing regime by way of understanding the driving factors in PPP applications for improving the chances of project success. This paper presents two case studies in China's MTS. Based on a case study and comprehensive literature review, 15 driving factors associated with PPP projects from the perspective of the Chinese public sector have been identified. A structured questionnaire survey targeting the public sector has been conducted to seek, analyze and integrate its perception of the driving factors. Through statistical analysis of the relative significance of each of these driving factors, the writers determined five common major dimensions of the Chinese public sector's purpose in developing PPP schemes, and the key factors that quantify each purpose. The establishment of the measures for these objectives and the key factors that quantify each of these purposes will likely be useful in encouraging private participation in infrastructure management and directing/concentrating efforts of the private sector to deliver quality public services under mutually beneficial long-term contractual arrangements.

Design/methodology/approach Building on studies that have questioned the dominant framing of the limited adoption of green construction as an inefficient behaviour, this study proposes a theoretical model characterising the two problems in the decision-making process that boost the reluctance of building construction stakeholders to embrace green construction. A traditional literature review, combining deductive and inductive approaches was employed. Findings The theoretical model consists of six conceptual variables as follows: social norms, personal dilemma, trust, loss aversion, self-interest and green construction adoption. The expected relationships between them are also provided. Research limitations/implications The theoretical model has not been empirically tested; however, it can be replicated or adapted for empirical investigation in any context. Practical implications This study may help in identifying which factors must be given attention in policy-making in order to promote the adoption of green technologies and practices. Specifically, subjecting the theoretical model to empirical test will reveal the strongest paths that can be used to curtail the reluctance of the industry to embrace green construction. Originality/value Contributes towards the current research agenda on the reasons for the low level of voluntary adoption of green construction. It also provides theoretical answers to the questions regarding the limited impact of the plentiful policy mechanisms instituted by governments around the world to promote green construction adoption.

J	Heshmati, A; Rashidghalam, M				Heshmati, Almas; Rashidghalam, Masoomeh			Measurement and Analysis of Urban Infrastructure and Its Effects on Urbanization in China	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Urbanization; Multidimensional index; Composite index; Principal component analysis; Urban infrastructure; Chinese provinces	DETERMINANTS; MIGRATION; INDEXES	This paper studies urbanization in China using composite indices of urban infrastructure. It has two objectives. First, it computes a multidimensional composite index of urban infrastructure for ranking 31 provinces and six regions in China by their level of urbanization and infrastructure development during the period 2005-2014. The infrastructure index is composed of 15 components: consumption, culture, economic, education, employment, environment, finance, human development, health, housing, social security, social services, technology, transport, and utilities. Second, the paper estimates the effects of the aggregate urban infrastructure index and its underlying components on urbanization levels. Our empirical results suggest that provincial and regional disparities are significant and allocations for urban infrastructure are not balanced between the different provinces and regions. Guangdong and Tibet have the highest and lowest values of urban infrastructure respectively while the Eastern and Southeastern regions have the highest and lowest urbanized populations, respectively. One policy implication of these results is that each province should implement a different urbanization plan based on its own characteristics and the resources available. The central government should improve the allocation of resources and the location of key industries between poor and rich provinces. Our estimation results indicate that the economics, employment, human development, health, housing, security, utilities, and technology components of urban infrastructure had positive and significant effects on China's urbanization. We suggest that the government should guide investments to more efficient transportation systems that include all age cohorts. After discussing the findings and how they are reached, this paper concludes by providing policy recommendations for city planners and policymakers.

To investigate which success criteria are important to public project managers, the authors interviewed 26 Dutch project managers who are employed by the government and who are responsible for managing infrastructural projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this research the Q-methodology is applied. Q-methodology helps to find for correlations between subjects across a sample of variables. Q-factor analysis reduces the individual viewpoints down to a few factors. A factor can be seen as the mathematical representation of an "average" perspective shared by a group of people. Findings - Findings are based on the individual rankings of 19 success criteria; the authors distinguished three common perspectives: the holistic and cooperative leader, the socially engaged, ambiguous manager and the executor of a top-down assignment. In none of the perspectives the iron triangle criteria formed the top three to measure project success. Research limitations/implications - The research results may have a national character. The way project success is perceived by public project managers may be culture dependent. For this the authors expand the research to other countries in the near future. Practical implications - This paper contributes to the understanding of the public project manager by their private collaboration partners, like consultants, engineers and contractors. This will help them to understand their client and contribute to better collaboration in projects. Originality/value - This paper shows that the difference in work attitude and value frame in the public sector leads to a specific view on project success.

Concession contracts, which govern the behavior of the participants in the partnership, often contain a Right of First Action (RoFA) clause. The holder of this clause has the right, but not the obligation, to invest in altering the project in some way. The RoFA is linked to design flexibility, which can be built into the megaproject public-private partnership's initial blueprint as a way to increase private-sector interest and preserve public- sector value for money. This research shows that the inclusion of a RoFA can create an additional stream of potential cash flows to the project; these cash flows constitute an asset that exists in addition to the primary revenues expected upon project completion. The additional asset can be offered to the private partner, augmenting the value of the project, or it can be held by the public sector until certain conditions are met. The value of the asset can be determined using a real options approach. To illustrate the approach, a case study on the Batoka Gorge Hydropower Dam, a 2,400-MWfacility on the Zambezi River, which divides Zambia and Zimbabwe, is undertaken. The framework extends existing research on contract design to offer a specific valuation application that will be especially useful to government agencies that are seeking to enhance the competitiveness of their bidding processes and create durable contracts of lasting value.

In addition, international construction project risks are highly interdependent. The objectives of this study are to (1) explore the risk paths in the international construction projects performed by Chinese contractors, and (2) examine the risk effects on the objectives of these projects. To achieve the research objectives, a total of 60 risks were identified from literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 104 professionals from Chinese international contractors. Adopting the structural equation modeling technique, this study proposed a networking of 20 significant risk paths. Specifically, host government-related risk, contractor's lack of experience, and contractors' lack of managerial skills had significant effect on project cost, quality, and schedule objectives, respectively. Moreover, host government-related risk affected project cost performance indirectly through resource price fluctuation, and contractors' lack of managerial skills affects project schedule objective indirectly through decrease in productivity. This study contributes to the literature because it is different from most of the previous studies, which depended on separate risk categories and generic checklists but failed to explore the potential interrelationships among risks in international construction projects. Additionally, the identification of risk path scenarios enables practitioners to gain a better understanding of the sources and impact areas of risks, and to better deal with the risks, thereby contributing to the practice.

J	Kalutara, P; Zhang, GM; Setunge, S; Wakefield, R				Kalutara, Pushpitha; Zhang, Guomin; Setunge, Sujeeva; Wakefield, Ron			Decision-making model for sustainable management of Australian community buildings: combined approach using analytical hierarchy process and neuro-fuzzy system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Australian community buildings; sustainable management; decision-making model; AHP; NFS; sustainability index	PROJECTS; AHP	Community buildings such as childcare/ aged care centres, sports pavilions possesses a massive investment in Australian economy built up over generations. From one viewpoint, they are providing essential services to the community and another viewpoint, the delivery of those services is limited by the ongoing degradation of the structural and service components of buildings, the scarcity of resources and the lack of funding by state and federal governments. This poses a huge challenge to Australian local governments to sustainably manage community buildings accountable to them. Reaching the goal takes further away by the absence of a holistic decision-making model for sustainable management of Australian community buildings. This study approaches the problem holistically identifying the sustainable decisions to be made through triple bottom line (environment, economic and social) and functional aspects. Incorporation of the influencing factors of each aspect led to a comprehensive decision-making structure which was the base for developing an effective decision-making model. The design of the model is based on the combination of two analytical methods namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neuro Fuzzy System (NFS). The final output of the model computes the sustainability index which interprets the total sustainability impact of a given building component. This enables building asset managers to utilise the index to prioritise the maintenance tasks of all building components.

The role of institutions is examined as a fundamental ingredient for sustainable urbanization in a Chinese perspective. The context within which China's urbanization is proceeding is analysed and the urbanization progress is briefly reviewed. The contradictions exposed in the urbanization progress are identified and the institutional defects behind these problems are analysed: the over-reliance on gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator, inappropriate assessment systems for local government, the urban-rural dual structure, the legal system, and building regulations. It is concluded that China's urbanization progress is too fast to be sustainable and that accomplishing sustainable urbanization in developing countries, particularly during their transformational period, cannot be best understood in terms of technical and monetary factors. Instead, the urbanization process can be formulated within a context of institutional innovation. Essential institutional innovations at both the central and local government levels are required: improving the performance appraisal system to regulate officials' behaviour; reforming the dual socio-economic system to cure 'town-country syndrome'; strengthening the legal system to bring it more in line with the requirements of a market-oriented economy; and revising building codes and standards to implement green plans and programmes. The 'scientific perspective of development' proposed by China's new national leadership indicates a break from an overwhelming emphasis on GDP growth, and is expected to provide a multifaceted approach giving impetus to a more sustainable approach to urbanization.

J	Yabuki, N; Miyashita, K; Fukuda, T				Yabuki, Nobuyoshi; Miyashita, Kyoko; Fukuda, Tomohiro			An invisible height evaluation system for building height regulation to preserve good landscapes using augmented reality	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Augmented reality; Landscape preservation; Invisible height; Building height regulation		Preserving good landscapes such as historical buildings, temples, shrines, churches, bridges, and natural sceneries is important. Recently, destruction of good landscapes from multiple viewpoints due to construction of high rise buildings has been reported. To regulate structures such as high rise buildings and high voltage transmission towers, the government or public agencies have established or are going to constitute height regulations for building and structures surrounding the location of interest. In order to check whether some portions of high structures are visible or not behind the locations of interest from multiple viewpoints, it is necessary to make a 3D model representing geography, existing structures and natural objects using 3D CAD or Virtual Reality (VR) software. However, it usually takes much time and cost to make such a 3D model. Thus, in this research, we propose a new method using Augmented Reality (AR). In this method, a number of 3D virtual rectangular objects with a scale are located on the grid of 3D geographical model. And then, the CG models are displayed in an overlapping manner with the actual landscape from multiple viewpoints using the AR technology. The user measures the maximum invisible height for each rectangular object at a grid point. Using the measured data, the government or public agencies can establish appropriate height regulation for all surrounding areas of the locations of interest. To verify the proposed method, we developed a system deploying ARToolKit and applied it to the Convention Center of Osaka University, deemed as a scenic building. We checked the performance of the system and evaluated the error of the obtained data. In conclusion, the proposed method was evaluated feasible and effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A variety of rating systems have been developed to assess the sustainability of a construction project. In Hong Kong, BEAM Plus is the most preferred system among the practitioners, however, its implementation is slow due to industry and policy-level challenges. While scholarly works relating to the performance and assessment factors of rating schemes have been conducted, limited efforts have been made towards the investigation of the challenges to the implementation of BEAM Plus. This research, therefore, conducted a thorough investigation to identify the challenging factors, and potential policies to encourage the use of BEAM Plus among construction stakeholders. A comparison of BEAM Plus with leading green building assessment schemes is made and the current policies regarding the implementation of these schemes in Hong Kong and other countries are discussed. Questionnaire surveys and expert interviews were conducted to validate the challenges and potential policies. The collected data is studied using Analytical Hierarchy Process and the responses from the interviews are found to mostly aligned with the AHP results. It is found that 'high initial cost' is the most critical factor affecting the application of BEAM Plus whereas 'shortage of green building experts' is the least important concern. The study revealed that 'gross floor area concession' is the most attractive policy whereas the effectiveness of the 'assessment fee subsidy' is insignificant. It is also disclosed that significant changes are required in existing policies such as gross floor areas should be granted on the level of green achievements instead of only registering for the scheme.

J	Gambo, N; Said, I; Ismail, R				Gambo, Nuru; Said, Ilias; Ismail, Radzi			Comparing the levels of performance of small scale local government contractors in Northern Nigeria with international practice	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management effectiveness; Construction management; Performance management; Performance measures; Performance monitoring	CONSTRUCTION; DELAYS; BENCHMARKING; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; TIME	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance levels of small scale local government contractors (SSLGCs) in northern part of Nigeria with international practice. Previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. This continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like Nigeria. There is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. A questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The contractors' performance was compared by using ANOVA with post hoc. Findings - The results indicated that the SSLGCs in Nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to SSLGCs in northern part of Nigeria. Practical implications - The study provided the criteria for evaluation of SSLGCs' performance in Nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. Social implications - The study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in Nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. Originality/value - This study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry.

It involves the determination of tariff magnitude, the choice of tariff structure, and the design of adjustment mechanisms. Tariff structures can be an all-in tariff or a compound tariff. Tariff adjustment mechanisms can be used to address different risk factors such as inflation, exchange rate, demand, and fuel prices. An appropriate combination of tariff structure and adjustment mechanism can be effective to manage key risks of privately financed infrastructure projects. Simulation results show that a well-designed tariff can create a "win-win" solution for both project promoter and the host government.

Project risk management is relatively mature. However, the programme risk management body of knowledge is still evolving. This paper presents empirical evidence from the UK public sector highlighting the risks that are common to or amplified by working in programmes. In the main, these risks are associated with changes in government policy, diverse stakeholder aspirations and the challenges of multiple project procurement. These risks relate to the role of programme management in providing the link between individual projects and their strategic context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

However, selection of the best green design is a decision-making process that is not easy to address. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular and comprehensive tool to accomplish the objective. Nevertheless, LCA is a time-consuming process that requires substantial resources and expertise. This research proposes an innovative approach to performing structured LCA in conjunction with the concept known as fuzzy analytical hierarchical process. In doing so, some of the disadvantages of LCA can be remedied and this provides a practical tool for performing LCA.

Evaluating real options for mitigating technical risk in public sector R&D acquisitions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Real options; Management of science/technology; Project management; Optimization; Public sector public acquisition; Dynamic programming	DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY	Government acquisitions requiring R&D efforts are fraught with uncertainty. The risks are often mitigated by employing a multi-stage competition, with multiple vendors funded initially, until a single successful vendor is selected. While decision-makers recognize they are using a real options approach, analytical tools are often unavailable to evaluate optimal decisions. We present an efficient stochastic dynamic programming approach that public sector acquisition managers can use to determine optimal vendor selection strategies in those competitions where Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are the measure of progress. We then use examples to demonstrate the proposed approach and provide illustrative numerical results. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

It is still a relatively new form of procurement that requires a wide range of specialist advice during the bidding stage and in-depth knowledge of how the facility will perform in the long term. This paper investigates the level of participation in PFI projects in the United Kingdom, the opportunities available for the construction sector, the types of problems experienced, and the challenges for the future. It achieves this by analyzing the results of a questionnaire survey of a large number of client and construction organizations. The study finds that there is a wide gap in the level of PFI experience between different PFI projects.

A time-distancebased cost (time cost) function was proposed to compare China Railway Express with traditional transportation modes. Time cost was related to different types of cargoes, which exhibit distinct sensitivity to time. Using the proposed cost function as basis, we identified the cost indifference area where total costs are equal. Further analysis was performed for selecting the transportation mode and supply area for a specific cargo.

A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to understand the opportunities, performance and constraints of such programmes. Building on a series of 20 voluntary programmes in Australia, the Netherlands and the United States (including a series of 101 original interviews), the analysis finds that the majority of these have not succeeded in incentivizing their participants to take meaningful action. Insights are presented into why the majority of these programmes have underperformed, and what binds together the small number of programmes that have achieved positive results.

P.			Application of a bottom-up approach to estimate economic impacts of building maintenance projects: cladding rectification program in Australia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building maintenance; Economic impact analysis; Bottom-up approach; Wider economic benefits		Purpose This paper critically reviews economic impact assessment methods adopted in construction-related projects, to develop and present a novel bottom-up approach suitable to estimate regional economic impacts of building maintenance projects. Design/methodology/approach A thorough literature review of economic impact assessment in construction projects is carried out to identify the most relevant approach to estimate wider economic impacts of building maintenance projects. Based on these findings, a model based on the bottom-up approach to estimate wider economic impacts is developed. The applicability and face validity of the developed model is demonstrated through a case of cladding replacement program in Australia. Findings The literature review revealed that bottom-up models are better suited for estimating regional economic impacts of maintenance projects, given the challenges of obtaining micro-level economic data in the maintenance sector. In relation to the total economic impacts (direct and indirect), the results show that for every $1 of government spending on similar projects the Gross State Product would increase by $1.34. In terms of employment impact, over 70% of the direct economic value addition is driven by the increase in labour, where close to 3 FTE jobs will be required for each $1 million of spending on cladding replacement projects. Originality/value This paper presents a model to estimate the wider economic impacts of building maintenance projects, which is typically overlooked in the construction management field. The proposed model is developed to incorporate the variability of different building maintenance projects so that the economic impact resulting from these projects could be estimated more accurately.

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV): costs, benefits, risks, barriers and improvement strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						risk; stakeholder; cost-benefit; construction; barrier; supply chain strategy; building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV)	OF-THE-ART; RENEWABLE ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; CONSTRUCTION; POLICY; OPTIONS; DESIGN; CHINA	Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) refers to photovoltaic or solar cells that are integrated into the building envelope (such as facade or roof) to generate 'free' energy from sunshine, and it is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide. However, up until now, there have been limited studies that analysed cost-benefit and risk factors/barriers of BIPV from a supply chain perspective; and there have also been limited studies that provide strategies to industry and academics in order to encourage BIPV diffusion and application. The aim of this research is to identify the costs, benefits and risks of BIPV and propose suggestions for greater BIPV application, from a stakeholder perspective, through a comprehensive review of current literature. The results of this research show that whilst BIPV have high initial investment capital costs, there are significant long-term benefits to be achieved for clients, end users and the entire society. Further, the results also show that BIPV costs decrease and government policy support and incentives are required in order to promote wider BIPV application. In addition, this research has identified the fact that there was a lack of detailed BIPV cost data (including individual component costs) and lack of methods for BIPV cost-benefit analysis, and there are risks and barriers in BIPV applications. Following this, this research provides a strategic framework and a number of suggestions to industry stakeholders for integration and collaboration within the BIPV supply chain in order to facilitate the cost reduction of BIPV. Finally, this study proposes several topics for future research. It is anticipated that the results presented in this paper have implications not only for government policy and product development and application, but also for academic research.

In this regard, they have been much studied. However, due to their long concession period, running into decades, few have run their full course into the transfer phase (TP) in which the PPP concession reverts from the private entity back to the public. In China, this is about to change as many PPPs approach their TP. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to comprehensively investigate the TP of PPPs in China. Design/methodology/approach A three-part methodology was undertaken to achieve the research purpose. Extensive literature review was first conducted to analyze the status quo of the transfer management regime in China, followed by the identification of critical challenges and the exploration of solutions via studying the TP of the Chengdu No. 6 Water Plant B Project - the first PPP in China's water sector to reach the TP. Research procedures and outcomes were hierarchically visualized by using Integration DEFinition language 0 (IDEF0) method. Findings The current transfer management regime of PPPs in China's water sector is deficient in many aspects. Based on the insight into the practice, a generic transfer process model with hierarchical structure process and sub-processes serving as a dynamic framework transfer model with self-evolving nature is developed to facilitate the successful transfer of the PPP utility. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically probe the TP of PPPs. Hopefully, the findings of this paper are to instruct government and PPP practitioners alike on mechanisms for smoothing the TP of further PPP projects ending their concession period.

J	Chen, ZS; Fang, L; Wang, HM				Chen, Zhisong; Fang, Li; Wang, Huimin			Internal incentives and operations strategies for the water saving supply chain with cap-and-trade regulation	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						water-saving supply chain; equilibrium coordination; internal incentive; cap and trade regulation	IRRIGATION SYSTEMS	Faced with the rapid development of modern industries of agriculture, manufacturing, and services, water resources are becoming increasingly scarce. Industries with high water consumption are generally regulated by the government's water cap-and-trade (CAT) regulation to solve the contradiction between the limited water supply and the rapid growing water demand. Supply chain equilibrium and coordination models under the benchmark scenario without water saving and CAT regulation, water saving supply chain equilibrium and coordination models under the scenario without/with CAT regulation are developed, analyzed and compared. The corresponding numerical and sensitivity analyses for all models are conducted and compared, and the managerial insights and policy recommendations are summarized in this article. The results indicate that (1) Conducting water saving could improve effectively the operational performance of the water-saving supply chain under the scenario without/with CAT regulation. (2) The coordination strategy based on the revenue sharing contract could efficiently coordinate the water-saving supply chain, enhance water consumption reduction rate, and improve the operational performance of the water-saving supply chain. (3) The implementation of CAT regulation enhances effectively water-consumption reduction in the water-saving supply chain and improves the operational performance of water-saving supply chain. (4) Simultaneous implementation of CAT regulation by the government and adopting coordination strategy by the water-saving supply chain would be superior to any other scenarios/strategies. (5) A suitable water cap based on the industrial average water consumption and historical water consumption data are beneficial for constructing reasonable and effective incentive mechanism. (6) A higher marginal trade price could induce more reduction in water consumption and create better operational performance for the manufacturer and water-saving supply chain, both under the equilibrium and coordination strategies.

However, their motivation for effective delivery of green building projects is currently unknown due to limited studies on the subject. Therefore, this study investigated project owners' motivation for delivering green building projects by surveying 150 Green Star Accredited Professionals (GSAPs), who are the representatives of project owners' interests in delivering green building projects in the Australian building sector. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and thereafter confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), findings revealed that project owners' drivers of motivation for delivering green building projects can be classified into internal (INT) and external (EXT) motivation factors. The internal ones comprise improved quality of life, pro-environmental altruism, enhanced reputation, and persuasive influence, while the external ones comprise market appeal and financial and nonfinancial incentives provided by the government. The INT is more important than the EXT, but both are complementary of one another in driving the delivery of green building projects. The hypotheses that significant differences exist between public and private owners' motivation, and commercial and noncommercial owners' motivation for delivering green building projects are rejected. Thus, the theoretical position that INT and EXT complement rather than undermine one another is supported in this study. Furthermore, the comparison of this study with related studies in the United States indicates that the motivations for delivering green building projects are geographically different. In summary, this study has derived the factors of project owners' motivation for delivering green building projects. Project owners can rely on either or both of the factors combined for successful delivery of their own projects. The government can use the factors to identify appropriate policies to enact and implement to increase project owners' motivation for delivering green building projects in the building sector.

At present, the Taiwan central government prioritizes funding allocations primarily using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a methodology that permits the synthesizing of subjective judgments systematically and logically into objective consensus. However, due to the coopetition and heterogeneity of railway projects, the proper priorities of railroad projects could not be always evaluated by the AHP. The decision makers prefer subjective judgments to referring to the AHP evaluation results. This circumstance not only decreased the AHP advantages, but also raised the risk of the policies. A method to consider both objective measures and subjective judgments of project attributes can help reduce this problem. Accordingly, combining the AHP with the artificial neural network (ANN) methodologies would theoretically be a proper solution to bring a ranking predication model by creating the obscure relations between objective measures by the AHP and subjective judgments. However, the inconsistency between the AHP evaluation and subjective judgments resulted in the inferior soundness of the AHP/ANN ranking forecast model. To overcome this problem, this study proposes the data preprocessing method (DPM) to calculate the correlation coefficient value using the subjective and objective ranking incidence matrixes; according to the correlation coefficient value, the consistency between the AHP rankings and subjective judgments of railroad projects can be evaluated and improved, so that the forecast accuracy of the AHP/ANN ranking forecast model can also be enhanced. Based on this concept, a practical railroad project ranking experience derived from the Institute of Transportation of Taiwan is illustrated in this paper to reveal the feasibility of applying the DPM to the AHP/ANN ranking prediction model.

Evolutionary Stable Strategy for Postdisaster Insurance: Game Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Game theory; Evolutionary stable strategy; Insurance; Disaster management	MORAL HAZARD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; REINSURANCE; LOSSES; SYSTEM	Mitigation of the financial impacts associated with natural disasters is becoming an urgent objective at both the national and international levels, as the rate and magnitude of natural disasters are continuing to increase. Using an evolutionary game theory approach, this paper aims to find an equilibrium profile of postdisaster insurance plans purchased by resident families and sold by insurance companies, as well as ex-postdisaster relief implemented by a government agency. This dynamic integrated assessment minimizes the total losses for the three aforementioned associated stakeholders, thus maximizing welfare within natural disaster host community systems. To this end, the authors determined a plausible set of actions and utility functions for the associated stakeholders. Also, they created a hypothetical sample of 1,000 resident families accounting for heterogeneous income levels, three insurance companies offering three unique insurance plans per company-each with different premium and coverage-and two different types of government compensation plans for postdisaster damage mitigation. The proposed model was implemented on the NetBeans IDE 7.4 platform using the Java programming language for a hypothetical case study. The results indicate that (1) resident families tend to prefer insurance plans with the lowest premium value and coverage; (2) insurance plans with the most comprehensive coverage experienced the least demand; and (3) the evolutionary stable strategy is an oscillating line of chosen plans and insurers as a result of the stochastic and dynamics nature of the factors associated with disaster management. Currently, the authors are working to develop the model further to better account for simultaneous actions by all stakeholders (not only resident families), population growth, changes in financial and income standards, integrating input from available natural hazard prediction software systems (e.g., HAZUS-MH), and continuous data. Ultimately, this evolutionary game theory model will be tested on post-Hurricane Katrina data representing real-life physical damage in Hancock County, Mississippi.

J	Li, YX; Zhao, H; Ouyang, SS				Li, Yanxi; Zhao, Heng; Ouyang, Shanshan			Governance distance and the performance of cross-border private participation infrastructure projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Country governance; Distance; Private investment; Infrastructure projects; Greenfield investment; Competitive contract	STATE OWNERSHIP; COUNTRY; ACQUISITIONS; MARKET; PRIVATIZATION; STRATEGIES; LIABILITY; MERGERS; ENTRY; FIRMS	Purpose The privatization of infrastructure promotes efficiency and service standards. While cross-border private participation infrastructure (PPI) projects hosted in emerging markets have become more prevalent in recent years, there have also been more failures. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how governance distance affects the survival of cross-border PPI projects. Design/methodology/approach The authors provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence to verify our views. The authors test the hypotheses on a sample of 4,678 cross-border PPI project investments made in emerging market countries between 1990 and 2016. Estimation techniques consist of a binary logistic regression model and a rare events logistic model. Findings The findings suggest that increased governance distance can lead to project failure. The study results show that governance distance is negatively correlated with the probability of project survival. Greenfield investment intensifies the negative effect of governance distance while competitive contracts mitigate the negative effect of governance distance. Practical implications The results reveal that transnational investment in infrastructure projects is susceptible to institutional differences between home and host countries. Therefore, both private enterprises and host government should pay attention to the impact of inter-country differences on negotiations and project operation. Competitive contracts mitigate this negative effect, but entering in the form of greenfield investment amplifies the negative effect of distance. Originality/value Transnational industrial engineering projects are easily affected by the differences in governance levels between the two countries. This study introduces governance distance into the field of infrastructure projects, focusing on the impact of differences between home and host countries on transnational projects. The findings on infrastructure projects that are closely related to host government contribute to the literature by broadening the research of institution and distance.

Recent studies have shown that implementing the building information modelling (BIM) methodology can improve the working conditions at construction sites and during building maintenance. Therefore, the European Union is promoting the development of projects through BIM. The government of Spain has established a roadmap to enforce the development of projects with BIM, and the integration of occupational health and safety in projects developed with BIM in Spain must comply with the current regulations. This study proposes a methodology-consistent with the requirements stipulated by the Spanish health and safety regulations-for its integration in the design phase of building projects developed using BIM.

Singapore has formulated a set of integrated blueprints to guide its socio-economic development into the knowledge age. The nature of the knowledge-based economy and its implications for construction, along with Singapore's strategies for developing its construction industry, are examined, focusing on the development of the workforce, training and professionalism, as highlighted in the Construction 21 Report. It is suggested that construction firms should emphasize learning among their employees and formulate corporate strategies for human resource development and information technology implementation. A more effective partnership between government and industry is needed to implement the transition to a competitive, knowledge-based construction industry.

The article identifies seven key factors that explain the differences between expected benefits and the actual legacy. Identification of these factors contributes to the increasing academic interest in explaining the poor legacy outcomes of mega-events. In conclusion, we recommend that future host country governments defragment their stadium programs by establishing a World Cup Delivery Authority (WCDA), with responsibility for the leadership and coordination of the stadium program.

To advance understanding of such delicate balancing among multiple reference audiences, we adopt the lens of institutional theory to illustrate that PPPs inherently exhibit strong institutional complexity due to the presence of multiple institutional logics, making them organizationally challenging to manage. Our theoretical contribution includes the development of a set of propositions to form a conceptual model to explain not only why and how PPPs exhibit institutional complexity, but also how to respond to it through logic by combining strategies such as organizational hybridization.

This study systematically reviews 37 empirical studies on the precursors of industry catch-up in emerging countries. A general framework on what makes a successful catch-up in latecomer industries is suggested based on literature review. The framework comprises six generic determinants, including technological capability, business ecosystem, government roles, market condition, technological regime, and windows of opportunity. In addition, this framework is applied to the Chinese LED industry, and a case analysis of the catch-up is performed in Chinese LED firms.	[Guo, Bin; Ding, Peng; Greidanus, Frans J. A.

This paper analyzes the governance potential of major countries in the high-speed railway value chain and studies the feasible ways and development strategies to enhance the highspeed railway governance in China. Findings of this paper are as follows. First, the government, as the early manager of high-speed railway governance, has given way to Siemens and other integrated enterprises. Second, the highspeed railway standard output has become the core competitiveness that embodies high-speed railway. Third, the global high-speed railway market presents a hierarchical high-speed railway governance model and changes to a modular approach to governance.

In this paper, we explore the potential of applying the analytic network process (ANP) to evaluate transportation projects in Ningbo, China. ANP differs from traditional hierarchical analysis tools in that it allows feedback and interdependence among various decision levels and criteria. Compared with the conventional transportation evaluation methods, our model has incorporated a much wider range of long-term and short-term factors, which are classified into benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks. Tactical and operational issues are taken into consideration. The evaluation framework is comprehensive and flexible, and shows great potential for helping decision-makers and others concerned with the transportation decision-making process.

Application of IT is piecemeal, discrete and non-systematic. Managing information for construction projects is crucial in order to make good and full use of IT in the construction industry. This paper proposes a simplified model to achieve managing information for construction by utilising the ubiquitous Internet technologies. The openness of these technologies is receiving attention of not only academics and amateurs but also of business entities and government organisations. A database-web link is required in order to properly store, organise and archive information. Internet technologies can be adapted to a corporate Intranet or business Extranet. Experiencing the advantages of Internet technologies is crucial in order to avoid negative perceptions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Women in construction - Tapping the untapped resource to meet future demands	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A lack of skilled workers has become a global problem that is impacting the construction industry. To address the issue, the industry-working in partnership with government agencies-has developed programs to attract new workers for high-skill positions in construction. These workers include women and minorities. However, attracting women into a career field that is dominated by conflict and aggression is problematic. Consequently, the industry is making a significant effort to change their image and culture, and these efforts are being supported by professional associations, labor unions, and universities. This paper highlights the current status of women in construction trades, management, education, and research positions. The paper also identifies many of the challenges women face in the construction industry and the many opportunities and support networks that are available to help them succeed.

We have validated this method using cash flow analysis of a mid-size (14-megawatts) California PV utility. We assess the economic feasibility of the project using sensitivity analysis, and examine the removal of the financing barrier by proposing a self-sustaining finance scheme as a possible alternative to government's subsidy that lacks an inflow of cash to offset the outflow of subsidy payments. Furthermore, we highlight the scenarios in which the PV power becomes cost competitive with conventional electricity generation.

The limits and benefits from the client and user perspectives are also explored. The interest in using LCC approaches for economic evaluation of investment decisions is large. However, constraints exists at a number of levels: uncertainties related to the long term forecasts used, difficulties in achieving relevant input data and lack of experience in using LCC models, incentives for consultants and contractors. Nonetheless, the LCC perspective is proving to be most useful during the design phase where the possibilities of cost reductions related to operation and maintenance are large. LCC can provide motivation for environmental progressive building despite the sometime higher initial cost. The implication for expanding the use of LCC are considered for government, clients/developers, professionals.

How to apply the Systemic Lessons Learned Knowledge model to wire an organisation for the capability of storytelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Knowledge management; Storytelling; Lessons learned; Organisational learning; Action research	TACIT KNOWLEDGE	This study is an application of the Systemic Lessons Learned Knowledge (Syllk) model that enables management to conceptualise how organisational know-how for storytelling is wired (distributed) across various elements of an organisation. The research method consisted of action research cycles within a large division of a government organisation. Storytelling interventions and initiatives were implemented with two action research cycles completed. Actions and changes were observed, monitored, evaluated, and reflected on using an after action review process. This study has established that the alignment of the people and system elements (learning, culture, social, technology, process and infrastructure) can positively influence an organisation's capability for storytelling, and therefore learn lessons from stories of past project experiences.

However, the briefing stage of PPP projects has been largely overlooked, although it has a far-reaching influence throughout the project lifecycle. In response, this is rectified by exploring the critical factors involved. A set of 15 procurement-related factors are first identified from the existing literature. Then the effects of four background variables on the factors are tested with Hong Kong government data by an exploratory factor analysis extracting four major dimensions. The relationships between these dimensions and background variables indicate the need to take the background variables into account when ranking the factors. The ranking of the factors is then obtained by considering their weighted importance. Finally, the final practical value of the results is discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Our analysis of the evolution of thinking and practice among leading IT project managers across four countries elicits nine principles and four personal qualities that constitute the core of a mindset that facilitates rethinking the practice of IT project management. We compare this with the Rethinking Project Management research agenda [Winter M, Smith C, Morris P, Cicmil S. Directions for future research in Project management: the main findings of a UK government-funded research network. Int J Project Manage 2006; 24(8): 638-649.]. Our contribution is to (1) validate the directions defined in that agenda; (2) identify elements not incorporated in it and (3) provide examples that crystallise the agenda for the domain of IT project management.

J	Sharma, VK; Sharma, SK; Singh, AP				Sharma, Vijay Kumar; Sharma, Satyendra Kumar; Singh, Ajit Pratap			Risk enablers modelling for infrastructure projects using Bayesian belief network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Infrastructure projects; risk enabling factors; Bayesian belief network modelling	MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; COMPLEXITY; SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; OPERATIONS; IMPACT	Work in the area of risk assessment of infrastructure projects is full of different techniques; study on the risk management factors is non-existent. It is required because such risks of high impact paralyze the performance of infrastructure projects. Delay and cost overruns in infrastructure projects affect the society welfare at large. Because of this, the reputation of the government is at stake. This paper is an attempt to contribute to the risk enablers modelling, by first identifying major critical success factors for risk management and then finding cause-and-effect relationships between them for developing a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model. The analysis of this model and results determine relative importance of the critical success factors on which risk management efforts must be focused first to ensure that the project achieves objectives within the stipulated time and cost.

A Heat Transfer Model for Policy Diffusion	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Public Policy; Technology Policy; Diffusion; Heat Transfer; Policy Transfer; Technology Transfer	TECHNICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION DIFFUSION; SMALL BUSINESS; STATE; DETERMINANTS; NETWORKS; RACE	Government policy affects the competitiveness of engineering companies; however, the literature describes a landscape in which technical professionals are largely absent from the policy-making process, resulting in sub-optimal policy outcomes and compromised competitive stances. This article describes ongoing efforts to derive a framework for policy decision-making by engineering managers. The framework is based on the principles of heat and mass transfer. Specifically, models of heat transfer conduction, convection and radiation in the physical sciences, are used to describe policy transfer scenarios. An initial comparison of the model for conduction is made with the innovativeness model from public policy research, in the context of policy diffusion among U.S. states. We highlight limitations in the current model, the need for additional data, and the potential for improved specification in diffusion research.

J	Bygstad, B; Lanestedt, G				Bygstad, Bendik; Lanestedt, Gjermund			ICT based service innovation - A challenge for project management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Service innovation; Stakeholders; Project models		In this paper we investigate to what extent ICT based service innovation can be successfully facilitated by traditional project management thinking. Should service innovation initiatives be organized the same way as high-tech product innovation, i.e. with expert teams in well structured projects? Or should they be organized in some looser fashion, with more interaction with users and other stakeholders? Our empirical evidence is a survey of 130 public sector projects in Norway, run within a national e-government program. We find that ICT based service innovation is not associated with a tightly run project (focused on cost, time and quality) or a professional project manager. Rather, successful service innovation is found in projects with a strong integration with the service providing organization and the external users of the services. We discuss three alternative models as an agenda for further research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Bakens, IW				Bakens, IW			International trends in research and technology development - A changing environment for CIB	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						trends; R&D; research infrastructure; research management; international collaboration; CIB		The way in which research and technology development in building and construction is conducted in most industrialized countries is changing dramatically. Major changes include a reduced dependence on government support for R&D, the development of a partnership between the construction industry and the research community, internationalization of construction research as a market, the subsequent impact for national research programmes, increased international collaboration between national research organizations, and the impact of electronic communication. The changing role of CIB is discussed as positive response to these challenges, which include the changing composition of CIB's membership (from East Asia and North America), increased participation by industry, more focused CIB programmes which are closely aligned to industry's priorities, and new ways of creating international teams and working methods through the use of electronic participation.

However, achieving a robust and reliable workforce prediction is a constant challenge, as a variety of variables and factors must be considered. Despite various forecasting techniques and approaches being developed, government's worldwide continue to produce inaccurate forecasts and consequently fail to maintain the balanced workforce required to deliver infrastructure projects. To address this problem, a system dynamics (SD) model for the construction and civil engineering industry is developed, as traditional WP modeling approaches are static and unable to accommodate the changing complex dynamics that influence workforce supply and demand. The SD model is tested and used to formulate training policies that ensure workforce equilibrium and in turn, nurture sustainable infrastructure development.	[Sing, Michael C.

Given that many risks which are traditionally borne by the government get transferred to the private sector, careful risk allocation is considered to be the key to successful PPP projects. This paper focuses on the current risk allocation practice within Indonesia's water supply projects. The paper captures, presents and discusses the perceptions of both regulators and operators in the context of project risk criticality and allocation. Both parties consider non-availability of raw water is of paramount concern. However, survey findings highlight low-to-moderate levels of intra-group and inter-group agreement regarding the allocation of specific project risk factors. Thus, asserting that the issue of optimal risk allocation remains elusive. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

UK government departments have recorded that project complexity has increased significantly over the last decade and highlight that the subject has received inadequate attention, with a detrimental effect on project performance. However departments have not examined the characteristics of complexity or made a distinction between complexity emanating from the decisions made by the project itself and the complexity emanating from its context, as they warrant different treatment. By way of response, post examination and comparison of existing frameworks, a new framework is proposed based on a literature review. A case study is examined to illustrate how the framework may be applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

It is a contentious practice: Managers seek effective ways to monitor work, unions demand an end to the systems, and legislators debate the appropriate degree of control over the practice. Yet little is known about why certain applications or designs of electronic monitors are acceptable, while others are not. Quantitative and qualitative data from a survey of 1500 service workers demonstrated that four factors (tasks measured, frequency of measurement, object of measurement, recipient of data) can be altered to significantly affect the acceptability of a monitor design. A fifth significant factor was the perception that computers are appropriate evaluation devices in a given job. These findings can help businesses, unions, and governments understand how to design acceptable monitors.

The Chinese Government is developing policies to increase the amount of residential housing construction and the capital support for housing consumption. The housing industry is being used as a driver for economic growth and improved quality of life. In 1998 the multi-level housing system for different economic groups was introduced. The subsequent marker opportunities created by this move are explored. The scale of urban housing construction will increase significantly; the national economic growth rate based upon the housing industry is significant; the multi-level housing system is necessary for urban housing reform; the demand for urban housing will increase; the provision of housing will change to accommodate technological change and market reforms.

J	Riley, MJ; Clare-Brown, D				Riley, MJ; Clare-Brown, D			Comparison of cultures in construction and manufacturing industries	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper investigates and compares the culture found in a construction company with that found in two manufacturing companies because large differences in culture might reduce the potential for the construction sector to adopt management tools developed in the manufacturing sector. For the comparisons to be valid, the culture within the physical production process was observed. The results were obtained by use of questionnaires and intensive interviews with individual members of staff using a U.K. government sponsored questionnaire. A vertical section of each company was sampled such that equivalent organizational levels could be directly compared. The main findings are that the culture existing in construction has significant differences to that found within the manufacturing industries. It will not be possible to transfer management tools from one industrial sector to the other without substantial redesign. The culture within construction was found to be a "project culture" in comparison to manufacturing, which was found to be a "company culture".

Investments in infrastructure have increasingly been used to improve the infrastructure quality, thus stimulating trade and economic development in developing countries. Nevertheless, a number of infrastructure challenges faced by developing countries remains. This raises the question about the efficiency in the use of public investments in infrastructure. Based on the case of Vietnam, this paper identifies a number of deficiencies in the planning and policymaking process as well as in the implementation of infrastructure plans. This paper aims to show policymakers that the critical challenge faced by developing countries in infrastructure construction is thus not about the funding but should be more about effective planning and implementation for long-term benefits.

These projects managed by Sir Joseph William Bazalgette included the construction of the Main Drainage and the Thames Embankment and were facilitated through significant levels of government support, legislation and public funding, requiring the interaction of social, technical, political and environmental processes. They exhibited innovative forms of construction, estimating, partnership working and contracting. Two major conclusions may be drawn. Firstly, these successful projects and the work of Bazalgette and colleagues merit greater recognition in expanded accounts of project history. Secondly, there are real dangers in forgetting the prehistory of project management, a time when major projects were distrusted and perceived as invariably failing (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Carbon accounting; energy efficiency; project design decision	REDUCTION STRATEGIES; CONSTRUCTION; ENERGY; EMISSIONS; SECTOR	Carbon accounting allows for an estimation of the embodied carbon amount associated with the construction stage of project development. However, in Australia such practice is not mandatory. This research investigates if carbon accounting can affect decisions in building design. Semi-structured interviews of project managers were conducted in Melbourne, Australia. While respondents showed good understanding of energy efficiency and life-cycle costing, they appeared to have misconceptions about carbon accounting. The results of this study reveal more energy efficient building may also be more embodied carbon consuming to construct. Interviewees recognized a need for carbon accounting and suggested this would improve the scientific credibility of decision-making in building designs. However, unless required by the government regulations, carbon accounting may not attract the attention that may help drive better decisions in building designs.	[Wong, Peter S.

This research explored this assumption by testing whether the use of project management and IT skills have a positive affect on business' total sales and profitability. The research data was drawn from two longitudinal Government surveys of small to medium enterprises in Australia. Models were created to describe the relationship between project management, IT skills, profitability and total sales using multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression. The results show that when controlling for the influence of other business skills, project management and IT skills have a significant positive influence on sales and profitability.

J	Montazami, A; Nicol, F				Montazami, Azadeh; Nicol, Fergus			Overheating in schools: comparing existing and new guidelines	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptive thermal comfort; benchmarks; overheating; overheating guideline; school classrooms; thermal benchmark		Providing thermal comfort in schools has a significant impact on students' performance and health. Climate change may result in an increased risk of overheating. A clear understanding and definition of overheating in schools is needed. Overheating can occur for various reasons. In order to deal with the problem realistically, it is necessary to have the correct design benchmarks. The UK government has recently published new overheating guidelines for schools. A comparison is made between the existing and new overheating guidelines. This is based on an analysis of recorded temperature data from 140 classrooms in 18 naturally ventilated primary schools in London, UK, which is then compared with records of occupants' thermal comfort responses to indoor temperature. It was found that the old guidelines were too lenient, thereby allowing some overheating to occur. The new guideline is more stringent, but needs further development to reflect occupants' perceptions more accurately.

To upgrade this valuable infrastructure, state and federal governments have advocated for rubberized asphalt concrete (RAC) technology, which would meet the current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own demands. This paper presents a cost-estimating system for rubberized asphalt road rehabilitation projects. The proposed system utilizes information collected from 44 projects and applies neural networks to perform its task. This tool is believed to be helpful in many road pavement applications, such as preparing accurate budget estimates and life-cost analyses, as well as managing financial resources in limited budget environments.

The Bayh-Dole Act is cited the driver for sharply increased university patenting, less fundamental research focus, and disinterest in traditional missions, although there is little data to corroborate these conclusions. A National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop points to I-U relationship issues in the context of the path a new technology must follow from lab to market. We propose some critical variables affecting I-U IP relationships; describe areas of agreement and contention between the parties, drawing also on secondary data and the broader literature of I-U relations; and offer IP policy observations of interest to universities, researchers and technology transfer managers, their industry counterparts, and government.

It appears as necessary to estimate hidden quality changes in both outputs and inputs. Changes in government regulations, in specifications, and the development of nonprice criteria for contract award emerge as important. Schemes for benchmarking the performance of construction projects as well as life-cycle analyses suggest that customer risk aversion and effects on customer productivity should be taken into account. The outcome is a set of measurements that can be applied to the selection of any type of proposed new construction or repair technology innovation according to their potential impact on industry productivity.

However, the application of IT in site have not achieved expected results because it is faced with many constraints caused by internal factors from enterprises and projects and external factors from the government and environment. Although many relevant studies have discussed the constraints of implementing different IT and devices in the construction industry or site, few articles have specifically focused on identifying and analyzing the indicator system. In this work, we took China as the background, scientifically identified 23 influential factors that affect the implementation of IT in construction management through literature review and expert interviews. Subsequently, questionnaires were issued, and Delphi method was used to obtain empirical data that aimed at four different management fields. Then, an efficient and convenient method called DEMATEL was used to deal with these data. Afterward, the factors were divided into four categories, namely, core, diving, independent, and impact factors. Finally, the similarities and differences of the analysis results from the four fields were compared, and the key factors were identified. Results show that the cross-domain talent ability, concept and value cognition, and organization structure are core factors in all management fields that should be managed first along with the IT innovation ability in the enterprise. The formulation of technical standards and related device and training input are also critical in specific fields. Strategic planning plays a role in macro control and promotion. Data management and application, platform construction, solution, and collaboration have direct impacts on information management. The research results provide suggestions not only for the government to formulate effective policies for IT application and promotion in construction industry, but also for enterprises to take measures in improving management efficiency in the construction site and realizing its substantial benefits.

Several decades of formal gender equality initiatives by government and business have failed to bring about any meaningful change to the hierarchical and numerical representation of women in the sector. Drawing on new institutionalism, particularly the concepts of 'robustness' and 'revisability', the nature and intent of formal policies and programs that impact on gender equality are analysed in two large Australian multinational construction firms. Through in-depth interviews with senior management and a document analysis of formal policies, it is concluded that gender equality initiatives and broader policies are primarily focused on increasing the numbers of women in construction rather than addressing gender practices and outcomes. These policies lack many of the qualities of robustness and revisability, which impacts on their capacity to genuinely challenge the gendered norms, practices and narratives of the sector.

To identify the problems, the writers used a case-based approach and interviewed the chairman of one small- to medium-sized enterprise (SME). Findings derived from the interview were validated by further interviewing four members of the construction union in Taiwan, three government officials, and four managers of mortgage banks. The theory of constraints approach was used to examine the construction development process of the SME and indicate the undesirable effects that hindered it and needed immediate attention. The study results were systemized into a conceptual model for developers' future reference to improve management of the development process and identify the root causes of problems.

A Fuzzy Approach for the Allocation of Risks in Public-Private Partnership Water-Infrastructure Projects in Developing Countries	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Water supply infrastructure; Risk allocation; Public-private partnership; Fuzzy set theory; Public and private sectors	SYNTHETIC EVALUATION; SUPPLY PROJECTS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; RANKING; SYSTEM	The allocation of risk between public-sector and private-sector parties in a public-private partnership (PPP) contract is a critical element of success that should be based on an assessment of the party best able to manage it. Assessing the risk-management capability of a contracting party to reach an efficient risk-allocation decision is subjective and implicit because it requires value judgments and experiential knowledge of expert practitioners. This paper draws on a set of established risk-allocation criteria (RAC) and the fuzzy-set approach to examine the allocation of five key risk factors related to PPPs in water supply infrastructure projects. The fuzzy set is used to deal with ambiguity in the linguistic RAC to minimize the fuzziness and bias in qualitative expert knowledge that characterize real-life decision-making. To explore how the risks should be allocated, three rounds of a Delphi questionnaire survey was conducted to elicit knowledge of practitioners with hands-on experience related to PPP projects in the water sector by requesting them to evaluate the risk factors on each risk-allocation criterion. The RAC and experiential knowledge were modeled to reflect capabilities of the public-private parties and to suggest the risk-allocation decisions for the corresponding risks. The results show that the risks should be shared between the government and the private sector, rather than wholly transferring specific risks to a particular party. This paper shows that it is possible to effectively distribute risks between the public-private parties based on fuzzy-set theory, RAC, and qualitative expert knowledge. The method has a merit of enabling decision-makers to utilize qualitative linguistic terms to assess risk-management capabilities of public-private parties and of predicting risk-allocation strategies in a contract. Also, the paper hints that, in developing countries, governments may take some political actions to make a water-infrastructure project to be executed via the PPP mode more attractive to private investors.

J	Blomgren, S				Blomgren, S			Changes to building research funding in Sweden	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction industry; European Union; governance; innovation; public policy; R&D; research policy; Sweden		Changes to the Swedish research landscape since 2001 are described including the re-organization of research councils, research programmes, the management and allocation of public funding research in Sweden, and the effects on built environment research. The reasons for these changes include the desire for increased integration with European Union research programmes, an increasing emphasis on inter- and multidisciplinary research, and the desire for research to contribute to economic well-being. Despite Sweden's high level of government investment in research, shifting priorities and an increasing number of applicants have resulted in reduced allocations for built environment research. This presents the challenging tasks to define and maintain core research capabilities within the built environment sector as well as to ensure adequate industry engagement with both the creation of the research agenda and the use of research outputs.

Regional and national policy documents that plan for heatwaves in the UK tend to focus on institutional emergency responses and infrastructure development. In these documents, although communities are mentioned, they are understood as passive recipients of resilience that is provided by active institutions. Meanwhile, contemporary discussion about community resilience highlights the potential for involving communities in planning for and responding to emergencies (although the concept is also the subject of critique). To improve heatwave preparation, planning and response, more effort by central and local governments is required to articulate and realize greater participation by individuals, and voluntary and community sector groups.

Influence of Simplified Procurement Methods on Competition for Public Sector Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ); Construction management; Competition; Procurement; Contracting	COST; BIDDERS; NUMBER; IMPACT	In response to problems of cumbersome regulations and understaffed public agencies, governments have worked to simplify procurement statutes and streamline processes. One of the most widely used simplified processes in the United States public sector is a subclass of agreements known as indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Some scholars and practitioners have criticized their use, suggesting public officials have taken advantage of simplified procedures at the expense of protecting the public interest. Specifically, IDIQ contracts have been seen as limiting competition, with adverse consequences for markets and price. However, no studies to date have empirically examined claims of limited competition from simplified procurement tools like IDIQ. This paper seeks to address that gap by evaluating the use of IDIQ contracts in the context of federal construction procurement. Using univariate and multivariate statistics, this study examined bid data from 935 U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) construction projects awarded between 2008 and 2015. The results show that IDIQ contracting does correspond with lower levels of competition as measured by the number of bids, even when controlling for factors like delivery method and market conditions. Using microeconomic theory and traditional assumptions of low-bid contracting, such limits on competition could have negative economic consequences. However, multiple-award IDIQ contracts also appear to be effective at maintaining a minimal level of competition needed to protect the public's interest while potentially lowering the transaction costs of both proposers and government agencies. For design-build projects in particular, IDIQ contracts may serve as a streamlined alternative to two-step source selection. This study serves as the largest empirical analysis of IDIQ contracting to date and adds to the bodies of knowledge on public procurement and competition in the construction industry. The findings lay the groundwork for researchers to explore the production and transaction cost tradeoffs of IDIQ contracting.

J	Liang, QX; Hu, H				Liang, Qingxue; Hu, Hao			Study on Identification of Spurious Public-Private Partnership Projects in China	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Evaluation framework; fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP); policy-making recommendations; public-private partnership (PPP); spurious PPP projects	CONCESSIONAIRE SELECTION; HEALTH-CARE; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE	Public-private partnership (PPP) is effective in delivering infrastructure projects. In China, PPP has been widely adopted in project finance ever since the government has permitted the private sector to get involved in the investment and operation of urban infrastructure. However, there seem to be many spurious PPP projects emerging in the market, which may bring about losses to the stakeholders and lead PPP away from orderly and standardized development. This paper attempts to address this issue by applying the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to investigate two infrastructure PPP projects, and analyze the characteristics of genuine and spurious PPP projects in China. Recommendations for mass implementation of PPP and ways of identifying spurious PPP projects are summarized to guide the regulation of infrastructure PPP projects. The paper also provides a reference for project selection and policy-making in the future.

The research method consisted of action research cycles within a large divisional branch of a government organisation. Knowledge management interventions and initiatives were implemented with three action research cycles completed. Actions and changes were observed, monitored, evaluated, and reflected on using an after action review process. This study has established that the alignment of the people and system elements (learning, culture, social, technology, process and infrastructure) can positively influence an organisation's capability for organisation learning. This study shows how the Syllk model enables management to conceptualise (and illustrate) how organisational know-how is wired (distributed) across various people and system elements of an organisation.

J	Liddle, BT				Liddle, BT			Privatization decision and civil engineering projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Most of the benefits from infrastructure privatization will occur in the selection/design and operation/maintenance phases, not in the construction phase. These benefits accrue from the private sector's greater innovation and cost-efficiencies. The selection/design phase benefits how mostly from innovation. The benefits from the operation/maintenance phase are from both innovation and cost-efficiencies depending on the type of privatization. Greater innovation and possibly greater cost-efficiency benefits will come from ownership transfer rather than contracting out operation and maintenance. The civil engineer has a good feel for which projects could reap the greatest benefits and how to conduct the bid process to maximize those benefits. However, the policy maker must consider important factors like the public's expectation of the government's responsibility, the environmental impact, and the following trade-offs: investment encouraged by long-term time horizons versus competition among private firms; profit induced benefits versus regulation of monopoly prices; and achieving economies of scale versus conflicts over control among local authorities.

The cost of remanufacturing is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion process, which is characterized by its drift and volatility. Under these assumptions, we construct and analyze a basic real options model for product remanufacturing. Specifically, we derive the remanufacturing cost threshold at which the remanufacturing option is exercised. We also perform extensive sensitivity analysis to examine how the remanufacturing cost uncertainty and other factors influence the remanufacturing decision. Furthermore, we present an extension where a remanufacturing subsidy and a disposal fee by the government are considered. The impacts of these economic instruments on the remanufacturing decision as well as on the environment are investigated.	[Shi, Wenbo] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Min, K.

J	BENNETT, G; WHITTAKER, J				BENNETT, G; WHITTAKER, J			ORGANIZATIONAL ATTITUDES OF SENIOR PROFESSIONALS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMMITMENT	The literature review indicates that architects tend to solve problems differently than students from the physical sciences and engineering. Because architects and engineers often fulfill similar roles in project development, should appropriate management training take into account differences in organizational, professional, and client commitment? A survey was designed using the organizational and professional commitment scales developed by Mowday et al. (in 1979) and Aranya and Ferris (in 1984). Another scale was also designed to test client commitment. A survey of 61 architects and engineers in management roles in a government department reveals that the two professions are virtually indistinguishable in these areas. It would seem that the organizational requirements that come with higher roles and positions override the speciality-professional referent. There are significant findings in ''use of profession as referent,'' but the question set ''client commitment'' requires extensive review of its internal validity. Further research is suggested on the effect of large bureaucratic organizations on the professional and organizational commitment of employees.

A Decision Support System for the determination of concession period length in transportation project under BUT contract	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Decision Support System; Concession period length determination; Monte Carlo	MODEL	The determination of the concession period length directly affects both the involved government and private investors' financial returns and risks in a Build-Operate-Transfer project. In existing methods, the concession period is usually determined by the concessionaire depending on their expected investment return, or predicted without comprehensive analysis of the influential factors. In view of this, a Decision Support System for concession period length determination (CPLD) was developed and, as demonstrated herein provides a possible way of solving the concession period problem, especially under the impact of influential factors. The influential factors were firstly investigated. Then the overall model was developed using the Monte Carlo method. A dataset of a simulated highway project was employed to verify the model. The results show that the developed model can generate a set of alternatives, among which a reasonable one could be selected after balancing the interests of both sides. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed to generate deterioration models that benefit from the large amount of facility data stored in IMS databases and updated on a regular basis. CBRMID (CBR for modeling infrastructure deterioration) is a new CBR system developed to satisfy the special requirements of modeling infrastructure deterioration and to provide government agencies with practical, accurate, and versatile deterioration models. CBRMID is required to support (1) hierarchial decomposition of infrastructure facilities; (2) representation of facility component interactions, (3) versatility and extensibility of case and knowledge representation; (4) data reusing and sharing; (5) representation of time-dependent data; and (6) fuzziness of retrieval knowledge. In this paper, the architecture of CBRMID is described in terms of case representation, case retrieval, case adaptation, and case accumulation. An application example generated using CBRMID is also presented.

J	GEISLER, E				GEISLER, E			WHEN WHALES ARE CAST ASHORE - THE CONVERSION TO RELEVANCY OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND BASIC SCIENCE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							R-AND-D; EXPERIENCE	This article suggests that the conversion of defense to civilian R&D and the movement to make universities and federal labs more responsive to industrial needs are threatening the nation's basic science capabilities. The roles of the federal government, industry, and universities in the support, production and utilization of basic research are analyzed. The article concludes that due to declining federal support for academic research, universities are under pressure to find alternative sources of funding. Industry's effort to outsource research provides universities with some financial relief. The two trends combine to threaten the university's function as the main supplier of basic science. The article recommends federal and industrial science policies that increase funding levels of basic research in order to relieve pressures on universities. Emphasis should also be placed on improving mechanisms for commercialization of results from basic research between universities and industry, and within the companies themselves.

These units frequently are understaffed and vulnerable to political and economic pressure to deliver. Few researchers have examined the organization, size, and transparency of these units. This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of 27 Brazilian federative units. The research has been focused more on identifying governance characteristics, and this study includes indicators of success, such as project implemented and transparency level. The research concluded the following: (1) Brazilian PPP units still have to significantly improve PPP public transparency; (2) a reduced number of PPP projects is actually implemented, but the more transparent PPP units are those with the ability to successfully implement more projects; and (3) size matters in terms of staff-the larger the units are, the more projects are implemented and the better the conversion ratio (projects appraised versus projects in operation).

This research study assesses the policy provisions and institutional behavioral factors influencing rail infrastructure financing in developing countries such as Ghana. An empirical and positivist epistemological lens was adopted using triangulation between deductive and inductive approaches to test three hypotheses. Methods adopted included questionnaire survey and interviews to gather primary data, and inferential statistics such as bivariate linear regression analysis. Factors identified that inhibit rail infrastructure development in developing countries include ineffective monitoring and evaluation, a largely neglected rail sector, and archaic financing posture. Based on the findings, prescriptive guidance on financing future rail infrastructure for policy makers and governments is delineated. This novel research identifies a number of interventions that, if implemented, will engender socioeconomic and regional intertrade integration and prosperity to the subregion of West Africa.

Construction is a major consumer of a wide range of naturally occurring and synthesized resources. The extraction, processing and utilization of these resources can have various negative impacts on the environment. With increased awareness and knowledge of these impacts, efforts are being made to avoid these adverse effects. Among these is the selection and specification of appropriate materials. This paper studies the level of environmental awareness and knowledge of architects in Singapore when selecting and specifying materials during the design stage. Responses to a questionnaire indicate that the architects are aware of the environmental impacts of building materials, and knowledgeable about possible measures which could help avoid the problems. However, they are not adopting green design approaches. Key policy directions for government, professional bodies, educators and clients are made to enable Singapore architects to apply their knowledge of environmental issues in their design decisions.

Our objective is to collect evidence of the full range of challenges public sector owners face in managing their major projects. After reviewing the literature on owner organisations, we carry out a case survey of 26 major projects to identify the principal challenges using a content analysis of UK National Audit Office Value for Money reports. Our original contribution is that the findings provide the first comprehensive picture of the full range of challenges of project organising faced by owner organisations. These findings push us theoretically to extend the scope of research in project organising to identify an extended core set of dynamic capabilities for project owner organizations to address these challenges.

Whether there is safe drinking water in cities has attracted wide attention. The ecological risk management of drinking water project is an important means of ensuring the safety of a drinking water source. Based on ecological risk assessment and management theories, this paper establishes an ecological risk management model and assessment system with the aim of providing theoretical guidance and scientific basis for formulating a policy on the safety and protection of drinking water sources in a city. Kunming is one of the cities plagued by severe water shortage in China. Its ecological risk management of drinking water has attracted the attention of both the local government and the public.

SEMATECH overcame its early challenges and succeeded by shifting its emphasis from horizontal (competitive) to vertical (precompetitive) collaboration, and then to a combined horizontal/vertical form (coopetitive). This evolutionary path in structure and strategy has broad implications for future relations between SEMATECH and the semiconductor industry as a whole, as well as industry R&D consortia in general. These implications are explored by detailing recent strategic developments at SEMATECH and their relationship to the market environment and structure in the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. This analysis is then extended to explore the implications for strategic research partnerships in other industries, which share particular salient characteristics with the semiconductor industry.

Yet, poor time and cost performance have been a critical issue prevailing in the global construction market and UAE have not been an exception. This research adopted a concurrent mixed-methods approach, utilizing a questionnaire and an interview with UAE construction professionals, to analyse the major causes of this poor time and cost performance. The top five causes for time overrun were concluded as design variation from client and consultant, unrealistic schedules and completion dates projected by clients, delay in obtaining government permits and approvals, inaccurate time estimation by the consultants and change orders from clients. Whereas, the top five causes of cost overrun were summarized as design variation, poor cost estimation, delay in client's decision-making process, financial constraints of client and inappropriate procurement method.

This project and auditor selection process is normally carried out based on personal experience and the quality of the selection outcome is hard to predict and control. This is a difficult work assignment problem because there are normally hundreds of projects and dozens of auditors to choose from. The purpose of this research is to establish a genetic algorithm-based model to assist with the project selection and auditor assignment process. The model is set up to find the optimal match between the project characteristics and auditor expertise from approximately 5.09E + 29 possible combinations. Information provided by the Kaohsiung County Government is used to validate the model. The results show that the model is not only valid but also able to produce a "much better match" between projects and auditors when comparing to manual assignment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The subsequent emergence of such a timber building system in Sweden is analysed in the context of the existing concrete-based construction system. The characteristics of the construction industry and its path dependency over the past century hamper the development of a timber building system. However, government policies and funding, the wood industry's interest in an enhanced market for value-added wood products, and involvement of the wood research community has helped develop such a construction system. Investments in knowledge creation, incentives for the entry of new firms, and increased prefabrication may facilitate a transition from this formative phase to a growth phase in the diffusion of timber buildings.

This paper assesses the improvement requirements in manpower development practices in Ethiopian construction industry focusing on the role of government, academic institutes and industry organizations. Factors affecting manpower development were identified through literature review and a framework for manpower development was proposed. Questionnaire survey was used to obtain the perception of professionals on manpower development practices. Improvement requirement levels were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale and one-sample T-test was conducted to identify significance of the improvement requirements. In addition to the questionnaire, curricula of three under graduate construction programs and professionals registration directives were reviewed. The findings indicate current manpower development practices require improvement. Based on implications of the findings and in reference with the proposed framework, improvement suggestions are given to enhance manpower development practices for development of the industry.

It explores the particular case of a PMO dedicated to a major organizational transformation within a Canadian university hospital. The national government has asked hospitals to provide strict control over their budgets through implementing strong governance mechanisms. How can PMO performance be assessed within this context? Perception of two different groups has been analyzed within a competing values framework, allowing for a combination of four different performance conceptions. Results show certain similarities in the barriers to PMO performance but, most importantly, they reveal that between the two groups a paradox exists regarding what is valued in PMO performance. Results bring empirical evidence of the application of the competing values framework to the health care sector, but also to a wide variety of industries, public or private.

Ranked Critical Factors in PPP Briefings	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Critical factors; Procurement; Stakeholder; Risk; Finance; Briefing stage; Public-private partnership; Infrastructure; Questionnaire survey; Queensland; Australia	VARIABLES; QUALITY	Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are increasingly used to procure Australian infrastructure projects. As with all construction projects, the early briefing stages are often the most crucial in determining a successful outcome. There is, however, a lack of systematic research on the type and nature of the critical factors affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of PPP during this period. A literature review is presented of PPP usage in Australia, in which four main categories of factors (procurement, stakeholder, risk, and finance) are identified, each with several subfactors. A questionnaire survey involving state government stakeholders is also described, and a mathematical model that ranks the factors involved is developed. This is followed by an examination of the potential of the factors to help improve the PPP briefing stage for both public and private sectors. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000131.

By defining slack as the difference between delivery arrival time and estimated inventory stock-out time, the objective of ISRP is to maximize the inventory slack of each dispensing site. Previous studies exclusively focused on single-depot ISRP, but this study extends the problem to a multidepot case, which is more applicable in practice. To quickly generate an optimal solution, this study proposes an efficient solution heuristic that consists of four consecutive steps: site assignment, vehicle routing design, delivery quantity scheduling, and site reassignment. The numerical test demonstrates that the proposed heuristic can properly assign the dispensing sites to different depots, design optimal vehicle routing plans for each depot, and balance inventory slacks over all sites.

One of the most important functions of the BMS is to provide the agencies with an effective decision making toot for managing bridges. Especially, it is very important for the BMS to assist in prioritizing routine maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement activities to optimize the given constrained budgets. This paper suggests an algorithm for the BMS to prioritize bridge maintenance activities at the network level and to show its implementation. The selection of maintenance activities can be modeled as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is used to solve it. Using bridge decks as an example, the application of genetic algorithms is demonstrated and the feasibility of the suggested methodology is examined through some numerical case studies.

However, PPP projects have a high risk of contract failure. To proactively predict PPP contract failure and obtain the most significant failure factors from a quantitative perspective, this research compared the performance of different combinations of machine learning models and data-balancing techniques. Forty-three project-specific and country-specific factors were examined, and the top 15 were chosen for the transportation, water and sewer, and energy sectors. The results show that the selected model can forecast contract failure with a recall of 75.9%, 73.3%, and 76.2%, respectively. This study showed the effectiveness and applicability of machine learning in predicting PPP contract failure. The results can facilitate decision making by forecasting the probability of PPP contract failure in the early planning stage.	[Wang, Yongqi; Tiong, Robert L.

Recent national strategies and policies have enabled China's geothermal energy industry to enter a new era with important development opportunities. This paper investigates the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to China's geothermal energy industry from political, economic, social, and technological (PEST) perspectives. SWOT-PEST analysis indicates that the resources, market, and technological foundation exist for the large-scale development of China's geothermal energy industry. However, it experiences constraints, such as unclear resource distributions, incomplete development of government regulations, incomplete implementation of national policies, unclear authority between governmental administrative systems, and lack of uniform technical standards and codes. Therefore, future development strategies have been proposed to provide technical support and policy tools for geothermal energy development. The recommendations to ensure its healthy and sustainable development include improving resource exploration, rationalizing administration systems, enhancing policy guidance and financial support, and cultivating geothermal talent.

J	Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ				Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ			A rework reduction model for construction projects	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						change; construction; procurement model; rework; stepwise regression		Rework is an endemic problem in building construction projects and is an area of research that has received limited attention. Recent research has shown that rework is the primary cause of time and schedule overruns in projects and that rework levels do not significantly differ between current procurement methods despite calls from government for the use of more integrated procurement approaches such as design-and-construct to improve project performance. To reduce the incidence of rework throughout the construction supply chain, data from 161 completed projects were gathered using a questionnaire survey. Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the significant variables that contributed to rework in projects. In conjunction with previously reported research, these variables were used to develop an alternative procurement model for reducing rework in projects. It is suggested that the proposed model could be used to stimulate interorganizational relations and promote teambuilding during the formative stages of a project, which is essential for reducing design-related rework.

Therefore, in-depth interviews to Indonesian VE experts, regulators and practitioners of infrastructure projects in Jakarta are conducted to obtain the main obstacles and efforts to overcome. Then discussion and seminar on VE is conducted to get more inputs from construction stakeholders. It is found and recommended: stakeholders low understanding on VE government regulations and its benefits so that the role of the VE Indonesia Association in VE socialization should be enhanced, no existence of VE implementation Guideline and the Code of Ethic and thus the existing law should be improved by creating them, no existence of public financial system to accommodate the share saving concept in VE so that it should be improved. These findings and recommended solutions can be useful for any parties elsewhere who face the similar VE implementation problems.

J	Carpintero, S; Vassallo, JM; Solino, AS				Carpintero, Samuel; Manuel Vassallo, Jose; Sanchez Solino, Antonio			Dealing with Traffic Risk in Latin American Toll Roads	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Toll roads; Risk management; Infrastructure; Private sector; Transportation management		This paper presents a cross-country analysis of traffic risk allocation in road concessions of Latin America. It shows that some countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Peru have been greatly concerned with mitigating traffic risk, either by putting into practice public guarantees, implementing flexible term concessions, or through availability payment concessions; whereas other countries such as Mexico and Brazil have assigned traffic risk to the private concessionaire by using fixed-term concession contracts without any traffic guarantees. Based on an analysis of data from 1990 to 2010, the paper finds that shifting traffic risk from the concessionaire to the government or users was not confined to the riskiest projects, as one might expect. The analysis also suggests that the implementation of traffic risk mitigation mechanisms in Latin American toll roads has not been very successful in reducing renegotiation rates or in increasing the number of bidders in the tenders.

A detailed statistical analysis of 297 projects in the Construction Industry Institute database is used to produce baseline measures of performance and D/IT use. The relationship between these measures is used to assess the economic value of using the technologies. A set of projects that excelled. in the use of WIT and that scored high on performance measures is then examined. These exemplary projects provide a basis for further in-depth analyses through on-site interviews with key project representatives. The results of this study establish that projects benefit from WIT use. Both owners and contractors can expect construction cost savings of approximately 4% by increasing the use of D/IT. For owners there is clear evidence of schedule compression as well. Although the statistical analyses do not support schedule compression benefits for contractors, findings from the on-site interviews provide anecdotal support.

J	Breese, R				Breese, Richard			Benefits realisation management: Panacea or false dawn?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Benefits Realisation Management; Performance management; Regeneration programme management	AREA-BASED INITIATIVES; SINGLE REGENERATION BUDGET; ET-AL. 2005; LOCAL OUTCOMES; THOUGHTS; ENGLAND	Benefits Realisation Management (BRM) is becoming an increasingly important aspect of project and programme management. However, commentators have observed that the practice of BRM is often flawed, and have made suggestions as to how practice might be improved. This paper is concerned with the reasons why the implementation of BRM might not be straightforward, by focusing on the underlying assumptions. It will approach the issue by drawing on the author's experience from the 1990s and 2000s in working in the management of government-funded regeneration programmes in the UK. In this field there was a rigid benefits management framework, although it precedes the development of BRM. The paper will argue that there are important underlying conceptual issues in benefits management which have practical implications and need to be recognised in the development of theory for BRM.

The model is based on a flexible structure that disaggregates the stock into various categories (e.g. by building type, climate, vintage and life cycle stage) and with attributes assigned to each of these (e.g. floor area and energy-use intensity by fuel type and end use) based on historical data and user-defined scenarios for future projections. In addition to supporting the interactive exploration of building stock dynamics, the model has been used to study the likely outcomes of specific policy and innovation scenarios targeting very low future energy consumption in the building stock. Model use has highlighted the scale of the challenge of meeting targets stated by various government and professional bodies, and the importance of considering both new construction and existing buildings.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted. The findings reveal that most of the decisions in construction projects are based on their financial returns unless there is a special requirement to comply with Green Star or any other sustainable building rating system. Even though there is a trend towards environment-friendly construction, contractors are favourable towards methods involving financial incentives. Results also indicate that private developers are more price-driven compared with government clients. Findings reveal the necessity of enforcing legislation to improve waste management practices until such practices become culturally embedded in organizations across the supply chain. Similarly, end users' motivation towards waste management was also identified as a key to encouraging stakeholders of construction projects and improving their attitudes and behaviours towards waste management practices.

It has undertaken post-occupancy surveys of well-regarded new commercial and public buildings, typically 2-3 years after completion. The purpose was to provide feedback on generic and specific information on factors for success in the design, construction, operation and use of buildings, together with areas of difficulty and disappointment. This paper outlines the project and describes the survey methods used, and prospects for further development. It considers the opportunities for more widespread deployment of post-occupancy surveys as routine quality assurance measures for the building industry and its clients. Papers 2 to 4 in this series discuss the findings on technical performance, energy performance and occupant satisfaction. Paper 5 draws some general conclusions and considers their implications.

Both programmes operated on the assumption that design for high performance requires extra design time and also incur extra costs for contracted specialists and energy simulations. This was achieved through the provision of funding additional design time and providing support to the client and design team. A survey of completed projects within these programmes was undertaken to validate this assumption. Significant cost savings for clients were demonstrated at a modest and acceptable increment in design costs. The provision of modest governmental funding for the design stage has been a successful policy, with positive feedback from clients and operating cost savings offset by modest increases in capital cost or design time.

The validity of the rhetorical arguments previously developed in the extant literature-innovation, market's maturity, quality specifiability, scope economies, competition, information asymmetries and transaction attributes-that are used to promote bundled public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements are explored. This is done using longitudinal case study methodology in an abductive research setting. Six cities of India and their activities concerning the municipal solid waste (MSW) management are used for testing. Thirty-nine semistructured interviews with PPP stakeholders, observations, and documentary analysis provided the evidence. The cases have offered important insights on how and why variations tend to occur among the two procurement models, i.e., bundling and unbundling and what practices can contribute to the success of these projects.

After two decades of concessions development, empirical evidence suggests a recurrent need to renegotiate contracts. What drives renegotiation? Why does it occur? What are the results? The literature still lacks data on renegotiation patterns and on its main causes and results, thus not answering these questions. This paper intends to fulfill this gap by identifying some of the key determinants of renegotiations and presenting the main results. Using an econometric analysis on a real database of 87 Portuguese concessions, the research identified some variables that help explaining the high probability of renegotiation, such as the concession duration and investment, or the existence of a regulator when the contract was signed. The research also found empirical evidence of the high costs involved in renegotiations, as well as of poor control and poor management of concessions by the government.

Perception of Financial Institutions toward Financing PFI Projects in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION; VIABILITY; INDUSTRY; CULTURE; TAIWAN	Private finance initiative (PFI) has emerged to be a viable strategy for governments to transfer financial risks in public projects to the private sector. It does not only help tap the efficiency and finances of the private sector but it also promises to deliver better public services to the community. Despite these obvious incentives, there is still a low PFI diffusion in Hong Kong. Based on this understanding, we have undertaken this exploratory study, which is probably the first of its kind, to investigate the PFI's financial issues from the perspective of financial suppliers. This study was intended to identify factors that may affect the perception of the supplier side and to explore ways to facilitate their participation in PFI projects. The findings suggest that respondents had low level of understanding and knowledge of the PFI and they perceived that PFI public projects had an average risk and performance. To increase their involvement, several enablers are provided in this paper.	[Cheng, Eddie W.

Energy-efficient new housing - The UK reaches for sustainability	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						carbon dioxide emissions; house building; renewable energy; zero-carbon homes		A critique is presented of recent proposals by the UK government to require new housing to become progressively more energy efficient, leading to net zero-carbon dioxide emissions from 2016. It is implied that these zero-carbon homes will involve a range of on-site power generation, and the technological changes needed to achieve this are discussed. Achieving zero-carbon space and water heating presents a distinct set of infrastructural challenges to the industry. However, proven and demonstrated technologies exist that, if deployed correctly, could achieve this goal. In contrast, the provision of zero net carbon electrical power to homes presents technological demands. It will require substantial advancement of current technological concepts, coupled to infrastructural change in the UK electricity supply industry, to be successful. Careful consideration should be given to the scale of the electricity-generating technologies proposed to ensure that the lowest cost and risk pathways are identified. It is not clear in the legislation proposed that these pathways will be sought.

Aside from the apparent mystery of how the Japanese advanced so quickly with the technology are such related issues of importance to policymakers and managers as: Did government contribute to or detract from the Japanese success? How did the major Japanese electron-tube producers, unlike their U,S, counterparts and dominant firms in numerous other industries undergoing a major shift in technology, successfully make the transition to the new technology? This paper explores the history of the commercialization of the transistor radio, Japan's first successful semiconductor product. The history is organized into a theoretical framework to help permit systematic comparison and analysis.

J	Christian, J; Pandeya, A				Christian, J; Pandeya, A			Cost predictions of facilities	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MAINTENANCE	Facility managers in all organizations experience many different problems. One of the most common significant problems is the prediction of future operating and maintenance costs. Although extremely accurate cost predictions are difficult, information generated through historical cost analyses, along with a study of the factors that determine these costs, could contribute greatly to improving the accuracy of such predictions. In the research described, 14 university facilities and eight government offices were investigated. Quantitative data on the historical operating and maintenance costs of these facilities, along with knowledge of the factors affecting the costs were elicited through various sources. Cost prediction models were developed using neural networks, regression analyses, and random deviation detection methods. The final stage of the research was the creation of a costs prediction decision-support system using the analytical results and the knowledge acquired. The system created may be used to assist and advise on certain aspects of facility management, such as the estimation of operating and maintenance costs, and the development of preventive and general maintenance plans for facilities similar to those investigated.

Power assist devices for installing plaster panels in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						robotized masonry; construction robot; material-handling manipulator; service robot; guided robot	SYSTEM	Building construction is a very interesting field for automation, but the incorporation of fully automated systems is a very slow matter because of the inherent difficulties of its unstructured and changing environment. However, this industry produces a large number of accidents and injuries in workers and government agencies are demanding protection for them. An intermediate solution is to provide the workers with new tools capable of supplying power to carry the heavy loads while the workers are still providing their sensor system and intelligence. This is just the concept of a power assist device. This paper presents two versions of a manipulator to assist operators in handling and installing pre-manufactured plaster panels for indoor-wall construction. This manipulator is guided directly by the operator, so it can be considered yet another tool to assist operators in handling heavy loads. The system's main features and its functions are presented.

Design for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) has played a significant role, with governments commissioning emergency hospital projects. Due to the conflict between some DfMA strategies/guidelines, their integration requires further thorough investigation. This study aims to explore the integrated approaches to DfMA. A three-step method, including a focus group, 18 designer interviews, and archival study, formed the basis and validation of the case. Finally, the study identified 31 DfMA measures and revealed three organizational (concurrence, integration, and collaboration) and five design attributes that correspond with integration strategies for DfMA. Critical to the integrated approaches to DfMA is breaking the mirroring trap. This study contributes to the theory development of DfMA in terms of systems integration. Future practitioners can take the example by the case to adapt the project organizational structure to the building production.

Modeling and forecasting construction labor demand: Multivariate analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							REQUIREMENTS; MANPOWER	This paper presents the development of advanced labor demand forecasting models at project level. A total of 11 manpower demand forecasting models were developed for the total project labor and ten essential trades. Data were collected from a sample of 54 construction projects. These data were analyzed through a series of multiple linear regression analyses that help establish the estimation models. The results indicate that project labor demand depends not only on a single factor, but a cluster of variables related to the project characteristics, including construction cost, project complexity attributes, physical site condition, and project type. The derived regression models were tested and validated using four out-of-sample projects and various diagnostic tests. It is concluded that the models are robust and reliable, which merit for contractors and HKSAR government to predict the labor required for a new construction project and facilitate human resources planning and budgeting, and that the methodology used may be applied to develop equally useful models in other subsectors, and in other countries.

The study further investigates a key contingency of this institutional effect: a firm's country/ownership identity. Using China's pharmaceutical sector as the empirical context, we find that the quality of subnational institutions, such as the degree of government deregulation and the effectiveness of local contracting institutions, has a significantly positive impact on corporate R&D intensity. Moreover, this institutional effect is more salient in indigenous firms and international joint ventures than in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. This study serves to shed light on future research on how multifaceted subnational institutions shape innovation activities across different types of business organizations in emerging economies.

Although this process ensures quality of the information, considerable time delays occur. With the rapid development of the Internet and mobile devices, crowd-based platforms have been developed and used for disaster responses. However, three obvious drawbacks exist with crowdsourcing: errors, duplications, and unstructured formats. This study aims to develop a computational method, called the Artificial and Crowd Intelligence (ACI) filter, to overcome these drawbacks. To verify the ACI filter, 876 responses collected from an actual flood that occurred on June 10th, 2012, in Taiwan, were used; 284 volunteers from the Internet were recruited for the testing. The results show that the ACI filter eliminates 26.25% of the responses. The percentage of mistaken validations was 0.00% and the percentage of mistaken eliminations was 3.91%. This demonstrates that the ACI filter, by combining machine and human intelligence, can successfully improve crowd response accuracy.

This paper examines why building owners are reluctant to adopt measures to reduce earthquake losses despite advancement in seismic design methods and the enactment of intervening legislative frameworks. A case study approach revealed the socio-behavioural barriers affecting seismic retrofit implementation. Significant barriers identified included the perception of earthquake risks, a lack of trust in seismic strengthening techniques and a lack of support for pro-social mitigation behaviours from public authorities. The findings suggest that a reappraisal of the policy implementation approach used by government agencies is required, and that greater attention should be given to seismic designs recommended by professionals and approved by regulatory authorities in order to earn building owners' trust regarding the efficacy of earthquake risk-reduction measures.

This paper will contribute to this debate by exploring two dimensions - projects as the content of change, and projects as the process of change. Projects form the process of change when the organisational changes are managed as a project, and projects form the content of change when the intent of the change process is a managing by projects form of organisation. This exploration will be conducted through a single rich case, using Pettigrew's well-established context, content, process model of organisational change. In presenting the case we will identify the paradox that the organisational change towards managing projects is not itself managed as a project, and we suggest that this paradox provides a good opportunity for stimulating novel lines of enquiry in research on project organising.

The public agencies that administrate such projects manage project packages that must be integrated. All project packages may involve similar work. However, they are carried out by different contractors each with their own scheduling practices. Standardization provides a foundation for more efficient and effective schedule integration, but cannot easily be enforced without objections from contractors. This paper presents a three-stage standardization implementation framework using modularization. A set of network modules that involve normal, repetitive, cyclic, and merging activities was developed for expressway projects. Two computer systems were developed to help contractors use these modules to create schedules, and to help the owner review schedules submitted by contractors. Experiments and a survey were also carried out to validate the proposed framework, demonstrating a significant amount of time saving and errors reduced by using network modules.

J	Denny-Smith, G; Loosemore, M				Denny-Smith, George; Loosemore, Martin			Integrating Indigenous enterprises into the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Procurement; Small enterprises; Labour utilization; Social progress	PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; COMPETITIVE FORCES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BARRIERS; STRATEGY; HEALTH; VIEW	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the barriers to entry for Indigenous businesses into the Australian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - A national survey was conducted with 33 Indigenous businesses operating in the Australian construction industry. Findings - The findings show that Indigenous enterprises face similar challenges to many small non-Indigenous enterprises wishing to enter the industry. These include adjusting to unique construction industry cultures and practices, breaking into existing business networks and building social capital and being under-cut by industry incumbents and competitors when tendering for projects. These barriers are similar to those faced by other non-Indigenous social enterprises, although Indigenous enterprises do appear to experience relatively greater difficulty in starting-up their businesses and in securing sufficient capital, finance and assistance to enable them to scale-up and tender for normal work packages at a competitive price. Research limitations/implications - The results are limited to Australian Indigenous businesses. The survey does not allow a comparison of non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses, although comparison of results with existing non-Indigenous research into small to medium-sized firms in construction does allow some tentative insights. These need to be explored further. Practical implications - These results indicate that there are significant barriers to be addressed within the Australian construction industry if government indigenous procurement policies are to achieve their stated aims of increasing the number of Indigenous firms in the industry. The results also have important implications for Indigenous businesses and for non-Indigenous firms operating in the Australian construction industry. Social implications - This is an important gap in knowledge to address if countries like Australia are to redress the significant inequalities in income and health suffered by Indigenous populations. Originality/value - In countries like Australia, with significant Indigenous populations, governments are seeking to address persistent disadvantage by using new social procurement initiatives to create quasi construction markets for Indigenous enterprises to participate in the construction industry. While there is an emerging body of research into the barriers facing mainstream small to medium-sized enterprises and, to a lesser extent, social enterprises in construction, the barriers to entry facing Indigenous construction enterprises have been largely ignored.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of State Department of Transportation Investment Decisions: Linking Performance Measures to Resource Allocation	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information management; Statistics; Traffic flow; Transportation networks; Urban planning; Surveys		In recent years, many state departments of transportation (DOTs) have developed performance measures to monitor their transportation systems and improve transportation planning. One of the main outstanding questions with regard to using performance measures is how to best characterize the connection between resources and outcomes, particularly at a system (state) level. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of state DOT investment decisions on two performance areas: Safety and congestion. We collected expenditure and performance data from 1984-2000 and developed state-specific linear regression models for each performance area. The statistical significance and direction of influence of each expenditure category varied between models, so we used 29 transportation-system characteristics to interpret model results. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the link between resources and outcome and will help state DOTs utilize their new funding opportunities, improve their planning procedures and address government accountability concerns.

Therefore, a new multilateral model of cross-industry alliance needs to arise. The advanced charging technology of Internet-distributed mobile energy can link up with many market participants closely and form an effective and multilateral win-win cross-industry alliance. This new industry alliance can realize unexpected multiple goals, for example, (1) consumers who have purchased new energy vehicles can avail free charging; (2) potential vehicle buyers can be encouraged to use new energy vehicles; (3) the new energy vehicle manufacturers can expand their production scale; (4) the new energy vehicles sellers (4S shop) can expand their sales volume; (5) large shopping malls can attain more income; (6) financial institutions can absorb more deposits; (7) governments can further promote low-carbon traffic.

Group decision support systems (GDSS) have been proposed to overcome these problems by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of VM studies. To investigate the effect of using GDSS in VM workshops, three experimental studies together with questionnaire surveys have been conducted to compare the traditional VM and GDSS-supported workshops. The results have revealed that GDSS can help improve the performance of VM workshops in quantity of ideas, process efficiency, and participants' satisfaction. These outcomes are valuable to the construction industry in Hong Kong, in which both the government and industry have called for wider use of VM, and yet users often encounter difficulties that are attributable to the large number of participants and short duration of the workshops.(C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Public construction works worldwide that adopt the BOT model as their project delivery method are increasing gradually. Although many BOT projects have been implemented at various stages, some projects encounter major obstacles for advancement. This study attempts to identify the delay causes in various stages of BOT projects. Opinions of BOT participants' replies are solicited using two questionnaire surveys. Those outcomes are analyzed using by traditional statistical methods and structural equation modeling method. Study results reveal that the stage of 'negotiation and signing of concession agreement' is the most essential stage, in which 'improper contract planning,' debt problem' and 'uncertainty on political issues and government-finished items' are the most significant delay causes. Identified causes of delay can be used to prevent the postponement of future BOT projects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Low, SP; Gao, S; Ng, EWL				Low, Sui Pheng; Gao, Shang; Ng, Eileen Wan Leng			Future-ready project and facility management graduates in Singapore for industry 4.0 Transforming mindsets and competencies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Employability; SERVQUAL model; Construction industry; Soft skills; Industry 4; 0; USEM model of employability key	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; SERVICE QUALITY; INNOVATION; DESIGN; SKILLS	Purpose The disparity between employers' expectations and the ability of graduates to meet them is an issue for employment. Industry 4.0, represented by technologies like big data and automation, permeate the construction industry, exacerbating the rift of changing expectations that future graduates must bridge. As sophisticated forms of technology emerge, the ways individuals work are also expected to change. Soft skills are needed to support, materialise, and enhance the workforce's existing technical skills. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of Industry 4.0 on employability in the local construction industry from the viewpoint of employers and future graduates. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, quantitative followed by qualitative. The questionnaire survey crosschecked the needs and expectations of employers in the local construction industry, regarding these nine soft skills and the extent to which students currently possess them, to determine whether students from the construction industry are Industry 4.0-ready. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with employers in the construction industry and PFM students to further understand the disparity between the survey results of the two parties. Findings Gap analyses and t-test results found six significant divides in nine soft skills - resilience, curiosity, adaptability, entrepreneurial thinking, pursuing convictions and vision - showing a significant difference between the mean expectations of employers and the soft skills capabilities of graduate students. Future graduate students thus lack the soft skills needed by Industry 4.0. The reasons for this significant difference and the barriers to improving soft skills are explored through interviews with employers and future graduates. Three parties - government, educational institutions and industry - were identified as crucial partners in change. Originality/value Little has been researched about the future strategies and mindsets required by the workforce to prepare for the changes brought by Industry 4.0. Likewise, the government's and companies' one-sided focus on promoting skill-upgrading leaves many to wonder about the soft skills needed to stay competitive. Hence, it is timely to examine the readiness of Singapore's future graduates in the construction industry in adapting to Industry 4.0's requirements in terms of soft skills.

Since the private sector is driven by profit-generation motives to enter a PPP arrangement, there are criticisms against PPPs for focusing on economic goals and financial targets while giving less emphasis to attainment of social objectives. As a result, infrastructure development through PPP will fail to promote sustainable development goals. The paper discusses the findings from a detailed review of Indian PPP procurement focusing on the shortcomings of infrastructure development through PPP in promoting sustainable development. A qualitative content analysis method was used to answer the research question Why have the key deliverables of the PPP procurement process failed to promote sustainable development goals?' The policy-makers and advisors of PPP projects could incorporate the key findings from the analysis in formulating new strategies for developing more sustainable PPP projects.

First, various US Government Accountability Office reports are analyzed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the DOD's overall program management practices, as well as individual projects. Then, the evolution and progress of United States Army's Future Combat Systems project is examined in detail as a case study to substantiate the argument that insufficient risk management has contributed to project delays and cost overruns significantly. Poor risk management performance and practices are not unique to the Army, but arises from a system bred into the process of gaining approval to implement projects in the DOD. Incorporating a comprehensive risk management plan in the planning phase and filling key project management positions with personnel trained to recognize sound proposals from contractors would make significant strides toward improving overall project management practices in the DOD.

Intelligent utility locating tool for excavators	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subsurface environment; utilities; excavation; safety; laboratory tests		Currently, backhoe excavator operators have to depend on color-coded markings applied by utility locators to expect the location of utilities buried in the ground. As accidents prove time and time again, this method is unreliable. While more efforts should be spent on subsurface engineering and as-built documentation, excavators should have their own tools to "see" cables, wires, and pipes while working underground. This paper presents the result of work aimed at supplying backhoe operators with a device capable of scanning the ground for metallic objects. The "fishfinder" type tool is thought to be the last "barricade" against horrific accidents caused by the damage of buried utilities. The writers not only present the results of extensive tests in the laboratory and the field but also highlight that the outdated contractual principles used by the government, utility companies, and insurers establishes insurmountable barriers for transferring this novel technology into the industry. The relevance of the presented work is in the experimental data that has been collected and analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field.

Considerable uncertainty about the future also exists, partly because of the response of society's apparent reluctance to mitigate climate change by reducing fossil fuel consumption. An adaptive response to the challenge draws on the literature on climate change, the urban environment, natural hazards and risk analysis. Two concepts - life cycle costs and the avoidance of ruin - provide a useful framework for factoring the uncertainty associated with climate change into a risk analysis for the built environment. Monitoring, prediction, data management and communication are the unglamorous underpinnings of a successful urban risk-management strategy. For cities to develop a significantly improved response capacity, the active support of senior levels of government is essential because cities have neither the legal powers nor the resources to tackle climate change on their own. Ultimately, the biggest challenges are institutional and behavioural.

The transportation sector and particularly the road sector has remarkably increased its use of PPP arrangements for building, upgrading, operating, and financing these investments due to a shortage of public spending, which is necessary to satisfy infrastructure needs of growing economies. Fast-growing economies, such as Brazil, are facing bottlenecks in their economic development due to a lack of proper transportation infrastructures. This paper discusses the use of PPP contracts in the road sector, focusing the analysis on the Brazilian case study MG-050. This road was the first PPP project in the road sector in Minas Gerais (Brazil) during the recent so-called PPP wave and can provide valuable lessons for future development of road projects, not only in Brazil but also in other fast-growing economies, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, or Southeast Asia countries.

J	Ngee, L; Tiong, RLK; Alum, J				Ngee, L; Tiong, RLK; Alum, J			Automated approach to negotiation of BOT contracts	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Build, operate and transfer (BOT) projects have become of increasing interest over the last few years. The BOT model entails a concession company providing the finance, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of an infrastructure project for a specified concession period. This paper deals with the negotiation of financial and contractual parameters associated with a BOT project before it is awarded to the promoter. It describes the development of an automated mechanism as an alternative approach in expediting the negotiation over a suitable pricing structure for the BOT project. The mechanism was developed by incorporating spreadsheet data into multiple linear regression models to formulate the prediction equations using the tariff, concession period, and rate of return as the variables. This approach reduces the bulk of urgent recomputations of the project cash flows during the final negotiation that would otherwise entail the use of considerable resources. The mechanisms could therefore be used as enhanced tools for dynamic negotiation between the government and the promoter for an acceptable level of tariff structure; concession period and rate of return on the promoter's investments; and for balancing the risk/return profiles of both parties.

One reason for this is an absence of generally accepted procedures for evaluating the performance of projects. In the framework of evaluating performance, there is the issue of evaluating the rate for discounting the anticipated benefits and costs of public projects to the present moment. This paper contains a methodology for estimating the social discount rate for cost-benefit analysis in various economic industries in Russia. We apply two approaches - social rate of time preferences and social opportunity cost of capital - and propose a methodology for projects related to any industry. We present examples of estimating the social discount rate for healthcare, education, social services, and infrastructure projects. Our results are useful when both the government and private firms are able to solve the same social problems. The findings are applicable for any country with unequal development of various economic industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Credit enhancement factors for the financing of independent power producer (IPP) projects in Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Independent power producer; Credit enhancement; Asia; Public private partnership	CHINA	Public and private parties give a number of guarantees and commitments in the form of credit enhancement for successful investment and implementation of independent power producer (IPP) projects in Asia. A research is thus conducted to find the suitable credit enhancement factors for these projects. From 27 out of 28 credit enhancement factors that were validated by IPP professionals, factor analysis revealed five factor groupings which are - (1) shareholders' credit enhancement, (2) host government's credit enhancement, (3) multi-lateral development banks (MDBs), export credit agencies (ECAs) and other parties' credit enhancement, (4) capital structure mechanism, and (5) commercial bank's credit enhancement. From these critical credit enhancement groupings, it is further noticed that contingency equity support, standby credit guarantee, subordinated debt mechanism, financing with political risk insurance from MDBs and ECAs, escrow account, and standby letter of credit are of great importance for financing decision of IPP projects in Asia.

Procurement management in the foreign-funded construction projects implemented in Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction industry; foreign funded projects; procurement issues; procurement strategies	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; SAFETY	The most salient issue faced in foreign funded (FF) projects is the project delays arising from procurement issues. Addressing these issues and finding strategies to overcome them will be helpful to FF project stakeholders. In this study, an extensive literature synthesis was conducted to identify the nature and significance of FF project procurement. The study adopted a qualitative approach consisting of a two-round Delphi survey, which included semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were selected through non-probability sampling. The collected data were analyzed using manual content analysis. The results revealed 16 key procurement issues, which included government bureaucracy, delays in hiring key personnel, regular movements/transfer of core project officials, unstable political conditions of the host country, and the complexity of the loan payment processes. FF project stakeholders can study the findings and revisit their existing procurement practices to reap benefits by adopting the strategies proposed in the study to overcome the procurement issues they face.

The paper presents a governance approach for managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data, informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the identified adoption blockers underpinned by a "mixed approach", that factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is discussed in the context of the recent UK government BIM industry consultation document supported by a research and development (R&D) roadmap taking into account current industry structure and its various levels of stakeholders' maturity, capability and readiness.

In light of the increased levels of public external debt contraction over the last few years, how would the Zambian government approach the process of budget allocation towards infrastructure development in response to the debt servicing charges? This study examines the effects of public external debt servicing on infrastructure spending in Zambia using time series data from 1970 to 2014 and the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag Model or Bounds Testing Approach to Cointegration as emphasized by Pesaran et al. to test for long-run equilibrium relationship. The study takes into consideration that at some point during this period, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was implemented which saw a large sum of Zambia's external debt cancelled. The data which are purely secondary were sourced through the World Development Indicators and Africa Development Indicators database. The regression results show that debt servicing is found to have a negative impact on infrastructure spending in Zambia.

This paper aims to develop a new MFDS model, which attempts to provide a more accurate way to support financial decision-makers in Chinese state-owned construction firms. Owing to the slow progress of passing the construction regulations, coupled with the inherited ownership problems in the Chinese booming construction industry, it is logical for Chinese project managers to make financial decisions with the consideration of the four objective functions (profit margin, risk factors, government relationship and market share), which are realistic representations of the present situation of Chinese construction industry. The proposed MFDS model is a practical method to support financial decision-making. For the model's computational performance, Module 3 (stochastic universal sampling selection, adaptive crossover and adaptive Mutation of Genetic Algorithm) is more superior. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It focused on post-disaster housing reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore and explain the impact of the barriers upon community participation, and how such impact can be eliminated or reduced. The analysed results were extended to facilitate the development of a framework for more successful community participation in post disaster reconstruction. This study identified five common barriers to community participation, which are: lack of community capacity, gender issues, lack of professional competence in NGOs, government policies and practices, and lack of adequate security. A logical framework is proposed as a pragmatic solution for community capacity development activities, which should lead to achieving the following objectives: to re-establish community structure; to encourage sense of project ownership; to provide disaster recovery support; and to provide livelihood opportunities.

Early engineering leadership considers the Corps of Engineers' assistance in developing the nation's infrastructure, Engineering/scientific leadership and technological innovation are key to everyone's quality of life and the nation's global competitiveness. Discoveries/innovations and their expanded and improved applications have become more and more dramatic-from steam engines to extraterrestrial travel and lunar exploration. Because of continued and dramatic future breakthroughs of an ever-accelerating rate, leaders must understand and manage technological change to help the nation be globally competitive. United States history clearly points to the need for its leaders to adequately prepare for this tremendous and ever-accelerating change, especially in this technological and global age. Engineers and scientists must be the future leaders. As such, they must be better educated in the broader issues affected by technology while not compromising their technical competence. Engineers and scientists will lead, participate in, and guide interdisciplinary teams, and be the decision-makers both in business and government in the 21st century.

Price and nonprice criteria for contractor selection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							UTILITY-THEORY; MULTIDIMENSIONAL AUCTIONS; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; GOVERNMENT; MODEL	Although the public sector has a long tradition of using the lowest bid as the award criterion for contracts, reliance on nonprice criteria is increasing. The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain how public owners use multiple criteria for the award of construction contracts. It is likely that nonprice criteria support the alignment of owner and contractor interests, and that bidder behavior should be affected by the likelihood of repeated contracts, and by the transparency of owners' evaluation procedures. Data from 386 bidding documents reflecting practice in Swedish municipalities in 2003 are analyzed. A typical pattern is a 70% price weight combined with three nonprice criteria. Price formulas, translating bid prices into scale values, were found to be based on the lowest bid, bid spread, or average bid. Nonprice criteria were evaluated on either relative or absolute merits. Owners should be aware of the incentives that their selection practices create and view this in a policy perspective, whereas contractors should be ready to assess the short and long term values of nonprice features.

Forty-five government and industry agencies associated with water security were identified. Existing WVA methodologies were compared to the EPA's six-step WVA guidance and an expanded version of the hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) framework for the hardening of water systems, a technique previously used for assessing vulnerability of infrastructure. Neither the AWWA Water System Security Field Guide, nor the Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment Guide for Small Drinking Water Systems were in complete agreement with the EPA's WVA guidance. Inclusion of HHM risk scenarios in the assessed methodologies ranged from 64 to 95%. Fifty-nine of the 112 HHM risk scenarios were not included in at least one, and 34 risk scenarios were not included in at least two WVA methods. No method emerged as a "best practice" technique for small and medium sized water systems. Consistent standards for WVA methods are needed.

However, disputes may occur during a contract management. This paper investigates various public-private partnership (PPP) disputes and their critical influential factors for associating fundamental project information and dispute resolutions. In this study, knowledge is extracted from the association rules so that dispute handling patterns can be identified from historical database. Analytical results show that the rule sets achieve 83.92% confidence level. By applying the results in practice, project managers can determine the likely method for dispute resolutions with known project attributes, dispute items, and the phase in which a dispute occurs. This research demonstrates an effective application and valuable reference for early notice of dispute handling methods in public infrastructure projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Although this scenario is uncommon, there are relevant examples that negatively impact the economy and society. Despite their relevance, unfinished megaprojects are scarcely discussed in project studies. However, political events such as a referendum or government transitions jeopardize the continuation of the megaproject, leading to its termination. This paper focuses on unfinished infrastructure megaprojects and employs the escalation of commitment as a theoretical perspective. It addresses the following research question: How political polarization fosters escalation of commitment leading to unfinished infrastructure megaprojects? The paper employs a longitudinal case study, the USD 13 billion Mexico City New International Airport, recently terminated during the construction phase due to a political decision. The paper describes the interplay between the development of infrastructure megaprojects and political polarization. It shows how political narratives can portray a misleading escalation of commitment to justify project termination, even when it is not rational.

Design Error Costs in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Designers; Errors; Costs; Procurement method; Project type	PROCUREMENT; REWORK; MANAGEMENT	Design errors can adversely influence project performance and can contribute to failures, accidents, and loss of life. Although there has been a considerable amount of research that has examined design error causation, little is known about design error costs. With increasing emphasis placed on the use of nontraditional forms of procurement methods as a result of various government reports and the advent of Building Information Modelling there is a general perception that design error costs will be significantly less than those projects procured by traditional means. By using a questionnaire survey, estimates for design error costs were obtained from 139 projects. The mean direct and indirect costs for design errors were revealed to be 6.85 and 7.36% of contract value, respectively. Design error costs were found not to significantly vary with procurement method and project type used. Although the research provides invaluable insights into practitioners' perceptions of design errors costs, their actual costs remain relatively unexplored. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000454.

J	Na, LJ; Ofori, G; Park, M				Na, Lim Jay; Ofori, George; Park, Moonseo			Stimulating construction innovation in Singapore through the National System of Innovation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction management; innovation; simulation; Singapore		This paper examines the national approach to the stimulation of innovation in construction. Based on a qualitative systems thinking approach, a model of the National System of Innovation (NSI) is structured with five main NSI actors: local contractors; suppliers; national research institutions; government; and foreign contractors. This model, established by the assumption that local contractors' key motivation for innovation is based on profit maximization, highlights two main driving forces of construction innovation within the NSI: profit incentives and the social desirability of higher construction productivity and quality. The research findings indicate that high profit levels provide a higher number of growth momentums compared to the social desirability of innovation. Additionally, although social desirability of construction innovation is associated with a number of obstacles, high profit levels do not impose any significant hindrances. Based on the research findings, it is concluded that innovation policies should be focused on sustaining higher profit levels of contractors. The social desirability of innovation can be more efficiently utilized by regular reviews of national policies as the industry develops.

J	Bao, HJ; Peng, Y; Ablanedo-Rosas, JH; Gao, HM				Bao, Haijun; Peng, Yi; Ablanedo-Rosas, Jose Humberto; Gao, Hongman			An alternative incomplete information bargaining model for identifying the reasonable concession period of a BOT project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build-operate-transfer (BOT); Concession period; Bargaining model; Incomplete information	BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER; PUBLIC-SECTOR EFFICIENCY; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; NEGOTIATION; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT	Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme has been widely advocated with increasing demand of public infrastructure in recent years. As a critical component of the BOT contract, identifying concession period has been emphasized by both researchers and practitioners. However, existing studies usually assume the availability of complete information for decision-making, which is unreasonable in real-life projects. Therefore, this study develops a model to identify the reasonable concession period of a BOT project by utilizing incomplete information bargaining analysis. The model provides more guidelines for decision-making under the constraints of incomplete information. A hypothetical case from existing studies is used to demonstrate the procedure of the model. The model provides an alternative tool for the government to design the concession period before BOT tendering, which would reduce relevant negotiations after bidding. Limitations and relevant future studies have also been discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to explore how public acceptance can be affected by people's emotional responses to recycled water. In study 1, the general population was divided into four groups, clustering analysis with the intensity of various emotions was conducted, and the association between emotions and acceptance was explored. In study 2, the emotions, people's acceptance, and "objects of care" of water treatment experts were compared with those of members of the general population for further study. We found that the objects of care shortened the psychological distance between individuals and recycled water, which led people to generate specific emotions to recycled water. In a broader context, the study suggested that various emotions motivate people's behavior to accept or oppose the use of recycled water.

With this purpose, four Portuguese case studies are carefully examined. The authors argue that the lessons provided by the literature are not being implemented by public authorities. In fact, while crafting these new governance structures, local governments seem to fail in protecting the public interest. To cope with this state of affairs, the authors draw a risk management strategy and advocate several contract management guidelines. The authors' findings suggest that increasing transparency in procurement procedures and fostering the standardization of the tender documents and contractual clauses are absolute requirements in achieving value for money. Albeit these best practices are now beginning to be prevalent among academics and practitioners, local decision makers still strive to cope with the complex process of handling the whole life-cycle management of PPP arrangements.

Pavement Maintenance-Focused Decision Analysis on Concession Periods of PPP Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Highway; Public-private partnership (PPP); Concession period; Pavement maintenance; Stakeholders; System dynamics (SD)	SYSTEM DYNAMICS; MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; SIMULATION; CONTRACT; MODEL	There are dynamic, interactive, and long-term relationships among the highway pavement performance, operator's toll income and maintenance costs, the users' satisfaction or willingness to travel, the government's satisfaction, and decisions during the concession period of the public-private partnership (PPP) highway project. This study adopts a system dynamics (SD) model to simulate such complex interactions among the highway pavement performance and stakeholders' relevant factors during the concession period of the PPP highway project, in which pavement maintenance is emphasized. The SD model is able to evaluate the rationality of the concession period and stakeholders' impacts in terms of the net present value (NPV). Justification and demonstration of the proposed SD model are presented based on an example project and a series of simulation experiments. This study is aimed at providing a methodology to help either the public sector or the private investor evaluate concession decision-making by addressing pavement maintenance of the PPP highway project.

Using Public-Private Partnerships to Expand Subways: Madrid-Barajas International Airport Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ECONOMICS	In the beginning of 2006, the regional government of Madrid decided to expand the subway network to the new Terminal T-4 in Madrid-Barajas International Airport using a public-private partnership (PPP) approach. Owing to the peculiar characteristics of this new access as the enlargement of an existing subway line, the PPP approach was based on separating infrastructure management from transportation service operation. The PPP contractor was entrusted with the infrastructure construction and maintenance while Madrid's public subway company remained in charge of operating the trains. This paper examines the theoretical foundation that justifies the implementation of different PPP approaches to deal with urban rail projects. The paper then explains the reasons why a nonintegrated PPP approach was ultimately adopted for the expansion of Madrid's subway network to the airport. From the outcome of the tender and the present operation performance, we find that nonintegrated PPP contracts have important advantages for urban rail PPPs, particularly for conventional subway networks. These advantages are notable in terms of encouraging economies of scale and density, boosting competition, and reducing the financial costs.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Contracting relationship trends and transitions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS	Construction industry reports worldwide have called for radical cultural changes to reduce adversarial conflicts and increase productivity levels. These reports have recommended reintegration of fragmented function and teams through different teamworking approaches such as partnering and alliancing. The theoretical basis for Such approaches can be tracked back to relational contracting (RC) principles. Recent teamworking initiatives have met with some success, based on structured cooperation between owners and contractors. However, the full benefits of these cooperative approaches may only materialize if (1) all potential team members/project partners are selected on the basis of relevant rationalized evaluation criteria; (2) all stakeholders work closely together as a coalesced team with common objectives, and (3) these arrangements are underpinned by government-sponsored, proper change initiatives. These approaches and arguments are analyzed in this paper, aiming at developing the required project culture through the application of RC principles for the joint management of risks during the entire project life cycle. Relevant observations from two recent Hong Kong-based industry surveys indicate a high motivation toward such approaches. Finally, examples of some potentially beneficial change initiatives are used to illustrate the potential synergies that are achievable.

To investigate this, the paper looks at a project on the implementation of the electronic system of business registration in Albania, a developing country in transition. The study introduces the concept of Obligatory Passage Channels (OPCs), building on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and the Circuits of Power Model (CPM). An OPC is defined as the mechanism that gives momentum to the flows of power in a multi-actor project network. Findings show that the social circuit of causal power is characterized by OPCs related to need and vision. The systemic circuit of facilitative power is shaped by OPCs related to coordination and capabilities. The episodic circuit of dispositional power is characterized by the interoperability OPC. This study contributes to a better understanding of network politics in multi-actor information system projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The efficiency of SHA in utilizing the bridge management systems (BMSs) available to them is analyzed, and the agencies' readiness to respond to events such as hurricanes, flooding, or earthquakes is evaluated. The paper addresses issues regarding bridges with unknown foundations, interviewing four structural engineers from three SHA regarding these topics. Bridge management officials across the country will benefit from this research by evaluating their agencies' current practices in comparison with other state agencies. Findings show that state officials attempt to follow very closely the guidelines set by the federal government for bridge inspection and maintenance. However, it was also discovered that, during catastrophic events, agencies rely heavily on managing engineers' experience and decision-making capabilities because there is no set of response procedures for these extreme conditions. Although powerful BMS tools are available, few SHA utilize these tools to their full capabilities.

Questions still remain as to how to cultivate a facilitating institutional environment for developing PPP projects success. This paper examines such a question, focusing on the institutional analysis of the Chinese context. A theoretical framework of PPP governance is first developed, identifying the logics and interactions of the differentiating levels in the PPP system. Then, the institutional framework of China is presented with regard to its cultural, legal, and administrative characteristics, as the embeddedness of PPP development. Thereafter, the evolution of Chinese institutions with particular regard to PPP is analyzed. Findings show that changes in the institutional arrangements have to go in tandem with introduction of PPP, and performance of PPP is closely related with its institutional environment. Suggestions are put forward to enhance China's institutional arrangements for healthy PPP promotion, and the implications for governments and investors in other countries are described.

A structurally different performance-based regulation document was published in 2001. A continuous research effort paralleled these developments, leading recently to the Policy Document on Building Regulations 2002-06 and the approval of a new national programme called Process and System Innovation in Building (PSIB). Actual and future developments are strongly influenced by the turmoil following the recent disclosure of the wide use of outlawed settlement of calculation cost and project 'rights' by the Dutch contractors. In addition, some blatant cases of fraudulent contract administration were revealed. By the end of 2003, key stakeholders within both the government and industry were in agreement that there was a need for radical change of the economic and social performance of the building and construction sector. The PSIB programme, in combination with a strong deregulation initiative. will be the major driver for the application of the performance approach in the sector.

J	Freeman, PK				Freeman, PK			Allocation of post-disaster reconstruction financing to housing	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						developing countries; disaster mitigation; disaster planning; disaster recovery; housing; post-disaster assistance; public policy; reconstruction funding; risk management		The allocation of a significant portion of post-natural disaster financing to housing reconstruction in poorer countries is examined. Many poorer countries are reliant on external assistance in the form of loans or grants to meet their post-disaster reconstruction needs. Today, half of all the post-disaster borrowing provided by the World Bank is earmarked for the reconstruction of housing. Should this high proportion of limited reconstruction funds be allocated to a fundamentally private sector need? Is such an allocation economically efficient? After exploring these questions, an alternative solution is examined for government funds to be allocated to high economic return projects ( e. g. infrastructure) and to meeting the needs of the poor. The allocation of funding to housing, much of which is captured by the economic and social elite, seems a misallocation of scarce resources. This is particularly the case since the funding available for post-disaster reconstruction by the international financial institutions is constrained and unable to meet anticipated future demand.

J	Carmichael, DG; Nguyen, TA; Shen, XS				Carmichael, David G.; Tuan Anh Nguyen; Shen, Xuesong			Single Treatment of PPP Road Project Options	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership (PPP or P3); Build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT); Options; Toll roads; Financial agreements; Unified treatment	MINIMUM REVENUE GUARANTEE; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; REAL OPTIONS; GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES; HIGHWAY PROJECTS; VALUATION; ALLOCATION	Recent publications have shown the role that options play in addressing the uncertainty, risk, and fairness in public-private partnership (PPP or P3) agreements in toll road projects. Typically, the literature uses financial market options techniques and applies these by analogy. Each option is presented and analyzed in standalone papers. In contrast, this paper presents an original single unifying approach for analyzing all PPP toll road options, an approach based on discounted probabilistic cash flows. The approach is a straightforward extension of conventional engineering viability analysis of projects, and does not rely on the financial market options literature. It offers a ready way to evaluate multiple options, requires minimal financial and mathematical knowledge, and hence can be readily implemented by practitioners. The paper also serves as a state-of-the-art literature summary as related to options in PPP toll road projects. The paper will be of interest to anyone involved in PPP toll road projects.

This paper presents an econometric model that describes the relationship between the level of sustainability experience a firm possesses and its characteristics and behavioral attributes. Data for this research were collected in Qatar by means of a survey as part of a study that aimed to analyze the triggers of sustainability adoption in the Qatari construction market. The presented model showed that a number of behavioral attributes of firms, besides their origin and the average size of projects they undertake, determine the level of sustainability experience these firms might have. Examples include firms' risk-taking tendencies, their claimed competitive advantages, and their previous history of introducing changes to their modus operandi. This research adds to the body of knowledge on sustainable construction by studying its adoption from an organizational behavior perspective that focuses on factors internal to the firms. This complements existing literature that studies external triggers such as governmental policies.

An assessment model was developed as a tool to identify the baseline conditions of contractors' readiness, i.e. awareness, willingness, and capacity towards sustainability practices. The model involves parameters and indicators derived from green building and green contractor concepts, and sustainable construction best practices. The scoring system for these parameters and indicators was set up through discussions with experts using the Delphi method facilitated by the Ministry of Public Works. Trial surveys were conducted to refine the model. A preliminary portrayal of existing conditions in Indonesia was assessed using the proposed readiness assessment model. This limited survey indicated that while large contractors are fully aware and willing, they have been only partly implementing sustainability practices. Because the process of developing the model had involved experts and champions of the industry/stakeholders, and was also led by the government/Ministry of Public Works, the proposed assessment model should be inherently acceptable for industry-wide application.

A satellite-hub model concept is proposed as an appropriate way forward. To set the scene, the complex nature and difficulty of the problem of achieving real energy reductions in housing is highlighted and research opportunities for current and forthcoming housing and energy policy measures are investigated. A range of recent and on-going research funding programmes managed by UK Research Councils, government departments and industry are appraised in the context of relevant policy measures and criteria that the authors consider to be essential for rapid and high-quality research in domestic energy reduction. Finally, the implementation of the concept of a satellite-hub model is explored through the structure and operation of a domestic energy use and retrofit research satellite-hub on a regional and national level. This provides an insight into a potential evolutionary change in the research of energy use and demand reduction in existing housing.

Although people's living quality improves and transportation needs increase, the environmental quality is destroyed with rapid economic and traffic growth. The concept of traffic assignment, an important procedure for transportation planning, should take all needs into consideration. Based on the viewpoints of all constituencies, this paper attempts to determine optimal flow patterns using three objectives-total travel time for road users, air pollution for nonusers (such as community residents), and travel distance for government-to formulate an effective multiobjective model for traffic assignment. By using multiobjective decision making and nonlinear programming techniques, a series of noninferior solutions is generated. By combining an eigenvector weighting method with pairwise comparison, we obtain a compromise solution for the flow pattern. An application case for the Taipei network system is also presented and discussed. The results show that if other nontraffic related factors are taken into account, the multiobjective traffic-assignment approach is more reasonable and suitable than conventional approaches.

Case studies of green star accredited office building projects were undertaken in China and Australia. Case data were collected through focused group workshops, face-to-face interviews and desktop studies, and analysed by using social network analysis methods. The results show that while reputation risk is important in both countries, the ethical risk of 'assessment experience and fairness' has been highlighted as crucial in the Chinese context. The results further show that government plays an important role in improving the societies' knowledge and awareness on green technology uptake in China. The social network analysis method in this research improves the effectiveness and accuracy of stakeholder and risk analysis by demystifying the social complexity which is usually overlooked in traditional linear risk impact analysis.

Based on previous studies, a questionnaire survey was developed to investigate the relationships between reported risk and success factors, and the performance of ventures. Through structural equation modeling, the paper empirically examines the effect of key processes such as partner selection, venture formation, and operation on venture performance. The results provide evidence that local partner attributes influence venture formation which, in turn, is strongly and positively related to its operation. These results also suggest that the negative impact of host government-related risks on venture formation is direct, while their impact on venture performance is indirect, through creating a "less certain" operating environment. Project-related risks appear to have strong and negative dual "direct and indirect" effects on venture performance. Based on these empirical results, the paper advocates that selecting a suitable complementary local partner and adopting a proactive risk management strategy are vital antecedents to successful venture performance.

The Taiwan government frequently applies the best-value (BV) tendering method, a multi-criteria evaluation method, to procure projects. However, the selection process of the winner for a BV-based procurement project is generally subjective and thus is easily accused of corruptions. To develop a systematic method to support contractor selection, this study proposes using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to facilitate the criteria evaluations for each bidder during the short-listing stage. The evaluation results of using the DEA are a list of potential BV winners who are then suggested to enter into the final selection stage. Based on three case studies related to service procurement projects, this research finds that the DEA is suitable of assessing the relative efficiencies among bidders when the BV approach is applied. Lessons learned here should be helpful in applying the DEA to aid bid evaluations in other supplier selection problems.

Despite the benefits found in the manufacturing industry, EVA has not been widely implemented in the Malaysian construction industry. This study is aimed to determine the advantages of EVA over other project control methods, to determine the suitability of implementing EVA in construction projects, and to develop a working flowchart as a guide in implementing EVA. Accordingly, qualitative approaches including the structured interview survey and the flowchart development were employed in this study. Findings reveal that comparing to stochastic methods, Fuzzy logic model, and miscellaneous methods, the EVA has remarkable advantages in accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability for complexity. Malaysian government has decided to implement EVA to enhance the level of project management for the whole country. Hence, an EVA working flowchart was developed by the authors, through which more detailed project status could be monitored and more accurate future performance of the project could be forecasted.

We hypothesized that national differences in institutional environments would lead to less active governance and information-exchange activities within Japanese R&D consortia relative to their U.S, counterparts. At the consortium level, we expected that internal consortium diversity would increase information exchange and governance requirements, and that structures stabilizing relations between consortium members would reduce information-exchange and governance requirements. We tested these hypotheses on 39 U,S, and 54 Japanese multiform R&D consortia, involving, respectively, 1801 U,S, member organizations and 1647 Japanese member organizations. Controlling for organizational age, size, and strategic focus, we found that internal diversity and interorganizational relations are both associated with information-exchange and governance mechanisms. Our model has much greater explanatory power for the United States than for Japan.

J	De Clerck, D; Demeulemeester, E				De Clerck, Dennis; Demeulemeester, Erik			An ex ante bidding model to assess the incentive creation capability of a public-private partnership pipeline	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP; Contract procurement and tendering; Multi-project bidding; Simulation	SEQUENTIAL AUCTIONS; CONCESSION PERIOD; PROCUREMENT; RISK; EQUILIBRIUM; CONTRACTS; SYNERGIES; PROJECTS; STRATEGY; COSTS	The inherent risky nature of public private partnerships requires contractors to develop expensive project proposals, which is seen as a burden to enter the playing field. It is believed that a pipeline of projects could succeed in triggering contractors' enthusiasm and increasing competition. This paper theoretically assesses whether the pipeline serves as an effective tool to levy this barrier to entry. A theoretical model and a simulation experiment that mimics the tendering process with heterogeneity in the bidders' cost structure are presented. In particular, the impact on the ex ante bid preparation effort willingness and the mark-ups is assessed by heuristically approximating the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A statistical scenario analysis approves that mark-ups are lower when more projects are included in the pipeline, leading to fiercer price competition and a lower government procurement cost. Nonetheless, the incentive creation with respect to investment efforts is limited according to the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The idea of BRI is based on the revival of the ancient Silk Road, a trade route that was once connecting China with Central Asia, India, Middle East, Western Asia, and Europe. More than 1,700 infrastructure projects are planned to be implemented under BRI. Such a huge infrastructure investment brings a lot of opportunities as well as risks for nations along the Silk Road, their governments, contractors, and investors. Compared to traditional international construction projects, BRI projects are exposed to additional risks since they are geographically distributed and complex in nature and include more stakeholders. Hence, risk assessment of BRI projects is a complex task that requires an efficient tool capable of providing detailed information about critical risks. To bridge this gap, a novel method is developed and applied to the risk assessment of complex, geographically distributed, and large-scale infrastructure projects, such as BRI projects. The proposed risk assessment method integrates fuzzy matrices, fuzzy logic, and probabilistic theory into a single approach that is applied to assess risks in BRI projects for different regions, as well as regional risk and total risk. In addition, sensitivity analysis is used to optimize the proposed fuzzy logic-based risk assessment method. The key findings are as follows: (1) the main risks in BRI projects are delay in supplying materials, increases in material prices, poor quality of materials, delays in equipment delivery, increases in the costs of equipment use, and economic risk; (2) the highest risk-ranked regions in BRI projects are Central Asia and Eastern Europe, while the lowest risk-ranked region is East Asia; and (3) a weighted-average method is the optimal defuzzification method for the proposed fuzzy logic-based method. The theoretical contribution of this research is a novel risk assessment method that integrates expert judgment, fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, fuzzy matrices, and probabilistic theory into a single approach supported by sensitivity analysis. In practical terms, this study provides significant information about risks in various regions, regional risk, and overall risk of BRI projects to contractors, investors, and other stakeholders.

To ensure the safety and stability in the lifting process of steel corridor construction and to prevent sudden overload-from affecting the later normal use, the finite element simulation of steel corridor before lifting and real-time monitoring during the lifting process were carried out. The results of finite element simulation were compared with the stress and deflection data monitored in real time. It shows that the numerical data obtained from the finite element methods (FEM) are slightly larger than those from the actual monitoring. It follows that the results obtained from FEM for the lifting is safer, the data obtained from FEM and monitoring agree with each other, and, accordingly, the study shows that the monitoring approach is applicable. The integral lifting scheme and monitoring approach presented here can be used as an interesting reference for similar projects.

Jonathan			Developing a systemic lessons learned knowledge model for organisational learning through projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Knowledge management; Lessons learned; Organisational learning; Swiss cheese model	HIGH-RELIABILITY; PATIENT SAFETY; RISK; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; REVIEWS; CULTURE	A significant challenge for government and business project organisations is to ensure that lessons are learned and that mistakes of the past are not repeated. Both knowledge and project management literature suggests that in practice lessons learned processes rarely happen, and when it does it is concerned with lessons identification rather than organisational learning. There are limited practical models for general management to use to conceptualise what organisational learning is and therefore how to enable it. However, aspects of health care, nuclear power, rail, and aviation organisations have successfully implemented organisational learning by way of the Swiss cheese model for safety and systemic failures. This paper proposes an adaptation of the Swiss cheese model to enable project organisations to conceptualise how they learn from past project experiences and distribute successful project know-how across an organisational network of elements such as individual learning, culture, social, technology, process and infrastructure.

Barriers to employment for refugees seeking work in the Australian construction industry: an exploratory study	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Corporate social responsibility; Human resource management; Collaboration; Employment; Migrants; Social procurement; Social value; Refugees		Purpose In Australia, as in many other countries, refugees are over-represented in the ranks of the unemployed, under-employed and precariously employed and often become frustrated in their attempts to secure work. Despite the construction industry being a major potential source of employment for refugees, there has been a surprising lack of research into their experiences of securing work in the industry. Addressing this gap and also the general lack of voice for refugees in construction research, the aim of this paper is to explore the barriers refugees face in securing employment in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports a survey of refugees who have worked or attempted to seek work in the Australian construction industry. Findings Results show that the main barriers to securing employment in construction are: lack of local work experience; employer discrimination; employer failure to recognise previous qualifications, skills and experience and employers not understanding the challenges they face. Government employment agencies and systems are also perceived to be of limited value and overly complex, in contrast to the activities of not-for-profit support agencies. Research limitations/implications While the research is limited to Australia, the findings contribute an important and missing refugee dimension to the emerging body of research on construction social procurement. They also contribute unique sector-specific insights into the broader debate about refugee resettlement and employment. Further research is needed in other national contexts. Practical implications Recommendations are made to address the barriers to employment identified including: initiatives to provide refugees with work experience in the industry; education to break-down negative stereotypes of refugees among employers; greater support for not-for-profits supporting refugees and reform of government and employment agency systems and procedures. Social implications By enhancing understanding of the barriers to employment for refugees in construction and proposing solutions to reduce those barriers, this research contributes new insights into a growing global challenge of how we better integrate growing numbers of refugees into harmonious and prosperous societies. Originality/value The findings are important in facilitating the smoother integration of refugees into society. Beyond the moral imperative, there are significant social, cultural and economic benefits which successful refugee integration brings to host countries and industries like construction which in many countries are now being required to employ refugees in their workforce as a condition of public sector contracts.

The Contingency Role of Market Dynamism	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Inbound open innovation (OI); informal ties; market dynamism; outbound OI	OUTBOUND OPEN INNOVATION; FIRM PERFORMANCE; POLITICAL TIES; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MANAGERIAL TIES; WEAK TIES; KNOWLEDGE; BUSINESS; SEARCH; TECHNOLOGY	Scholars and practitioners have recently shifted their attention from traditional closed internal innovation to open innovation (OI). Building on both the resource-based view and the network perspective, we explore the roles of three types of informal ties (i.e., business, government, and university) in driving inbound and outbound OI, and further examine such effects contingent on market dynamism. Empirical results from our study of 260 Chinese firms show that all three types of informal ties positively affect inbound innovation openness, whereas only business ties facilitate outbound innovation openness. In addition, market dynamism strengthens the relationship between university ties and inbound innovation openness, but weakens the effect of business ties on inbound innovation openness. These findings indicate the salience of informal ties in increasing innovation openness and the contingent role of external market conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the drivers of innovation openness, and help clarify the differences between inbound and outbound OI.

Considering the public client, so far researchers have been looking at him in a passive role with respect to project success. The focus of this exploratory research is what public project managers who are actively involved in the project, consider project success. Using Q-methodology, we identify four viewpoints in the respondent group, consisting of managers from five North-Western European countries and the specific success criteria accompanying these viewpoints. Within each viewpoint, the managers have the same vision on the ranking of project success criteria. Next to the conventional project manager, we distinguish the product driven manager, the parent oriented manager and the manager with a stakeholder focus. In Large Infrastructure Projects, where public and private partners collaborate, awareness of these different perspectives will help to understand the motives of the public project manager.

Yet, AHP was criticized that DMs often cannot provide strictly consistent comparisons in a pairwise weighting matrix (PWM). The present study proposes an automatic repair procedure for the inconsistent PWM. The procedure seeks a substitute PWM, which can pass the consistency test, and yet being as close as possible to the primitive PWM. The repair is performed by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, whose control parameters are tuned using the Taguchi method. The proposed procedure, by automatically adjusting the PWM with the approval of DMs, can greatly facilitate the process of contractor selection and thus expedite the entire procurement function. Two practical cases are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed procedure, in comparison with previous work. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a model to assess public-sector capital project portfolio management (CPPM). Our objective was to create an assessment protocol to measure how effectively and efficiently public-sector capital assets are managed. We built on the tenets of asset management and improving service delivery, specifically focusing on the project, portfolio, and business management domains. In developing this model of measuring federal real property management capabilities, we identified and evaluated a wide range of decision-making process activities in managing these assets. Using the capability maturity model framework, we then developed and validated the system-level CPPM capability model. When applying the model, managers can assess organizational performance in a structured repeatable process. Model results help managers identify strengths and weaknesses in the organization, identify best appropriate practices, and get credit for the good things they have done as they measure their performance in improving service delivery.

Existing optimization methods fail to provide certain confidence level of the optimization result of PPP capital structure. The aim of this paper to optimize the capital structure of PPP projects by developing a chance-constrained programming (CCP) method with a certain confidence level under project risks. The results show that compared with existing methods, CCP method yields a greater optimal equity share, smaller NPV value, and higher confidence level depending on private sector's risk preference. Besides, the optimal equity share is mainly determined by banks' requirement and government regulation on commitment and it shrinks as banks' risk preference grows. Theoretical calculation and simulation technique were adopted to make the result more convincing. The paper can help the private sector to more reasonably and reliably determine the optimal capital structure according to their risk preference.

A sensemaking perspective is mobilized to empirically study how project actors perceive the effects on government efficiency, legitimacy and accountability of Quebec's (Canada) governance framework. Results highlight the specificities and tensions between these three objectives, exploring the positive accounts, potential improvements and dynamic aspects associated with each. Using a multilevel perspective, results show that each level is related to a central objective: the institutional level with legitimacy, the organizational level with accountability and the project level with efficiency. Tensions are found within each level but more importantly between them, as some objectives oppose the others, making it challenging to attain an overall equilibrium. This exploratory research, based on 44 interviews and abductive theory building, broadens understanding of the governance of public megaprojects, notably by applying a sensemaking lens to an institutional policy that seeks to improve project performance.

A questionnaire-based survey designed to test the effect of non-economic drivers on MCB revealed that the pursuit of social value and self-serving motivation, including firm development and political appeal, function as significant non-economic drivers of MCB. And the self-serving motivation to perform MCB is generally less significant than the pursuit of social value, and the relationship between selfserving motivation and MCB is partially moderated by the governmental connections of the megaprojects. In government-hosted construction megaprojects, when the governmental connections of the individual participating entity are as strong as those of the megaproject itself, MCB engagement is actually driven by the pursuit of firm development and political appeal even where the apparent driver is the pursuit of social value.

Evaluating barriers inhibiting investors participation in Public-Private Partnership project bidding process using structural equation model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Public-Private partnership; structural equation model; construction industry; Nigeria	FIT INDEXES; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; DECISION	The study investigates the critical barriers restraining private investors from participating in the PPP construction project bidding process. Hence, three key potential inhibiting factors, which include political constraints, public sector poor PPP capacity, and undefined project scope, were investigated. Therefore, the study adopted a quantitative research technique through a questionnaire survey to obtain data from 384 PPP practitioners sample representative in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria. The survey recorded 274 responses, and SmartPLS (v.3.2.3) was used for the data analysis. The study developed a conceptual model to formulate hypotheses which were validated with Smart PLS3. Findings from the study indicated that the three key factors have a significant effect on the private investor's decision not to participate in the PPP bidding process.

S. construction industry. This study investigates the root causes of this issue as well as the existing attempts to manage these causes effectively. Cultural barriers are one of the root causes that have not been fully explored. This detailed investigation expands into an exploration of cultural barriers and differences, variables that are directly attributable to construction site safety. A survey instrument was designed to evaluate the existence and influence of these differences at U. S. construction sites, and data were collected from construction supervisors across the United States. The results of the survey strongly suggest the existence of two differences: high power distance and collectivism cultural dimensions. Based on the survey results and feedback from construction supervisors, recommendations for best practices in workforce development that guides construction professionals and researchers are suggested.

The AHP framework was structured as a "vertical" XHP with "horizontal" fuzzy scoring. Original inputs for the index system were elicited from a survey of expert evaluators on a national level. The AHP-based system was then applied by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology to evaluate a large number of completed R&D projects from multiple fields. The new R&D evaluation system reduced the heavy workload for experts and government agencies, significantly enhanced the efficiency and quality of the award process, and made the evaluation process transparent and fair. In addition, the new evaluation system was user-friendly and fully computerized, an important attribute required for widespread usage. Although the system was initially developed for R&D project evaluation, it can be extended to evaluations in other fields such as investment selection in venture capital and in corporate capital budgeting.

However, a number of PPP projects have suffered serious risk scenarios and ended up with project failures. The change from a short-term contract period of traditional projects (fewer than five years) to a long-term contract period of PPP projects (20-30 years) has raised challenges to the traditional risk management. The high occurrence of renegotiations and early terminations of PPP projects suggest that ex ante risk management is no longer enough and ex post risk management is needed. This study aims to propose an ex post risk management model, under which renegotiations and early terminations are introduced. The application of this model begins with risk impact evaluation, then ex post risk response measures assessment, selection, and enforcement. An illustrative case is provided in the Appendix at the end of the article. The outputs of this study would facilitate governments' decision making in PPP projects under serious risk scenarios.

Infrastructure projects will continue to be developed in the coming years, particularly in developing countries such as China and India; therefore, it is important to find methods and solutions for improving the sustainability of them. Although existing studies have suggested various methods for practicing sustainable development principles in the process of implementing infrastructure projects, effective assessment indicators are unavailable, which presents a barrier to the effective assessment of infrastructure project sustainability. This study introduces key assessment indicators (KAIs) for assessing the sustainability performance of an infrastructure project. The research data used for analysis were collected from a questionnaire survey given to three groups of experts, including government officials, professionals, and clients in the Chinese construction industry. The fuzzy set theory was used to establish KAIs. A procedure for using the KAIs is demonstrated by a case study. These research findings provide an alternative solution to appraise the sustainability of infrastructure projects. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000315.

Existing valuation methods address traffic flow estimations using linear models, which yield point estimates of traffic predictions regardless of traffic flow volatility. Additionally, considering traffic projections alone ignores the financial risk of these projects, which is an important variable for public-private partnership (PPP) projects. The framework is demonstrated by simulating scenarios based on the model. The model accounts for possible traffic flow pathways and paths that interest rates can take, resulting in the net present value probability distribution for the project. The outcome is the risk profile of the project under consideration. The constructed profile can be employed for analysis by both government agencies and the concessionaire and can thus promote a more efficient environment for contracting purposes. Finally, various applications of the model, including determining the operation period to be allowed for the concessionaire, setting the toll rates, and determining the impact of other policies, are discussed.

J	Cruz, CO; Marques, RC; Pereira, I				Cruz, Carlos Oliveira; Marques, Rui Cunha; Pereira, Ines			Alternative Contractual Arrangements for Urban Light Rail Systems: Lessons from Two Case Studies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractual arrangements; Public-private partnership (PPP); Risk sharing; Urban light rail systems (ULRS); Contracting		The need to improve urban transportation systems in order to decrease travel time and increase their reliability while keeping the costs at an affordable level has led governments to develop public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements in urban light rail systems. Many cities around the world have used the PPP model for the construction of urban light rail systems, particularly light rail, since it provides a quicker and easier answer to financing these large investments. However, different models have been adopted. In most cases a typical design-build-operate-transfer model, with long duration (e.g., 30 years), is used, but other innovative models have also been adopted (e.g., a hybrid model with different contracts for infrastructure construction and maintenance-a 20-year contract-and another for the systems operation-a 5-year contract). This paper addresses the advantages and disadvantages of these models, using one case study for each model. The conclusions show that the hybrid model has the potential to decrease the operation costs, but at the same time to mitigate the interface risk (operation Pi <-> infrastructure).

J	Wang, NN				Wang, Nannan			Correlation Analysis of Capital and Life Cycle Costs in Private Financial Initiative Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Private financial initiative (PFI); Capital cost; Life cycle cost; Cost analysis; Cost model; Public-private partnership (PPP)	MANAGEMENT	Although private financial initiative (PFI) projects have proved to be more expensive to build, the U. K. government believed that it can spend more for less, delivering better value for money (VFM) to public projects. The underlying philosophy is that increased specification of a new asset increases construction costs but redu1ces future cost-of-use, such as the life cycle replacement (LCR) cost of the asset. However, there is a lack of research about whether higher initial capital costs indeed result in a lower long-term LCR cost of PFI projects in practice. In order to discover the relationships between the capital costs of PFI projects and their LCR costs over the concession period, a sample of 30 live PFI projects are selected randomly for correlation analysis. Contrary to the hypothesized negative relationship, a positive correlation is found between the two variables. In order to review the current cost estimate practice, the cost models for LCR costs are reviewed and surveys are carried out to investigate the issues surrounding cost estimates further.

However, in the current practice no unanimous agreement exists on what factors to consider when making capital structure decisions in PPP infrastructure projects. To close this gap, generalized least-squares (GLS) regression analysis was performed on data from 498 projects across 22 countries to identify the capital structure determinants. At the 10% significance level, three project-specific factors (number of sponsors, number of lenders, and contract type) and four country-specific factors (total tax rate, real interest rate, risk premium on lending, and bond market capitalization) were identified as critical. It contributes to the body of knowledge (1) by explaining the financial decision from the lender's perspective, which complements common capital structure theories that focus on sponsors; and (2) by providing sponsors, lenders, and governments with knowledge on the primary factors that drive decisions, which in turn forms the base for effective negotiation and optimization of the capital structure in PPP infrastructure projects.

This article develops a dynamic framework which argues that PPP models evolve when some of the critical success factors (CSFs) for PPP are changed/improved over time based on project sponsors' risk management. The framework consists of four elements: CSFs for PPP, rising risks due to poorly addressed CSFs, the corresponding risk management to change/improve the CSFs, and consequently changed PPP models. Here, CSFs for PPP contain three aspects: external environment, internal project characteristics, and partnership-related factors. The framework is empirically explored with a multiple-case analysis of six toll roads developed in the United States since the late 1980s. The results demonstrate a two-phase evolution of PPP models in the studied context, confirm the theoretical framework, and find that public institutions' risk management can effectively explain the PPP evolution.

Using case study and network-theory based analysis in a large reclamation project, this paper investigated the key stakeholder concerns and concern interdependencies of MEPs, and how they bring major challenges confronted by stakeholders. The network analysis identifies five major challenges of the case: "applying highly advanced and complex construction technology", "mitigating project disruptions to the environment and marine ecology", "conducting public and community consultation during construction phase", "site constraints due to nearby air and marine traffic", and "meeting government standard on the quality of new materials and equipment". Recommendations are provided to alleviate these problems for future MEPs. This paper contributes to a new angle, the network perspective, of analyzing stakeholder concern interdependencies and their practical implications on MEPs. The findings provide useful insights on common pitfalls of MEPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the capability of making accurate landslide assessments is very useful for government agencies to develop land-use planning and mitigation measures. The research objective of this paper is to investigate a novel methodology for spatial prediction of landslides on the basis of the relevance vector machine classifier (RVMC) and the cuckoo search optimization (CSO). The RVMC is used to generalize the classification boundary that separates the input vectors of landslide conditioning factors into two classes: landslide and nonlandslide. Furthermore, the new approach employs the CSO to fine-tune the basis function's width used in the RVMC. A geographic information system (GIS) database has been established to construct the prediction model. Experimental results point out that the new method is a promising alternative for spatial prediction of landslides. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The adaptive learning model suggests contractor organizations would regulate the use of a bidding strategy, which is deemed optimal in response to recurring and similar bidding situations. A data set on open tendering by a select group of contractors was gathered over six years by the Hong Kong government and used to test this premise. The behaviour of the eight newly listed contractors indicates that an upward trend of bidding competitiveness in initial bidding attempts is not a generic phenomenon. The theoretical construct of bidding behaviour in the start-up phase is therefore dubious. Data lend only partial support to the existence of rapid learning during the start-up phase. However, the five more experienced contractors (indicated by the largest number of bidding attempts) show high and consistent bidding competitiveness. This provides evidence that contractors display behavioural regularity when the optimal bidding strategy has been reached. Construction organizations are, therefore, urged to treat organizational learning strategically in their attempts to maintain high competitiveness in the bidding process.

Determination of attractive projects and markets where the competitive advantage of a company is high requires extensive environmental scanning, forecasting, and learning from the experience of competitors in international markets. In this paper, a neuronet model has been developed as a decision support tool that can classify international projects with respect to attractiveness and competitiveness based on the experiences of Turkish contractors in overseas markets. The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.

Recent pressures to improve the UK building industry and its products have so far focused on production and not performance in use. Feedback, however, reveals successes which are not immediately apparent even to experts (when newly completed, the best all-round performer in Probe did not make the shortlist for an environmental award), and that innovations can easily have unintended consequences. Meanwhile, persistent chronic low-level problems need to be tackled if we are to move towards the triple bottom line of more sustainable practice and create a base of sound practice upon which innovations can flourish. Factors for success include making sure essential features are in place; seeking simplicity, usability, manageability and responsiveness; identifying and managing downside risks; a culture of feedback with better benchmarking and constant review against client and design intentions; and more involvement of the supply side in improving and learning from the performance of buildings in use. Seven main themes are explored and initial actions suggested for the key industry players, clients and government.

The results of the cross-case analysis suggest that communities' negative perceptions from government and media can influence their judgement of organizational behaviour. Additionally, this research proposes that local communities' anticipation of the consequences of protesting against the organization can make them decide not to take any action. According to institutional theory, when community individuals arrive at a legitimacy verdict about an organization, their future perceptions will mainly be influenced by this decision rather than conscious consideration of the conditions. Accordingly, this research recommends that organizations aiming to recover their reputation need to adopt compensation activities with a substantial influence on the improvement of conditions. It is only in such conditions that communities will consciously evaluate organizational legitimacy. Trivial changes in organizational behaviour will only result in adding new evidences in support of the illegitimacy of organizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Gorog, M				Goeroeg, Mihaly			Market positions as perceived by project-based organisations in the typical project business segment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Characteristics of a typical project business transaction; Market position of project-based organisations; Project marketing	MODELS	Literature on project marketing mainly focuses on those project-based organisations that are able to supply complex systems primarily for government agencies. Thus, current project marketing literature emphasises the central role of the milieu in which both the constructivistic approach and the associated creative offer are of outstanding importance. Although this segment represents a considerable section of the entire project business, it might be considered to be atypical. Most project-based organisations generally operate in a different segment which is referred to as typical. Consequently, the project marketing approaches propagated for complex system suppliers could not be utilised in the typical project business segment. This paper aims to highlight determinants of the market position perceived by project-based organisations in the typical project business segment. Determinants were firstly drawn from project management literature, then a qualitative empirical research was undertaken to provide empirical evidence for the determinants. The research outcomes may provide the basis for applying project marketing more purposefully in typical project-based organisations in accordance with their likely market position.

The ISO 14000 series offers a framework for managing construction operations to improve environmental performance. To discover the conditions of implementation of ISO 14000 in the construction industry, a structured questionnaire survey was conducted whose results show that the major motivation for implementing the system was to seek entry to the international construction market. Other motivations include standardization of the environmental management procedures for internal operations, obtaining social recognition, gaining confidence from clients and a better corporate image, enhancing the environmental awareness of subcontractors, and cleaner sites as a result of better housekeeping. However, some obstacles remain along the path, such as the financial burden, poor rates of return for most firms, low environmental awareness, and inadequate legal enforcement. Based on the analysis and discussion, the paper concludes that the government should take the lead in encouraging training, providing financial support, and improving the legal framework to promote ISO 14000 for the Chinese construction industry.

Determining the value of these items has a crucial role for successful implementation of BOT projects, especially in BOT projects with direct-negotiation procurement. In this research, first, a financial model of BOT projects is developed according to a real-world situation of bargaining. Then, a finite-horizon alternating-offers bargaining game, as a conflict-resolution tool, is chosen and applied. Uncertainties and risks are taken into account. Based on the sponsor's and government's share of the project's financial benefit, the value of concession period length and equity to debt ratio are determined taking into account the lender's requirements. Finally, the proposed model is implemented in a real-world BOT project to evaluate its applicability and performance. The proposed model enables one to predict the final agreement on concession period length and equity to debt ratio and prevents an unsuccessful negotiation or costly renegotiations.

However, as social consciousness and personal welfare demands increase, social conflicts among external stakeholders, such as local residents, local and central governments, and NGOs, have become more critical factors in enhancing project viability. In Korea, these conflicts have an impact of US $70 billion annually on social costs. To alleviate social conflicts and costs, this study aims to propose a conflict management framework based on twenty-two representative public construction projects. This study identifies and frames the various causes, impacts, and resolutions of conflicts through the case history of project viability. Through these findings, five types of conflict scenarios were derived: project termination, early mitigation, late mitigation, project enforcement, and late occurrence. Furthermore, this study suggests root causes, pathway of conflict propagation, and characteristics of each conflict scenario, which will assist project stakeholders in developing sustainable management for conflict solutions in line with each project's unique situation.

Temperatures were measured in 11 office buildings and thermal comfort transverse surveys of occupants were conducted for over a year in the Tokyo and Yokohama areas of Japan. A total of 4660 samples were collected from about 1350 people. The occupants were found to be highly satisfied with the thermal environment in their offices. Even though the Japanese government recommends the indoor temperature setting of 28 degrees C for cooling and 20 degrees C for heating, the comfort globe temperature was found to be 2.6 degrees C lower in cooling mode and 4.3 degrees C higher in heating mode, in line with actual indoor temperatures. The monthly and seasonal variation in the comfort temperature was found to be significantly lower than those in dwellings. The comfort temperature is related primarily to the indoor temperature, but an adaptive relationship can be derived to estimate the indoor comfort temperature from the prevailing outdoor temperature for similar office buildings.

The bidding process is the main determinant of whether a contractor is commissioned to complete a construction project. Therefore, contractors must rapidly and precisely estimate construction costs and the bid award amount. This study involved optimizing artificial intelligence models to forecast bid award amounts for bridge construction projects. A genetic algorithm is used in several forecasting models, including models based on multiple regression analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and case-based reasoning (OR). Data for public bridge construction projects were collected from the Taiwan government e-procurement system. The cross-validation results show that the mathematical model for the ANNs provides more reliable simulations and has a superior fit compared with the regression methods, CBR, and the conventional approach. This study provides an optimization process for estimating project award prices that improves construction and evaluations of Al-based models as well as an auxiliary tool that contractors can use to make bidding decisions.

J	Denny-Smith, G; Williams, M; Loosemore, M				Denny-Smith, George; Williams, Megan; Loosemore, Martin			Assessing the impact of social procurement policies for Indigenous people	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Australia; counterfactuals; social impact measurement; social procurement; social value; sustainable procurement	EMPLOYMENT	Governments of highly developed western nations with colonised Indigenous populations such as Australia, Canada and South Africa are increasingly turning to social procurement policies in an attempt to solve social inequities between Indigenous people and other citizens. They seek to use policies and funds attached to infrastructure development and construction to encourage private sector companies to provide training, employment and business opportunities for Indigenous people in the communities in which construction occurs. This paper outlines the rise of these policies and their origins, and critiques their connection to Indigenous people's human rights, impact measurement, evaluation and accountability mechanisms. In doing so this paper also explores benefits and potential of social procurement policies, as well as risks. Drawing on insights from an Aboriginal-developed evaluation framework,Ngaa-bi-nya, and Indigenous Standpoint Theory, this paper highlights Indigenous peoples' definitions of value and outlines their relevance to social procurement. Introducing the notion of cultural counterfactuals into social impact measurement research, it also offers a new conceptual framework to enable policymakers and practitioners to more accurately account for social procurement value and impact, including Indigenous people's notions of social value.

Economics of a Hydrogen Bus Transportation System: Case Study Using an After Tax Analysis Model	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Societal Life Cycle Costs; After Tax Analysis; Hydrogen Bus Economics		Because of global warming, governments worldwide are taking actions to reduce green house gases in transportation systems such as bus fleets. All involved aspire to make these changes in an economically efficient manner. This article provides an after tax economic model to help determine pricing (fares), the level of subsidies, the impact of carbon credits, and financial leverage options. Most approaches to compare new technologies use before tax analyses like societal life cycle costs. Most industry analyses use an after tax analysis approach. This article describes and compares both techniques. To illustrate the proposed after tax analysis transportation model, a carbon free bus system fueled by hydrogen is used with data extracted from published sources. Major conclusions are that a carbon credit (from Cap & Trade or carbon tax) provides some economic gain, but does not meet the economic criteria established. Borrowing funds (e.g., using financial leverage) for the capital costs significantly increases the rate of return and could attract investors; however, increased borrowing increases the financial risk and this risk needs to be moderated via risk mitigation strategies (default insurance, etc.). Other financing options need to be explored.

J	Yang, XL; Heidug, W; Cooke, D				Yang, Xiaoliang; Heidug, Wolfgang; Cooke, Douglas			An adaptive policy-based framework for China's Carbon Capture and Storage development	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						CCS; policy; climate change; China		China's political leadership has taken an increasingly public and proactive stance on climate change since 2014. This stance includes making a commitment that Chinese carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will peak around 2030 and enacting measures through the 13th Five Year Plan to support energy efficiency, clean energy technology, and carbon management. Chinese policy-makers consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) a critical bridging technology to help accelerate the decarbonization of its economy. This paper reviews and analyzes Chinese CCS support policies from the perspective of an adaptive policymaking framework, recognizing uncertainty as an inherent element of the policymaking process and drawing general lessons for responding to changing circumstances. Notably, the political support for CCS in China remains fragmented with uncoordinated government leadership, undecided industry players, and even with opposing voices from some leading scientists. There is scope for expanding the framework to provide more granularity, in particular relating to the development of a CCS infrastructure and the development of storage focused CO2-EOR. Overall, given the role CCS can play to decarbonize China's power and other industrial sectors, a commitment to CCS from top policymakers and major stakeholders is needed.

J	Garvin, MJ; Wooldridge, SC; Miller, JB; McGlynn, MJ				Garvin, MJ; Wooldridge, SC; Miller, JB; McGlynn, MJ			Capital planning system applied to municipal infrastructure	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Public owners are challenged by limited and constrained capital sources for acquiring and sustaining infrastructure facilities. They also generally lack supporting automation tools and techniques for analyzing capital investment and project execution decisions, elucidating the impact of these decisions in a holistic manner, and leveraging alternative delivery methods and financing means for competitive advantage. An automated decision support system in development at Massachusetts Institute of Technology provides an integrated planning framework for public owners and engineers to confront these issues. The system, called CHOICES, models life cycle cash flows of capital projects using variable delivery methods and finance options and aggregates them with forecasted operating revenues and expenses at a portfolio level. This paper describes the application of CHOICES to a municipality in Massachusetts. Capital program scenarios were developed using pace of execution and alternate funding sources as primary considerations. Development and analyses of the scenarios suggest that the current municipal environment hinders local infrastructure management and procurement. This is a first-order problem; its solution is likely to outweigh the choice of project delivery for many municipal governments, and it forces municipalities to consider a wide array of alternatives for fulfilling local requirements.

Utility Management System Cost and Time Benefits and Implications from the Local Agency Perspective	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Utility relocation; Utility management systems (UMSs); Subsurface utility engineering (SUE)		Utility management systems (UMSs) have become more common for government agencies, and their use has recently been advocated by AASHTO on a statewide basis. By identifying current utility locations and correlating utility-related information between ongoing and upcoming projects, UMSs can reduce the occurrence of unexpected delays and cost overruns resulting from unforeseen utility conflicts found during construction. This paper presents an analysis of a two-part survey of local agency professionals in the transportation industry, regarding perceptions of UMS cost and time benefits and implications associated with implementation. The paper evaluates two hypotheses regarding local agencies' perception on two key areas: (1) impact of UMS cost and time implementation requirements on implementation decisions; and (2) difference in cost and time benefits and implications for different types of local agencies. The study finds that despite its obvious potential benefits, UMSs are not being widely implemented at the local level because the cost to adopt them is perceived to be high. Additionally, this study found opportunities for improvement that may considerably advance UMS practices. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Sihombing, LB; Simanjuntak, MRA				Sihombing, Lukas Beladi; Simanjuntak, Manlian Ronald Adventus			Analyzing the Hybrid Financing Deep-Discount Project Bonds and Land Leases for a New Toll Road Financing Model	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financing model; Deep discount project bonds; Land lease; Toll road; Infrastructure investments		Infrastructure has been discovered to be the backbone of an economy due to its influence on business and productivity. However, a significant investment funding gap was observed in infrastructural projects, particularly regarding toll roads. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a solution to fill this gap through the use of a hybrid financing model with deep discount project bonds and land leases. Both Latin hypercube and system dynamics simulation methods were used for analysis due to their ability to handle large and complex systems. Moreover, a case study was used to accurately depict the concept. The simulation results showed it is possible to overcome the risk of the ramp-up at first operation by avoiding land acquisition delays, minimizing construction cost, and optimizing toll road tariff and deep discount bond yield interest instead of creating a new entity. Furthermore, it is also possible for the government to improve its revenue by renting the land along the toll road in order to reduce the dependence on land acquisition costs from the state budget allocation.

A systematic review and detailed content analysis of 130 selected articles from well-regarded and relevant academic journals published over the last three decades was conducted. The findings of the content analysis showed that the majority of the selected articles identified risks for construction projects-mainly infrastructure projects-in Asia and Europe, and in most cases the identified risks were either classified based on their nature or listed without any categorization. For identifying risks, combinations of different information-gathering techniques were predominantly used in the selected articles, whereas diagramming and analysis-based techniques were seldom used. The most frequently identified risks were unpredicted change of inflation rate; design errors and poor engineering; and changes in government laws, regulations, and policies affecting the project. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic review and content analysis of published articles related to risk identification, and it provides researchers and industry practitioners with data on the most common risks affecting construction projects.

The qualitative research strategy was adopted, using in-depth face to face interviews. Participants were seven each of Contractors and Consultants using data saturation to limit the number, through purposive sampling technique. Data were analyzed using content analysis technique. The most critical impacts of accidents and hazards on the GCI were identified as slow-down of work, increase in cost of project and poor performance of work. The findings of the study provide knowledge on impacts of accidents and hazards to stakeholders of the GCI and the government in general. Serious steps should be taken by stakeholders to enforce construction health and safety (CHS) practices on construction sites to reduce the high frequency rate of accidents and injuries and the high incidence rate in the GCI. The courts should be encouraged to impose fair and adequate compensation on employers and occasionally punitive or exemplary damages to deter and prevent occurrence of accidents and hazards at construction sites. CHS-related issues have to be given the needed research and academic attention in order to reduce accidents and hazards on sites.

Public Infrastructure Procurement: Detecting Collusion in Capped First-Priced Auctions	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Auctions/bidding; Corruption; Collusion; Probabilistic method; Capped bidding	PRICE; BIDS	Worldwide, numerous economies have been subjected to the unnecessary economic and social impacts that materialize from the collusion that has taken place when public infrastructure has been procured. In an attempt to mitigate this collusion, the Brazilian government introduced laws (e.g., Law 8666/93) that require the procurement of public goods and services to be subjected to capped first-price auctions. For public infrastructure projects, bids are limited by median market prices that are recorded in specific databases and relied on during the selection of bidders. We examine 187 capped first-price auctions with eight or more bids. We reveal that full collusion can be detected if the collective behavior of any auction's bidders is compared to a "but for" scenario that expresses the expected behavior of a group of honest competitors bidding randomly. This comparison makes it possible to flag, using different confidence levels, whether participants in a particular auction fully colluded at the time the bids are known. The contribution of our approach is twofold. It can be used independently or in conjunction with other existing methods to detect the presence of collusive behavior in a capped first-price auction.

To face them, the government decided to promote the first full network of electronic toll highway concessions ever implemented in a metropolitan area worldwide. The toll system was defined fully free-flow and interoperable across all concessions, requiring a complex enforcement mechanism to make it effective. Although previous research studied specific issues of the highway program, an overall analysis of its performance over time was missing. Using a case study methodology, information was gathered from literature review studies, statistical sources, and interviews with key stakeholders. This paper found that the concession model is a feasible alternative to finance and operate a network of urban toll highways using an interoperable electronic toll collection (ETC) system. However, future experiences should take into account crucial aspects such as the need to promote integration with public transportation means, to avoid separation among neighborhoods, and to adopt regulatory measures to prevent congestion in the future.

Surveys were used to generate probability and severity indexes to rank 36 risk factors. Data were collected from 14 companies that are members of the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association. The results indicate that the main risk factors that hinder achieving the tunneling construction project objectives are (1) inaccurate cost estimation or lack of detail in budget preparation, (2) unexpected geological conditions, (3) inaccurate deadline estimation or insufficient breakdown of the project schedule, (4) frequent malfunction of construction equipment, (5) excessive delays in approval processes by government entities, and (6) unexpected soil conditions and water table. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature review is provided to compare these results to international perspectives to confirm the existence of risks inherent to tunnel construction projects. This article concludes with revisiting the risk factors, which are common for the construction industry in general.

School buildings play an important role in these costs. The best strategy for reversing this scenario includes efforts on buildings retrofit, seeking to optimize their energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality. However, in the unfavourable economic climate we are experiencing, which requires great prudence when it comes to public investment, special attention should be given to this multi-objective optimization process. In this research, a methodology to optimize the insulation thickness of the external walls and roof on school buildings retrofit is proposed. The procedure includes the optimization of the building performance considering the following objectives: the minimization of the annual heating load; the minimization of the discomfort in the classrooms due to overheating; and the minimization of the life cycle cost of retrofitting external walls and roof.

J	Verweij, S				Verweij, Stefan			Achieving satisfaction when implementing PPP transportation infrastructure projects: a qualitative comparative analysis of the A15 highway DBFM project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership; Transportation infrastructure project; DBFM; Project implementation; Project management; mvQCA	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; PROCESS MANAGEMENT; QCA; STRATEGIES; COMPLEXITY; DIALOGUE; EDGE	This article investigates how managers in public-private partnership (PPP) projects respond to social or physical events during the implementation of their projects, and which of their responses produce satisfactory outcomes. Multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis (mvQCA) was used to examine the events that took place during a large Dutch Design, Build, Finance and Maintain (DBFM) transportation infrastructure project. The analysis found that most events were social in nature. Private managers' responses to these events were internally-oriented and resulted in dissatisfactory outcomes. In contrast, externally-oriented managerial responses were associated with satisfactory outcomes. The article concludes that both public and private managers need to invest sufficiently in stakeholder management resources and capabilities when implementing projects. Although the intention of DBFM contracts is to lower the burden on the government, public managers still play an important role as intermediaries between the contractor and the local stakeholders and this role should not be underestimated.

This paper examines existing data on 3400 German homes; their calculated energy performance ratings (EPR) are then plotted against the actual measured consumption. The results indicate that occupants consume, on average, 30% less heating energy than the calculated rating. This phenomenon is identified as the 'prebound' effect and increases with the calculated rating. The opposite phenomenon, the rebound effect, tends to occur for low-energy dwellings, where occupants consume more than the rating. A similar phenomenon has been recognized in recent Dutch, Belgian, French and UK studies, suggesting policy implications in two directions. Firstly, using a dwelling's energy rating to predict fuel and CO2 savings through retrofits tends to overestimate savings, underestimate the payback time and possibly discourage cost-effective, incremental improvements. Secondly, the potential fuel and CO2 savings through non-technical measures such as occupant behaviour may well be far larger than is generally assumed in policies so policy-makers need a better understanding of what drives or inhibits occupants' decisions.

Three mechanisms are identified that explain the underlying behavior: switchbacks occur 1) as a natural discovery dynamic, the result of mid-pathway efforts to fill gaps revealed through systems integration; 2) as a strategic framing used by technologists to survive funding shortfalls; or 3) as a revisit of known problems in response to uncertainty in a discrete mission opportunity environment. Although switchbacks are traditionally thought of as deviant events that should be suppressed by managers, this study reveals that many "switchbacks" represent a natural, and necessary, part of the complex technology development process. The implications of these findings are demonstrated by analyzing one dominant funding decision heuristic in terms of the assumptions it embodies and its consistency with the above-described mechanisms. The analysis reveals that efforts to eliminate switchbacks may stifle important innovations without necessarily improving efficiency.

RISK ANALYSIS OF BOT CONTRACTS USING SOFT COMPUTING	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build/Operate/Transfer; Monte Carlo simulation; risk analysis; artificial neural network; contracts	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS; AUTOMATED APPROACH; CONCESSION MODEL; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts have been widely implemented in developing countries facing budget constraints. Analysing the expected variability in project viability requires extensive risk analysis. An objective analysis of various risk variables and their influence on a BOT project evaluation requires study and integration of many scenarios into the concession terms, which is complicated and time-consuming. If the process of negotiating the financial parameters and uncertainties of a BOT project could be automated, this would be a milestone in objective decision-making from various stakeholders' points of view. A soft computing model would let the user incorporate as many scenarios as could be provided. Extensive risk analysis could then be easily performed, leading to more accurate and dependable results. In this research, an artificial neural network model with correlation coefficient of 0.9064 has been used to model the relationship between important project parameters and risk variables. This information was extracted from sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation results obtained from conventional spreadsheet data. The resulting consensus would yield to fair contractual agreements for both the government and the concession company.

The objective of this transformation from the old practice of lowest bid to best-value is to increase the value added to the project for each dollar added. This paper discusses a new concept of best-value modeling that is unique and tailored to each project. The model uses records of past projects to obtain specific evaluation criteria, from which a best-value score is determined for each contractor. Primary parameters that impact contractor selection are identified and analyzed based on which best-value model is designed. Data are collected from groups of experts in the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Two application methods are used to assess the best-value: (1) the weighted average method; and (2) the analytic hierarchy process. Although the paper is written to assist government agencies in selecting the best contractor(s), the research results shared in this paper are relevant to both academics and practitioners. The paper provides practitioners with a tool for ranking contractors based on best-value and provides academics with selection parameters, a model to evaluate this best-value, and a methodology of quantifying the qualitative effect of subjective factors.

Emerging markets have a significant impact on the strategic planning of contractors. based on an electronic survey covering foreign contractors, clients (foreign investors). and design institutes. the design/build procurement route in conjunction with strategic alliances has been found to enable foreign contractors to enter the Chinese marketplace, The writers present a strengths. weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to inform readers where opportunities for development might he found and to warn of threats to entry. The research also found that mutual trust. synergistic strengths and complementarities, market demand for services. flexibility for both parties, and minimum change of top managers were ranked as the top live critical success factors for strategic alliances between foreign contractors and design institutes. Finally, medium-sized, state-owned. and large-sized design institutes were ranked is the first, second and third preferences, respectively, for strategic partnering by foreign contractors.

William			System Dynamics Models for the Valuation of Real Options in P3 Concession Project Agreements	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								Public-private partnerships (P3) are increasingly being pursued for infrastructure procurement because of their ability to alleviate pressure on government budgets, promote innovation, and implement new technologies. These types of contracts tend to be long term and often need to account for future yet-to-be-seen variables that potentially impact the feasibility of this procurement method. This is especially true when the P3 exists within a portfolio of competing assets across transportation infrastructure systems. The current research presents a system dynamics model that is used to analyze the complexity of a transportation infrastructure asset procured through a P3 within such a portfolio. An illustrative case demonstrates how discrete and continuous events potentially impact the successful procurement of infrastructure within a portfolio of competing assets comprising a regional transportation system. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by demonstrating how a system dynamics model can simulate the real-world causal relationships that impact the procurement of infrastructure through P3s. The system dynamics model is used for the valuation of real options in order to promote public initiatives, encourage private participation and enhance the economic sustainability of P3s.(c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Governments around the world, in both developed and developing economies, have dedicated significant shares of the public budget to infrastructure development and refurbishment. Nevertheless, there has been an increasing concern about the selection of economically more interesting projects. The large sunk investments, as well as the uncertainty surrounding these projects, require new and more sophisticated investment analysis techniques. Simultaneously, there has been a recent trend towards increasing the flexibility in these projects to allow a more progressive adaptation to changing market conditions, thus decreasing the overall risk affecting these investments. The flexibility is introduced through real options that include the possibility of change that one develops in the planning and design stage, allowing the infrastructure (and service) to cope with future uncertainty. This paper intends to provide an overview of the current literature on real options, thereby fulfilling a gap in current academic literature. It addresses the main types of options and valuation mechanisms and provides an extensive overview of their application to the infrastructure sector. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Jones, SH; Armanios, DE				Jones, Samuel H.; Armanios, Daniel Erian			Methodological Framework and Feasibility Study to Assess Social Equity Impacts of the Built Environment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SPATIAL DYNAMICS; SERVICE AREA; SEGREGATION; MAINTENANCE; OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFACTS; BENEFITS; BRIDGES; VALUES; SCALE	Civil engineers recognize the need to better address the potential consequences of infrastructure systems on social equity. However, the challenge has been translating social equity concerns into metrics that are usable in engineering analyses. In this case study, the authors aim to identify such metrics that can be subsequently used by engineers who seek to make equity-informed infrastructure construction, replacement, and rehabilitation decisions. Combining geospatial and statistical techniques on publicly available data sources, this research proposes a quantitative framework for how to incorporate social equity metrics into infrastructure analyses. The feasibility of this framework is analyzed in the case of Pennsylvania's bridge system. This feasibility study finds that selection effects (i.e., factors that drive bridge siting) are stronger than treatment effects (i.e., changes that occur after bridge construction) of bridges on social equity. Consistent variables are also identified as correlated with such effects (e.g., demographic and, to a lesser degree, family variables). Overall, this research proposes measures and an approach that helps local government transportation agencies better incorporate social equity into infrastructure construction, replacement and rehabilitation.

They are also one of the most contentious project delivery mechanisms to have been mobilised in recent decades. Research has demonstrated the lack of realised value within many such projects, yet construction management academics continue to examine ways of increasing, implementing and optimising this approach in practice, even encouraging its adoption worldwide despite growing social and political dissatisfaction. Here, we go beyond what we see as myopic construction management perspectives, placing our body of work firmly within wider economic, political and social contexts. We challenge uncritical academic compliance with a process that demonstrably contributes to economic inequalities, opportunism and exploitation. We confront the lack of criticality in construction management research of PPPs, and call for construction management academics to broaden their research focus and engage in more robust critique and analysis of construction systems, as they are realised in practice.

The importance of non-financial determinants on public-private partnerships in Europe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; PPPs; Critical success factors; Attractiveness; Non-financial determinants; Europe	CORRUPTION; GOVERNMENT; SUCCESS; PERSPECTIVES	In previous work regarding public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements the theoretical rationales and empirical results have mainly focused on analyzing the importance of quantitative features related to budget constraints deriving from public deficits, the existence of an infrastructure gap and the efficiency hypothesis. Thus, this study aims to identify the underlying determinants behind the proliferation and execution of PPPs, emphasizing the importance that non-financial (such as political, legal and macroeconomic) determinants have in establishing a PPP, as well as the factors that enhance the attractiveness of a country to encourage the private sector through PPPs in the European context. The results of this study show that the macroeconomic environment represented by economic freedom, competitiveness and the unemployment rate is essential for PPPs, as well as the legal system, where regulatory quality and effective rule of law are associated with the effective execution of a PPP. The political environment and previous experience of PPPs are also key factors in making a country more attractive for establishing PPPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, TT; Wilkinson, S				Liu, Tingting; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Critical Factors Affecting the Viability of Using Public-Private Partnerships for Prison Development	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Prisons; Correctional services; Australia; New Zealand	INFRASTRUCTURE; OPPORTUNITIES; SERVICES; PROJECTS; LESSONS; PPPS	Building, managing, and operating prisons is essential for sustaining a country's criminal justice system. The provision of prison services usually incurs large capital expenditures and high operating costs, requires hybrid types of operational services, and involves multi-group stakeholders. Internationally, public-private partnerships (PPPs) were introduced by governments to bring forward prison projects. This research aims to evaluate PPP experiences in the prison sector, extract critical factors affecting the viability of PPPs and recommend strategies and measures for improved use of PPPs for prison development. Comparative case studies of two prison projects were adopted as the main research method with semi-structured interviews and focus group as primary data collection instruments. The research shows that the critical factors leading to the success of prison PPP are (1) relevant business case development, (2) robust and streamlined project development, (3) effective contract administration and management, (4) effective governance structures, (5) enhanced private consortium, and (6) equitable risk allocation. The research findings add to the international PPP best practice frameworks by showing that the critical factors for specific sectors vary. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Thus, it is important to explore the critical factors responsible for collective actions against major construction projects. This study initially developed 25 indicators inducing collective actions based on a comprehensive literature review. An empirical study with 127 samples was conducted using questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews from projects located in Central China. Furthermore, ranking analysis and factor analyses were implemented to conclude that collective actions in major construction projects can be explained by a six dimension critical factor system: benefits to the public, characteristics of project performers, layout of projects, living quality of the public, perceptions of the public, and influence from the authority. This study contributes to government administration for collective actions against major construction projects and serves as a useful reference for further studies of this type.

J	Comerio, MC				Comerio, MC			Public policy for reducing earthquake risks: a US perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building codes; disaster recovery; earthquake hazards; insurance; land-use regulation; mitigation; performance-based design; public policy; risk management; United States		Although many countries have experienced significant losses from earthquakes, governments have a difficult time creating effective seismic hazard mitigation policies. Traditional building-oriented policy mechanisms, such as land-use regulation and building codes, are minimum standards for public health and safety, but more specialized hazard zone development restrictions are difficult to enforce at the local level where more salient issues typically dominate. Some hazards' insurance policies link the cost of coverage to mitigation, but as a broad policy, the availability of insurance often encourages rather than discourages poor site selection and development planning. In recent years, there has been a strong divergence between knowledge and policy. Public utilities, large corporations, museums and educational institutions have developed risk management models to safeguard critical functions, protect valuable contents and limit downtime. These self-generated mitigation plans could be replicated in other organizations and institutions if hazard mitigation policies were designed to reward innovation and allow flexibility. Policies such as performance-based design standards that create incentives for mitigation, accommodate change and allow the negotiation of means for desired objectives are needed to replace rigid and prescriptive regulatory models.

Speculation concerning the gross output and the debate over the subject of value added continues. The market research questionnaires remain abundant and we have witnessed a deluge of revisions to the categorisation of the sector - with some significant new contributions. Sector growth is critically linked to the availability of skilled labour, the mechanisation of manufacturing processes and data driven processes. We require a new approach to engineering education to deliver our modern workforce and cross-disciplinary education and training is of fundamental importance for the delivery of Construction 4.0. Historical financial data for the period 2000 to 2018 is presented. A breakdown of the sector, examining the standard industrial classification codes, gross output and value added for each categorised sub-sector is provided. The data will continue to assist government and industry in benchmarking, labour forecasting, market research and forecasting growth and diffusion of innovative delivery of offsite built environment infrastructure.

The research team used an action learning approach to work with managers from construction companies and housing associations to design and deliver support mechanisms, such as industry workshops, specific to the needs of SMEs. Analysis of the results showed how, as a result of interacting with other groups within a non-adversarial environment and benefiting from the process, partnering and performance improvement came to be seen as both desirable and possible. The trust and confidence generated from working together successfully also led construction SMEs to share good practice with others from the industry, including local competitors. The authors propose that SMEs should be treated as 'leaders' and 'full partners' within the programme for UK industry improvement being championed by Sir John Egan (1998), rather than simply recipients. It is also suggested that governments provide further support to ensure participation from small and micro firms.

Such grading is needed both for funding and resource allocation purposes and for personnel decisions. In grading journals, objective information, such as the impact factors (the most commonly used journal citation information provided by Journal Citation Reports) and/or subjective information, such as experts' judgments about the journals, are used. Grading of journals is typically done by a committee. Most of the existing approaches only consider either the subjective or the objective information. While such approaches work in many cases, they may not work in many others. Complaints about politics, inconsistencies, and unfairness are common in many situations. This paper presents a methodology that integrates both types of information, providing a comprehensive method for assessing the quality of journals. The method employs a fuzzy set approach that also deals with the imprecise and missing information frequently inherited in the evaluation process. The proposed evaluation model is implemented in a Web-based system. A pilot evaluation study indicated that participants clearly preferred the system and its major features.

We therefore address megaprojects as elaborate, temporally bracketed social systems made up of key actor groups pursuing interwoven individual and joint goals that may not always be aligned. This work illustrates the process by which goal-oriented actors, in this case international organizations, national governments, firms, and civil society, work through formal administrative structures and legal systems to create and transform their institutional contexts. Building from the findings of an extended case study of the Lyon-Turin high-speed railway megaproject, we firstly detail the overarching institutional environment that megaproject professionals build to realize success. Secondly, we categorize the variety of institutional practices that actors can use to shape global megaprojects. Thirdly, we describe the institutional shaping skills available to project managers for such cases. These findings broaden the scope of traditional project management approaches to megaprojects and provide rich detail in relation to the understanding and successful governance of megaprojects.

Because the involved parties have conflicting interests regarding these variables, this research introduces a new trilateral bargaining model which helps the BOT participants to model the BOT negotiation process (especially in a procurement process based on direct negotiation) and reach an efficient agreement on the concession period length and equity:debt ratio considering the conflicting interests and different bargaining powers of the sponsor, government, and lender. First, a mathematical interpretation of conflicting financial interests of the parties is introduced. Then the noncooperative and cooperative bilateral bargaining games are combined as a novelty of this research to develop a trilateral bargaining game model enabling consideration of the negotiation process in BOT projects. The proposed model can be used to predict the concession period length and capital structure simultaneously. Finally, the proposed model is implemented in a real-world BOT project and the application and performance of the proposed model are illustrated.

Managing Cultural Diversity at US Construction Sites: Hispanic Workers' Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor and personnel issues; Active culture difference; Hispanic workers; The construction industry; Safety management; Leading indicator	UNITED-STATES; SAFETY; FATALITIES; WORKPLACE; WORKFORCE; HEALTH	Communication on construction sites is crucial for improving overall construction performance. Cultural barriers influence the clarity of communication between construction supervisors and Hispanic workers on U.S. construction sites, which affects safety performance. In this study, Hispanic workers' perspectives regarding active cultural differences (ACD) were collected, analyzed, and compared to supervisors' perspectives and responses that were reported earlier. The results confirmed the existence of three active cultural differences: high power distance, collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Although the goal of the study was primarily to investigate active cultural differences, the results revealed additional important factors that affect Hispanic construction workers, such as daily work conditions, the effectiveness of government agencies' regulations, workers' legal status, and reporting nonsevere injuries. Very few, if any, empirical studies have focused on cultural diversity on U.S. construction sites. Therefore this study provides a meaningful understanding of the nature and influence of cultural differences, which in turn helps construction supervisors manage their diverse workforce as well as aids future research studies that are focused on cultural diversity.

Comparative review of building commissioning regulation: a quality perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						building regulations; commercial buildings; commissioning; energy efficiency; enforcement; governance; policy; regulation framework		Building regulations are an important policy instrument available to governments wishing to improve building energy efficiency, which should be a priority to policy-makers wishing to target cost-effective avenues in support of carbon-abatement targets. Meanwhile, building system commissioning has been recognized as a cost-effective measure to cut energy consumption, but in practice commissioning quality can deliver less-than-satisfactory outcomes. Regulation needs to better support commissioning outcomes. A five-grade commissioning scale is developed to assess the quality of commissioning and propose a common language to assist with regulation setting. Using this scale, building regulation and polices related to new and refurbished building commissioning were analysed in comparative case studies between jurisdictions England and California. This study finds that Californian regulations mandate a higher quality of commissioning and regulations that are more enforceable. The crucial elements to support better-commissioned buildings were identified as: outputs-focused regulation (not input based); regulation and process clarity; commissioning agents and building official training; as well as acknowledging the financial burden of upholding more complex building regulations. For the full benefit of commissioning to be realized, policy and regulations for existing buildings will be required.

Although the type of projects can relieve transportation pressure in cities and make citizen's life easier, it raises many environmental and social problems during the construction process, in particular, problems about residents' daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify key environmental and social impacts of urban subway constructions and adjust construction programs and urban transportation programs to reduce negative impacts on citizen's daily life during construction. This paper analyzes the key factors for measuring environmental and social influences of subway construction and their interrelationships by using structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Four major impact factors are identified, namely, the impact on residents' travel, transportation, environment and daily life. Then some suggestions are made accordingly. These findings can be used as references for governments, contractors and other parties to develop more rational construction programs to minimize negative impacts of subway construction in urban development.

However, PPPs expose the concessionaire to a number of potential risks over the long concession period and the concessionaire may not be able to recover the large initial investment and obtain a reasonable rate of return if significant difficulties occur in the concession period. Hosting governments normally allow concession renegotiations when certain serious risk scenarios occur. International PPP practices have shown conflicting results from renegotiations, and many renegotiations have raised serious questions about the viability of the PPP approach. To facilitate renegotiations between the public and private sectors, this research has developed a concession renegotiation framework and compensation models for three common compensation measures, namely, toll adjustment, contract extension, and annual subsidy or unitary payment adjustment. The key issue in developing a quantitative compensation model is to estimate future cash flows, in which future traffic demand and operation and maintenance costs are important stochastic variables. Time-series models have been used to forecast these stochastic variables.

There is, in particular, a split between the definitions, approaches and priorities in developed and developing countries. Subsequently, a process for creating an international agenda for sustainable building is needed to recognize these regional and local differences. Part of this process is the development of regional action plans for sustainable building and construction at a number of regional sustainable building conferences. The key elements of an action plan for Africa, based on a discussion session at the SB04 Africa Conference, are considered and placed within the African context and the larger international issues. The key issue is the establishment of a solid knowledge foundation for Africa that will equip the public, professionals, development agencies and governments with accurate and relevant knowledge generated within the framework of the continent's social needs, its cultures and its biophysical environment to guide their decisions and actions towards establishing a sustainable built environment.

Different types of PPPs have been practiced in infrastructure development in both developed and developing countries, with diverse results. Although PPPs have many advantages, they involve some complexities in planning, execution, and monitoring and control that vary according to specific project and country conditions. This paper provides a case study of the Tehran-Chalus Toll Road project, one of the largest highway projects in Iran. The authors analyze the contract organization of the PPP project, identify the most important risks, compare the project's organization with successful and unsuccessful experiences in similar PPP projects, and suggest ways to improve risk allocation to achieve better project performance for this and other PPP projects in developing countries.

The possible impacts of these changes on flooding, wind damage, driving rain impact, subsidence and the internal environment of buildings are reviewed and the steps that might be taken to mitigate these impacts discussed. The current response of regulators, standardisation bodies, building owners and the insurance industry to these impacts is examined, and it is shown that each body acts in different ways to different impacts. Some bodies, such as government departments responsible for building regulations and the insurance industry, are taking the possibility of climate change very seriously. However, the uncertainty of future climate predictions, especially as regards wind speed, means that it is not easy to incorporate these issues in formal legislation. The whole culture of standardisation, which is based on well-established data, such as mean climate data over the last 30 years, makes it difficult for British and European Standards, which underpin regulations, to react to the changing climate.

To obtain valuable insights, a qualitative research study was conducted on Dutch smart city projects. Fifteen cities responded to the invitation to participate. By mutual agreement, twelve projects were selected since they met the requirements for the research. Fourteen smart city professionals completed a questionnaire and were interviewed. The acquired data were analysed by the template analysis method. The results of this study contribute to the theory of the strategic orientation of organizations and the theory of co-creation. We found that the goal orientation and motivation of individuals were critical, and therefore these aspects were included in this research. As such, we would encourage managerial practices to analyse the impact of the strategic orientation of all actors. Once the challenges in multiparty co-creation are overcome, the effectiveness of creating solutions for societal challenges will improve. This will foster and improve the liveability of cities for residents and speed progress on various societal aspects.	[Akterujjaman, S.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						continuous quality improvement; convenience factors; cross-cultural management; culture; government-run clinics; patient satisfaction; technology management; total quality management	CARE; MANAGEMENT	The improvement of health care service has a great effect on patient satisfaction. During the service delivery, the health care organization attempts to answer the reasonable expectations of patients. The expectations relate to many service dimensions, among them the phone system, appointment availability, and waiting times. The research questions of this study are: can the implementation of quality initiatives improve patient satisfaction with the phone system, appointment availability, and waiting times and do patients from diverse cultural backgrounds exhibit different levels of satisfaction? The study was undertaken in a public clinic, with a culturally diverse clientele, including 194 patients. The authors use a combination of the longitudinal and cross-sectional research design to test the propositional model. The findings show that the implementation of the quality initiative significantly improved patient satisfaction with the appointment availability and waiting time. On the other hand, the implementation of the quality initiative did not improve patient satisfaction with the phone system. Some culturally diverse patients exhibited different levels of expectations of the care provider and quality in terms of patient satisfaction with the appointment availability.

This praxiographic study of a major National Health Service (NHS) hospital project uses practice theory to investigate the concept of design evaluation as 'a practice'. By applying Theodore Schatzki's site ontology, design evaluation practices are revealed to respond to dynamic teleoaffective structures that highlight the role of both practical intelligibility and the intertwined impact of external policy stipulations. Through this theoretical lens, fresh insight into the actuality of NHS hospital design evaluation praxis is provided that questions some of the axioms upon which such processes are assumed to operate. In particular, the appropriateness of the decontextualized and deterministic processes currently found in UK government design policy is questioned. It is posited that an approach to design evaluation grounded in Schatzki's practice theory has greater potential to improve the design quality of NHS healthcare buildings that could, in turn, improve patient healthcare outcomes.

These projects face multiple sources of uncertainty in high risk situations, and require specialized know-how and longer periods for revenue growth than their counterparts in other industries. We use data from 207 clean technology projects funded by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to conduct a comparative study of how operations design can hedge risk and enhance project valuation in technology development and deployment stages. We find that deployment feasibility is significantly and positively related to project valuation. On the other hand, stretched technical performance goals, development feasibility and market growth targets are associated with lower valuation. We also find some significant differences for these results across institution types: mature firms, start-ups, universities, and research centers. We examine the risk profile of these projects by technology and institution type, and discuss the managerial and policy implications for these findings.	[Erzurumlu, S.

J	Ock, JH; Han, SH				Ock, JH; Han, SH			Lessons learned from rigid conflict resolution in an organization: Construction conflict case study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Success in construction projects mainly depends on how well project managers handle conflicts. There are in general five conflict resolution approaches: withdrawal, compromise, forcing, smoothing, and problem solving. Conflict results are very relevant to the interaction of the approaches. Improperly managed, the interaction often generates psychological residue such as anger that ruins the project. The main objective of this research is, through a case study, to enhance the comprehension of the approaches, their interactions, and the psychological changeovers involved. Although conflict resolution among the contractual parties with privity has been studied widely, the conflicts among the parties either in an owner or in a contractor organization have been rarely researched, although they frequently cause destructive claims to the contractual parties. This research identifies a real construction conflict as the case study that occurred between two functional entities of a local Korean government. The case illustrates that a badly managed conflict in an owner organization causes undesirable claims between contractual parties. Based on the previous research regarding the five approaches and psychological transitions in a conflict resolution process, the case is analyzed to recognize the approaches and psychological changeovers absorbed. Useful lessons from the case are identified through a graduate class discussion.

Though some strategies have been deployed to facilitate BIM implementation in China, their outcomes are not clear. The purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations regarding appropriate strategies for promoting the development and implementation of BIM in China based on lessons learned from advanced implementation experiences in other countries. Design/methodology/approach First, existing strategies are investigated and barriers to BIM implementation mentioned in previous studies are summarized. Then, the identified barriers are mapped to the strategy contents. Finally, a comparative analysis on different areas is conducted to propose suggestions for identified items of BIM implementation strategies that need to be improved. Findings Six unaddressed barriers to BIM implementation strategies in China were identified from the mapping results: insufficient government lead/direction, organizational issues, legal issues, high cost of application, resistance to change of thinking mode and insufficient external motivation. Originality/value The findings of this study can be used to facilitate the development of appropriate strategies within the public and private sectors for promoting BIM implementation in China and elsewhere.

J	Fitch, GJ; Odeh, I; Ibbs, CW				Fitch, Gregory J.; Odeh, Ibrahim; Ibbs, C. William			Economic Sustainability of DBO Water Based on Wastewater Projects in the US: Three Case Studies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								As public utility owners face increased budget constraints and greater expectations, alternative project delivery methods will increasingly be used to fast track projects, reduce costs, promote innovation, and ensure proper performance for water and wastewater facilities. The goals of public utility owners and U.S. federal tax regulations suggest why design-build-operate (DBO) projects have been selected over other procurement processes. The research reported in this paper contributes to the body of knowledge and benefits industry practitioners, by identifying tax regulations and best practices that when jointly considered improve the project delivery selection process, while enhancing risk-mitigation efforts on DBO water and wastewater projects. A procurement selection process using multiple-criteria decision and financial risk analyses is presented to select the most economically sustainable delivery method given each project's characteristics. A present value analysis establishes a range of values that takes into account variables that will potentially impact lifecycle costs. The selection of the procurement process and the contractor is based on best value where financial risks to the concerned government and contractor are mitigated through dynamic service fee agreements in accordance with current U.S. federal tax regulations.

It attempts to understand the Quantity Surveyors' (QS) estimation accuracy in relation to public projects. This study analyses 83 projects of estimates and tender bids. The analysis includes three (3) estimating targets i.e. lowest bid, accepted bid and mean of the bids. To broaden the study, 344 QS involved in the procurement answered the questionnaires. Linear multiple regression analysis on project characteristics shows that project size, number of bidders, location and type of schools affect the bias. Contract period affects the consistency. The use of mean of the bids is the best-fit target to explain the bias in terms of adjusted R-2. The accuracy may improve if sufficient design information is available, proper cost planning and improving the application of historical cost data. As an alternative, the phenomenon of overestimation is resulted from government directive instruction, which could challenge the rational of accurate estimate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Zayed, TM; Chang, LM				Zayed, TM; Chang, LM			Prototype model for build-operate-transfer risk assessment	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						risk analysis; prototypes; project management; developing countries; private sector	CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS	The build-operate-transfer (BOT) approach for project delivery, where the private sector has to finance, design, build, operate, and maintain the facility and then transfer it to the government after a specified concession period, is now gaining widespread popularity in developing countries. Compared with conventional project delivery methods, BOT sponsors expose themselves to a high risk, so that special attention must be paid to analyzing and managing risks. The identification, analysis, and allocation of various types of risks are an important aspect for the validation of privately promoted infrastructure projects. The BOT risk model presented in this paper is a prototype evaluation model that provides a logical, reliable, and consistent procedure for assessing the BOT project risk. The proposed model introduced the BOT risk index (F), which relied on the actual performance of eight main BOT risk areas. Two different modeling approaches were used in constructing this index: a new developed and an adapted Dias and Ioannou model. Not only can this index be used for BOT projects' risk evaluation, but also for ranking them to select the lowest risk project as well.

Based on this logic, the article also assesses whether the effects of these two types of collaboration are conditional on a firm's connections to the existing institutional structure in emerging markets. The regression results reveal that both collaboration with science-based partners and collaboration with foreign business partners are positively related to a firm's innovation performance, while the effect of collaboration with science-based partners is weaker. Our article also shows that a firm's connections to the institutional structure positively moderate the influence of collaboration with foreign business partners, while they negatively moderate the influence of collaboration with science-based partners. This article contributes to the existing research on innovation collaboration by providing a theoretical framework for understanding the distinct effects of collaborating with different types of partners.

This study investigates the prices trend of some selected common building and construction materials on the construction market in Ghana. Average annual prices of building materials from 2011 to 2016 were collected from Public Procurement Board and used in the determination of the trend in prices of building and construction materials in Ghana. The data were inputted into Microsoft Office Professional Plus Excel, version 2016 for generating graphs for analysis. It was revealed that materials such as fine aggregates, felt, aluminium roofing sheets and sandcrete blocks had an inconsistent (fluctuating) increase in price. It was further found that other materials such as coarse aggregates, ordinary Portland cement, concrete kerbs and high-tensile steel rods had a consistent increase in prices along the study period. The study concludes that there is general increase prices trend of the selected building and construction materials on the construction market in Ghana. It is recommended for government and the legislature to take the necessary measures and enact laws to control the factors that contribute to the increasing prices of building and construction materials.

While the benefits of such an exercise are widely understood in some countries, no standard framework works in all countries due to the differences in workforce capacity and resources, national priorities, and energy data and analytics maturity of various countries. Hence, this paper documents an energy-accounting exercise that first collects commercial building sector data in India from multiple sources. An approach is then proposed that first divides the commercial building sector into categories and subcategories and then estimates the floor area (1.1 billion m(2)) and energy intensity (69 kWh/m(2)) of the entire commercial stock in 2017. Based on macro-economic parameters, the floor area (1.78 billion m(2)) and energy intensity (81 kWh/m(2)) are projected for 2027 in a business-as-usual scenario. This research sends a clear signal to other researchers and policy-makers in the central and state government about the need and potential to refine and adopt more rigorous data-collection and analytical methods by institutionalizing the process and advancing data-driven policies and evaluation in future.

Minimum revenue guarantees (MRGs) are one financial aid option that costs the Korean government US$2.7billion in liabilities annually. To reduce these considerable expenditures, this study proposes resolving financial conflicts using a three-phase game framework with a bargaining phase, a ratification phase, and a decision-making phase. The first two phases are adopted from traditional two-level game theory, and the last phase is added to support sequential negotiations and multiple buyers. To confirm the usability of proposed framework, the authors conduct illustrative case applications with two representative real-life PPP cases. Case 1 shows that qualitative bargaining power can be accurately quantified, and Case 2 demonstrates that empirically calculated values can be used in negotiation practice. The framework proposed in this study reduces the range of negotiation, the time required to negotiate, and the damage caused by conflicts. Additionally, the frame is expected to support strategic negotiations and well-structured decisions in financial conflicts between key stakeholders. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The presented work extends the state-of-the-art of visualizing simulation models of construction operations in three-dimensions. The writers present efficient methods and a tool, ViTerra, that can be used to automatically generate photorealistic, digital, three-dimensional (3D) terrain computer-aided design databases to represent construction job sites in animations of simulated construction processes. The work capitalizes on the availability of detailed topographical and aerial imagery data that are readily available in digital format from several government and private organizations. In addition to automated terrain generation techniques, the presented work implements animation methods to describe the evolution of virtual jobsites by depicting deformations to the visualized terrains in response to common construction operations such as earthmoving and trenching. The writers' first contribution alleviates the need to manually create 3D terrain models for use in animations as has been the case hitherto. The writers' second contribution (1) enhances realism in animations of several common construction operations; and (2) allows the visualization of several other construction processes that were hitherto impossible to animate accurately in 3D.

Application of Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Construction Strategies at the Federal Level	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CRITERIA; PROPOSAL	Indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts use an overarching master contract between an owner and contractor for multiple projects over a specified time period. The practice is widespread in the federal government but its efficacy has been the subject of relatively few studies. Content analysis of 90 federal requests for proposal advertised between 2010 and 2014 reveals IDIQ contracting use for a wide range of facility types and construction services. Owners most often use best-value procurement methods, emphasize qualifications over price to initially select the IDIQ pool of contractors, and use seed projects for initial price evaluations. Findings also suggest that IDIQ contracts reflect the inherent paradoxical organizational tensions in public sector procurements. On one hand, IDIQ contracts reflect a desire for flexibility, simplified procurement processes, and finding the most qualified contractors for long-term performance. On the other hand, public owners must put control mechanisms in place to obtain a fair price, protect the public interest, and comply with regulations. The findings of this study have practical implications for public owners with large asset portfolios and for contractors interested in pursuing IDIQ contracts. The findings also provide requisite knowledge for researchers to study IDIQ performance at an aggregate level.	[Stanford, M.

Policies, codes, and governance structures vary among regions, and there is no universally accepted definition of a ZEB. These variables make it difficult, for countries such as China that wish to set similar goals, to determine an optimum approach. This paper reviews ZEBs policies, programmes, and governance approaches in two jurisdictions that are leading ZEBs development: Denmark and the state of California in the United States. Different modes of governance (hierarchy: principal-agent relations, market: self organizing and network: independent actors) are examined specifically in relation to policy instruments (prescriptive, performance or outcome-based). The analysis highlights differences in institutional conditions and examines available data on energy performance resulting from a building policy framework. The purpose is to identify ZEBs governance and implementation deficits in China and analyse alternative governance approaches that could be employed in China, which is currently developing ZEBs targets and policies. Conclusions suggest that the ZEBs governance structure in China could benefit from widened participation by all societal actors involved in achieving ZEBs targets. China's ZEBs policies would benefit from employing a more balanced hybrid governance approach.

The study is aimed at examining the effects of the IoT on construction project performance with the view of increasing productivity and efficiency. Quantitative research method was adopted and questionnaires were structured on a five-point Likert scale to elicit the opinion of respondents. Descriptive and Inferential analysis were used in analyzing the retrieved data. The most important effects of IoT are security and privacy, collecting previous data, safety comfort and efficiency. Factor analysis was used to group the various impacts of IoT into six. The results showed that there were nine variables with a significant difference while the others ten are not. It was concluded that the IoT adoption has a high influence on the security, privacy, safety, productivity and performance of construction workers. It is recommended that variables with least influenced areas can be developed by improving the skills of professionals. Government is also encouraged to adopt the principles of IoT not only in construction but other sectors to improve the economy of the nation.

J	Jiang, HC; Lin, P; Qiang, MS				Jiang, Hanchen; Lin, Peng; Qiang, Maoshan			Public-Opinion Sentiment Analysis for Large Hydro Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Public opinion; Large hydro projects; Project management; Information technologies	3 GORGES PROJECT; SOCIAL MEDIA; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; ALGORITHMS; ATTITUDES; POLARITY; REVIEWS; CHINA; DAM	Public opinion is becoming increasingly involved in feasibility studies, construction, and post-evaluation of large hydro projects. Recently, with the rapid development of social network services, sentiment analysis can provide officials and managers with fresh perspectives on public-relation problems in project management. An effective sentiment analysis method can enable projects to gain from public participation. In this paper, a project sentiment analysis (PSA) system using a lexicon-based method is proposed. This system collects user opinions from social network sites, establishes emotion dictionaries, and builds basic rules that calculate those sentiment values embodied in a collection of messages. The Three Gorges project (TGP) was used as a case study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PSA. Sentiment analysis results show that about half (47.7%) of the collected messages expressed negative emotions towards the TGP, while the other messages were positive or neutral. The case study is of help to Chinese government and project managers in future decision-making regarding the TGP. The PSA system provides a new theoretical perspective and a practical method to assess public opinion during the whole life-cycle of a large hydro project.

This study uses the Home Energy Efficiency Database (HEED) to investigate both the combination of measures that have been installed, and in which dwellings, according to key neighbourhood socio-demographic variables, including income and tenure. Analysis of 2000-07 data indicates that approximately 40% (9.3 million) dwellings in England had approximately 23.7 million efficiency measures installed, with an average of 2.5 measures per dwelling. Building fabric-related measures were the most frequent (e.g. cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and glazing) with an average of 2.1 million installed each year. Dwellings with the highest number of fabric interventions (the top 20%) were more likely to be found in areas with low income, with more owner-occupied dwellings, experiencing lower winter temperatures, having a lower proportion of flats, and having a slightly higher proportion of older adults and children. Energy efficiency installations have tended to occur among specific types of households or parts of the building stock. These findings have implications for the design of future government programmes for targeting energy efficiency measures to specific household groups or dwelling types.

J	Grigg, NS				Grigg, NS			Universities and professional associations: Partnerships for civil engineering careers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								As civil engineers take more individual responsibility for their careers in the 21st century global economy, they need assistance from educators, industry, and government, both to help them individually and to strengthen the workforce. As described in the paper, assistance can be provided through partnerships involving universities and engineers, working through local chapters of professional associations. A potential mission statement for the partnerships might be: to work together to attract quality students to civil engineering, support and enhance their education, and provide lifelong career support for the civil engineering workforce. The paper presents an array of career education activities that offers work for universities, grades K-12, and associations. Experiences show that the partnership concept is promising. Benefits would include having better people in the profession, motivating students to relate education to life, even if they do not become civil engineers, and helping engineers all along the career path. The key issue in career development for in-service engineers is lifelong learning. Universities should be key players in K-12 and career education, and they should reexamine their current plans and policies to ascertain whether enough resources are going into these phases of education. Career education requires much effort and commitment. Still, the rewards in career enhancement and workforce improvement are worth the investment.

Led by the benefits of this procurement model, governments felt tempted to engage themselves in long-term contracts for the provision and management of health care facilities, under distinct configuration schemes. Several arrangements have been tried: partnerships concerning just the infrastructure on a stand-alone basis, or bundling infrastructure and clinical services management, among other more unusual models. Experience has demonstrated benefits and pitfalls in each model. This paper tries to overcome the gap in the literature regarding the review of PPP arrangements in a cross-country perspective. Using case studies from 16 countries (10 European Union, Canada, Australia, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and Lesotho), it provides a reflection on international experiences with health care PPPs and draws some recommendations for further development. To support the discussion on the trade-off between contract complexity and the ability to capture efficiency through vertical integration, the Portuguese case is presented in detail because it represents a unique model. The potential benefits of the integration should not be neglected. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To achieve this objective, a deductive approach is adopted using a questionnaire survey of 107 construction professionals. A total of 39 barriers were identified through an intensive literature review, and were grouped into six categories: management, financial, educational, governmental, technical and human attitudinal. Data were analysed using the simple but widely used effect index (EI). The strongest barriers to implementing LC techniques for improving safety in the Gaza Strip are lack of LC concept understanding, lack of government support for applying innovative strategies in construction projects, and lack of knowledge on how to apply LC techniques for safety improvement. Regular training should be provided to all construction practitioners to provide them with the most appropriate LC techniques for improving construction safety. This paper will be valuable for stakeholders in the construction industry to focus their attention and resources on the significant barriers and to identify strategies to address these barriers and facilitate the application of LC techniques to improve safety in local construction projects. It will add value to the existing LC knowledge and to the region.

J	Brito, MP; Lewis, RS; Bose, N; Griffiths, G				Brito, Mario Paulo; Lewis, Ronald S.; Bose, Neil; Griffiths, Gwyn			Adaptive Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: An Assessment of Their Effectiveness for Oceanographic Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptive planning; autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); autonomy; gliders; mission planning; positioning; precision; risk	ADOPTION; IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN	Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are practical tools for ocean observation. However, they tend to operate in an automatic rather than autonomous way. This reflects the attitudes and behaviors that individuals and organizations share when adopting new technology in this industry. This paper clarifies the factors that are preventing one important aspect of autonomy-adaptive mission planning (AMP)-from transitioning from research to commercial and bespoke AUVs. A total of 25 experts comprising AUV developers and users, with combined 237 years of experience, provided their views in a structured survey covering several different hypotheses. There is insufficient evidence to determine clearly a single reason for failure to adopt AMPs, but a primary cause is the paucity of demonstration trials. This view is irrespective of participants' years of experience. Managers, engineers, and technologists agree on the two most likely causes for failure to adopt AMPs. However, the differences between the assessments provided by researchers and these three professional groups are statistically significant, with p value <0.005. For researchers, complexity is one of the two most important inhibitory factors. We present recommendations to support the integration of AMP into AUVs substantiated by recent examples where government, industry, and researchers have developed and tested AMPs.

When updating building regulations and related policies to meet challenges in the built environment, it is essential to develop different strategies for different locations according to local circumstances, requirements and capabilities. Based on two research projects, this article examines the mechanisms and strategies for promoting building energy conservation in rural China from the perspective of economic governance. The challenges and potentials of building energy conservation in rural China are analyzed. The essence of the governance paradigm is briefly reviewed. A three-level analysis framework is developed in which markets, governments and the third party (professionals and others) play complementary roles in regulating stakeholders' behaviour. A key question addressed is how to create a favourable institutional environment in which people are willing to do the right things. Different strategy portfolios are proposed for different levels, including technology strategy, financing strategy, as well as regulations and incentive policies. In conclusion, there is no best' but rather the most suitable' approach to building governance. In this light, the principle of discriminating alignment and the multilevel analysis approach provides conceptual insights.

Policies and outcomes for UK sustainable schools	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						policy implementation; outcomes; carbon emissions; schools; policy formation; socio-technical systems; sustainable development; stakeholder participation; public policy		The 1997-2010 UK government's priorities for education and improved social equality led to the development of two major school building programmes: the Academies programme and Building Schools for the Future (BSF). Political concerns for social, economic and environmental sustainability were increasing during the same period, leading to stated new aspirations from 2004 for the schools to be 'models of sustainable development'. The key political discourses for 'sustainable schools' during this era are examined. While some aspects of the initial focus on social equity were retained, there was a rapid shift in emphasis towards environmental sustainability, and specifically carbon reduction. The impacts of these shifting discourses are then considered on four school building projects, examining the technical decisions made and their intended and unintended consequences. Within the diversity and complexity of individual building projects, the paper also exposes both the changing priorities within the construction sector during this period and the impacts of some specific policy tools. The considerable interpretive flexibility in the implementation of the policies is demonstrated, along with variability in their outcomes. Built environment policy should be understood as a continuous process that shapes and reshapes what happens.	[Moncaster, A.

J	Zhang, XQ				Zhang, Xueqing			Win-Win Concession Period Determination Methodology	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In infrastructure development through public-private partnerships (PPPs), governments worldwide often preset the concession period to a fixed length and then invite the private sector to bid on other aspects of the project. This practice has potential economic, financial, and social problems as shown in a case study of Hong Kong tunnel projects. To overcome these problems, this paper has proposed a win-win concession period determination methodology, in which PPPs are addressed as a principal-agent maximization problem. Both deterministic and simulation-based methods are provided to determine the concession period, with detailed step-by-step procedures. These methods take into consideration the financial characteristics of PPPs and the construction and operation requirements. In particular, the simulation-based approach combines the critical path method and Monte Carlo simulation technique in an effort to quantify construction and market risks for informed decision making. Furthermore, some issues related to the proposed methodology also have been discussed. These issues include (1) factors in determining a reasonable rate of return to the concessionaire's equity investment; (2) advantages and disadvantages of rate of return regulation; (3) concession period as a tender evaluation criterion; (4) efficiency check of the concessionaire's cost performance; (5) workable pricing mechanism; and (6) a practical approach to establishing statistical construction cost/duration distributions.

J	Gamil, Y; Rahman, IA				Gamil, Yaser; Rahman, Ismail Abdul			Assessment of critical factors contributing to construction failure in Yemen	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; Failure factors; Yemen	PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; DELAY	Yemen construction industry faces immeasurable challenges which result to its deterioration. Almost all projects in Yemen face challenges to attain the preplanned outcomes. This paper aims to uncover and assess the critical factors causing failure to the construction industry. At initial study?s stage, a comprehensive literature investigation on academic articles was carried out to determine 62 critical factors causing failures to the industry. Then, a quantitative study was carried out using questionnaire survey as a method to obtain the data. 5-points Likert type scales were applied to assess the factors. Then, the factors were categorized into five different groups. Collected data from the survey was analyzed using SPSS software based on relative importance index (RII) and standard deviations for ranking purposes. The study found that, the top ten ranked factors among 62 factors are poor construction management, frequent change of design, continuous suspension of work, shortage of raw materials, hiring uneducated contactor, low salary for engineers and construction workers, cash flow and financial difficulty, delay of progress payment to subcontractors, financial difficulty faced by owners and poor financial control and management. Results from this study are recommended to the Yemeni government in improving the current state of its construction industry.

J	Wang, DD; Fang, SZ; Li, KL				Wang, Dedong; Fang, Shaoze; Li, Kaili			Dynamic changes of governance mechanisms in mega construction projects in China: The mediating role of opportunism	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Project management; Strategic management	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; CONTRACTUAL GOVERNANCE; FORMAL CONTRACTS; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; MEGAPROJECTS; UNCERTAINTY; COOPERATION; ALLIANCE; STRATEGY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the mechanisms governing dynamic changes in relational and contractual governance at different stages of government-funded mega construction projects (MCPs) by studying their different effects on project performance and participants' opportunism. Design/methodology/approach Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test eight hypotheses based on data collected from 147 respondents in different participating organizations in Chinese MCPs. Findings First, contractual governance has a stronger positive impact on project performance than relational governance in the early stage of MCPs, while relational governance exerts more positive effects on project performance than contractual governance in the middle and late stages. Second, opportunism is a mediator variable between governance mechanisms and project performance, and relational governance is more effective than contractual governance in restricting opportunism. Originality/value In contrast to a static analysis of project governance mechanisms, this study examines dynamic changes in the governance mechanisms of MCPs in the Chinese context by considering the mediating role of opportunism as well as guanxi as an element of relational governance, thus filling in gaps in the literature on MCP governance and contributing to the development of MCP management theory.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 25 micro-level variables were identified from the literature review, and a questionnaire survey was performed with 138 professionals from both academia and industry. Then, the Spearman rank correlation was used to test whether there was agreement on ranking between the two respondent groups. Furthermore, the 25 variables were grouped into six underlying factors through the exploratory factor analysis. Findings The results indicated that the most critical variables were project desirability to the host country, relationship with governments, misconduct of contractors, public opposition to the project, experiential knowledge of political risks and advantageous conditions of contract. In addition, the opinions within each group were consistent and there was no significant disagreement on the rankings of variables between academics and practitioners. However, the academic and practitioner groups held different opinions on some individual variables. The impact direction of the variables was associated with confusion among the respondents. Originality/value The findings presented in this paper can help international construction enterprises effectively manage political risks in international construction projects.

As a result, engineering firms are faced with challenges related to embedding new technologies and associated working practices for the digital delivery of major infrastructure projects. Diffusion of innovations theory is used to investigate how digital innovations diffuse across complex firms. A contextualist approach is employed through an in-depth case study of a large, international engineering project-based firm. The analysis of the empirical data, which was collected over a four-year period of close interaction with the firm, reveals parallel paths of diffusion occurring across the firm, where both the innovation and the firm context were continually changing. The diffusion process is traced over three phases: centralization of technology management, standardization of digital working practices, and globalization of digital resources. The findings describe the diffusion of a digital innovation as multiple and partial within a complex social system during times of change and organizational uncertainty, thereby contributing to diffusion of innovations studies in construction by showing a range of activities and dynamics of a non-linear diffusion process.

Risk Management Strategies for Privatized Infrastructure Projects: Study of the Build-Operate-Transfer Approach in East Asia and the Pacific	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Build-operate-transfer; Privatized infrastructure; Project management; Risk management; Private-public partnerships		Private-public partnerships have been adopted for the development of public infrastructure to meet the growing demand for public services. Many Asian countries have used the build-operate-transfer (BOT) approach to develop public infrastructure projects. However, the potential benefits of undertaking a BOT project are accompanied by corresponding risks from the private sector's perspective. The objectives of this study are (1)to identify and discuss major risks inherent in the East Asia and Pacific regions, and (2)to propose risk management strategies for future BOT projects to be successful. This paper reports the results of five case study analyses undertaken to review their primary risks and mitigated methods. In addition, this paper proposes some strategies for future BOT projects. Two main categories of risks were analyzed: general risks and project-specific risks. Risk management strategies were suggested for each category of risk. The main finding of this study indicates that the private sector cannot be the only participant in risk management. The host government's active support is the most essential factor for the profitability and economic viability of a BOT project in the East Asia and Pacific regions.

This has enabled the development of several private and public construction firms. However, the performance of EDCs is still a matter of concern. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to identify and prioritize risks of EDCs operating in the federal road construction projects. Forty-seven risk events were identified through an in-depth literature review. A questionnaire survey was conducted with professionals from the three main contracting parties (contractors, consultants, and the client) to prioritize the identified risk events in terms of their relative significance. The study outlined the ten most significant risk events namely, shortage of cash, inadequate planning, lack of access to foreign currency, delay in possession of site, frequent breakdown of equipment, delay in delivery of material and equipment, financial failure, inflation, delay in payments and poor commitment and coordination within the contractors' team. This study provides an insight into contractors' risks with a focus on domestic contractors engaged in the road sector. The findings of this study will be helpful to construction firms to develop an appropriate risk management system to effectively mitigate their risks.

J	Jones, P				Jones, Phil			A 'smart' bottom-up whole-systems approach to a zero-carbon built environment	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						bottom-up; buildings; energy policy; low-carbon society; policy outcomes; public policy; whole system; zero carbon	POWER	Since the energy crisis of the mid and late 1970s, society has been aware of the need for a built environment that uses less fossil fuel energy. Although the built environment accounts for a large proportion of global fossil fuel use, it may be argued that the energy and buildings agenda is not being addressed at the depth or scale needed to meet global and national CO2 emission-reduction targets. Most actions to reduce energy use in the built environment have mainly used a top-down' decision-making approach, from government and industry, with little end-user engagement. Greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets will not be met without providing the technological and socio-economic pathways for achieving them. The paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, it discusses the need to reduce fossil fuel use and the apparent failure to transition policy goals and aims into practice. Secondly, top-down and bottom-up approaches are reviewed, advocating a greater emphasis on a 'whole-system' bottom-up approach in delivering multiple benefit solutions. Thirdly, the concept of 'smart' is considered in relation to bottom up with its implementation at a regional scale.

However, contractors do not share the necessary information with the contracted parties and thus give rise to the asymmetric information (AI) phenomenon. The aim of this study is to perform an analysis of the determining factors in the adoption of relational contracting (RC) in combination with Building Information Modelling (BIM) to reduce AI. The results of a questionnaire survey, which was e-mailed to 14 specialists with solid experience (over twenty years) and knowledge in construction projects, revealed that the probability of the AI phenomenon occurring in Portugal is very high, and its impact on construction projects is equally high. The results also show that RC in combination with the BIM methodology contributes very positively to the mitigation of AI problems in construction projects in Portugal. Approximately 85% of respondents consider that the government should seek to reduce AI in the public works sector through the use of RC and its combination with the BIM methodology in the Portuguese Public Contracts Code.

This paper analyses factors influencing the success of the community-driven project in selected communities surrounding the largest city of Ibadan. We collected survey data through copies of semi-structured questionnaire, backed with an interview. Factor analysis categorizes the major factors into seven groups, including social integration and commitment to the community development project, governance structure and leadership, democracy, selfless services, networking and accountability, openness in selecting professionals for development, and joint agreement. We subject the items of the factors into SWOT analysis to understand the values. Community-based organizations (CBOs) serve as potential means to address infrastructure deficit if CBOs take note of the main factors, use the opportunities that match the strengths, attempt to overcome the weaknesses to attain the opportunities, use the strength to reduce the vulnerability to the threats and prevent the weaknesses to avoid susceptibility to the threats.

However, little is known about how contractors perceive and act in response to varying levels of bidding feedback information from construction clients. Focussing on construction procurement in Hong Kong, this exploratory study examines: (i) the level of bidding information feedback from public, private and quasi-government client groups, and (ii) the sources, types, uses and adequacy of bidding feedback information from these client groups from contractors' perspective. Data was collected using online questionnaire. The results provide strong evidence that the respondents perceive bidding feedback information from the three client groups are inadequate. They have heavily relied on multiple and/or 'unofficial' sources for obtaining bidding feedback information. Nonetheless, there is suggestive evidence of different possible uses of bidding feedback information among the contractors, which could substantially affect bidding outcomes. This study provides a much-needed insight into clients' information feedback conditions and how feedback information might be used by contractors in competitive bidding. The research implication for clients is that they should take into consideration contractors' need for feedback information in their procurement design so as to enhance efficiency in their procurement practices.

A mixed method design was adopted for this research due to limited information and stakeholders on the ground. 43 industry practioners representing contractors, developers' financiers and government were identified motivating a mixed method approach in order to obtain more data given a generally lower sample available. 27 questionnaires were obtained. Findings revealed that the PPP Act had not played a significant role to influence private sector decision to participate in PPP projects. The findings from this research unlocks part of the reason why there is little participation by private sector in PPP projects. The research identifies presents areas of focus in amending the Act in order to attract and influence private investment in current critical areas such as energy, higher education and housing among others. The study recommends immediate revision of PPP Act to remove identified barriers which among others include inadequate and unclear governing PPP framework, obstruction by bureaucracy, inappropriate risk sharing mechanisms and absence of protection to the private sector stakeholders.

The contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is to analyze how the incorporation of CCCS may affect general contractors' present and future competitiveness through a case study in China. This paper analyzes the procurement of 158 building projects tendered in Beijing involving 2,071 local general contractors active in the market. The results show that (1) the contractors' CCCS scores are important for being awarded large and mega project contracts; (2) CCCS scores have a generally positive effect on future corporate financial income; and (3) contrary to expectations, the policy does not increase the CCCS of companies. Finally, the changing trend in contractors' CCCS scores is observed to be highly correlated with their initial values (the scores of higher CCCS scoring companies increase faster on average than that of other companies). The final remarks address ways to better implement CCCS schemes in the future and avoid the potential risks involved in their use. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Regulatory incentives for green buildings: gross floor area concessions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						concession scheme; density bonus; economic instruments; governance; green building; gross floor area; incentives; regulatory systems; transaction costs	TRANSACTION COSTS; EFFICIENCY; DEVELOPERS; INVESTMENT; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; ECONOMICS; BARRIERS; POLICIES	Incentive schemes formed by regulatory or administrative instruments are measures to promote green building (GB) and increase the motivation of developers to meet higher standards. The hidden costs to different stakeholders during the GB transaction are often ignored. Understanding these hidden transaction costs (TCs) helps appraise the costs and benefits of GB and policy effectiveness. The example of a gross floor area (GFA) concession scheme is used systematically to explore and understand the fundamental issues of TCs' typology and chronology in the GB development process. The GFA concession scheme is a popular incentive due to its indirect compensation to developers by allowing additional floor area without expenditure by government to implement GBs. A TCs' framework is used critically to review and evaluate the costs and benefits of the GFA concession scheme. Its particular implementation in both Hong Kong and Singapore is explored. Hong Kong is used as a case study, complemented with in-depth expert interviews on GFA concession in Hong Kong. The key contribution is to establish the parameters for estimating the optimum GFA bonus that could both motivate various stakeholders and minimize the negative impacts on the built environment in future.

Scott; Roth, Michael			Environmental implications of construction site energy use and electricity generation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The construction industry is responsible for environmental impacts that include air emissions, waste generation, and the use of land, water, and energy. However, most prior construction research attention has focused on these impacts only for material selection and building operation. The focus here is the environmental and energy implications of the construction process, specifically on-site energy consumption. Existing estimates of energy use and environmental emissions for the industry are tied to large construction vehicles, but other equipment consumes energy in various forms. This research creates a broader boundary for considering the energy use and environmental impacts of engines and vehicles used for construction activities by estimating these effects and comparing them to other national-level impacts. Results indicate that fuel use estimates for construction equipment are almost double the levels suggested by government reports, accordingly, air emission impacts are 30% larger for particulate matter and almost double levels of oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds. Quantitative and qualitative analysis regarding how U.S. diesel engine and fuel regulations could significantly reduce air emissions from construction sites is also provided. If fully implemented, these regulations could initiate the manufacture and use of portable generators that make on-site electricity generation comparable to the electricity grid in terms of air emissions.

Investors usually consider the price of energy guaranteed by the government during their feasibility studies which is the worst case scenario. However, it is apparent that negotiations that take place between investor and broker determine the price of energy which is affected by various sources of uncertainty associated with the energy demand and country conditions. The objective of this study was to make a realistic estimate of the investor's selling price by modeling the negotiation process between investor and broker using a multi-agent system (MAS). Thus, the factors affecting the negotiation process were identified, a negotiation protocol between the parties was set up, negotiation scenarios were determined, and modelled by using a MAS. The model was tested on a hydropower investment in Turkey and generated more realistic results compared to the current practice. Investors and brokers may benefit from this study because it considers the potential changes in the market as well as the negotiating postures of parties under different scenarios.

This paper provides useful knowledge about this emerging Internet-based business of CPI for the stakeholders in the A/E/C industry. This paper investigates the business from three different perspectives; a) the effectiveness of current CPI providers' websites, b) business operation models of this new industry sector, and c) critical factors for the successful operation of the Internet based CPI business using multiple surveys in the U.S. and South Korea. Lessons learned from the multi-layered assessment in this study has been actively applied and incorporated into a new web-based construction production information system which is currently developed through government support in South Korea. This study shows that reliable assessments of existing and rapidly growing CPI businesses in developed countries such as the U.S. and England can provide effective guidelines and strategies for successfully implementing this emerging market into different environments of developing countries.

Given the importance of social capital on startup success and the opportunity for social capital diffusion in high-density ecosystems, the inconclusive impact of ecosystems on firm performance warrants further attention. We present a startup survival model that distinguishes between access to social capital and using it. Empirical tests with the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey find that those startups that use social capital by collaborating with other agents (universities, industries, and government organizations) significantly outperform startups that do not. However, we also observe that the amount of social capital available in an ecosystem counterintuitively does not correlate with a tenants use of it, and correlates weakly with longer life expectancy. These results are moderated by whether the tenant is a high-tech startup or not. Findings contribute to extant research in innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Policy and pedagogical recommendations for leveraging an ecosystem to improve firm performance and achieve the ultimate goal of regional economic development are discussed.

These new roles and decision-making contexts (increased regulative complexity, stricter control and outsourcing of wider ranges of municipal services) are examined for how they shape procurement practices for architectural and engineering services in Swedish municipalities. Based on a critical theoretical review of policy implementation and inter-professional collaboration, the purchasing practices of five Swedish municipalities are examined and compared through case study interviews to understand the relationships and practices that occur between technical and procurement staff. Resource constraints and stricter control are found to lead to a strong preference, especially among technical staff, for simplified procurement models with a high emphasis on lowest price, whilst procurement staff favour more advanced methods for quality assessment. However, differences in knowledge and professional culture between the technical staff and procurement staff have created barriers to communication and competence integration. To develop a procurement practice that rewards supplier competence, clearer guidelines and changes to procurement roles within the client organization are needed, as well as increased resources. Procurement policies need to be more closely tied to their implementation.

REVIEW ON WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE HONG KONG CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY: USE OF SPECTRAL AND BISPECTRAL METHODS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						waste management system; construction and demolition waste; power spectrum; bispectral; construction; Hong Kong	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT	The Hong Kong government has implemented various measures to reduce waste, including a waste disposal ordinance, a green manager scheme, a waste reduction framework plan, a pilot concrete recycling plant, waste management systems and a landfill charging scheme. However, there are difficulties in implementing the waste management systems for contractors. This paper examines the existing implementation of waste management systems in the Hong Kong construction industry. Major sources of construction waste, awareness to install environment-friendly activities, benefits, difficulties and recommendations in the implementation of waste management systems are discussed. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. Power spectra and bispectra of the survey data are introduced to assess the implementation of the existing waste management systems. It is found that formwork and temporary hoardings are the major sources of construction waste. Improving environmental performance is ranked as the least project scope for construction projects. "Propose methods for reducing waste" is the major benefit gained. However, "Lack of well-known effective waste management methods" is the major difficulty encountered by organisations. "Use of metal formwork", "Use of prefabricated building components" and "Use of non-timber hoarding" are the recommended methods to improve the existing implementation of waste management systems.

Critical Success Factors for Bond Financing of Construction Projects in Asia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Infrastructure bond; Credit risk; Credit enhancement; Liquidity		Although bonds have been commonly used for financing construction works in developed countries such as the United States, Asian governments would like to see their construction growth increasingly funded by alternative sources such as the capital market, instead of overrelying on bank loans. Yet even in relatively active markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the use of bond financing for infrastructure development is limited. In a recent study based on two questionnaire surveys with subsequent interviews about retail and institutional investors, results demonstrated that credit risk was a major concern and that deterrents include lack of bond market information, illiquidity of domestic bonds, and the reliability of external credit ratings. Institutional investors, however, welcome infrastructure bonds because of the stable income stream matching their long-term commitments. To address these practical concerns, we have proposed credit and liquidity enhancement measures in this paper as the critical success factors for international construction promoters to tap into the bond market for financing construction works in Asia. Hence, this paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners who are working on project financing, because empirical findings reveal investors' concerns, which are then addressed with recommendations.

J	Bernold, LE				Bernold, LE			Economic model to optimize underground utility protection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						terrorism; economic impact; underground structures; utilities; buried pipes; risk analysis; optimization models	INTERRUPTIONS; ELECTRICITY	The need for better protecting our vital infrastructure from being damaged or destroyed has received increased attention since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The tragedy of having thousands of innocent people die before the eyes of an entire nation awakened people to the reality of "managed" attacks of unthinkable magnitudes. However, tragedies of a smaller scale are a daily occurrence but accepted as "collateral damage" of work in an unsafe environment. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis to address the question of how much money should be spent in protecting underground utilities from damage. During the study of an actual incident it was found that the total costs of such accidents are vastly underreported because only costs for emergency responses and repair are tallied up. This paper makes the case that a comprehensive approach for assessing the total economic impact of such incidents on the public, business, and government is the critical stepping stone to a mathematical optimization of expenditure for damage prevention. In addition, the reader will quickly realize that the use of the presented optimization model provides theoretical underpinning for the engineering profession in its effort to better protect our critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks.

Infrastructure maintenance and replacement optimization under multiple uncertainties and managerial flexibility	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Maintenance; replacement; optimization; Markov Decision Process; real options analysis	REAL OPTIONS; GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; PART; DETERIORATION; PROBABILITIES; ASSETS	Infrastructure maintenance and replacement decisions are subject to uncertainties such as regular asset degradation, structural failure, and price uncertainty. In the engineering domain, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) typically focus on uncertainties regarding asset degradation and structural failure. While the literature in the engineering domain stresses the importance of addressing price uncertainties, it does not substantiate the observations of such uncertainties through optimization modeling. By contrast, real option analyses (ROAs) that originate from the financial domain address price uncertainties but generally disregard asset degradation and structural failure. Accordingly, this piece of current research brings both domains closer together and proposes an optimization approach that incorporates the flexibility to choose between multiple successive intervention strategies, regular asset degradation, structural failure and multiple price uncertainties. A practical result of the current research is a realistic approach to optimization modeling in which state space reduction is achieved by combining prices into portfolios. The current research obtains transition probabilities from existing price data. This approach is demonstrated using a case study of a water authority in the Netherlands and confirms the premise that price fluctuations may influence short-term maintenance and replacement decisions.

These buildings contain a range of administrative spaces, classrooms, libraries and studios, reflecting their often complex, multi-use, heterogeneous nature. The key features of each environmental strategy are described (including passive, mixed-mode or active systems), in the context of the occupants and spaces they serve and the level of interaction that they afford. Energy performance and occupant thermal comfort (assessed by user surveys) are analysed and compared with studies of other non-domestic buildings, which have typically focused on more predictable single administrative uses (e.g. government offices), and unusually effective operation scenarios (e.g. continuous monitoring by expert building managers). The paper concludes by examining two of the case studies that reflect an increasingly common model of 'flexible' environmental design in more detail, identifying key features of the strategies for each building that have had a significant impact on their performance. The design assumptions leading to these features will be explored, and key lessons identified, contributing towards the development of a more robust evidential basis for choosing appropriate environmental strategies for university and other non-domestic buildings in the UK.

This is despite the enormous untapped potential of the facilities management sector to create social value in the communities in which they operate. To address this gap in research, this paper presents an in-depth case study of an innovative social procurement initiative developed by a major Australian facilities management organisation. Integrating research in the fields of employment studies, facilities management and social value, it provides new empirical evidence of the significant affective, cognitive, behavioural and situational social value outcomes which can be generated through facilities management. These are best achieved through new hybrid partnerships between business, government, not-for-profit, community and educational organisations which create shared value, underpinned by a common interest in maximising social value for the communities involved. More research is needed into the types of attributes, skills and resources that facilitate such outcomes, the attributes of organisations most likely to be able to collaborate and the types of cross-sector partnerships which work.

These requirements engender manifold uncertainties and risks events which may derail the success of MiC projects. Empirical studies have examined the risks associated with MiC in different countries. However, the critical risk factors (CRFs) in the application of MiC have not been reviewed. This study conducted a systematic review and synthesis of 39 empirical studies on the risks of MiC and identified 30 CRFs. Based on the frequency of occurrences, the top ten (10) CRFs in the application of MiC have been discussed. Of these, stakeholder fragmentation and management complexity; higher initial capital cost; poor supply chain integration and disturbances; delays in delivery of modular components to the site and poor government support and regulations constitute the five (5) most CRFs. The findings are useful to countries which are yet to adopt MiC and may broaden the understanding of offsite construction researchers and practitioners on the risks of MiC. Future studies would make a quantitative ranking of the CRFs and propose management strategies.	[Wuni, Ibrahim Y.; Shen, Geoffrey Q.

This method is proposed by an international organization and it is currently recommended by governments and organizations as a standard method to be adopted for this type of measurement. This paper presents a compilation of improvements, focused on increasing the accuracy of the FPA method, which have been proposed over the past 13 years. The methodology used was a systematic literature review (SLR), which was conducted with four research questions aligned with the objectives of this study. As a result of the SLR, of the 1600 results returned by the search engines, 454 primary studies were preselected according to the criteria established for the SLR. Among these studies, only 18 specifically referred to accuracy improvements for FPA, which was the goal of this study. The low number of studies that propose FPA improvements might demonstrate the maturity of the method in the current scenario of software metrics. Specifically in terms of found issues, it was found that the step for calculating the functional size exhibited the highest number of problems, indicating the need to revise FPA in order to encompass the possible improvements suggested by the researchers.

J	Meng, XH				Meng, Xianhai			CHANGE IN UK CONSTRUCTION: MOVING TOWARD SUPPLY CHAIN COLLABORATION	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; relationship; change; collaboration; construction industry; United Kingdom	PROJECTS; ADVERSARIAL; WORKING; MODEL	The traditional adversarial relationship in the construction industry has been criticized by a larger number of researchers and practitioners. Following the success of the supply chain collaboration in other industry sectors, such as manufacturing, supply chain relationships in UK construction have been increasingly changing from the traditional adversarial to the collaborative, which is supported by a series of government reports for the industry reform. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the current status of supply chain relationships in a systematic way. Therefore, there is no clear understanding of how change has taken place in today's practice and whether or not the change is balanced. To bridge the gap, a questionnaire survey is carried out in the UK construction industry. Based on the analysis of more than 100 responses, it is found that the UK construction industry as a whole has experienced an important change and moved toward supply chain collaboration. On the other hand, an unbalance is found for the change movement. In addition to the questionnaire survey, a series of industrial experts are interviewed, which help to explore the specific characteristics of supply chain collaboration in construction and provide practical implications for collaboration strategy implementation.

Therefore, it is imperative that military systems be designed to account for these countermeasures. As such, technology roadmapping should be a critical activity in the acquisition of defense systems. Technology roadmaps provide a strategic vision for a system that accounts for the operational context, including evolving needs and technology changes. However, the operational context can be difficult to predict. This article suggests using wargaming coupled with combat simulation to better understand the operational context to allow for testing and refining technology roadmaps. Wargaming requires teams to roleplay friendly and enemy units to determine how each side adapts with the implementation of a new military system. Computer-based simulations can then convert the qualitative results from the wargame into quantitative metrics that further inform the roadmap. A case study is presented for a technology roadmap associated with an armored exoskeleton. Wargaming forecasted the countermeasures implemented by the enemy and the associated responses. The wargame results were coupled with models to quantitatively forecast the change in the warfighter's survivability and lethality. The wargame was then used to inform the technology roadmap.

This can lead to situations where future traffic levels exceed the concession capacity limit, and additional investments in expansion is required. One common solution is to mandate this investment as a firm obligation in concession contracts, either after a set number of years or when demand reaches capacity. In this article, we show why these policies are suboptimal and propose a model that combines flexible capacity expansion decisions with conditional term extensions. We model this flexibility under the real options approach and the project value uncertainty during the life of the concession as a Brownian Bridge. As a novel contribution, we take into account the fact that concession revenues are bounded by the current traffic capacity of the road, which represents an upper absorbing barrier that has implications for the expansion decision. As a numerical application, this model is applied to a typical toll road project in Brazil. The results show that flexible expansion policies, coupled with conditional term extensions, have significant advantages. These findings can be of use to government officials involved in developing policies to attract private investment in public infrastructure projects.

However, evidence suggests that an organization's behaviour with regard to EE measures does not follow rational cost minimization, demonstrating potential ESOS weakness. A case study is presented that assesses whether ESOS can lead to EE measures deployment despite different overarching agendas. A generic qualitative approach is used to assess the change within the organization; auto-ethnomethodology was used to assess the change within its facility management (FM). The results demonstrate that the energy audit delivered through an agenda of cost minimization was weak in creating organizational behaviour change. However, the ESOS audit along with the research process led to a mindset change of the FM, resetting an overarching agenda from cost minimization to co-evolution between a building and its occupants, further empowering the FM to facilitate behavioural change within the whole organization. These findings suggest that the success of EE policies can increase if policies shift from understanding end-users as passive to proactive and capable of shaping better outcomes for themselves and their organizations.

J	Sherratt, F				Sherratt, Fred			Legitimizing public health control on sites? A critical discourse analysis of the Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						positive liberty; well-being.; health; power; Autonomy		As part of a wider programme, the UK Department of Health produced a Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge, seeking organizational commitment in improving the health of its workforce. Yet commercial involvement with the health of the worker beyond the workplace is a contentious issue, a fundamental challenge to personal freedoms. The exercise of this paternalistic or pastoral power should be questioned, and consequently the agendas and interests behind it have been explored through a critical discourse analysis of the press release of the Pledge. Workers' inability to make the 'right' decisions about their health was used as justification for corporate intervention to guide workers to their 'true' interests and the 'right' choices. The occupational health of individual construction workers on sites was negated for their wider contributions as a workforce to industry and the UK economy. Whilst the real interests of construction workers are likely to be served by a balance of good health and work, this should not be dictated by government, much less commercial organizations with vested interests in worker output. Concerns are raised for workers' health and well-being in terms of their fundamental autonomy, and an increasingly controlled relationship between productive activities and power relations.

Social Sustainability Considerations during Planning and Design: Framework of Processes for Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable development; Social factors; Design; Planning; Construction; Safety	PREVENTION; COSTS	This research identifies 50 processes and categorizes them into a framework for integrating and evaluating social considerations in construction projects. These processes focus on the planning and design phases because they offer the greatest potential for influencing project performance. The concept mapping research method was applied to develop this framework on the basis of input from 25 experts in academia, industry, and government. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to organize the experts' input into six categories defining social sustainability in construction projects: stakeholder engagement, user considerations, team formation, management considerations, impact assessment, and place context. Although previous research has recognized social sustainability as a series of processes, this study is the first to integrate them into a comprehensive framework. Practitioners can benefit from this framework, which will enhance existing sustainability assessment methods and help address the challenge of developing truly sustainable projects. This framework also provides academics with a tool for introducing students to social sustainability in construction projects. Future research could use this framework as a baseline, developing metrics using the processes included in the framework. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000566.

Relative values of these ratios are likely different between alternative facility types. Empirical analyses of ratio estimates are presented for English secondary schools over recent years. Findings challenge established views of the relative cost ratios of 1 (construction), 5 (facility management) to 200 (operations or staff), suggesting the ratios are actually 1/1/5 respectively. The study also estimates the value of investing in schools in terms of improved outcomes, applying educational attainment data for rebuilt schools. These are converted into monetary values using wage uplift indicators. This produces estimates of expected economic benefits (increased productivity and output) and benefits to government via future tax receipts (financial return). Findings suggest the present value of future tax revenues alone do justify investing in school rebuilding. Average economic returns are positive but highly variable, with high dispersion in expected benefits. These benefits are positive only in half the rebuilt schools. The results will help inform allocation of public resources in schools, while also assisting management of the growing independent and semi-autonomous school estate.

Government of India started to use public-private partnerships for this infrastructure provision but without knowing the rationale of its adoption. To this end, this study purposes to draw lessons on factors affecting PPP preference in Indian MSW sector. Questionnaire survey and interviews with the stakeholders of the PPP project provided the data for analysis. Factor analysis technique on the survey data resulted in four components each for attractive and negative factors. The findings suggest that MSW services primarily and importantly procured because of the PPP mode is more favoured on account of the dire need of MSW services in India and benefits. But, stakeholders perceived that PPP caused unfavourable results such as failed projects, high transaction costs, and overexploitation by the private sector. They attributed this negativity to the inappropriate procurement process. Hence, deliberation of the attractive factors and devising strategies to overcome the negative factors will help the public sector to successfully adopt PPP in MSW sector and to frame policies for the procurement of MSW projects through PPP route. This work is novel for providing sector-specific nuances.

This design allows us to examine whether the effects of firm characteristics and economic growth on capital structure vary with macroeconomic conditions and across periods with changing economic growth trends. First, the results show that the effect of macroeconomic conditions on capital structure is counter-cyclical. Second, the effects of firm characteristics on capital structure can vary with macroeconomic conditions, although firm characteristics do not have a direct effect on capital structure. Third, the effects of firm characteristics on capital structure can vary across periods with changing economic growth trends. Finally, economic growth does not have a direct effect on capital structure. However, the effect of economic growth on capital structure can vary with macroeconomic conditions and across periods with changing economic growth trends. The findings of this study can be a helpful reference for financial managers, creditors, investors and government policy-makers in emerging countries.

J	Xu, TJ; Tiong, RLK; Chew, DAS; Smith, NJ				Xu, TJ; Tiong, RLK; Chew, DAS; Smith, NJ			Development model for competitive construction industry in the people's Republic of China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PROJECTS	This paper identifies and analyzes the open-policy trend of the Chinese construction industry, which is characterized by trade liberalization, the underlying principle of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Compared to the construction industries in the United States, Japan, and the U.K., the construction industry in China is less developed in its legal framework, industrial structure, technological level, and international market share. To develop a competitive construction industry, the Chinese construction industry needs not only to accommodate appropriate international practice, but also to adapt and adopt it according to the market environment in China. A model to enhance the performance of the Chinese construction industry is proposed. The model consists of six modules: defining government's role, opening up the construction market and establishing a competitive mechanism, promoting design institutes' services and empowering professional bodies, encouraging technological innovations, upgrading employees' educational level, and adopting multiprocurement routes. Recognizing China's recent accession to the WTO and the attendant boost to its economy and industry development, the paper gives a timely evaluation of the post-WTO Chinese construction industry and proposes a model for its development. The model may serve the needs of academics, Chinese construction policymakers, construction enterprises, design institutes, and foreign contractors.

J	Wu, HJ; Qian, QK; Straub, A; Visscher, H				Wu, Hongjuan; Qian, Queena K.; Straub, Ad; Visscher, Henk			Stakeholder Perceptions of Transaction Costs in Prefabricated Housing Projects in China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prefabricated housing (PH); Transaction costs (TCs); Stakeholder perceptions; Challenges; Construction	CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; BARRIERS; PERFORMANCE; SCHEMES; OFFSITE	Prefabrication has the potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of housing production. However, there are various challenges in the realization of prefabricated housing (PH) from the stakeholder's perspective. Transaction costs (TCs) theory provides a particular angle that explains the invisible costs within transactions. This study aims to explore how perceptions of TCs vary for stakeholder groups and show the potential to reduce TCs in China. The distribution of TCs related to stages and stakeholders was investigated by a literature study and validated by expert interviews. Further, an existing framework of TCs was adopted to conduct a questionnaire survey for collecting perceptions of TCs from six stakeholder groups. The findings show that assembly, detailed design, and design change are the most highlighted TCs of PH. In particular, the component suppliers complained of TCs from the points of detailed design and hiring skilled labor. The local government emphasized TCs on monitoring and enforcement in assembly, architectural design, and component transportation. This research contributes to the construction management community by acknowledging stakeholders in understanding their TCs, which also inspires the policy makers to reduce significant TCs to smooth transactions for the future of China's PH market.

J	Bachman, LR				Bachman, Leonard R.			New Professionalism: the post-industrial context	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; education; professionalism; public institutions; public interest; universities		Definitions and perceptions of professionalism are continually challenged and transformed by public need, government interaction and institutional organizations. When the goals of those three entities are focused on near-term results, this poses a significant threat to the integrity, value and relevance of professional services. When the individual and corporate professional's profit margin, corporate shareholder responsibility and news media sensationalism are factored in, this short-termism dynamic is greatly magnified. Built environment professions are seen as particularly vulnerable to this threat, given that investments in buildings and infrastructure have long-life and high-performance service expectations. This commentary responds to the Building Research & Information special issue entitled New Professionalism' (2013, volume 40, number 1) and situates the predicament of built environment professionals within an emerging historical transition: that of the post-industrial information society with its characteristic knowledge workers and cybernetic bases of production. Long-term virtues of the built environment mission such as sustainability, public good and evidence-based design are shown to be reflections of the transition from industrial era short-termism to post-industrial systemic foresight. This commentary supplements the special issue papers with a discussion on the broader academy's potential role in breaking the stranglehold of contemporary short-termism in the built environment professions.

Technical and institutional factors in the emergence of project management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						History; Systems analysis; Configuration management; Systems engineering; Systems integration; Weapon system; Intercontinental ballistic missile; Polaris; SAGE; Air defense; Von Braun; Schriever; Ramo-Wooldridge; MITRE; Phased planning; Lincoln Laboratory; Atomic bomb; V-2; Matrix management; Complexity	OPERATIONS-RESEARCH	This paper explores the fundamental question of why the practice and discipline of project management emerged during the 1940s through the 1960s in the United States. Although projects have been around for millennia, not until the middle of the 20th century in the U.S. military-industrial academic complex did project management become formalized in institutional processes and as an academic discipline. The paper argues that technical complexity and novelty were the primary factors driving project management and its engineering counterpart systems engineering, as a new organizational form. Institutional factors such as the need for legal separation between government and industry created important secondary effects that drove the particular forms in which project management evolved. This paper uses examples from large scale, complex projects of the 1940s through 1960s in the aerospace and computing industries to tease out the fundamental technical and institutional factors that led to the emergence of project management in these two key American industries during this period.

This is the world's first cap-and-trade programme to cover buildings in the commercial, industrial and public sectors. Its main aim is to reduce CO2 emissions from energy consumption in existing buildings in urban areas; therefore, it is called an 'urban cap-and-trade programme'. The appropriateness and effectiveness of this demand-side mechanism are examined, as well as the key policy and strategy components for introducing this new mechanism. Crucial factors for the successful introduction of this programme include the implementation of a mandatory reporting programme prior to the cap-and-trade programme and a consultation process involving open discussions among stakeholders for creating a consensus. Actual outcomes of the programme will take several years to assess; however, given the significant impact of growing carbon emissions from existing urban buildings, an urban cap-and-trade mechanism can be a worthwhile action at the level of local governance. Based on these lessons, other cities can consider this urban cap-and-trade scheme as a viable policy instrument.

Older people's experience of disabling conditions can be affected by the design and layout of their accommodation. Adaptations and assistive technology (AT) are a major way of addressing this gap between functional capacity and the built environment. The degree of adaptability and the differences in the average cost of adaptation of different types of property are large and there is major variation within property type. Based on a series of user profiles, it was found that a comprehensive package of adaptations and AT is likely to result in significant economies arising from a reduction in the need for formal care services. This finding is sensitive to assumptions about how long an individual would use the adaptations and AT, as well as to the input of informal care and the nature of their accommodation. The present study, which focused on social housing, has implications for how practitioners specify ways of meeting individual needs as well as providing a case to support the substantial increase in demand for specialist adaptation work.

J	BAKER, M				BAKER, M			SHARPENING THE FOCUS OF VIEWPOINTS BETWEEN HIGHER-EDUCATION AND EMPLOYERS OF THE EXPERTISE REQUIRED FOR CONTEMPORARY AND FUTURE TECHNICAL MANAGERS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Sharpening the focus between what employers require for technical managers and what universities are delivering is deemed to be an urgent strategic and policy issue. Governments should also be concerned about the problem and its solution because the efficacy of technical managers in both the public and private sectors is essential to any nation's achieving a competitive position in the global economy. Technical managers must understand the technology which they are managing and the requirements of the customers which they are attempting to serve. Technical managers have wide and varied responsibilities in any enterprise; major areas are MOT, TQM, R & D, design, production facilities, manufacturing, product reliability, managing technical personnel, managing technical resources, and in high-tech enterprises, determining the customer's present and future requirements. Fundamental strategic issues are: 1) employers' vision for forecasting future needs, 2) the compatibility of university curricula with required employer job classification, and 3) availability of graduate-level job-focused short courses, symposia, and workshops to maintain currency of technical managers for contemporary and future job demands. In-depth forecasts of needs by employers and a sharper focus of viewpoints interpreting these and how they can be fulfilled must be achieved to erase or allay concerns.

However, early cost prediction is often inaccurate because public officials are not familiar with cost engineering practices, and moreover, have limited time and insufficient information for estimating the possible range of the cost distribution. This study develops a conceptual cost prediction model by combining rough set theory, case-based reasoning, and genetic algorithms to better predict costs in the conceptual planning phase. Rough set theory and qualitative in-depth interviews are integrated to select the proper input attributes for the cost prediction model. Case-based reasoning is then applied to predict road construction costs by considering users' difficulties in the conceptual policy planning phase. A genetic algorithm is also used to assist the rough set model and case-based reasoning model to obtain optimal solutions. The result of the analysis shows that the proposed conceptual cost prediction model is reliable and robust compared to the existing cost prediction model.

This study ascertains the relative importance of a set of internal and external factors for the intensity of technological and non-technological innovation among construction contracting firms. Seventeen types of contractor activities, associated with three levels of service content, are identified and a characteristics-based theory of service innovation with four innovation trajectories (material, informational, methodological, contractual or relational) is applied. Data collected from a questionnaire survey of 44 of the 50 largest construction contractors in Sweden indicate that 30 contractors had carried out research and development during 2003-2005 and that 11 had made at least one innovation new to the country. The lowest level of innovation intensity was mostly linked to the methodological trajectory (28 contractors), while the material trajectory dominated innovation 'new to the country' (eight contractors). Analysing data per activity where research and development or innovation had been reported shows that collaboration with another type of contractor is associated with a higher intensity of innovation, regardless of trajectory. The level of employee education is significant for relational innovation. The consequences for policies in firms and central government are identified.

These have shifted the focus of the nation's construction industry towards mass production and modular products. A proper study on site selection criteria for new IBS precast manufacturing sites has now become essential. The preliminary study in this research determines the IBS precast manufacturing site selection criteria from literature reviews. Questionnaires pertaining to IBS acceptance and preference criteria were send to manufacturers, policymakers, academicians and contractors. The outcome analyses the respondents' view towards 15 site selection criteria. The result from the ANOVA statistical test indicates that most respondents agreed with the selected criteria except political and regulation criteria, urban requirement criteria, and personal criteria. However, there is a significant difference within the opinions of the contractors and manufacturers sector.

Sources of Changes in Design-Build Contracts for a Governmental Owner	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of the Portland-International-Center-for-Management-of-Engineering-and-Technology (PICMET 2007)	AUG 05-09, 2007	Portland, OR	Portland State Univ, Dept Engn & Technol Management, Natl Sci Fdn, Ikon Off Syst, Portland Int Ctr Management Engn & Technol			DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; CONSTRUCTION	In recent years, many U.S. federal, state, and local governments have been authorized to use the design-build method of project delivery instead of the traditional design-bid-build method. Recent studies have not been definitive on the cost advantage of design-build for governmental owners. There are fewer change orders in design-build due to design errors because the designer (architect/engineer) and contractor are one entity, but there are other causes of change orders. Some literature suggests that changes requested by the owner of the facility are greater with the design-build method. This research examines the causes for construction-phase changes in 14 design-build and 20 design-bid-build projects. Total changes, expressed as number per contract, cost per contract, or percentage of original contract, were significantly lower in design-build. Fewer design errors in design-build accounted for this advantage. The number of owner-requested changes was significantly greater in design-build. The cost of owner-requested changes, averaged over all the projects, was significantly less for design-bid-build. The differences in changes due to differing site conditions were not significant. The concept that there are more owner-requested changes in design-build projects is supported by this research.

This usually requires increasing insulation levels from code requirements on the understanding that this will provide a warmer, drier internal environment. However this solution to 'cold and damp' housing may have unintended consequences; while highly insulated dwellings may be warm over the winter, are they still comfortable during warmest months? This study analyses 29 dwellings in Auckland, New Zealand to determine if there is any difference in the temperature and thermal comfort between three types of dwellings: newly built green certified (6-Homestar), newly built non-certified and old dwellings (pre-1978). The results show large differences between dwelling categories with the certified 6-Homestar dwellings exceeding the World Health Organisation (WHO) healthy temperature threshold 75% of the time during the warmest months of the year, resulting in predicted occupant discomfort 16% of the time. These results have significant policy implications with it apparent that not only under-heating but also overheating require specific attention in government legislation, green building rating tools and building codes.

JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Toll road; Traffic analysis; Toll fares; Case studies; Brazil; Highways and roads; Concession; Infrastructure	PARTNERSHIP INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; RISK ALLOCATION; CONTRACTS; SPAIN	This paper assesses the toll road concession program started by the federal government of Brazil, from its beginning in 1996 until 2012. Brazil has one of the longest road networks, under private concessions, in the entire world. The authors use the case study approach, based on the available information, to analyze the evolution of the program over the course of its history. Specifically, a detailed analysis is conducted from three perspectives: those of the competitiveness of the tender, the impact of toll modifications caused by the rebalancing of the economics of the contract, and the actual evolution of the traffic flows as compared to their estimates, respectively. It is found that the most recent auctions have been very competitive. Moreover, with the original toll roads, bidders relied on early traffic forecasts that turned out to be overly optimistic, and over the years, contract rebalancing has led to large increases in toll rates. Overall, and even though Brazil's program can be considered successful in many ways, there is still considerable room for improvement. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

D.; Gimbi, Joaqium			Project management challenges for post-disaster reconstruction projects in Angola: a public sector perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Angola; Challenges; Post-disaster reconstruction (PDR); Project management; Public sector	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION; BUILDING BACK; DISASTER; INFRASTRUCTURE; RECOVERY; PROCUREMENT; EARTHQUAKE; LESSONS; ACEH	Purpose Despite the extensive research on post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP), there is a paucity of studies that examine critical challenges for the project practices in post-war-developing countries, particularly, Africa. The purpose of this research is to investigate the key project management challenges impacting the post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP) during the construction and planning stages in Angola, with an aim to fill the knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach The primary data was collected from 130 project management practitioners working with planning, provincial government organisations including consultants, and contractors within the Angolan public sectors organisations. Response data was subjected to descriptive statistics, mean scores, and inferential statistics (One samplet-tests) and Kendall's concordance. Findings The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of the ranking of the 21challenges affecting the PDRP among the groups; with statistically significant differences amongst the 10 challenges. Based on the overall sample, 6 out of 10 critical challenges are between (24-25) levels of agreement close to the mean. The results of the mean score ranking indicate that "working with poor or restricted access to location", "project culture that fits the needs of local people"; "improving the capacity of local government", "minimizing the negative effects of local people" and "relocation issues by establishing property rights during the reconstruction project" were the five critical challenges to managing PDRP whereas "improving information and communication processes", "securing adequate resources (material and machinery)", "dealing with rising costs of materials and labour" were considered to be the least critical. Research limitations/implications The study was restricted to one province and Country (out of 18) namely, Luanda, Angola. Therefore, the findings may not be generalized to public sector organisations operating in different countries with different contexts, political settings and disaster complexities. Practical implications The establishment of challenges in PDRPs helps the key stakeholders by providing the foundation to project teams to address the challenges during planning and construction stages, and thus improving project delivery in the future. Understanding the uniqueness of PDRPs and interdependency of project management from the implementing organization is of particular value for the managers of future projects and other decision-makers, especially in the emerging countries. Moreover, the findings could be used to reflect on the need to formulate policies appropriate to post disaster environments, which among other issues could address building policies, which could include land ownership regulations and procedures together with property rights. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge on the subject within a previously unexplored post-war context with a focus on public organizations perspective. The study provides insights on the challenges affecting the post-disaster reconstruction across the Angolan public sector.	[Sospeter, Nyamagere Gladys; Rwelamila, Pantaleo M.

It is imperative to determine the policy implications of the construction labor force's skill formation that concerns both the economic and social development of Asian metropolitan regions. Nevertheless, little comparative research has investigated construction VET models of the fast-changing regions. This paper used a multiple exploratory case study design to study the construction VET of two Asian metropolises, Singapore and Hong Kong, which share similar historical paths of skill formation and face comparable challenges of skills shortages and aging workforces in the construction sector. The research design combined an in-depth literature review, document analysis, field trip observations, and semistructured group interviews. The results revealed how developmental, collective, and liberal skill-formation features were combined to form the hybrid construction VET systems in the two metropolises to serve the governments' agenda of enhancing productivity and developing high-skills societies; and unveil the political-economic, cultural, and historical reasons underpinning the challenges faced by the systems in developing occupational competence of construction workforce.

Alliancing has since emerged as an evolution of the partnering method and offers substantial advantages over partnering, but it also poses more difficulties with federal acquisition regulations. This research aims to determine if an alliancing contract can be effectively utilized in federal construction and, if so, to create a framework under which federal agencies can utilize the advantages of alliance contracts within existing regulations. A commercially available standard form alliancing contract was selected for analysis against the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Key practices that characterize the alliancing method were identified. Utilizing a panel of federal contracting experts, qualitative data were gathered to analyze which of these key practices do or do not comply with federal regulations, why certain practices do not comply, and how those practices could achieve compliance. The results show that most alliancing key practices can be utilized in a federal construction project. Although other practices cannot be used effectively under current regulations, these limitations do not significantly hinder the use of a comprehensive and effective federal alliancing contract.

A game model is presented to analyse how the equity allocation between private partners-typically, building firms and operating firms-indirectly influences their incentives, in order to improve the quality of non-contractible services. The findings show that the equity structure can effectively compensate for the incompleteness of the contract. When the equity structure is privately negotiated by private partners whose only concern is private benefits, a loss of social benefits due to the low quality of non-contractible services occurs because the penalties are not enforceable. A socially optimal equity structure, which depends on the combined effects of marginal social and private benefits, plays a role in aligning these social and private benefits, thereby providing private partners with appropriate incentives to improve non-contractible services. These findings provide insights into the regulation of the equity structure for PPP projects providing services in diverse sectors.

Based on optimization techniques, through a portfolio of materials two of the three objectives in building maintenance works can be achieved: employment generation, lifecycle cost reduction, and carbon emission reduction. These materials are different from the original ones used in the floors, walls, ceilings, waterproofing, and doors. The findings enhance the sustainability performance of the global building construction sector in overcoming the universal barriers to implementing energy-efficient buildings, namely, high initial cost, weak enforcement of government policies, and uncertainty of returns. The prototype model suggests that a portfolio of materials can be constructed to achieve two objectives at any given time, with the third objective acting as a constraint. The optimization techniques enable the global building construction sector to strike a balance among economic, social, and environmental benefits and constraints in maintenance works.

J	Pan, M; Pan, W				Pan, Mi; Pan, Wei			Stakeholder Perceptions of the Future Application of Construction Robots for Buildings in a Dialectical System Framework	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction robot; Building; Technological innovation; Future planning; Stakeholder; Dialectical system	INNOVATION	Construction robots hold much promise for buildings, but their real-world uptake is limited. Previous studies lacked in-depth explorations of stakeholder perceptions to help elaborate the development requirements and dialectics of construction robots. This paper examined stakeholder perceptions of future construction robots for buildings within the Hong Kong context theoretically based on a dialectical system framework that incorporates the technical systems, stakeholders, and contexts. The study was conducted through a questionnaire survey with wide-ranging industry stakeholders that yielded 166 effective responses and 20 follow-up interviews for generating insights. The results indicate that construction robots have minimal application but are perceived to be important, particularly in off-site production and on-site lifting. The findings reveal the multidimensional complexity of task-oriented technical systems and the influencing contexts of construction robots, and demonstrate their dialectical relationship. Recommendations are offered for promoting robot applications, which include leveraging government support, capitalizing on off-site construction, encouraging technology adaptation, and driving task-technology integrative and iterative design. This paper contributes to the literature on construction robotics by proposing a novel dialectical system framework and providing new insights for future research and development.

Housing associations (HAs) contribute approximately 20% of the UK's new housing supply. HAs are currently experiencing central government funding cuts and rental revenue reductions. As part of HAs' quest to ramp up supply despite tight budget conditions, they are reviewing how they learn from defects. Learning from defects is argued as a means of reducing the persistent defect problem within the UK housebuilding industry, yet how HAs learn from defects is under-researched. The aim of this research is to better understand how HAs, in practice, learn from past defects to reduce the prevalence of defects in future new homes. The theoretical lens for this research is organizational learning. The results drawn from 12 HA case studies indicate that effective organizational learning has the potential to reduce defects within the housing sector. The results further identify that HAs are restricting their learning to focus primarily on reducing defects through product and system adaptations. Focusing on product and system adaptations alone suppresses HAs' abilities to reduce defects in the future.

J	Schweber, L; Lees, T; Torriti, J				Schweber, Libby; Lees, Tim; Torriti, Jacopo			Framing evidence: policy design for the zero-carbon home	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						net-zero; energy policy; policy formation; public policy; evidence-based policy; policy design; regulatory impact assessments; zero carbon; building regulations	RATIONALITY; KNOWLEDGE	In 2006 the UK Government announced a move to zero-carbon homes by 2016. The demand posed a major challenge to policy-makers and construction professionals entailing a protracted process of policy design. The task of giving content to this target is used to explore the role of evidence in the policy process. Whereas much literature on policy and evidence treats evidence as an external input, independent of politics, this paper explores the ongoing mutual constitution of both. Drawing on theories of policy framing and the sociology of classification, the account follows the story of a policy for Zero Carbon Homes from the parameters and values used to specify the target. Particular attention is given to the role of regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) and to the creation of a new policy venue, the Zero Carbon Hub. The analysis underlines the way in which the choices about how to model and measure the aims potentially transforms them, the importance of policy venues for transparency and the role of RIAs in the authorization of particular definitions. A more transparent, open approach to policy formulation is needed in which the framing of evidence is recognized as an integral part of the policy process.

A longitudinal study of BIM adoption in three major public agencies (two in the United Kingdom and one in Israel) tracked their BIM adoption actions and outcomes over a 3-year period, using a formal BIM adoption impact map (BIM-AIM) to structure the observations and to record and measure the outcomes. Detailed case studies of these organizations and 17 of their individual projects reveal the actions taken and their effects. The agencies' project managers varied greatly in their perceptions of the purpose and the value of BIM implementation. Nevertheless, two of the organizations have made significant progress in compiling the information backbone necessary to integrate as-designed and as-made BIM models in digital twin information systems that can enhance their operations and achieve long-term organizational goals. The results emphasize that public agencies stand to reap significant value from system-wide asset information models in addition to the benefits of BIM application in isolated projects. An updated (BIM-AIM), which can guide agencies in their BIM adoption efforts, is a central contribution of the research.

This can include new infrastructure projects in the case of growing areas. It can also include the renewal and upgrading of existing infrastructure in areas that have been inhabited and already developed. Infrastructure includes roads, bridges and transportation systems; power grids and energy service; internet and telecommunications; and water and sewer services. This development can be part of a system of systems, in which government, industries, and universities can contribute knowledge, skills, and abilities. This paper will investigate the strategic project management taken by one university to provide an academic experience that will prepare engineering students to address several of the Grand Engineering Challenges of the 21st Century, as identified by the US National Academy of Engineering. The challenges relating to energy, water, information, and urban infrastructure can be approached using the functions of teaching, research, and service. By approaching the challenges strategically, resources of faculty time, student effort and laboratory facilities can be leveraged to achieve greater results. This case study will describe the efforts and results to date and identify opportunities for future growth.

The scarcity of research exploring this important issue means that there is a pressing need for thorough investigative research which offers empirically-based intuitions on the assimilation of local and foreign construction firms, particularly in the context of developing countries. This study reviewed the presence of foreign construction firms in the Malaysian construction industry (MCI) by exploring regulations and performance-related issues. A systematic literature review was conducted by employing the summative content analysis methodology. The key concerns observed were the Malaysian liberalization policy, the governing rules and the actual performance of foreign construction firms. The formation of backward linkages was found to be one of the most substantial ways by which Malaysia could benefit from the participation of foreign construction firms. Therefore, this article suggests that the government has a vital role to play in promoting the formation of backward linkages between foreign construction firms and local business entities. This study marks a significant contribution to current knowledge of the critical elements involved in the relationship between MCI and foreign construction firms in Malaysia.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 representatives of clients and contractors with direct and recent experience of delivering large public infrastructure projects. Interviews explored the procurement approaches taken, and the use of incentives and performance measurement. Data was subjected to inductive analysis to identify emergent concepts and themes relating to the way that New Public Management (NPM) influences the commercial management of infrastructure construction projects, with particular reference to OHS impacts. The concept of institutional logics was utilised as a theoretical frame to understand clients' behaviour in the commercial management of infrastructure projects. Client behaviour was consistent with elements of NPM and reflected a managerialist logic in the pursuit of efficiency, the use of targets, incentives and performance measurement. However, a strong professional service logic was also found to drive active client behaviour in relation to the management of OHS. Understanding the institutional logics driving client OHS practices is an important theoretical development that can stimulate reflexive practice which may create an impetus for change.

UK government policy has prioritized energy efficiency in the built stock as a means of carbon reduction, but the sector is historically information poor, particularly the non-domestic building stock. This paper presents the results of a pilot study that investigated whether and how property and energy consumption data might be combined for non-domestic energy analysis. These data were combined in a 'Non-Domestic Energy Efficiency Database' to describe the location and physical attributes of each property and its energy consumption. The aim was to support the generation of a range of energy-efficiency statistics for the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors of the non-domestic building stock, and to provide robust evidence for national energy-efficiency and carbon-reduction policy development and monitoring. The work has brought together non-domestic energy data, property data and mapping in a 'data framework' for the first time. The results show what is possible when these data are integrated and the associated difficulties. A data framework offers the potential to inform energy-efficiency policy formation and to support its monitoring at a level of detail not previously possible.

S. government agencies and their contractors have subscribed to using the prescriptive metric of technology readiness level ( TRL) as a measure of maturity of an individual technology, with a view toward operational use in a system context. A comprehensive set of concerns becomes relevant when this metric is abstracted from an individual technology to a system context, which may involve interplay among multiple technologies that are integrated through a system development life cycle. This paper proposes a system-focused approach for managing system development and making effective and efficient decisions during this life cycle. A system readiness level (SRL) index that incorporates both the current TRL scale and the concept of an integration readiness level is presented with methods for determining current and future readiness of a system. Using techniques in evolutionary algorithms, the SRL index is optimized based on resource allocation to provide a decision support approach that enhances managerial capabilities in the system's development life cycle. The optimization model for the SRL is then executed with a case example and resource constraints of 75%, 60%, 45%, 30%, and 15% to demonstrate how it can be used to make strategic planning decisions in the system's development life cycle.

BIM security: A critical review and recommendations using encryption strategy and blockchain	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						BIM security; Levels of BIM security; Blockchain; Collaborative BIM; Encryption	INFORMATION MODEL BIM; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; LIFE-CYCLE; CONSTRUCTION; COLLABORATION; MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; ATTACKS; CHALLENGES; OPERATIONS	Security of information in collaborative BIM platforms is crucial particularly for critical projects such as that of government buildings, prisons, and power plants. Inappropriate distribution and loss of sensitive information may potentially lead to physical security threats, financial loss, and loss of trust and reputation. Therefore, this paper identifies the information security requirements of collaborative BIM platforms considering the characteristics related to data security of collaborative BIM platforms through a literature review and as a result, identifies seven components of BIM security, based on which defines three levels of BIM security. Existing cybersecurity facilitating technologies such as encryption protocols, distributed database technology, and blockchain technology are reviewed to assess applicability to BIM security. This review shows that although the technologies to support BIM security are available in research and on market, they are not customized in existing collaborative BIM platforms to support BIM security. Therefore, two conceptual frameworks are proposed - (1) an encryption strategy-based framework to facilitate secure storage and distribution of BIM and (2) a blockchain-based framework to record BIM changes in a tamper-proof ledger for the non-trusting environment of construction projects. Discussions on cost and functionality are provided, which will be further extended in the future.	[Das, Moumita; Tao, Xingyu; Cheng, Jack C.

There are also many BIM-related research initiatives worldwide. Likewise, the Korean government has joined this trend by improving its existing e-Submission system, SEUMTER, to provide for BIM-based e-submission and automated code compliance checking. Further, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in Korea has funded the Korea BIM (KBIM) building e-Submission system project. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is an openBlM approach that has been designated as an international standard through the International Organization for Standardization. It is not dependent on specific design tools and is suitable for public works applications. Hence, this study performed a comprehensive analysis of and developed a framework for a prototypical system for an e-Submission process based on the IFC data model. Four main modules were developed to perform code checking, submission, pre-checking, and automated rule-making. A real-world project was used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This study could increase the adoption of BIM-based building e-Submission systems by sharing effective and successful processes.

J	Lam, KC; Oshodi, OS				Lam, Ka Chi; Oshodi, Olalekan Shamsideen			Using Univariate Models for Construction Output Forecasting: Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Econometric Techniques	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Box-Jenkins; Forecasting; Construction output; Support vector machine	PROPERTY PRICE; HONG-KONG; DEMAND; INVESTMENT; MARKET	Forecasting of the volume of construction works plays an important role in ensuring that stakeholders (contractors, consultants, government, etc.) formulate policies for strategic long-term planning in the construction sector. In construction economics, research efforts targeted at construction output forecasting have been limited due to the lack of availability of quantitative data. To address this problem, the current study explores the use of univariate modeling techniques in construction output forecasting. Three univariate modeling techniques [namely, Box-Jenkins, neural network autoregression (NNAR), and support vector machine (SVM)] were used to predict output of various construction sectors. In the literature, the Box-Jenkins model is considered a benchmark univariate method due to its simplicity, sound theoretical basis, and predictive performance. Out-of-sample forecasting was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. The results of the study revealed that the SVM model can reliably and accurately predict residential, maintenance, and total construction output in the medium term. The univariate models reported here can be implemented using historical data on construction output in other countries; this is particularly useful in cases where data are inadequate for multivariate models. The developed SVM model can serve as a tool for estimating future trends in construction output.

This research aims to identify appropriate responses to PPP risks in these projects and prioritize the implementation of risk responses. To achieve this goal, experts were requested to provide strategies to mitigate 23 PPP risks and suggest the time required to implement them. Finally, the applicability of mitigation measures was investigated by prioritizing them based on the scores obtained from the product of three factors, namely the importance of each risk and the solution's feasibility and effectiveness. Although the most critical risk was determined to be the impossibility of providing physical security, the most applicable solution was related to the government's insufficient commitment to carry out its obligations. The identified risks are common among conflict states, but this research focused on Afghanistan. However, the introduced solutions can be employed as a new collection for the risk response development in countries with conditions similar to Afghanistan. Furthermore, the findings can expand the use of PPP and improve the risk distribution in such projects.

This paper aims at providing answers to the following key research questions: Which are the PPP features that favour innovation? How should a PPP be properly structured in order to foster innovation? With this aim, drawing upon the main streams of studies on innovation, we develop a conceptual framework on the relationship between PPP and innovation and formulate the research hypotheses. An econometric analysis is then applied to empirically test the hypotheses using a dataset of 290 PPP projects spanning different countries and sectors, extracted by the World Bank PPI Database. Findings reveal that the arrangement of PPP projects; the market, contract and network structure, as well as government supports, may affect innovation. These results provide foundations to elaborate managerial implications for the future implementation of PPP projects, showing how PPP features have to be structured in order to foster innovation.

In developing countries, corruption stifles economic development and engenders social inequality. Using a structured questionnaire survey to elicit direct knowledge and lived experiences of construction practitioners, this study uncovered the prevalence and forms of corrupt practices within the developing country of Ghana. Research findings illustrate that habitual corruption and unethical behavior prevail among public officials, contractors, and construction professionals during the bid evaluation, tendering, and contract implementation stages of a construction contract. This research proffers that corruption is driven by a toxic concoction of high political connections, excessive and reckless sole sourcing of public construction projects, lack of commitment by construction companies in addressing corruption, and the inherently idiosyncratic operational environment of the construction sector. The top five forms of corruption frequently encountered, in descending order, are kickbacks (extortion), bribery, collusion and tender rigging, conflict of interest, and fraud. This research presents a rare glimpse of construction industry corruption in a developing country and provides polemic clarity geared to intellectually challenge readers in government and industry. Future work is required to explore and develop appropriate countermeasures to address corrupt practices and behaviors. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Specifically, it aims to help answer questions about (1) how much should be spent on mitigation (specifically, retrofitting or acquiring/demolishing buildings); (2) what the return on that investment will be; and (3) how mitigation funds should be spent (i.e., which buildings should be mitigated, how, and when). A full-scale case study for residential woodframe buildings in eastern North Carolina is presented to show how a model application can consider the important features of hurricane loss and mitigation while remaining computationally tractable for real, regional applications and to illustrate the type of results the model provides and how they can be interpreted. The case study considers damage from both high winds and storm surge flooding. The case study includes a detailed assessment of the risk by using a carefully selected set of hurricane scenarios to represent the regional hazard and a component-based damage model and considers physically realistic mitigation strategies.

In the construction industry, government agencies and private sector clients typically adopt competitive bidding to determine contract awards. Contractors also apply the same approach to bidding decisions. There are many variables that affect contractor decisions regarding whether to bid and the markup scale, which complicate the bidding decision process. This study proposes a Multi-Criteria Prospect Model for Bidding Decision (BD-MCPM) to assist contractors to make decisions on bid/no bid and markup scale. Key factors of influence that impact bidding decisions were identified first. Second, Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) was employed to assess factor weights and determine bid/no bid. Finally, if a decision to bid is given, then the Multi-Criteria Prospect Model (MCPM), which links Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), is deployed to determine the markup scale that best conforms to primary decision maker (PDM) preferences. The applicability of this model was demonstrated in a real case study.

J	Syn, T; Ramaprasad, A				Syn, Thant; Ramaprasad, Arkalgud			Megaprojects - symbolic and sublime: an ontological review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Review						Megaprojects; Ontology; Research	PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; RESEARCH QUESTIONS; LEADERSHIP; HISTORY; DESIGN; DAM	Purpose Megaprojects are symbolic milestones of human history. Most megaprojects are one-of-a-kind endeavors to which traditional project management principles are neither applicable nor suitable, rendering the holistic study of megaprojects especially difficult. There is no systemic framework that can help systematically assess and guide megaprojects and megaproject research. In the absence of such a framework there is a significant risk of bias in planning the projects and the topics researched. The purpose of this paper is to present an ontological framework of megaprojects and discuss how it can help analyze individual megaprojects and synthesize the corpus of megaproject research. Design/methodology/approach An ontology framework of megaproject is developed by deconstructing the symbolism and purpose of megaprojects into respective dimensions and their categories. The ontological framework is then used to map the extent literature on megaproject to identify the dominant themes and gaps in the state-of-the-research. Findings The megaproject research has predominantly focused on select stakeholders (builders, governments, and communities), translation stages (implementation and conceptualization), and sublime (mostly economic). Other aspects of megaprojects have received little or no attention. Originality/value The paper presents an ontological framework to holistically capture the symbolism and sublime of megaprojects. The framework is complete, expansive, and grounded, yet simple, parsimonious, and innovative. It is a tool for decision makers more than a formal ontology readable by machines.

J	Short, CA; Whittle, GE; Owarish, M				Short, CA; Whittle, GE; Owarish, M			Fire and smoke control in naturally ventilated buildings	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						fire and smoke modelling; fire engineering; fire regulations; governance; innovation; natural ventilation; performance-based regulation; regulation; sustainability; UK		There is a developing interest in achieving low-energy, naturally ventilated, non-domestic buildings in significant numbers over a relatively short period that is driven by the government's commitment to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and building owners' interests in reducing life cycle costs. The presumption is that this is possible within the current regulatory context. However, design for natural ventilation of public buildings is still innovative, at least within the regulatory framework. Two case studies involving the implementation of natural ventilation schemes indicate the concern and barriers raised by local authority Building Control departments, the fire authorities and various prospective insurers in response to design proposals. The design strategies devised fell outside the provisions of the prevailing codes and regulations in their approach to ensuring safe and effective fire control and smoke clearance using natural ventilation. The destabilizing effects of the current regulatory system impact negatively on the use of natural ventilation and hinder innovation. Schemes proposing to incorporate natural ventilation may be rejected through risk- and value-engineering exercises because of;perceived uncertainties about compliance with current fire regulations and codes, and the time and cost implications of embarking on an exercise to prove at least equivalence in the creation of a safe environment.

Design/methodology/approach The OLI factors and hypothesis are significantly developed to address a weakness in the OLI framework in its application to settings, such as multinational contracting, with extreme heterogeneity arising from extreme location specificity. Findings These developments advance Dunning's seminal contribution and bring this to life in construction research that has barely applied the framework and, when doing so, has focused only on outbound FDI by multinational contractors (MCs). Research limitations/implications The power of the OLI framework is increased on explaining and predicting FDI in contexts that exhibit extreme heterogeneity associated with extreme location specificity. Furthermore, the operationalisation of key theories representing the framework's OLI factors is made far more precise. Practical implications Engineering, construction and architectural managers, can now more reliably apply the OLI framework both in MCs' outbound FDI decisions and in governments' decisions to attract new MCs - or inbound FDI. Originality/value A significant advance is made in the OLI framework in settings with extreme location specificity, along with the operationalisation of key theories associated with the OLI factors, including the first steps to operationalise Coase's Nobel prize-winning transaction cost thesis.

Options-based negotiation management of PPP-BOT infrastructure projects	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Real options; private finance; public-private partnerships; build-operate-transfer; negotiation	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; MINIMUM REVENUE GUARANTEE; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; REAL OPTIONS; HIGHWAY CONCESSIONS; RISK MITIGATION; UNCERTAINTY; VALUATION; MODEL	The success of public-private partnership (PPP)-build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects largely depends on effectively mitigating the impact of a variety of risks and uncertainties, especially those influencing the revenue over time. Revenue instability is one of the main obstacles of PPP form of procurement. Government support, which is established as a clause in the concession agreement, should be carefully designed and well formulated. Options which arise from certain clauses in the contract are more valuable for risky projects. The purpose of this paper's proposed model is to evaluate early fund generation options and also to calculate equitable bounds for a guaranteed revenue for the project sponsor under uncertainty and risk. The model is specially designed to alleviate the concern of revenue risk. To illustrate its applicability the methodology is then applied to a freeway PPP project and a power plant PPP project in Iran. The results show that the value of these options can indeed be significant and by applying the proposed systematic negotiation mechanism both public and private sectors can take advantage of its flexibility at the negotiation table. The proposed mechanisms can facilitate negotiations on the verge of a break down as well as accelerating ongoing negotiations that have become moribund.	[Attarzadeh, Meghdad; Chua, David K.

The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings, collected since the early 1970s, and the Commonly Recognized (CoRe) element condition data, collected since the early 1990s, are two major sources of bridge condition data in the United States. General NBI condition ratings are utilized for performance assessment, performance reporting, resource allocation, and selection of bridge projects by all levels of government. Since the early 1990s, the bridge management community has been interested in an algorithm to predict the categorical NBI condition rating classes from the more quantitative and detailed CoRe element condition data. An algorithm with sufficient predictive accuracy would make only CoRe element inspections necessary and would provide time and resource savings. This paper presents a new methodology for this purpose, using classification and regression trees (CARTs). The CART analyses were conducted with the bridge condition data provided by three state transportation agencies, using data from 2006 to 2010. The statistical results point to a more accurate prediction method than the previous algorithms described in the literature. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To date, a number of housing sites around the UK have strived to reduce carbon emissions by following sustainable design principles and utilizing renewable technologies. On paper, these sites exceed regulatory compliance and are regarded as high-performance buildings. However, their actual performance is seldom validated from the perspective of either the design engineer or the occupants. Findings are presented from an on-going post-occupancy evaluation of a UK EcoHomes site with an 'excellent' rating (the highest rating of the predecessor to the current standard, the Code for Sustainable Homes). The detailed post-occupancy evaluation investigated the energy performance of the buildings (as well as water consumption) and the comfort and satisfaction of users. A bespoke behavioural survey and interview were developed and implemented to distinguish between and quantify frugal and profligate patterns of consumption. Results indicate that energy-efficiency behaviours account for 51%, 37%, and 11% of the variance in heat, electricity, and water consumption, respectively, between dwellings. Human factor issues need to be addressed more adequately as standard practice in low-energy/carbon design.

We do this by bringing together recent literature on institutional projects with that on institutional logics and institutional complexity to show how institutional projects can act as vectors of change in institutional fields by offering bounded spaces for working through the implications of institutional complexity. We then explore this contention empirically by examining the implementation of strategic field change in a mature, complex, institutional field. We contribute to theory in project organizing research in four ways. First, we show how projects can be complements to hybrid organizations in fields displaying volatile complexity to achieve institutional field change. Second, we respond to the call to link institutional projects with institutional logics and thereby place project organizing at the heart of change in complex institutional fields; third, we demonstrate how change in the institutional field both shapes and is shaped by interactions across the commercial interface between project owner organizations and project-based firms. Fourth we show how the development of institutional theory in project organizing research depends upon a full theorization of the institutional field in which the project is embedded.

Through the lens of transaction cost economics (TCE), this paper aims to answer why and when PPPs may become a costly governance structure. Specifically, the authors develop a TCE-based theory of PPPs as a governance structure. This theory suggests that three major opportunism problems embedded in infrastructure PPPs are possible to cause substantial transaction costs and render PPPs a costly governance structure. The three main opportunism problems are principal-principal problem, firm's hold-up problem, and government-led hold-up problem. Moreover, project and institutional characteristics that may lead to opportunism problems are identified. Based on these characteristics, an opportunism-focused transaction cost analysis (OTCA) of PPPs as a governance structure is proposed to supplement the current practice of PPP feasibility analysis. As a part of theory development, a case study of the channel tunnel is performed to evaluate the proposed theory and to illustrate how the proposed OTCA can be applied in practice. Policies and administration strategies for infrastructure PPPs are derived based on the proposed theory. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Ho, S.

The extreme requirements for time deadline and competition function expose the venues construction to high risks. These risks would potentially bring negative impacts on the site safety performance. Meanwhile, there is a lack of systematic management for safety risks in China's construction industry, especially for large projects such as the Beijing Olympic venues construction. This paper identifies and assesses safety risk factors inherent in Beijing Olympic venues construction with the involvement of 27 experienced and highly respected experts from government agencies, the construction industry, and academe through brainstorming, workshop discussions, and questionnaire surveys. The finding reveals that more than half of the critical safety risk factors are from contractors and subcontractors such as: lack of emergency response plan and measures; workers' unsafe operation, and contractors ignoring safety under schedule pressure. Based on these critical safety risks, a risk register is composed and a model is developed in application of the analytic hierarchy process to assess the status of risks on site safety. The model has been attempted in two Olympic venue projects under construction and the validity has been approved. The risk checklist, register, and assessment model developed in the paper were integrated into the risk management system that has been used for Beijing Olympic venues construction.

As a result, many modalities have been developed to utilize the resources and skills of the private sector to supply essential infrastructure products and services, as well as to improve the efficiency in government procurement of the same. The buildoperate-transfer (BOT) approach is an important example of these innovative modalities. The BOT approach in China is still in its infancy; many pitfalls await the unwary and obstacles impede more extensive application of this modality. The pitfalls are attributable to the complexities in the BOT approach, particularly when attempted in China's transition economy emerging from decades of central planning to become one that is more market driven and globally integrated. This paper proposes two systems concepts to help manage this complexity: (1) a process modeling approach that maps key functions, parameters and interfaces in the project delivery process, and (2) the use of interface management involving specific measures that have contributed towards project success in Chinese BOT projects. The process modeling approach has led to the development of China's BOT generic process model (CBGPM). Expert opinion was elicited on the criticality of the interfaces identified in CBGPM as well as the effectiveness of selected interface management measures. Finally, an interface management framework consisting of five key steps is suggested for China's BOT projects.

Conscious of the benefits derived by adopting BIM, the Taiwanese government is planning to enact a policy that would incorporate BIM-based e-submission into the Taiwanese building permit review process, revolutionizing the local AEC industry. Nevertheless, the effects of BIM application are unpredictable. The aim of this study was to investigate the current status of BIM adoption in 224 Taiwanese architectural firms, assess how accepting and ready the firms were to implement BIM, and create a predictive model that can be used by decision makers who are considering adopting BIM. The results revealed that approximately onethird of the firms surveyed had already adopted BIM-based tools. More than half of the firms were willing to use BIM-based tools to streamline the building permit review process; however, their willingness was strongly influenced by governmental policies, competitor motivation, financial incentives, and technological support. The challenges, problems, and opportunities related to adopting BIM were discussed. Lessons learned from the experiences of the Taiwanese firms may be useful to firms facing similar situations and challenges in other countries.

However, its applications in developing countries are limited. This paper aims to investigate factors which impact on BIM adoption in the construction industry. Twelve external variables were identified by an integrated TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) and TOE (Technology Organization Environment) framework and a systematic review of past studies. A survey was conducted in development, construction, design and consulting companies to investigate the impacts of these 12 external variables on BIM adoption. Using the interval Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, retrieved 120 completed questionnaires were analysed. The "Requirements from national policies" was found to be the most significant driving variable of BIM adoption by investigated companies. A further simulation analysis revealed that the "Intention to Use" BIM varied significantly with the change of "Requirements from national policies", "Standardization of BIM", and "Popularity of BIM in the industry". The results lead to the conclusion that government incentives play critical roles in BIM adoption in China. Policy makers could put more efforts into motivation strategies, standardization measures, and BIM culture cultivation to promote BIM applications in the construction industry.

An in-depth semi-structured interview and survey were employed to solicit the views of definitive stakeholders involved in public sector affordable housing projects being executed in Ghana through PPP arrangement. The results show that there are thirty-four challenges that the affordable housing project delivery faces. In order of importance, the challenges relate to politics and governance, international forces, administration, financial resources, material resources, management practices, technical, local external forces and natural forces. Whilst factors that relate to politics and governance, administration, financial resources, materials resources, local external forces and natural forces are external challenges, those that relate to management and technical are internal to the performing organization. This study contributes to both academics and practice. Policymakers, governments and housing project practitioners can use the findings as guidance to make informed decisions during affordable housing projects delivery. By comparing the most important challenges, practitioners will be able identify challenges that need to be focused on the most during affordable housing project delivery. It also offers a theoretical framework to assess affordable housing projects challenges.

As a result, the Chinese government is promoting prefabricated buildings (PBs) but many difficulties occur during promotion of prefabrication. One of the most effective ways to overcome these difficulties is to study the factors affecting the motivation of adopting PBs and their relationships, which has rarely been studied by previous literature. In this paper, 13 critical factors affecting the choice of adopting prefabrication were identified by reviewing literature and interviewing experts. A hierarchical graph of factors was obtained through interpretative structural modelling (ISM). It can be concluded that ?safety?, ?quality?, ?cost?, ?schedule?, ?corporate image? and ?environmental benefits? are direct factors. ?Supply capacity of component factory?, ?structure type?, ?capacity of the contractor?, ?transportation of components? and ?function of project? are indirect factors. ?Project height? and ?project size? are fundamental factors. Through using the Matriced? Impacts Croise?s Multiplication Appliquee a UN Classement (MICMAC), factors were classified into two groups based on their driving power and dependence. This research states the benefits of PBs in detail such as schedule, quality and safety and offers a comprehensive view on factors.

Among them, the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program (TCTP), implemented since 2010, is an important measure to accelerate the building sector's emission reduction to achieve Tokyo's greenhouse gas target, 25% reduction by 2020 from a year 2000 baseline level. Under TCTP, all large commercial and industrial facilities are required to achieve the 25% reduction in two compliance periods (FY2010-14 and FY2015-19). An emission-trading scheme was established that allows building owners to purchase carbon credits to compensate for shortfalls and sell excess reductions over the obligations. This paper assesses the effectiveness of TCTP based on extensive data obtained from 1300 facilities covered by the programme and surveys among facility owners from the first compliance phase. Data indicate that TCTP has been working effectively to reduce energy consumption in participating facilities to meet the ambitious emission reduction goals, to introduce new technologies, and to raise awareness and drive behavioural changes for energy demand reduction. TCTP is examined as an alternative policy instrument to building energy codes in a portfolio of sustainable building policies, highlighting its unique capacity for driving deeper and longer-term improvements for more ambitious mitigation targets.

J	Jin, XH				Jin, Xiao-Hua			Determinants of Efficient Risk Allocation in Privately Financed Public Infrastructure Projects in Australia	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk allocation; Organizational capability; Transaction cost economics; Multiple linear regression; Public-private partnership	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; KNOWLEDGE; SUPPLIER; FIRM; CAPABILITIES; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; ECONOMICS; COSTS	Risk allocation in privately financed public infrastructure projects, which are mainly referred to as public-private partnership (PPP) projects, is a challenging job due to the nature of incomplete contracting. An investigation into the mechanism that guides the formation of efficient risk allocation strategies is thus desirable. Drawing on the transaction cost economics and resource-based view of organizational capability, this paper has identified five main features of the transactions associated with risk allocation in PPP projects. They include partners' risk management routine, partners' risk management mechanism, partners' cooperation history, risk management environmental uncertainty, and partners' risk management commitment. For achieving cost efficiency, different risk allocation strategies may suit different conditions of the features. Accordingly, a theoretical framework and five hypotheses were proposed for testing. Data collected in an industrywide survey were analyzed using multiple linear regression technique. It was found that generally, the identified features are determinants in the decision-making process of efficient risk allocation. Therefore, the proposed theoretical framework provides both government and private agencies with not only a logical and holistic understanding of but also a support tool for decision making on risk allocation strategy in PPP projects. Study limitations and future research directions are also set out.

Albeit the promising nature of the UAE's AEC industry, that sought to embrace the latest technologies, the research revealed that, BIM is not yet widely utilised. The UAE was selected as a case study due to the diversity of its local AEC industry, whereby the AEC market has attracted contractors, consultants, suppliers from across the globe. This research adopted a mixed methodological approach using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to gather data from BIM users and non-users. The research investigated the perceived benefits and challenges of adopting BIM and the impact of short and long-term initiatives that can be deployed to drive the effective diffusion of BIM. The study found that there is irrefutable evidence of a lack of impetus to generate interest in BIM from an industry that has in fact undermined the pace of BIM adoption. This paper offers a set of practical recommendations not only for the government to accelerate the transition to BIM, but also to BIM late adopters.

However, since the introduction of PPP in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI) in 2004, the factors contributing to its successful implementation have not yet been fully explored. This has made many local practitioners very reluctant to procure construction PPP projects. This paper aims to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for construction PPPs in Ghana by reviewing and analysing two successful PPP projects: the Kojokrom Market Development Project and the Asutsuare Water Treatment Plant Project. The analysis reveals five CSFs for construction PPP projects in Ghana; these are: government commitment and support, strong community support and relationship, openness and constant communication, project profitability and capable private partner. The experiences in the case studies are further compared with global experience. Practical and management implications are provided to facilitate the implementation of PPP policy in GCI. It is expected that the research outputs would inform policy makers and local practitioners on the appropriate measures to adopt when engaging in future projects. Future research should adopt empirical surveys to make objective generalization and comparison with other countries.	[Osei-Kyei, Robert; Chan, Albert P.

This is formulated as a partial differential, and its structure enables transformations with price and energy elasticities. However, when considering heating energy efficiency upgrades of homes, the mathematical predictions can be unreliable because these upgrades involve large changes in efficiency, energy and energy services, whereas differential calculus only holds true for very small changes. This could be one reason why existing estimates of rebound effects are so diverse. This paper shows how this limitation can be remedied, using the German housing stock as a case study. A curve of consumption/efficiency for this stock is derived from empirical studies and, based on the mathematical definition of the rebound effect, a rebound effect relation is derived from this. This curve is then integrated over the likely ranges of energy efficiency upgrades that would correspond to the government's policy of reducing consumption by 80%. The model is found to be mathematically coherent, and suggests energy service rebounds of 28-39% for the German stock as a whole if the 80% goal is achieved.

Of particular concern is an apparent reliance on monetary calculations alone to determine toll road lump-sum value. This primary focus on monetary considerations appears to neglect a number of nonmonetary variables associated with potential benefits and costs. The objective of this paper is to present a four-step process that uses two analytical methods to assess the benefits, costs, and other impacts associated with P3 organizational alternatives. The first analytical method uses cash-flow diagrams to calculate the net present value (NPV) for each P3 alternative. The second method weighs the relative importance of quantitative and qualitative (nonmonetizable) variables. Four distinct groups of variables form the basis of the two analytical methods: monetary, monetizable, quantitative, and qualitative. The last two groups represent variables that are nonmonetizable. It is these variables that can reflect the much larger stewardship role that government plays in society. The primary user of these analytical methods is identified as the public sector decision maker who has been asked to make recommendations regarding different organizational alternatives for toll road operation.

Globally, construction projects are often delayed and completed above-estimated budgets because of inferior works and contract variations. These in turn negatively affect the goals set by public sector client. Many studies aim to establish factors for successful construction projects that include public road construction projects. However, challenges remain. Using institutional theory, this research focusses on success factors for implementing public road construction projects in Uganda. Loss of funds in such projects significantly affects and stalls the implementation process. This study is cross-sectional and structured self-administered questionnaires are used with Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) data analysis by Smart-PLS3 subsequently conducted. The findings reveal that professionalism, monitoring activities, familiarity with regulatory framework; perceived inefficiency of regulatory framework and compliance with these frameworks significantly enhances successful implementation of public road construction projects. However, sanctions on staff and contractors' resistance to non-compliance are insignificant predictors. Governments should emphasize and embark on improving monitoring mechanisms and staff familiarity with public procurement regulatory frameworks to avoid manipulations by unethical project stakeholders especially on contract cost variation during implementation. These regulatory frameworks should be written in a less technical language that is easily interpreted by stakeholders. Recruitment of qualified staff is paramount.

Despite this, there are many indicators that BIM implementation is a main concern for large companies, while Small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind in adopting and implementing this new technology. This slow adoption, has led to a competitive disadvantage for SMEs in public projects and possibly private projects, which is exacerbated by the limited research focusing on the implementation of BIM Level 2 within SMEs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to bridge this gap and explore the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) influencing BIM Level 2 implementation in SMEs, as well as identifying their importance throughout the implementation process. To achieve this aim, a qualitative research approach was adopted involving 25 semi-structured interviews with BIM experts in three SMEs in the UK. The study concluded by identifying 15 factors, which includes 3 new factors and 12 factors previously mentioned in the literature. All 15 factors were then given an importance level based on how influential they were during the implementation process.

However, the nwnber of GDs is relatively small. Especially in China, GDs only account for less than 0.4% of the total buildings. It is directly due to the shortage of supply, which is influenced by the lack of willingness to develop. To stimulate the GD diffusion, the study applies structural equation model to analyse the factors in developers' willingness to construct GDs, considering the inter-relationships and relative influences among factors. Further, it calculates the influence of each policy and policy subseries on developers' willingness. It is showed that developers' willingness is mostly influenced by their developing ability, followed by market development. Then comes government policy and corporate responsibility. In terms of stimulating policies On developers' willingness, floor-to-area density award is of the biggest impact, followed by the green building requirement and interest rare. As to the policy subseries, mandatory requirements has larger effects on developers then voluntary incentives. Besides, in China, developers are more sensitive to financial incentives than non-financial ones. Accordingly, suggestions for policy making are proposed to stimulate developers to construct GDs.

Governance structures for public infrastructure projects: Public-private management regimes, contractual forms and innovation	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Infrastructure governance; public-private partnerships (PPPs); management regimes; contracts	TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS; INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS; PARTNERSHIPS; OWNERSHIP; INCENTIVES; PRIVATIZATION; PROCUREMENT; BENEFITS; QUALITY	The choice of appropriate governance structures for public infrastructure projects is a major challenge for governments. The extant literature provides ample theoretical support to analyse various public-private management regimes for public infrastructure service delivery, but there is little discussion on the innovation incentives of specific contractual forms and their welfare implications under different management regimes. Our research aims at providing answers to the following research questions: who should manage different tasks in public infrastructure delivery - public, private or public-private partnership (PPP)?; how should these tasks be managed to foster innovation and enhance welfare?. We explore these using a multi-period analytical model that analyses innovation incentives induced by six contractual forms under five management regimes. We derive conditions under which specific governance structures maximise welfare. Our analysis reveals that PPPs induce optimal innovation and maximise welfare if governed through revenue-sharing concessions for user-payment type services and fixed-price annuity type contracts for no-user-payment type services. The risk share of the private partner and the shadow cost of public funds strengthen the case for PPPs while transaction costs weaken it. These results generate novel insights for policymakers to design effective governance structures and set new research directions in public infrastructure governance.

Nevertheless, little is known about its acceptance in the construction community. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the views of industry stakeholders on safety design in the harmonized safety regulations of South Australia. A desk study on pre- and post-harmonized WHS regulations reveals that design for safety now constitutes a major theme in practice following the harmonization process. After that, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate the use of design for safety in the construction industry. The results show that the guidelines promote safety-related design requirements without significantly increasing designers' and contractors' workload. Designers are aware of the hazards on sites and design firms are willing to embrace the guidelines if they are protected from liability. However, the extent to which contracting and procurement systems encourage safety design is uncertain. Moreover, the problem of cost hinders designers in implementing it unless the client accepts it as part of the over-arching life cycle cost structure. There is great uncertainty on whether the concept will be promoted through regulation and subsequently lead to a reduction in hazardous risks and injury rates.

J	Dey, SS; Thommana, J; Dock, S				Dey, Soumya S.; Thommana, Jose; Dock, Stephanie			Public Agency Performance Management for Improved Service Delivery in the Digital Age: Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Management; Public services; Productivity; Leadership; Management methods; Communication; Business management; Case studies; Client relationships		Customer expectations for government services have changed significantly in the past decade, at the same time as technology, especially social media, has transformed how agencies interact with their customers and deliver services. These transformed expectations and interactions have created a perception gap about service delivery and are challenging agencies to respond quicker, be more transparent about programs and processes, and provide a better overall customer experience. This article uses the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) in the District of Columbia as a case study of how one agency developed a strategy to address this perception gap. The strategy is based on a three pronged approach: rebalancing the workload to be less reactive, reducing the amount of reactive work and the amount coming in through customer calls by adopting proactive measures, and rapidly responding to service requests. The strategy was implemented through a series of initiatives including business process enhancements through the infusion of technology, adopting a data-based decision making approach, innovative contracting, smart asset management, and a better aligned communication strategy and proactive customer outreach. DDOT saw positive outcomes as a result of these initiatives, including reduced service requests, more proactive work, quicker response times, and overall increase in customer satisfaction.

However, even after demonstrating the bankability of a project and reducing debt cost, the success of the project may be prevented by the lack of long-term commitment from shareholders. Equity contributions by promoters in the project company may be recovered from earnings on short-term construction activities. Based on lesson learned from early PPP projects with GDG, the hold-up problem for government in the view of transaction cost economic (TCE) theory may worsen if the designed contractual structure does not adequately manage opportunistic behaviours from promoters. This study empirically examined the effects of a structured GDG mechanism with particular complementary measures applied in joint projects to develop the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations. A GDG game model was then applied to bridge the theoretical gap based on the Taipei MRT experience. The analysis shows that requiring the promoter to provide sufficient equity and ensuring the commitment of the lender to provide the loan are the appropriate proactive measures. This study demonstrates its practical value for policy makers by combining case study, TCE and game theory in contractual issues.

J	Chan, EHW; Chan, ATS				Chan, EHW; Chan, ATS			Imposing ISO 9000 quality assurance system on statutory agents in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A major part of the building control system in any country has to do with quality assurance (QA) of building the process and the products. As in many other countries, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region delegates part of its statutory role to statutory agents to deal with the QA function. As a case study in the context of the Hong Kong construction industry, the relationship between QA and the role of statutory agents is investigated. An authorized person (AP), normally an architect, is the statutory agent as an integral part of the property development control system in Hong Kong. Although AP's statutory roles have already been recognized, their formal roles in respect of QA have never been studied. This paper, being supported by a research project carried out in 1997, presents the result of a study on the relationship between the QA system and the AP practice. The research revealed that in the APs' professional practice most of them have a basic concept and awareness of QA. Their checklists to run projects are similar to a QA manual. To discharge their statutory duties APs are already performing most of the QA standards similar to the ISO 9001 requirements. This paper concludes that the ISO 9000 requirements could be an extra administrative burden to a statutory agent.

This study established models that examine the impact of internationalization on total factor productivity (TFP), TFP's components, and the profitability of 86 construction firms in Malaysia from 2003 to 2016 by applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The results showed that internationalization reduced firm productivity during Malaysia's lack of promarket phase of 2003-2009 but became negligible during the more promarket phase of 2010-2016. The negative impact was due to scale inefficiency. The effect of regulatory control and family ownership concentration reduced the negative impact of internationalization, whereas capital availability, foreign debt, price control freedom, and government ownership negatively affected the impact of internationalization on firm productivity. This study is the first to explore the impact of internationalization on TFP's components. It contributes to management in the engineering domain by extending insights into the effect of institutional environments, institutional dimensions, and ownership concentrations on the impact of internationalization on firm productivity.

As public-private partnership (PPP) is a proven method for supporting the financial viability of various types of infrastructure projects, governments have recently adopted PPP for eldercare facility projects. However, there are limited methods to support decisions on payment mechanisms, which is one of the fundamental factors required to make PPP contracts. This study investigated the relationships between the characteristics of eldercare facility projects and payment mechanisms [e.g., viability gap funding (VGF)]. This study applied a multivalue qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA) with 26 case studies, which could be considered the best practice in China. Based on the analysis, the authors identified five and three configurations of project attributes for VGF (i.e., VGF user-fee) and user charge (i.e., non-VGF user-fee) mechanisms, respectively. This finding supports informed decision-making on payment mechanisms of PPP projects for healthcare facilities for the elderly. Further research in other countries is necessary to identify not only general but also culturally and politically specific configurations of attributes for different payment mechanisms.

Project facilitation as an active response to tensions in international development programmes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International development; Programme management; Partnership; Non-governmental organisations; Adaptive management; Tensions; Project facilitation	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; PARADOXICAL TENSIONS; LOGICAL FRAMEWORK; FOCUS GROUPS; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; PARTICIPATION; PROCUREMENT	This paper examines the tension within international development programmes between traditional task-oriented approaches to development and the wider view of programmes as sites for adaptability and learning. It characterises it as a set of inter-related tensions between recursive and adaptive tendencies that exist at individual actor, programme and institutional levels. Drawing on a multiple interpretive case study of partnership based programmes between an international non-government organisation and local partners in three countries, it looks at how these tensions play out in practice. Based on the findings, it proposes an active response to the tensions called project facilitation. This is an adaptive and co-created process that incorporates local experience and practice based knowledge to achieve strategic goals, while utilising recognised project management practices to achieve agreed outcomes. By adopting active responses to the tensions that exist within programmes it offers greater potential for effective delivery of long term benefits than the more typical defensive response strategies. Project facilitation is consistent with the social constructionist view of programmes and programme management but broadens our understanding by emphasising the need to actively consider how the tensions inherent in programmes are responded to.

A social construction of technology perspective is used to understand the choices underlying these multiple fuel practices. Nine participants (household energy managers, consumers and users) were purposefully selected from Soshanguve, an urban township in Pretoria, South Africa. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews and narrative analysis was used to generate findings. Stories about multiple fuel use in the household showed this practice is common and forms part of the participants' lifestyles. Social, cultural and political meanings of fuel use are identified in the narratives. Suggested interventions to optimize multiple fuel use in this context include additional technology such as solar power, collaborations with manufacturers to improve existing fuel types that are seen as potentially hazardous, and leveraging women's knowledge and position in the household to formalize education about multiple fuels. The role of government in providing subsidies for alternative energies and reviewing accessibility to electricity was also highlighted by the participants. This research demonstrates that policy-makers should actively involve consumers in household energy system decisions through deliberative dialogue with communities.

PassivBIM: Enhancing interoperability between BIM and low energy design software	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Information Modelling; Industry Foundation Classes; Passivhaus standard	PERFORMANCE	The process of building design is currently undergoing some major changes. In an attempt to mitigate climate change, the design of more sustainable buildings is advocated by the UK government. Furthermore, standalone design methods are being replaced with the concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The adoption of BIM has been documented to result in many benefits, which range from time to cost savings. During the initial planning stages, building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC schema lacks an energy domain, and as a result, an extension is proposed in this paper. This contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). The extended schema was developed by way of an externally coupled Java tool, which facilitates the transfer of data, and informs the building design decision-making process. The process of geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies, which are based on certified Passivhaus buildings in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales. The amount of error is acceptable, and it is mostly due to differences in the initial BIM model setup, not due to the processing of IFC files. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The growing perception that the nation is not getting an adequate return from its federal R&D budget is accompanied by a growing demand for more measurable technology transfer results. Yet measures of technology transfer effectiveness are neither well defined nor universally accepted. This exploratory study focused on defining and describing the measures or metrics used in the process of transferring government-funded technologies to private sector firms. The paper presents an initial conceptual framework and an exploratory, empirically based taxonomy of metrics used in technology transfer. This taxonomy and specific measures were used to help determine which technology transfer metrics were used by various players across the federal technology transfer process. Individuals who played roles as either sponsors, developers or adopters of federally funded technologies were surveyed on their roles and the measures of transfer effectiveness used in their work units. The data showed statistically significant differences in frequency of use of the transfer measures by the three roles. Secondly, a broad set of measures were used in varying degrees by all roles. Most importantly, all three roles used most measures rather infrequently. Recommendations to guide future research are included. Recommendations are also made for technology transfer practitioners.

However, many water PPPs have failed in both developed and developing countries. In some cases, the government has to pay huge compensations for contract terminations, and in others, the private party withdrew or even became bankrupt because of extreme financial loss. Despite the disastrous consequences, research on water PPP failures is scarce. This paper attempts to unveil the factors associated with the private sector that have led to the failure of water PPPs and their causal relationships. Through an exploratory sequential mixed-method research approach that integrates literature review, multiple case studies, questionnaire survey, and statistical analysis, this paper has identified the common failure drivers initiated by the private sector, evaluated the relative severity of the failure drivers, and established the failure mechanism model for water PPPs in general. Outputs of this study will facilitate public and private sectors in better planning and managing water PPP projects and developing more responsive strategies to address the failure drivers that can occur in the different stages of the PPP life cycle toward successful outcomes.

Guidelines for Responding to COVID-19 Pandemic: Best Practices, Impacts, and Future Research Directions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Due to the novelty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the lack of measurable data, no enough research studies have been conducted to provide guidelines for responding to the coronavirus pandemic. This paper addresses this critical knowledge gap through a methodology comprising two main steps. The first step involved reviewing the updated industry best practices developed by various organizations and government entities. The second step involved investigating the impacts of the coronavirus based on the available resources and expert opinions, which also were used to develop a synopsis of emerging research topics. This paper provided various beneficial outcomes and findings. First, the paper presents a concise and integrated resource of COVID-19-related best practices for the construction industry. Second, the paper determined that the pandemic is perceived to have short- and long-term impacts-including negative and positive consequences-on four main facets: (1) workforce-related issues; (2) project and workplace considerations; (3) procurement and supply chain implications; and (4) contractual, legal, and insurance aspects. Third, the paper provides future research streams and directions that could be examined by future studies to help in the transition toward the new normal. Ultimately, this paper adds to the body of knowledge by offering practitioners and researchers guidelines for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the construction sector.

The intent and outcomes of this programme (in which all authors participated) are critically examined through a cross-project meta-study of the primary data, substantiated by insights from secondary sources. Given that only three (out of 45) projects met the expected CO2 target in reality, despite generous funding and professional expertise, it suggests that decarbonizing existing housing will not be particularly easy. Important lessons are found in this initiative's formulation, target setting, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and feedback mechanisms. These lessons can inform the formulation, delivery and effectiveness of future national energy retrofit programmes. Furthermore, to support the 'scaling up' of effective retrofit programmes and reduce the gap between intent and outcome, it is recommended that attention be moved from what level of CO2 reductions are to be achieved to how (delivery models) these radical reductions can be achieved and by whom (supply chain). Such alternative delivery models to the 'whole house' approach include retrofit over time, city-scale retrofit and community-based energy retrofits.

Design/methodology/approach The study is methodologically designed as a qualitative assessment of project governance frameworks that apply to state-funded investment projects in selected sectors, based on data gathered through document reviews and interviews. Findings The study finds that all of the agencies have introduced their own project governance frameworks, which are basically consistent with the recommendations from the project management literature and with the cabinet's overall requirements in Norway. By contrast, only one ministry has taken a formalized role as a project owner. Governance tasks thus seem to be extensively delegated to the subordinate agencies. This even includes strategic tasks such as project selection and portfolio management, and implies there is a risk that public project governance has a narrow and internal focus. Originality/value The paper is a first step toward a better understanding of public project governance as a hierarchical system and the relationship between project owners on three levels, the cabinet, the sectoral ministry, and the government agency.

However, extensive deterioration of mostly aged systems complicates the management of this type of infrastructure in coping with increased demand and restricted upgrade and renewal budgets. The main objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive network-level decision-making model for managing urban railway systems to maintain the highest level of performance, reliability, and convenience in the movement of passengers in a metropolitan area. By considering ridership fluctuations and network expansion scenarios, the proposed model integrates the current and expected future usage rates into the decision-making process. The Montreal metro system was considered as a real-world case study. The results indicate that proactive maintenance scheduling can save up to 25% of the cumulative expenditure during a 20-year horizon while improving the overall performance of the system. Comparing the decisions proposed by the model and the government plan for this network presents an opportunity to understand current railway asset management practices. The proposed model is applicable to rail rapid transit (underground and surface), light rail transit, and suburban trains as well as bus rapid transit and guides maintenance, upgrade, and expansion of these systems, targeting improvements in their convenience, reliability, and ridership.

J	Wang, Y; Liu, J; Zuo, J; Rameezdeen, R				Wang, Yang; Liu, Jing; Zuo, Jian; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen			Ways to improve the project management efficiency in a centralized public procurement system A structural equation modeling approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Management; Project management; Questionnaire survey	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PERSON-JOB; FRAMEWORK; GOVERNMENT; PERFORMANCE; CORRUPTION; GOVERNANCE; INFRASTRUCTURE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate driving factors that improve the project management efficiency (PME) in centralized public procurement systems. Design/methodology/approach Employees in four public-sector organizations in China were surveyed. The structural equation modeling was employed to examine the relationship amongst those variables. Findings Organizational culture (OC) is an effective method to improve PME, and employee quality is the most critical factor of OC in this system. Job satisfaction (JS) is another significant contributor to PME and satisfaction with fairness of salary in this system being the key factor of JS. Job analysis (JA) has indirect influence on PME through JS and OC, whereas the job structure in this system is the most critical factor for JA. Originality/value PME in a centralized public procurement system will be improved by addressing these key factors and their interrelationships. This provides detailed pathways for the centralized public procurement system to achieve better PME via optimal OC and JS and reasonable JA in China. In addition, the institutional and administrative traditions may vary significantly across cities, regions and countries. Therefore, such contextual differences should be taken into consideration for the improvement of PME in a centralized public procurement system.

J	Warwick, E				Warwick, Elanor			Policy to reality: evaluating the evidence trajectory for English eco-towns	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						garden cities; public policy; policy design; sustainable development; policy evaluation; eco-town; built environment; policy formation		Can evidence reconcile idealized policy formation processes with the messy reality of large-scale sustainable projects? Was the main driver of the UK eco-towns project the national housing need or a local version of sustainability? To answer, this paper traces the progress of the eco-town policy: from a government-funded initiative to start a cohort of new towns, via the first pilot sites, to the delivery of a single eco-town. It maps the national policy intent, which incorporated industry and academic expertise into a strategic policy vision. Then the local interpretation of this generic eco-town definition is reviewed, along with how the authoritative knowledge on innovative eco-planning is distilled into guidance. By revisiting the original eco-town objectives, comparing them with the recently published garden cities prospectus, the limitations for intra-national implementation of national policy frameworks are considered, asking whether any lessons have been incorporated in the current round of policy formation. The success or failure of such policy implementation is found to be more of a socio-political exercise than an empirical or rationalist process. The eco-towns were less an attempt to establish new forms of sustainable habitations than a political attempt to use eco-planning to justify new large-scale housing settlements.

J	Glew, D; Johnston, D; Miles-Shenton, D; Thomas, F				Glew, David; Johnston, David; Miles-Shenton, Dominic; Thomas, Felix			Retrofitting suspended timber ground-floors; comparing aggregated and disaggregated evaluation methods	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Retrofit; building performance; thermal retrofits; whole house heat loss; floor insulation; coheating	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; COMFORT; VENTILATION; INSULATION; BARRIERS; HOUSES	It is estimated that around 80% of UK dwellings have uninsulated ground floors, representing a significant heat loss mechanism in these buildings. In this research, an aggregated assessment of dwelling heat loss was made using the electric coheating test before and after a ground floor retrofit took place. Heat loss was reduced by 24% (43 +/- 18 W/K) indicating that suspended timber ground floor retrofits could improve thermal comfort for occupants and contribute to government domestic energy efficiency policy targets. The findings indicate that disaggregated evaluation methods, such as spot heat flux density measurements, may overestimate the benefits of fabric retrofits. Aggregate methods may therefore be more appropriate tools with which to evaluate retrofits. The U-value improvement resulting from the suspended timber ground floor insulation retrofit, derived via aggregate measurement, was 0.55 W/m(2)K. Disaggregated spot heat flux density measurements indicated the improvement was 0.89 W/m(2)K. This research also indicates that Energy Performance Certificates, are unlikely to provide a reliable estimate of energy savings, because they rely on default assumptions for fabric U-Values and ventilation rates. This has implications for policy evaluations as well as householders, who may be excluded from financial support for retrofits.

However, the operations used in performing the BV method often differ due to the various government procurement requirements. Consequently, some of the methods popular in the academic community are not easily incorporated in the BV method in some countries. To enhance the procurement process, this study aims to gain experience by applying the well-known analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight the decision criteria for selecting BV contractors of two construction projects in Taiwan. Through these two case studies, this work confirms that the AHP provides a significant benefit for considering the individual preferences of all decision-makers when weighting the criteria. However, this study finds two major potential obstacles, the legal requirements associated with using the AHP and the time it takes to implement the AHP. To overcome these obstacles, this work suggests guidelines to meet the legal requirements for implementing the AHP in the BV contractor selection, and proposes several strategies to shorten the AHP implementation time. The lessons learned here are relevant to those countries in which BV method must be performed in a transparent and strictly regulated environment.

Environmental life cycle assessment based on the retrofitting of a twentieth-century heritage building in Spain, with electricity decarbonization scenarios	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; heritage building retrofit; decarbonization; climate change mitigation; renewable energy	OFFICE BUILDINGS; ASSESSMENT LCA; ENERGY; IMPACTS; SECTOR; REFURBISHMENT; SYSTEM	The aim of this study is to estimate the environmental impacts associated with modernization measures that improve the energy efficiency of an office building listed as of cultural interest and located in northern Spain, a region with an Atlantic climate. European Climate Action for 2020-2030 sets a long-term goal of achieving neutrality of greenhouse gas emissions and towards the end of 2019 the Spanish Government presented its Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan. It is of interest to the international audience to know how energy policies can affect decisions on building retrofitting to improve sustainability: reduction in energy consumption, climate change and other environmental impacts. A life cycle assessment was carried out for the retrofitting of the building envelope and different energy supply scenarios: only electricity from the electricity mix (scenario of reference that of 2018, and decarbonisation scenarios proposed for 2020 and 2030), and the installation of heat pump and photovoltaic panels. The impacts will decrease 40% for Global Warming Potential and 15% for Cumulative Energy Demand in 2030 with respect to the reference scenario. These reductions will further increase up to 54 and 61%, respectively, if photovoltaic panels and a heat pump are implemented.	[Gonzalez-Prieto, D.; Prieto, M.

However, studies assessing the relationship between EI and the performance of construction projects are scarce. The study presents a case study assessing the influence of EI on the performance of construction projects in developing countries. Simple random sampling technique was used to select certified project managers affiliated to PMI-Ghana Chapter. Data was collected with well-structured close-ended questionnaires and mean score ranking, exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis were used to provide an in-depth explanation to the data collected. The study revealed that effective management of EI would significantly increase project performance by 50.7% if they are employed by project managers in performing their roles. This research is confined to Ghana, limiting the study in that regard. A study to examine the relationship between leadership styles and the level of awareness of project managers on EI is proposed for further studies. The findings would provide practitioners, government agencies and industry players with the required information about the influence of EI on the success of construction projects while demonstrating the importance of EI to the project management profession.

It plays a significant role in location-based decisions of infrastructure facilities. Present study explores the application of geographic information systems (GIS) in the topography modelling and the modelling of existing facilities. GIS facilitates the location-based evaluation of proposed facilities through geospatial analysis. The use of GIS facilitates construction professionals in organizing, interpreting and linking information to evaluate the locations of proposed infrastructure facilities. Critical aspects affecting LBE of infrastructure facilities identified through the existing literature and questionnaire survey were modelled for evaluating the locations of proposed infrastructure facilities in the campus layout of Jawaharlal Nehru Government Engineering College Sundernagar, Himachal Pradesh in India, as a case study. The use of GIS facilitates construction professionals in organizing, interpreting and linking information to evaluate the locations of proposed infrastructure facilities. Building codal provisions to consider topography and locations of already existing infrastructure facilities were modelled. GIS-based framework developed in the present study helped in identifying proposed infrastructure facilities which were located at adverse locations. This facilitates in taking corrective measures timely for re-locating these proposed infrastructure facilities more appropriately in hilly regions.

J	Evans, S; Liddiard, R; Steadman, P				Evans, Stephen; Liddiard, Rob; Steadman, Philip			Modelling a whole building stock: domestic, non-domestic and mixed use	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						activity; building stock; buildings; energy model; mixed use; non-domestic buildings; residential; topology; urban analysis	GIS	Work on energy use in buildings - in university research, professional practice and government - has tended to draw a broad distinction between 'the domestic stock' and 'the non-domestic stock'. A further tendency has been to focus attention on types of non-domestic buildings devoted to single uses (e.g. offices, shops or hospitals). This paper reports an empirical research programme in which the complete building stock in large areas of England and Wales is comprehensively represented in great detail, using a new method and model called 3DStock. The model breaks down activities by floor level and within each floor of every building. The results show that the extent of mixing of uses is much greater than has previously been acknowledged, especially towards the centres and in the older parts of towns and cities. These mixed-activity buildings are sometimes relatively simple combinations of domestic and non-domestic, e.g. urban retail with flats above, while others are complex mixtures of different non-domestic activities. The model can be used to investigate how these complex relationships influence energy use. It is argued that, at the larger scale, explicit account needs to be taken of the mixing of uses in future stock models for research and policy-making.

Nonetheless, the number of sustainable buildings is still few compared to conventional buildings. This study analyses the barriers to development of sustainable buildings and solutions to lessen these barriers. To that end, barriers were classified into political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental barriers using the PESTLE technique. Then, questionnaires were emailed to the industry professionals in Sweden, United States and New Zealand to evaluate the impact of 42 barriers and 20 solutions on development of sustainable buildings. Findings showed that the most important barriers were social and economic barriers, including 'long payback period and investment risks', 'high initial costs' and 'lack of demand for sustainable buildings' and the most effective solutions were, 'financial incentives from government', 'using past successful sustainable projects as references' and 'engaging professionals and staff with sustainable building experience'. Also using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology in projects could help reducing barriers. This study analysed the barriers affecting the development of sustainable buildings in developed countries, but it also provides a comprehensive reference and new insight for further studies on sustainable building development in developing countries.

This study empirically determines some organizational internal drivers influencing the social sustainability performance in construction firms. To achieve this, we developed a conceptual model and tested on a sample of registered and active large construction firms from the Malaysian Construction Industry Development Board, using partial least-squares structural equation modelling for analysis. The study reveals that organizational internal drivers could trigger social sustainability performance. However, our analysis shows that organizational capabilities - complex tangible and intangible resources that are controlled by a firm through certain organizational practices and which enable it to implement value-creating strategies-partially mediates the relationship between these drivers and social sustainability. While few limitations of this study include the fact that the data used are the subjective opinions of the top officials who responded to the survey, our findings reveal that construction firms with efficient resource capabilities tend to adopt more sustainability in project delivery. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the important factors for social sustainability in construction.	[Bamgbade, J.

J	Tavakoli, N; Nourzad, SHH				Tavakoli, Nastaran; Nourzad, Seyed Hossein Hosseini			Win-win pricing method for BOT projects using a simulation-based evolutionary optimization	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Build-Operate-Transfer; multi-objective optimization; evolutionary algorithms; concession pricing; simulation-optimization	CONCESSION PERIOD; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; GAME-THEORY; MODEL	Several failures have been reported in maintaining the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects viability through their life cycle. BOT contracts are one of the popular tools to respond to fund deficiencies in infrastructure projects, thus it is crucial to determine optimum concession terms for them. In previous research, the value of social benefits has mostly been neglected in the decision-making process, which results in unfair distribution of benefits between the government and the concessionaire. Therefore, a pricing framework based on a Simulation Multi-Objective Optimization (SMOO) method is developed in this research which includes the value of social benefits as well as the effects of uncertainties in BOT projects. The application of the model to a real-world project confirms that it presents a win-win solution in which the benefits of the two contracting parties are simultaneously maximized compared to the results obtained by using conventional methods. The results confirm the contribution of this research to reach a consensus on concession price and to keep the project viability as a result of its ability to cope with the high volatilities through simulation techniques. Furthermore, it can help the decision-makers to either seek a balance between both sides' interests or determine the concession price based on their preferential strategies.

Altogether, 499 defect types (classified from 17,648 defects) were found after analyzing 990 construction projects from the Public Construction Management Information System of the public construction commission which is a government unit that administers all the public construction. The core of this research includes the following steps. (1) Data mining (DM) was used to derive 57 association rules which altogether contain 30 of the 499 defect types. (2) K-means clustering was used to regroup the 990 projects of two attributes (defect frequency and original grading score of each project) into four new quality classes, so the 990 projects can be more evenly distributed in the four new classes and the correctness and reliability of the following analyses can be ensured. (3) Finally analysis of variance (ANOVA), fuzzy logic, and correlation analysis were used to verify that the aforementioned 30 defect types are the important ones determining inspection grades. Results of this research can help stakeholders of construction projects paying more attention on the root causes of the critical defect types so to dramatically raise their management effectiveness.

Although numerous studies on PPP in China have been published in different international journals in the past decades, few relevant reviews have been found. In this research, a bibliometric analysis of 139 peer-reviewed articles on PPP in China is performed to reveal the research evolution and trend. Besides, a meta-analysis of 111 empirical articles among the total 139 articles is conducted using multinomial logistic regression to examine how data characteristics and analytical features have been utilized in this area. The major findings suggest that, first, many studies are published in the subject areas of Business, Management and Accounting, and Engineering, and most topics are discussed from the micro-level perspective. Second, the issues in the procurement phase lack enough attention. Third, for studies with different research themes, how data characteristics and analytical features have been utilized significantly differ. In general, how PPP studies are approached in China contrasts with the global PPP research. Future research directions are proposed. The research contributes to the global PPP body of knowledge and methodology by providing the first quantitative review of studies on PPP in China and by combining the research methods.

The study of knowledge transfer in PBOs has focused exclusively on the knowledge transfer practices held at the realm of the temporary units; however, we still need to understand how the permanent organization can enable this knowledge transfer process. Using a deductive-inductive approach and exploring the case of a division managed as PBO in a provincial government agency in Canada, we analyzed how the practices led by the permanent organization enable the actual knowledge transfer across projects. We found that different practices conducted at the level of the permanent organization were enabling or disabling the performance of formal and informal knowledge transfer practices executed at the temporary units. In this work we show how by distorting the goal of the formal knowledge transfer practices the permanent organization pushed the project team members to the use of informal knowledge practices to overcome this flaw. We argue that a balanced deployment of formal and informal knowledge transfer practices not only can boost knowledge transfer but also can reinforce the temporary organizations? embeddedness within the permanent organization.

Large-scale voluntary efforts have also failed to provide successful templates through which to mainstream broader building performance evaluation (BPE) activity within which POE sits. This paper reviews various programmes and initiatives in the UK that have attempted to embed first POE, then BPE, over the last 20 years within a global context, using a practice-based approach based on the author's experience of working in the field over this period. Key findings are: a failure of government to systemically follow through on BPE initiatives; stakeholders operating independently of each other; lack of institutional engagement in the education sector as a key driver for BPE; and the potential for interdisciplinary models to embrace all members of the design team as well as the client. The means by which BPE has been successfully embedded into practice directly is examined through deep organizational learning and knowledge-exchange activities. Recommendations for these models to be replicated through professional institutions, other learning organizations and regulatory frameworks in the UK are presented as a constructive way forward.

However, there are obstacles to its effective implementation, mainly in developing countries. Herein, we proposed a GPP model and framework based on constructive systems' environmental performance. We argue that the present proposal minimizes the gaps involving GPP and supports its implementation in the construction sector. The development of the GPP model and framework is based on an intensive theoretical overview, interview with stakeholders, and validation phase. Also, an integrated holistic framework for GPP adoption based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is performed. Besides that, the GPP model is based on an integrated and collaborative system that involves all the stakeholders. This research contributes to the scarce GPP literature in the context of sustainability in developing countries and softens the lack of metrics to evaluate the environmental impacts of materials and buildings. The model has the potential to support the decision-making process in buildings' early-stage design and integrates data and stakeholders promoting environmental awareness and can leverage the practice of GPP with appropriate comparisons. It opens a new perspective on the GPP providing knowledge and supporting decision-market.	[Timm, Janaine F.

As mega hospital construction projects face various kinds of limitation which affect the cost dramatically, many developing countries such as Iran have focused in these kinds of projects. Only a few studies have been conducted which are associated with cost overrun factors in hospital construction projects in developing countries. The aim of this study is to identify and rank cost overrun factors in mega hospital construction projects of Iran. Delphi and SWARA methods were used in order to align experts' opinions in categorizing cost overrun factors and weigh the cost overrun factors, respectively. These factors were then allocated to consultants, employers and contractors. The results illustrated that "Unacceptable quality of work which leads to rework" with score of 0.458, "Not allocating sufficient budget from the government during the project" with score of 0.429 and "Lack of supervisors' technical knowledge" with score of 0.44 were the most crucial factors in contractors, employers and consultant groups, respectively. The identified factors inform the main literature on hospital projects and results in decreasing cost overruns in the mentioned projects.

The current strategy is to mandate the use of BIM for government projects as a way of integrating the design, construction and operation of publicly procured buildings. This aspiration represents a partial turn away from a focus on managerialist agendas towards a belief in the power of digital practices to achieve the aspiration of integrated working, collaboration and innovation, a trend that is being reflected globally in relation to both national and firm-level policy interventions. This paper subjects this so-called BIM revolution' to critical scrutiny. By drawing on theories of the digital divide, a critical discourse is developed around the ways in which political reform agendas centred on BIM might not stimulate innovation on a wider scale, but could act to disenfranchise small firms that are unable (or unwilling) to engage with them. This critical analysis presents important new research questions around the technocratic optimism that pervades the current reform discourse, the trajectory of industry development that it creates and the policy process itself.

With economic sustainability as a primary aim, the coordination and prioritization of investments has been a challenge in part because of Afghanistan's volatile security situation along with the intricacies of the negotiating and coordinating efforts of numerous stakeholders. An understanding of the contributions of infrastructure systems and associated projects to the national development strategy is needed. This paper formulates a scenario-informed multicriteria approach to prioritize major project investments for infrastructure development subject to deep, nonprobabilistic uncertainties. The methods are inclusive of stakeholder values and accounts for deep uncertainties in governance, security, economy, environment, workforce, and other topics. The methods are applied in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province to assist in the selection among twenty-seven candidate infrastructure projects that are vulnerable to potential refugee immigration among other emergent conditions. The paper describes the relationships of selected projects to strategic goals while facilitating collaboration among government and nongovernment investors, donors, technologists, and other stakeholders.

Although the Norwegian government has been relatively proactive in instituting measures aimed at halting global climate change, less attention has been paid to the challenge of adapting to climate change. The global climate system is likely to undergo changes, regardless of the implementation of abatement policies under the Kyoto Protocol or other regimes. The full range of impacts resulting from these changes is still uncertain; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that adaptation to climate change is necessary and inevitable within several sectors. The potential impacts of climate change in the built environment are now being addressed. Both the functionality of the existing built environment and the design of future buildings are likely to be altered by climate change impacts, and the expected implications of these new conditions are now investigated. However, measures aimed at adjustments within individual sectors, such as altering the criteria and codes of practice for the design and construction of buildings, constitute only a partial adaptation to climate change. In order to adapt effectively, larger societal and intersectoral adjustments are necessary.

J	Fernie, S; Leiringer, R; Thorpe, T				Fernie, S; Leiringer, R; Thorpe, T			Change in construction: a critical perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						benchmarking; best practice; change management; demonstration projects; industry performance; innovation; key performance indicators; organizational change; reform movement	MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; STRUCTURATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORKS; PROSPECT; DECISION	Change within the construction sector has been a central concern of governments and a select few private-sector clients for a considerable time. The discourse of change emanating from organizations concerned with reform in the construction sector reflects these ongoing concerns for change in the sector. The underlying assumptions of the content of change and appropriate change mechanisms in the UK are critically examined and challenged. In particular, the limitations of measurement and best practice are explored. The allegiance to approaches based on measurement and best practice is acontextual, unreflective and insufficient in providing wholly reliable explanations for the relationship between practice and performance. Claims for the use of measurement and best practice by the reform movement must therefore be understood to have limitations and their use approached with caution. The emphasis on best practice is also understood to direct attention away from understanding the legitimacy of current practice and change within the UK construction sector. An agenda for change in the UK construction sector will need to engage with and be more reflective of current managerial practice and past change initiatives. Contextual approaches such as structuration theory offer a way in which to underpin a research framework that could support the reform movement in setting such an agenda.

J	Yun, SM; Jung, W; Han, SH; Park, H				Yun, Sungmin; Jung, Wooyong; Han, Seung Heon; Park, Heedae			Critical organizational success factors for public private partnership projects - a comparison of solicited and unsolicited proposals	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						stepwise regression analysis; organizational drivers; factor analysis; unsolicited proposal; solicited proposal; public private partnership	CONCESSIONAIRE SELECTION; HONG-KONG; RISKS	Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects are typically initiated through solicited or unsolicited proposals. The difference between the processes according to the proposal mode often leads to different levels of involvement and responsibilities for the public and private sectors. However, no robust research exists to capture the differences, depending on the proposal mode, in the roles and involvement of project participants and the impact of those differences on project success. This study intends to explore the critical organizational success factors contributing to the success of PPP projects according to the proposal mode and to provide practical recommendations for project success from organizational perspectives. To assess the factors, 141 questionnaire surveys were conducted with participants in 32 PPP projects. The major findings indicated that "Project Implementation Capability" had the most critical influence on solicited projects, whereas "Risk Sharing and Mitigation Strategies" was the most significant in unsolicited projects. In addition, "Interorganization Coordination" among project participants was essential to the success for both solicited and unsolicited projects. Government roles and involvement were also critical, although their contributions were relatively less important than other critical organizational success factors. Based on the findings, practical recommendations were provided for the success of solicited and unsolicited projects.

J	Doan, DT; Chinda, T				Dat Tien Doan; Chinda, Thanwadee			Modeling Construction and Demolition Waste Recycling Program in Bangkok: Benefit and Cost Analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction and demolition waste; Recycling program; System dynamics; Bangkok; Cost and schedule	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; GENERATION	In Bangkok, many infrastructures have been built to satisfy the needs of the rapidly developing economy, leading to much higher construction and demolition (C&D) waste than ever before. A recycling program is, therefore, needed to properly manage the waste and to avoid landfill shortages and future environmental problems. This research examines the feasibility of a construction and demolition waste recycling program in Bangkok, Thailand, using a system dynamics (SD) modeling technique. The model consists of two main elements, namely the total benefits and total costs. The simulation results show that it takes 14years for the recycling program to be worth the investment. However, with the minimum acceptable internal rate of return (IRR) of 12% for most government projects, the recycling program must be continued until the end of Year 17 to be considered feasible. The results also show that saving in landfill charges and green image are the two key benefits in the recycling program. This could be seen from the high impact of the recycling rate and green image rate parameters on the construction and demolition waste recycling program. The developed dynamic model provides a better understanding of the construction and demolition waste situation in Bangkok, and plans for an effective waste management in the long term.

However, investing in another country for PPP projects is not free of risks, due mainly to unfamiliarity with different environments and conditions. This paper aims at identifying and evaluating risk factors in TPPP projects. Drawing on the X hydropower project, the identified 22 critical risk factors affecting the TPPP project were assessed by industry experts who had direct involvement in the project. The intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IFAHP) technique was used in the assessment of the risk factors. The results indicated that technology, natural environment, construction, administrative, and political risk were the top five risk factors. The findings of this study improve the understanding of the risk factors in TPPP projects and could be useful for risk management professionals and researchers. Future research is needed to develop risk assessment and management models for TPPP projects based on current risk factors in TPPP projects. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ebekozien, A; Abdul-Aziz, AR; Jaafar, M				Ebekozien, Andrew; Abdul-Aziz, Abdul-Rashid; Jaafar, Mastura			Mitigating high development cost of low-cost housing: findings from an empirical investigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						High construction cost; housing developers; low-income houses; low-income earners; Malaysia		The high development cost of Malaysian low-cost houses (LCH) remains one of the major encumbrances towards wide-scale development, and the worst hit is the low-income group. Several studies have investigated the causes with insufficient evidence and impassive in the possible policy solutions, thus, the issues remain. This paper attempts to identify the root cause and proffer possible policy solutions via an unexplored exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. First, 40 participants were engaged and the qualitative findings were further analyzed by 149 suitable retrieved questionnaires. The 'quantilized findings' were validated by the Malaysian LCH policymakers. Findings show that provision of land and capital facilities to utility companies by housing developers, scarcity of land in cities, and construction cost increased over the years are the three major causes of high development cost. Waiving all forms of taxes for LCH, housing developers to embrace industrialized building systems, utility companies should provide land for their infrastructure and absorb the construction cost, ceiling price should be revised upward to RM65,000-RM70,000/unit (RM4.10/US$1) while the government subsidizes housing costs among others were recommended. This study adds a new perspective in mitigating high development costs by utilizing the Public Interest Theory of Regulation as one of the theoretical underpinnings.

Reintegrating ex-offenders into work through construction: a case study of cross-sector collaboration in social procurement	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Collaboration; construction; ex-offenders; social procurement; social value	PARTNERSHIPS; TYPOLOGY; SUPPORT; DEBATE	Too many ex-offenders are condemned to a life of unemployment, under-employment and benefit-dependency with significant ongoing costs to themselves, the economy and to wider society. To address this growing and intransigent problem, recent public policy innovations have led to the re-emergence of collaborative instruments such as social procurement which require companies tendering for construction and infrastructure contracts to train and employ ex-offenders on their projects. To comply, construction firms need to form new collaborate arrangements with organizations from the social and government sectors, yet little is known about how these new cross-sector collaborations work, what barriers to collaboration exist and how to overcome them. Mobilising theories of cross-sector collaboration, this exploratory case study research draws on findings from interviews, observations and documentary analysis of eleven collaborative pilot projects in the UK designed to explore new employment pathways for ex-offenders into construction. The findings reveal numerous barriers to cross-sector collaboration including little experience of cross-sector working; challenges working across different organizational logics; transaction costs associated with new organizational practices; and misaligned incentives. It is concluded that new forms of social project management, intrapreneurship and relational competencies need to be developed to enable these new collaborative arrangements to work.

The aim of current study is to examine the impact of firm size and industry experience on influencing factors that indicate the time delay in the Pakistani construction contracting firms having varied sizes and industrial experiences. The data are collected through dissemination of the questionnaires in the targeted construction firms. A comparative analysis of these data is undertaken for firms of varied sizes and experiences by using Mann-Whitney U test. The results show that firms of varied sizes do not concur over several skilled labour and site operation related influencing factors, whereas firms of varied experiences are in disagreement over several financial management related influencing factors. Small firms need to overcome their weakness in site operation related issues, especially poor site supervision and management, and countering the weather conditions. Young firms need to overcome financial management weakness, including inaccurate estimation of time, variations in material prices, lack of cost planning and monitoring during pre-contract and post-contract phases. Government support is needed to retain the skilled labour in the country, particularly for younger and smaller firms that are more vulnerable to time delay due to lack of availability of skilled labours in market.

J	Hallowell, MR				Hallowell, Matthew R.			Risk-Based Framework for Safety Investment in Construction Organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Risk; Finance; Contingent liability	IMPACT	The costs of construction injuries can have a substantial impact on the financial success of construction organizations and increase the overall costs of construction up to 15%. Following the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, construction firms began to implement a variety of management techniques to reduce the frequency of injuries. Although these strategies decrease the cost of injuries, they consume time and other significant resources. Thus, it is imperative for construction organizations to objectively evaluate the cost-benefit of investments in injury prevention through formal and robust processes. This paper presents a risk-based framework that can be used to evaluate the incremental return on investment of a series of investments in highly effective injury prevention strategies. The framework was developed using foundational risk quantification and analysis techniques and is illustrated using a hypothetical case study that is based on archival data published by United States government agencies. The conclusion of this study is that the optimal investment strategy can be identified through a formal analysis and that optimization depends on the frequency and cost of injuries, the sequence in which the specific injury prevention techniques are implemented, the risk mitigated by each strategy, and the organization's attitude toward acceptable risk.

It is a challenging issue to effectively use Building Information Modeling (BIM) for PPP project performance evaluation. The objective of this study is to develop a PPP project performance evaluation model based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and an enhanced matter-element method to more precisely evaluate PPP project performance. Design/methodology/approach The performance evaluation of PPP projects in the construction and operation period was explored. The PPP project performance evaluation indicator system was first established based on a literature review and PPP project practice. Then, the evaluation indicator information was expressed through IFC mapping and extension. After that, an IFC-based PPP project performance evaluation model was developed, and a case study was provided to validate the use of the proposed performance evaluation model. Findings The results of the case study show that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently evaluate PPP projects, and it could favorably contribute to performance evaluation in PPP projects. Originality/value The performance evaluation of PPP projects utilizing IFC extension and the enhanced matter-element method provides guidance for the government and private parties to accurately and efficiently evaluate PPP project performance.

Increasingly Governments in many developing countries have adopted public-private partnerships (PPPs) to meet their housing needs. However despite the adoption, problems still remain and the progress is slow. Various studies have examined the ranges of issues that have produced the poor results in delivering PPP projects in developing countries. However; no tool (framework) has been developed to address these challenges for a successful outcome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to present a validated PPP framework which will address the identified challenges in order to improve housing delivery. The proposed housing PPP framework was empirically validated by 12 PPP experts who were purposely selected in order to ascertain its applicability, effectiveness and adaptability. The results of the validation showed that the proposed measures within the housing PPP (HPPP) framework all rated above the test value, thus demonstrating its viability. The implication of the findings is the applicability of the HPPP framework in assisting the stakeholders address the existing challenges. Second, the framework has the potential of providing valuable guidance and roadmaps for successful delivery of PPP housing projects in developing countries.

However, the potential energy savings that are feasible do not match the more ambitious policy targets. Based on case studies in the Netherlands, obstacles are identified in the context of urban renewal that need to be overcome if energy efficiency measures are to be implemented and space heating replaced with low-carbon technologies. The current free-market public policy instruments have not managed to,address the obstacles identified in the case studies due to poor market signals, costs and payback periods, risks, and a lack of leadership on environmental targets and policies on sustainable urban renewal. The potential for stronger government intervention is examined for the effectiveness in reducing both energy consumption and CO2 generation. Legislation could produce a certain policy outcome in terms of CO2 reduction in urban renewal in the Netherlands if compliance and legitimacy are ensured, but policy consideration is also required to account for the dilemma of low-income households and the rebound effects associated with occupant behaviours.

J	Ward, M; Poleacovschi, C; Faust, K; Weems, CF; Gabiam, N				Ward, Michael; Poleacovschi, Cristina; Faust, Kasey; Weems, Carl F.; Gabiam, Nell			Evaluating the Role of Infrastructure Components and Demographics on Social Capital in Refugee Camps	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							HEALTH; SUPPORT; ASSOCIATION; SANITATION; MANAGEMENT; CONFLICT; DESIGN; KENYA	An important asset for displaced people residing in refugee camps is social capital. Social capital, which represents the social networks built among displaced people, the host community, and government actors, helps displaced people access services not adequately provided by camp managers. Despite the known importance of social capital for displaced people, researchers do not fully understand how it is fostered or inhibited by the design of a refugee camp. This research thus explores the following question: which salient infrastructure components and demographic characteristics in a refugee camp foster social capital? At a Greek refugee camp, researchers distributed 68 surveys to evaluate how salient infrastructure components in the camp environment affect bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. Salient infrastructure components represent, in this study, what the displaced persons identify as the most important infrastructure components in the camp environment. Linear regression is used to identify demographics (e.g., gender, nationality, age, asylum status, family status, and marital status) and salient infrastructure components (e.g., internal lighting and kitchen utensils) that influence bonding and bridging social capital. Interestingly, the research team found that demographics and salient infrastructure components had no relationship with linking social capital. This research proposes methods for policymakers and camp managers to identify the factors that drive the formation of social capital. Once these factors are identified, camp managers will be able to make targeted changes in the camp environment that could foster the formation of social capital.

Using the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of projects funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Small Business Innovation Research program, a two-stage competitive process, we find that the result of selection of the first round is a tendency toward larger companies. In the second round of funding, technology maturity is a stronger determinant of selection and company headcount is no longer a statistically significant driver. This combination allows the program to manage risk and deliver real technical advancement from even the smallest companies. We find that technologies typically advance from TRL 2, concept formulation, at the program's outset to roughly TRL 5, component validation, at the program's conclusion; these outcomes precede economic benefits from the subsidy. These findings illuminate a mechanism to address risk as well as demonstrating the technical outcomes of a managed early-stage technology program.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on literature research and interviews with 15 professionals in IT, project and asset management and government agencies. The authors discuss and illustrate what data that can be used for project evaluations and discuss potential obstacles. Findings - New data is creating new opportunities to analyse a phenomenon based on different types of data. Interesting data categories include: internet traffic, movement-related data, physical environment data and data in organisational internal systems. The authors show how these data categories can be applied in project evaluations. Research limitations/implications - Big Data gives an opportunity to add quantitative data in ex post evaluations. Use of Big Data can serve as a step towards a stronger technology focus in evaluations of projects. Practical implications - There are major advantages in using Big Data, increasing the opportunities to find indicators that are relevant when a project is evaluated. Social implications - Possible problematic issues related to use of Big Data that are addressed in the study include: availability, applicability, relevance, privacy policy, ownership, cost and competence. The study indicates that none of the challenges need to hinder use of Big Data when evaluating projects, provided that the issues are properly managed. Originality/value - The study illustrates how Big Data can be applied in project management research.	[Olsson, Nils O.

With the evolution of Project Management Knowledge areas, stakeholder management and engagement have become an integral part of Project Management as it imposes great threats and opportunities to a Project. Pakistan is a developing country and Infra-structure industry has gained a lot of stakeholder attention these days. Project based organizations here, strive to achieve success by incorporating best stakeholder management and engagement practices. This study aimed to measure the impact of stakeholder management on project success moderated by the awareness of stakeholder management. The study model has been quantitatively evaluated by collecting data from 300 respondents who belong to some of the major private and government construction firms of Pakistan. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has been applied using Smart PLS software after which it has been concluded that the stakeholder management positively impacts the project success and also affirms the positive moderation of awareness. The study Statistically (though SEM) concludes that on increasing stakeholder management's Awareness of Project teams there is a positive effect on the relationship between Stakeholder management approach and project success. This result is in-line with the literature discussed in this study, which suggest that to increase the chances of project success in projects, better stakeholder management approach is required.

Mass Customizing Paratransit Services With a Ridesharing Option	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mass customization; Transportation; Organizations; Optimization; Vehicle routing; Standards organizations; Process design; Accessible transportation service; decision analysis; mass customization; service design; vehicle routing problem (VRP)	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; LARGE NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH; A-RIDE PROBLEM; HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS; DESIGN	Paratransit services for people with travel difficulties have received increasing government and community attention due to the aging population. In this paper, we examine an integrated service design approach to customize paratransit services with a ridesharing option for a dial-a-ride (DAR) service. The fundamental challenge of DAR services is a lack of commonality across other services in the process, which results in low vehicle utilization. To mass customize paratransit services systematically, we identify the common service components of different paratransit services under the design framework of product family architecture. We then formulate the community organization & x0027;s pricing and vehicle scheduling decisions with a ridesharing option for a DAR operation as a two-stage decision model. In stage one of the tactical plan, we determine user tolerance of earlier pick-up and later drop-off times, and a price discount for a shared ride. Based on the user tolerance of a longer traveling time, we optimize the vehicle scheduling of shared service orders. Our experimental results indicate that a ridesharing policy option for a DAR service providing a 20 & x0025; discount for passengers who accept a 15-min earlier pick-up time or a later drop-off time leads to 15 & x0025; more people being served.

Refurbishment projects accounts for over 50 percent of cost of the project throughout the life cycle of an existing facility, thus requiring a sustainable platform to holistically address and manage such an enormity. BIM is increasingly being identified as an innovative technology, with the potential to streamline processes in refurbishment building projects, however, its application is marred with several risk factors impacting its adoption in New Zealand. This research study gleaned into the current literature to understand the perceptions and the risks in BIM adoption and then using a case study of a complex multipurpose building project facility, proposes risk-response strategies for BIM adoption. An exploratory interpretative methodology incorporating semi - structured interviews with informed project stakeholders and BIM experts and thematic analysis using NVivo is employed to analyse the results. The research revealed several BIM adoptions risks ranging from social-cultural which encompasses the attitude of stakeholders towards project time and skills to impact BIM adoption. The study proffers a pragmatic solution for addressing the cost issue and suggest a detailed Risk Mitigation Plan at government, organizational, and project level for BIM adoption.

The UK government will be requiring fully-collaborative BIM in all public sector projects by 2016 and is also chasing the target of achieving zero-carbon buildings by 2019. This dual target will require the use of renewable energy analysis tools in the early stages of the building design process and establish the need for these tools to be IFC-compliant. This paper presents a conceptual framework for developing IFC-compliant renewable energy simulation tools using a multi-model concept in which the IFC data model provides partial input data required to run simulation models. A prototype has been developed as a 'proof-of-concept' for an IFC-compliant solar PV simulation tool. The prototype has been validated against other solar PV simulation tools such as PV*Sol, RETScreen (R) and HOMER to provide credibility to the simulation model. The developed conceptual framework is applicable not only to solar PV simulation but other renewable energy simulation models as well, thereby making an IFC-compliant renewable energy modelling tool capable of conducting, energy, carbon emissions and financial analysis.

J	Fang, DP; Li, MG; Fong, PSW; Shen, LY				Fang, DP; Li, MG; Fong, PSW; Shen, LY			Risks in Chinese construction market - Contractors' perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							POLITICAL RISKS; JOINT VENTURES; MANAGEMENT	With China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Chinese construction market will be increasingly open and finally become part of the international market. Because of different social and economic systems, as well as different historical and cultural backgrounds, contractors are likely to encounter different risks in different markets. Based on questionnaires and case studies, this paper adopts an importance evaluation index and makes an importance evaluation of various risks encountered by Chinese contractors when contracting for projects in Chinese markets. This paper also makes comparisons between and analyses of the research findings and related available investigation results. The Cox-Stuart trend increase test method is applied in the current research, the results indicating that the variance corresponding to the importance index value tends to increase as the risk event importance decreases. This tendency shows that those investigated tend towards unanimity in terms of higher importance risk events. This paper also examines the reliability of the questionnaires by means of Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. The research shows that the main risk currently encountered by Chinese contractors in domestic markets includes owner's irregular behavior and government departments' interference in construction markets. China's accession to the WTO has provided greater opportunities for international contractors to enter the Chinese construction market. Therefore the research results described in this paper can provide valuable data enabling international contractors to gain a better understanding of the potential risks in the environment of the Chinese construction market.

The core of their activity consists of collaborative projects, which are characterised by specific management and Human Resources practices located at the junction of different cultures and employment statuses. Almost four years after they were launched, what can we say about the dynamic of these collaborative projects? What is the reality of such collaboration when it involves multiple partnerships bringing together employees from different occupational cultures and Human Resources Management systems? The aim of this longitudinal research, which is based on the observation of two collaborative projects in one of the most largest clusters in France, is to discuss management and HR issues in such a setting. A literature review highlights the need to open up the 'black box' of collaboration within projects and encourages examination of both manager's coordination efforts and the actors' motivation to cooperate, as well as the role played by HRM practices. Thus observation of the conduct of the projects over two years reveals that collaboration, far from being a given within these projects, is the product of a process of social construction that might be fostered by better managerial support.

Some authors have predicted a sea change in engineering workflow through model-based systems engineering. Despite benefits, the prevalence of effective modeling techniques in industry is an open question. Massive open online courses and similar online offerings are a new opportunity to learn about industry practices. In this paper, we draw on data from the "Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems" online program from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has enrolled 4200 participants, to understand how models are used in practice. We use aggregated data from questions to investigate model use by participants and their organizations. The results demonstrate that whereas modeling is widely recognized for its potential, the actual deployment against problems of interest is substantially lower than the participant-stated potential. We also find that many participants reported low use of basic modeling best practices, such as specialized programs. We propose that this research is a fresh use of descriptive analysis to uncover actual modeling practices. Future research should target more detail about modeling practices in engineering-driven firms, and the reasons why modeling adoption is low or overstated.

Critical success factors for building information modelling (BIM) implementation in Hong Kong	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology; Construction; Building information modelling	INSPECTION SCHEME MBIS; SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; EMPIRICAL SURVEY; DELPHI SURVEY; BENEFITS; ADOPTION	Purpose - Some initiatives have been proposed and implemented to facilitate successful project delivery and improve coordination and collaboration in the design, construction and management phases of project development. Building information modeling (BIM) is one of those initiatives that, though recent, however, have made a significant impact on the construction industry in some countries. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This paper aims to explore the critical success factors for BIM implementation in the architecture, engineering and construction industry of Hong Kong through a mixed research method (structured empirical questionnaire survey and expert interviews). Findings - The most influential success factor relates to the client's acceptance with BIM projects, proper organizational structure to support a BIM system within the company and financial aid from the government to set up the BIM system. The expert interviewees also stressed the need for willingness from project staff members to learn and utilize BIM. Practical implications - This study has contributed to the establishment of more practical and effective strategies for ensuring full adoption of BIM in Hong Kong. Practical recommendations for enhancing BIM adoption in the construction industry were highlighted. Originality/value - This study has established the key drivers leading to the success of BIM implementation in Hong Kong, as well as in the perspective of construction experts on how to enhance its uptake in construction projects.

Project delivery methods and more generally the procurement policies that currently drive the management of the US infrastructure system are explored. The historical evolution of government procurement policies of facilities indicates a wide variety of strategies including a dual-track procurement strategy that used a combination of different delivery methods and, in many instances, private financing. The methods ranged from the combined procurement of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a facility, such as Design-Build-Operate (DBO) and Design-Build-Finance-Operate (known outside the US as 'BOT'), to the separate procurement of these services, such as Design-Bid-Building (DBB) and Design-Build (DB). In the last 50 years, there has been a shift toward the exclusive reliance on separate procurement such as DBB and the use of public funding. This approach is not sustainable financially, considering the widening gap between the availability of public funds and the increasing needs of the existing infrastructure system. Some drivers that foster a possible future shift in public procurement procedures are highlighted as well as the development of a more efficient infrastructure management practice.

Construction Engineering Conference and Workshop 2014: Setting an Industry-Academic Collaborative Research Agenda	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry; Construction engineering; Basic research; Research needs; Agenda; Industry forum	EDUCATION	Construction engineering is a vital discipline in industry practice, providing essential facilities and systems for modern society. Despite its undisputed importance, basic research intensity and focus has been declining, which is compounded by challenges in collaboration between industry and academia. This study therefore aimed to revitalize construction engineering by emphasizing basic research, exploring barriers and enablers, and collaboratively establishing an ambitious research agenda. These objectives were addressed via a dedicated research conference and workshop held in March 2014 in Seattle. The event outcomes included new collaborations for 49% of workshop participants. In addition, the workshop identified four fundamental attributes of basic construction engineering research, including the drive to further knowledge, to improve construction delivery, to serve industry, and to pursue sustainability. Ultimately, this paper presents a research agenda for construction engineering based on workshop participant contributions. This agenda is a call for action that focuses attention on global systems and sustainability (for example, creating and maintaining vast distributed infrastructure systems), technology and management (for example, designing for the hybrid technical-human nature of construction engineering), and research methods (for example, adapting interdisciplinary research methodologies for construction engineering research). It is intended as the starting point for junior and senior researchers, industry representatives, and government agencies to develop, participate in, and support their targeted research projects that endeavor to address a specific part of one of these major themes.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Defining the public; Policy; Project; Public inclusion; Public pivate partnership; Users	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; PERFORMANCE; DELEGATION; PFI	Public private partnerships (PPPs), as new organizational forms, are intended to respond to societal problems previously held as intractable. In all countries, the originality of PPPs raises new questions of governance, which include the problem of sharing economic, social, and political responsibility among various segments of society in the development of the country; and the adoption of new institutional forms to enhance the efficiency of government action. These concerns are raised in both developed and developing countries, but with greater acuteness in the latter. In all cases, the central question regarding the relation between the public and private sectors is that which constitutes the public side of the partnership. This paper traces historical and contemporary developments in the need for PPPs; and current public protests against PPPs, which are perceived as impositions to the desires of the greater public. Using a principal-agent model as a lens, this paper provides a detailed understanding of what constitutes the first "P" (the public) in a PPP construct and shows how many current approaches in PPP project arrangements have failed to embrace the real public (an inclusive approach) and have instead been dominated by the artificial public agent (an exclusive approach). The paper provides an appropriate definition of the public and recommends the need for a paradigm shift from exclusion to inclusion in PPP arrangements. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Such requests often entrap the government in hold-up problems and result in improper payments to the developers and may even create general public dissatisfaction with a project. In this paper, the Game Theory model is used to analyze the Taiwan High Speed Railroad project to examine how developers implement different strategies at the various stages of a project to alter the contract's conditions in order to continually creating competitive advantage after they have been awarded the contract. This project developer is now facing serious financial difficulties. In this study, the financial information on the Taiwan High Speed Railroad operations was used as the foundation for conducting a simulation to calculate the project's value after this project began operation. The results will serve as reference to the best decision-making strategy for renegotiating costs in competition and cooperation so that a developer can select the optimum project offering the maximum reward. Also, the result will be offered to industries involved in market competition or act as an approach to establish future BOT policies on renegotiation.

J	Askar, MM; Gab-Allah, AA				Askar, MM; Gab-Allah, AA			Problems facing parties involved in build, operate, and transport projects in Egypt	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							BOT TENDER	One of the newest financial schemes for environmental projects is the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) concept, which is being used increasingly worldwide as a project delivery system by which governments obtain the infrastructure projects by private sector after a concession period free of charge. In the Egyptian environment up to now, promoters and investors have had many fears toward declared projects. This study aims to investigate the potential for implementing the BOT system in the Egyptian environment. This can be achieved by giving a clear view of BOT and of its problems, risk areas, and features, pertaining to the Egyptian environment, in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks as much as possible. The collected data was analyzed based on actual implementation in Egypt. This involved the following: (1) An overview of the critical success factors in order to achieve a BOT project; (2) an analysis of results obtained from questionnaires seeking to determine the possibility of occurrence of the different risk factors in the Egyptian environment, and their ranking-, (3) a comparison between the questionnaire results and the actual risks from requests for the proposal of locally advertised projects; and (4) a determination of the missed critical success factors in the Egyptian environment. The main conclusion of this study is that three critical success factors are essential for the success of BOT projects in Egypt: (1) Picking the right project; (2) competitive financial proposal; and (3) special features of bid.

However, these studies typically report thematic classifications and bibliometric data. Based on the concept of governance, this paper takes a systems approach to synthesize evidence around complexities of the shaping phase of road PPPs. The approach employs a textual analysis of road PPP case studies reported in archival papers listed in Scopus and Web of Science between 1997 and 2018 and uses the system dynamics method to provide a holistic view, synthesizing major insights and layout interdependencies across financial, operational, and sociopolitical variables. The outcome of this endeavor is a systems map, which helps consolidate varying evidence from the past cases, and goes beyond a narrow focus on single causes of governance issues in road PPPs. Results show that, although no silver bullet exists for PPP governance problems, reaching satisfactory feasibility levels in the shaping phase is enabled most by having government agencies highly capable of dealing with procurement issues and generating attractive projects to the private sector. The map provides a synopsis of the relationships (the forest) as well as insights into the variables (the trees) behind PPP shaping efforts.

As a result, it is urgent to focus on waste recycling, resource conservation, and environmental protection. To reduce environmental pollution and decrease waste disposal costs, this paper employs a reverse logistics network (RLN)-based multiperiod optimization for CDW recycling and disposal. To optimize the CDW disposal process, a dynamic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to determine the optimal solutions. By making decisions about the disposal process and CDW disposal volumes, the overall network costs are controlled on the premise of protecting the environment. A case study from China is then introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MILP model in selecting the disposal processes, determining waste disposal volumes, and controlling total costs. Scenario analyses for the collection and recycling ratios are conducted, and the influence of the government's green tax is considered. Finally, practical policy suggestions are given to guide CDW disposal. The main contribution of this paper is that the learned CDW disposal network could strictly and efficiently regulate CDW recycling and provide a valid political instrument to dispose of CDW that can not only reduce environmental damage and construction activity resource consumption, but also convert the CDW into new construction materials to economically benefit the construction industries.

While, CSR research in the construction and engineering industry is progressing there has been little research into whether and how firms in this industry operationalize CSR, how they incorporate CSR into their business vision, leadership and mission and strategies and what forms these strategies take. In addressing these gaps in knowledge, a survey of 104 firms from across the construction and engineering industry and its supply chain in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. The results indicate that CSR in construction and engineering firms is largely informal, unsophisticated, compliance driven and in its early stages of development. There is little strategic focus in CSR initiatives and the potential social capital derived from better strategic relationships with communities appears to be largely wasted. Conceptually, it is concluded that there is a need to adapt current models of CSR practice, developed in a permanent business context, to reflect the transitional, nomadic and project-based nature of construction. Current models of CSR are inadequate at explaining how firms operating in the construction industry need to practically adjust and adapt their CSR strategies to fit with the constantly changing political, social, cultural, environmental and economic profiles of local communities and the requirements of clients and local governments.

J	Harris, M				Harris, Mike			Competitive Precinct Projects: The Five Consistent Criticisms of "Global" Mixed-Use Megaprojects	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						urban megaprojects; competitive cities; neoliberal globalization; urban renewal; urban planning	NEW-YORK; URBAN; COPENHAGEN; GOVERNANCE; CITIES	Mixed-use megaprojects on state-owned land have been increasingly occurring around the world over the past few decades. This article reviews the body of literature that has emerged on these projects during this period and investigates a number of projects more deeply by reviewing original planning documents and undertaking interviews with government officials, consultants, and other insiders. Project motives, delivery methods, and built outcomes have been examined in order to contextualize their emergence and proliferation, leading to a typological understanding, defined in this article as competitive precinct projects. A content analysis of 30 reviews covering 42 mixed-use megaprojects in 20 countries reveals remarkable global consistency in thematic criticisms. Framed in this article as the "five consistent criticisms of 'global' mixed-use megaprojects," they pose a significant barrier to addressing increasingly complex urban challenges as well as to their successful management from inception to delivery. While the consistent criticisms represent patterns that have endured within a globally active urban development type for over three decades, this research shows that rather than being a neoliberal hegemony, there are mixed political and ideological aims and outcomes across projects and sometimes within the same project. A typological understanding allows patterns to be examined and understood, variances and hybridity to be evaluated, and more sophisticated future directions to be mapped out in the pursuit of broader based and city-scale project outcomes.

Quantifying the Linkages and Leakages of Construction Activities in an Open Economy Using Multiregional Input-Output Analysis	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction sector; Import-dependent economy; Linkage; Leakage; Input-output analysis	COUNTRY SIZE; SECTOR; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; POLICY	This study proposes an analytical framework to evaluate the economic influence and leakage of the construction sector in a small and open economy, using Hong Kong as a case study. Input-output analysis (IOA) is used to capture the domestic intersectoral linkages, and multiregional IOA is used to measure the leakages resulting from international trade. In the absence of Hong Kong official input-output tables (IOTs), five IOTs during 1995-2013 and three multiregional IOTs from 2004, 2007, and 2011 are compiled using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database in conjunction with official statistics. Comparisons with other economies are included to disclose the relative economic influences of Hong Kong's construction sector. The results reveal the declining economic importance of Hong Kong's construction sector in stimulating economic growth, along with increased leakage to the manufacturing sectors abroad. The domestic backward linkage dropped from 1.74 in 1995 to 1.55 in 2013 per unit of final demand. In 2011, 40.55% of the economic contribution leaked out through international trade.

J	Hinze, J; Hallowell, M; Baud, K				Hinze, Jimmie; Hallowell, Matthew; Baud, Kevin			Construction-Safety Best Practices and Relationships to Safety Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Risk; Project planning; Labor and personnel issues		The construction industry has experienced a great deal of safety improvement after the Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970. In the last twenty years, improvements have been made largely due to safety interventions that exceed compliance with government regulations. Researchers have long attempted to identify the most effective safety programs. However, studies in the past focused only on a small subset of potential injury-prevention options. In addition, to date, there has yet to be a study that documents a comprehensive list of safety strategies implemented by industry-leading companies. This research addresses this knowledge gap by creating a comprehensive list of construction-safety strategies from relevant literature and supplementing it with input from an expert panel. Once the strategies were identified (n=104), the research team conducted interviews with representatives from 57 projects in the United States to determine which strategies were implemented on each project and the project's recordable injury rate (RIR). The data were then analyzed to determine the total proportion of potential strategies implemented and examine the relationship between each strategy and the RIR. The results reveal that 14 strategies differentiate safety performance (P>0.05) and that 22 strategies were implemented by 100% of the sample projects. The implications are that the 22 practices implemented in all projects can now be considered a foundation of a safety program, and the 14 differentiators are the keys to improved safety performance.

Dormitories have a particular impact on occupants' lives and, therefore, deserve judicious maintenance management. Although the key to good management, there is no clearly established benchmarks for monitoring maintenance performance in dormitories. To provide objective benchmarks, this study sought to analyze work order histories from a government database. This study employed a scripted method to visualize trends in 96,629 work orders from military dormitories across the United States and around the world between 2015 and 2020 to determine the effect of facility age on maintenance requirements and preventative maintenance (PM) to corrective maintenance (CM) ratios for five different facility systems. By calculating the maximum inflection points of the trendlines, the study determined the age of maximum CM cost and labor intensity between 21 and 25 years for most facility systems studied. The study also calculated the PM-to-CM ratios that minimized CM costs and labor for three tiers of building ages. This study contributed to the existing knowledge in maintenance benchmarking by providing a method to calculate objective costs and labor requirements for maintenance management based on historical data. Additionally, this study contributed practical values for FMs to use when monitoring maintenance performance in dormitories.

State-of-the-Art Review of Urban Rail Transit Public-Private Partnerships	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Review						Finance; Public-private partnership (PPP); Scientometric analysis; Urban rail transit (URT); State-of-the-art review	MAIN-PATH-ANALYSIS; LAND-VALUE CAPTURE; POST-TRUTH ERA; FAKE NEWS; TRANSPORT; INFRASTRUCTURE; PROJECTS; PPP; LESSONS; INVOLVEMENT	With a plethora of major capital and regional centers worldwide being subjected to increasing population levels, there is a need to upgrade and expand the capacity and performance of their urban rail transit (URT) networks and systems. Fiscal constraints, however, have hindered many governments' ability to fund the construction and operation of URT projects. While there have been numerous studies that have examined the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to deliver URT, there has been a paucity of research that has critically reviewed, analyzed, and compared developments in this important and emergent area of transportation procurement. In addressing this void, the authors undertake a state-of-the-art review by performing a systematic scientometric analysis of the extant URT PPP literature to determine gaps in knowledge and identify implications for policy and areas for future research. As a result of performing a state-of-the-art review, the contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) provide the foundations for developing a theoretical framework that can be used by policy-makers to ensure URTs are resilient and adaptable to change; and (2) identify the need for research to examine how land value capture can be used to finance mechanism to ensure the viability of PPPs.

An explanatory case study technique and case study evidence from four BIM construction projects form the study's research design. The study identified and established the three sub-criteria of the BIM-PIMF model which are the BIM process level factors, BIM product level factors, and the key indicators for a successful BIM deployment on construction project sites. These criterias were semantically linked to the development of the BIM-PIMF framework on a five-point metric scale. The deliverables of this study include the development of the BIM-PIMF framework, together with its analytical scoring system. The findings of the study will improve the information channels of and ease the integration of technological innovations in construction processes while improving the technical competencies of project staff. The study highlighted a basket of effective recommendations and strategies to enhance the deployment of BIM throughout a project lifecycle. Policymakers and government departments can utilize the model in assessing the level of usage of BIM in a construction project as one of the useful measures in gauging which construction firms to be provided subsidies.

J	Guevara, J; Garvin, MJ; Ghaffarzadegan, N				Guevara, Jose; Garvin, Michael J.; Ghaffarzadegan, Navid			Capability Trap of the US Highway System: Policy and Management Implications	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						U.S; highway system; System dynamics; Road maintenance; Simulation	RECOVERY; DYNAMICS; ACT	The deterioration of the U.S. highway system has received significant attention from scholars, industry practitioners, and policymakers over the last several decades. This growing interest has encouraged the production of multiple reports highlighting the challenges of enhancing system conditions in the long term. Because government agencies do not have sufficient resources to take care of roads in a timely manner, deterioration worsens, and available funds are primarily used for previously deferred maintenance and rehabilitation activities. The current work seeks to gain insight into the dynamics of capital investments and maintenance expenditures in U.S. road infrastructure. Based on a system dynamics model, the authors argue that the highway system is stuck in a capability trap (failure to achieve sustained improvements) because authorities tend to promote short-term reactive efforts over long-term proactive actions. The study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the feedback mechanisms that connect maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures with aging and deterioration processes. Building on a counterfactual analysis between 1994 and 2010, the research reveals that incentivizing preventive practices not only enhances system conditions but also reduces major rehabilitation expenses and, in the long term, frees up resources for capacity expansion. Conclusions point to the difficulties associated with escaping the trap and the impacts of implementing reactive and proactive policies throughout the highway system.

J	Yang, KP; Chiao, YC; Kuo, CC				Yang, Kuo-Pin; Chiao, Yu-Ching; Kuo, Chih-Chung			The Relationship Between R&D Investment and Firm Profitability Under a Three-Stage Sigmoid Curve Model: Evidence From an Emerging Economy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Optimal level; performance; research and development (R&D); sigmoid (S) curve; threshold	PRODUCT INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; SIZE	The relationship between investment in research and development (R&D) and firm performance has been the subject of numerous academic investigations, but the findings of these investigations have varied greatly, with research revealing a number of different patterns in the R&D-performance relationship. This inconsistency may be partly attributable to the failure of the commonly used linear modeling method to capture the full dynamics of the R&D-performance relationship. Based on the sigmoid (S) curve paradigm, as well as on other economic foundations, this study proposes the use of a three-stage S-curve model to help reconcile the disparities in the literature. This S-curve model shows that the relationship between R&D intensity and firm profitability is nonlinear, with the slope negative at low levels (stage 1), positive at medium levels (stage 2), and negative again at high levels of R&D investment (stage 3). Empirical evidence from a sample of 377 publicly listed Taiwanese high-tech manufacturing firms and 179 nonhigh-tech firms, examined during the period between 2000 and 2007, confirmed our proposed model. This study not only establishes a relationship pattern that differs from that shown in past studies, but also has important managerial implications for R&D managers and important policy implications for governments.

Although various theories and workforce retention mechanisms have been used to reduce labor turnover, a consensus has yet to be reached as to what factors contribute to high employee turnover among construction companies. By using a systematic review approach and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, this study identifies factors affecting construction workforce turnover. Findings from 53 studies were analyzed and included in this study after the search protocol was applied. In total, 26 factors were identified, and these fall into four categories, namely, (1) factors related to the nature of the job; (2) factors related to the external industry environment; (3) factors related to the construction company itself; and (4) factors associated with the individual workforce. An improved understanding of these factors will inform targeted workforce development approaches within construction organizations and prepare them as businesses, as sectors, and as partners with government agencies to combat the odds of labor turnover. The review reported in this paper serves as a starting point for future research to understand the labor turnover issue faced by the construction sector and the measures companies can take to mitigate its effects.

J	Iyer, KC; Sagheer, M				Iyer, K.

Such arrangements, which reallocate risks and rewards between public and private sectors, present complex issues for the prospective concessionaires. During the bidding stage, the prime concerns of the private investors are the bid-winning probability and financial profitability of the project. In Indian BOT highway projects, the grant sought from the government is the sole bid variable that determines the successful concessionaire. A higher grant, although ensuring increased chances of winning the concession, would also lead to significant cash outflows adversely affecting the profitability of the project. The profitability of the project is also a function of debt-equity structure, which is determined by using financial engineering techniques. Hence, from the private investors' point of view, a systematic model for optimizing the bid-winning potential and capital structure is needed, which would assist the project sponsors in bidding and financing decisions. Prior researches in this area have considered these optimization issues in a fragmented manner. This paper presents a genetic-algorithm (GA)-based model that yields a set of optimal solutions for the key decision variables: grant, debt, and equity. The proposed model, demonstrated through a real life BOT highway project, can aid the private investors in fast and efficient decision-making. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000071.

The main objective of this project is to improve the quality of the core project documentation that serves for supporting the construction works in Spain and to facilitate an efficient exchange of information between the stakeholders in the Spanish Architectural Engineering and Construction sector, in particular their relationship with the Professional Associations and Spanish control public bodies. Starting from the premise that high quality project documentation is the basic precondition for a good quality in all the phases of the whole buildings and facilities life cycle, the project is based on Internet, XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and the new Spanish standards about the quality in the project documentation (UNE 157000 series). As a result, a new set of XBRL taxonomies has been developed to support the processes of elaboration, verification, sending to the Professional Association, digital stamping, delivery, control, compulsory registration and storage of the construction project core documentation by the public authorities. Our proposal can be extended to other countries, particularly in Europe, since regulations are becoming similar in all EU countries. The potential for spin-off technology utilization is also significant in the areas of insurance, inspection chamber, digital reporting and project management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, if they are to be efficient social choices from an economic perspective, their spatial benefit incidence should be equal to their cost burden in each region. An analysis of benefit incidence should consider not only a usual scenario but also a disaster scenario because the redundancy effect is expected to reduce the amount of economic damage incurred during a disaster. The authors' research group has developed a spatial computable general equilibrium model (RAEM-Light) that can be applied to small spatial regions. The RAEM-Light model was used to analyze the benefit incidence in the development and maintenance stages of proposed road networks under a usual and a disaster scenario. The spatial incidence of the economic effect of road investment differs between the usual and the disaster scenarios for both the development and maintenance stages. As Japan becomes more decentralized, it will become more important to determine the optimum allocation of the road-network cost burden among local governments, taking into account differences in the spatial benefit incidence at each stage and in each scenario. However, to minimize the economic losses incurred by a disaster such as the Tohoku earthquake (March 11, 2011), more centralized decision making may be necessary, although this is not efficient social choice from an economic perspective.

The scientists, researchers and government are analysing the problems concerning with heritage building's, like seismic issues, energy saving, sustainability, structures, materials and adaptive reuse. Since, heritage buildings' reuse and preservation are characterized by multiple criteria, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are useful in finding rational solutions for the previously mentioned problems. The current paper aims to overview papers on the MCDM approaches application in regard to heritage buildings' reuse and preservation area. This study employs a bibliometric data analysis to explore state-of-the-art of the defined topic and an in-deep analysis - to synthesize the knowledge domain and critically evaluate a thorough literature in the analysed topic. As a result, scientific maps were created to reveal the knowledge domain of MCDM approaches in heritage buildings' reuse and preservation. Finally, research gaps and future research directions are identified. Results of the analysis shows that till now MCDM approaches are not widely used in solving heritage buildings reuse and preservation issues. Moreover, there is luck of complex problem solving approach in cultural heritage buildings area.

Public participation performance in public construction projects of South China: A case study of the Guangzhou Games venues construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public participation; Performance index; Public construction project; Survey; China	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY; RESEARCH TREND; UNITED-STATES; HONG-KONG; INFRASTRUCTURE; SATISFACTION; IDENTIFICATION; ENGAGEMENT; HEARINGS	Over the past decade, public participation has been increasingly implemented in Chinese public construction projects (PCPs) to facilitate their smooth execution at the micro level and to promote collaborative governance at the macro level. However, only a limited number of studies have systematically evaluated participation performance in Chinese PCPs. This study aims to develop a public participation performance index (PPPI) for promoting the implementation of public participation in Chinese PCPs. An initial list of 15 key performance indicators (KPIs) was compiled through a literature review and refined by a pilot survey with selected experts. Based on this list, a questionnaire survey instrument was developed and used to collect the opinions of 192 participants with various stakeholder roles in different PCPs in South China. A composite PPPI for PCPs in South China, which consists of six out of 15 KPIs, was then constructed according to the survey results. The Guangzhou Asian Games venue construction was selected as a case study to illustrate the use of this index. The PPPI has great potential for future application in participation practices. Although this index is developed in China, the research method can be replicated in other developing countries to develop similar indices for international comparisons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome these problems, some local governments initiate on-street short-term pay programs to limit lengths of stay and generate revenue. The problem lies in determining which data should be collected, how frequently, and for how long to produce significant results. This study applied power analysis in analyzing rate of turnover and utilization levels to develop optimum data collection using license plate surveying methodology. A case involving downtown areas, shopping centers, and beach parks is presented. Analysis evaluated the probability of detecting desired changes, minimum detectable changes (MDC), and coefficient of variation (CV) for different data monitoring frequencies over desired data collection periods. Three critical license plate monitoring intervals for downtown parking were identified to be between 5-20 min, 30-40 min, and 40-60 min, with each group having different characteristics compared with others. There was a slight overlap in transitional monitoring time intervals. Analysis found that, to detect all possible optimal parking characteristics and cost-efficient surveying, license plates should be monitored at intervals less than every 30 min for downtown and 60 min for beach parks.

Hence, this study aims to (1) investigate the challenges in adopting smart technologies, (2) propose effective strategies to promote adoption of smart technologies, and (3) investigate whether there are significant differences in the perceptions of the challenges and strategies by organizations' sizes and years of experience in the construction industry. To achieve the objectives, a comprehensive literature review and pilot interviews with industry experts were first conducted, followed by a survey and postsurvey interviews. The findings revealed that the top challenges faced are data and information sharing, regulatory compliance, and data ownership, while the most effective strategies are training of skilled construction workforce, provision of government incentives, and communication and change management. Furthermore, the criticality of regulatory challenges was perceived differently between organizations of different sizes. The findings provide a better understanding of the challenges faced and the strategies that have been perceived as effective by industry practitioners, which are essential starting points to develop a data-driven roadmap to drive the adoption of smart technologies to facilitate the digital transformation of the construction industry.

According to one official U.S. government assessment, transit infrastructure is assigned a grade of D, which means "poor condition." In the meantime, subway systems ridership is growing; therefore, it is crucial to assess the condition of such vital infrastructure, which greatly affects public safety. Transit providers need to create efficient management tools, including methodologies for the condition rating and performance evaluation of their assets. The objective of the present research is to develop a condition assessment model for subway stations and tunnels considering structural, electrical, and mechanical components. The condition is rated based on actual defects in which the Analytic Hierarchy and Networks Processes are utilized to estimate defect and component's weights. A fuzzy scale is proposed to interpret the various condition grades. A customized Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is utilized to develop an integrated infrastructure condition index for various components, stations, and tunnels. Data to determine weights were collected from experts through on-line surveys. The model is implemented in a case study, where the examined subway system reported good performance, and is tested through comparison with results obtained from existing models. This study is relevant to transit authorities, subway industry practitioners, and researchers. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Since the 1990s, China has started experimenting with the public-private partnership (PPP) delivery method in the water supply sector. However, many problems stemming from unsuccessful risk management have been encountered in PPP applications that have eventually led to project failure. This paper aims to identify and evaluate typical risks associated with PPP projects in the Chinese water supply sector. A literature review, a Delphi survey, and face-to-face interviews were used to achieve these objectives. Finally, a register of 16 critical risk factors (CRFs) of water PPP projects in China was established. The findings revealed that completion risk, inflation, and price change risk have a higher impact on Chinese water PPP projects, whereas government corruption, an imperfect law and supervision system, and a change in market demand have a lower impact on the water supply sector. The findings can help project stakeholders to improve the efficiency of privatization in public utility service and provide private investors with a better understanding while they participate in the enormous Chinese water market through the PPP mode.

J	Eweje, J; Turner, R; Muller, R				Eweje, John; Turner, Rodney; Mueller, Ralf			Maximizing strategic value from megaprojects: The influence of information-feed on decision-making by the project manager	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaprojects; Program management; Strategic value; Decisions	PROSPECT-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; ISSUES	Large projects are notorious for erosion of value during execution. Decisions made by project managers have a significant impact on the strategic value of the asset delivered, and those decisions depend on the information feed on which they are based. This study uses theories of organizational behavior, decision-making and program management to investigate the impact of information feed used by project managers on the strategic value delivered by mega projects in the oil and gas industry. A global survey of 69 managers of mega-projects was conducted. Results showed that information feed to project managers significantly influences the strategic value created by megaprojects. Also some moderating effects of contextual factors on this relationship were found. The contextual factors that influenced project manager decision-making relate to what they perceived to be Senior Management drivers for their projects. However the hypothesized moderating influence of project manager experience on decision-making was not found-an interesting observation. It was found that the extent to which project managers feel in control should influence the scope and quality of information-feed that should be sought. Four risk areas were observed as significant to long-term value creation from megaprojects: government relations; host community relations; contract management and procurement; and the influence of multi-location execution.

For projects that cannot be self-financed, public sectors usually invest public funds to make them financially feasible. The concession agreement allocates revenues and risks, and lies in the center of balancing public and private interests. However, stakeholders may have contrary opinions regarding the optimization of concession agreement. While private sectors are concerned about earning money, public sectors pay more attention to the efficient use of public funds. To address this challenge, this paper firstly identifies several key concessionary items, including concession period, concession price, capital structure and government subsidy. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is presented using discounted cash flow method, in which key concessionary items act as decision variables and public and private interests are represented by two sub-objectives. Subsequently, the model is solved using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Furthermore, a numerical case based on Beijing No. 4 Metro Line is provided to demonstrate the application of the model. Results show that the proposed model can produce a series of viable combinations of concessionary items that balance public and private interests, which provides practical references for relative decision making activities.

J	Sun, YF; Zhang, LY				Sun, Yanfang; Zhang, Lianying			Balancing Public and Private Stakeholder Interests in BOT Concessions: Minimum Revenue Guarantee and Royalty Scheme Applied to a Water Treatment Project in China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Build-operate-transfer (BOT); Concession period; Minimum revenue guarantee (MRG); Royalty collection (RC); Project planning and design	OPERATE-TRANSFER PROJECTS; PERIOD; MODEL; CONTRACTS	Because of demand uncertainties, a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project may lead a concessionaire either to realize an excessive profit or suffer a loss. The object of this paper is to establish an adjustment mechanism to automatically balance the risks and rewards between public and private sectors under the fixed preset concession period. Using a revised net present value (NPV) financial evaluation model and the Monte Carlo simulation technique, the authors construct a model that can determine the optimum solution of the minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) level and the collect rate of royalty for BOT projects. The MRG and royalty collection combination (G&R) is shown, via a reduction in the decision variables, to be a more effective scheme than those in previous studies. The results of a sensitivity analysis based on a wastewater treatment BOT project prove that Scheme M of MRG based on 90% volume combined with a 20% royalty rate is the leading option because it guarantees that the concessionaire will always earn a reasonable anticipated return under the fixed term. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a simple tool for balancing the risks and benefits for the government and investors. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A Structural Equation Model of Feasibility Evaluation and Project Success for Public-Private Partnerships in Hong Kong	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Critical success factors (CSFs); public-private partnerships (PPP); structural equation modeling (SEM)	FIT	A successful public-private partnership (PPP) scheme can be described as one that can lead to the delivery of high-quality end products and/or services, which can satisfy the needs of the community, achieve the intended targets/goals of the government, as well as provide a favorable financial return for the private sector involved with the project. This study aims to establish an evaluation framework for the initial feasibility evaluation of a PPP project that would satisfy all the stakeholders. The factors for evaluating the feasibility of PPP projects can be classified into five broad categories: technical; financial and economic; social; political and legal; and others. Through the structural equation modeling approach, data attained from a questionnaire survey conducted in Hong Kong was analyzed and a model was developed to examine the relationships between different evaluation factors and the overall satisfaction of stakeholders. The results indicate that technical and social aspects are critical to the feasibility of PPP projects, and therefore, are the determining factors for success. This paper should assist relevant stakeholders to improve their understanding on the relative importance of the evaluation factors, and help to establish a comprehensive framework for decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of PPP projects. The predictors for PPP project success were also determined to enrich the knowledge base and help formulate management strategies to better implement the PPP project delivery approach.	[Ng, S.

Roadmaps are employed as decision aids to improve coordination of activities and resources in increasingly complex and uncertain environments. Specific uses of roadmaps include: S&T management including strategy, planning, executing, reviewing, and transitioning; S&T marketing; enhancing communications among researchers, technologists, product managers, suppliers, users, and other stakeholders; identifying gaps and opportunities in S&T programs; and identifying obstacles to rapid and low-cost product development. S&T managers also use roadmaps to help identify those S&T areas that have high potential promise, and to accelerate the transfer of the S&T to eventual products, However, there has been little attention paid to the practice of roadmapping in the published literature. This paper is a first attempt to bring some common definition to roadmapping practices and display the underlying unity of seemingly fragmented roadmap approaches. The paper begins with generic roadmap definitions, including a taxonomy of roadmaps that attempts to better classify and unify the broad spectrum of roadmap objectives and uses. Characteristics of retrospective and prospective roadmaps are then identified and analyzed, as well as summary characteristics of bibliometric-based S&T mapping techniques. The roadmap construction process, including fundamental principles for constructing high-quality roadmaps, is presented in detail.

In the UK, energy-feedback provision (currently via an in-home display) is part of the government-mandated roll-out of smart meters to all homes by 2020. A core assumption underlying this widespread provision is that information, or evidence, can lead to positive changes in action. This is analogous to assumptions underlying the notion of evidence-based policy', and raises questions about how users, researchers and policy-makers go about using evidence when aiming for a successful' outcome. In addition, the policy feedback' research agenda has asked how policies alter the landscapes within which they operate by, for example, affecting relationships between actors. Via an in-depth review of Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) policy literature over 2010-16, the UK smart meter roll-out was analysed in terms of how its energy-feedback-focused measures may be deemed as successful'. Findings include the fact that direct energy savings played a smaller role than might be expected, and translation from one success measure to another was repeatedly observed. A key conclusion is that acting on feedback requires an assessment of success, but such assessment is highly contextual, for consumers and policy-makers alike. Ways to increase reflexivity in this area are discussed.	[Robison, Rosalyn A.

Since BOT transportation projects are characterized by irreversibility and uncertainty, project values tend to be underestimated by ignoring the value of the option to defer in the evaluation process, and thereby a long concession period is required by the concessionaire and a high subsidy is invariably paid by the government concerned when a project is financially nonviable. However, the existing net present value (NPV) method for making a concession period decision cannot properly capture the managerial flexibility value in BOT projects. In addition, the existing Nash bargaining model used in the concession period negotiation process cannot define an optimal concession period but can only narrow the interval of the concession period. This paper presents an alternative method for determining the optimal concession period by considering the investment in BOT-type transportation projects under dynamic uncertainty. In the proposed model, real options theory is used to identify an effective interval of concession period for a BOT transportation project, and Nash negotiation theory is applied to find the optimal value of the concession period. An actual transportation project in China is referred to as demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The impact of contractors' attributes on construction project success: A post construction evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; Contractor selection; Project performance	SELECTION CRITERIA	The success of construction projects is a fundamental issue for most governments, users and communities. In the literature that deals with construction project success and causes of time and cost overruns in the construction industry, there is some literature that highlights the role of the contractors in project success. While most studies rank contractors' success attribute from tendering, prequalification, and a long term historical perception perspective, this paper aims to study the impact of contractors' attributes on project success from a post construction evaluation perspective to identify what critical success factors (CSFs) that greatly impact the success of project. In an attempt to understand and investigate this impact, a questionnaire survey is used to establish construction professionals' perception of CSFs of contractors that greatly impact on the success of construction projects. Factor analysis reveals nine underlying clusters namely :(i) safety and quality; (ii) past performance; (iii) environment; (iv) management and technical aspects; (v) resource; (vi) organisation; (vii) experience; (viii) size/type of pervious projects; and (ix) finance. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models that predict the probability of project success. Factors such as turnover history, quality policy, adequacy of labour and plant resources, waste disposal, size of past projects completed, and company image are the most significant factors affecting projects success. Assuming that project success is repeatable, these findings provide clear understanding of contractors' performance and could potentially enhance existing knowledge of construction project success.

J	Tariq, S; Zhang, XQ				Tariq, Salman; Zhang, Xueqing			A critical analysis of water PPP failures in sub-Saharan Africa	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Public-private partnerships; Failure drivers; Case study; Water services; Sub-saharan Africa	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PRIVATISATION; PRIVATIZATION; SERVICES; PROJECTS	Purpose Top-down pressure from donors, public sector inefficiencies and fund deficits have steered the introduction of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, PPP activities in the water sector have been quite insignificant compared to other infrastructure sectors in this region. In addition, a number of water PPPs have encountered great difficulties and subsequent failures. This study aims at unveiling the underlying reasons behind failures. Design/methodology/approach This study has classified the failure types of water PPPs and reviewed the development of water PPPs in sub-Saharan Africa to identify failed ones. Eight failed case studies are completed through the rigorous approach of event sequence mapping. Findings Nine root causes of water PPP failure are identified through a thorough examination of these failed water PPP cases and the interrelationships between these failure causes are established. The failure causes are further generalized through literature focusing on water PPP failures in developing countries and problematic issues that hinder the implementation of successful water PPPs across different Sub-Saharan African countries. Recommendations are provided for future improvements in carrying out water PPPs in Sub-Saharan Africa by learning past lessons and drawing experiences. Originality/value This is the first case study on water PPP failures in Sub-Saharan Africa from a construction management perspective. This study will help governments and the private sector in developing stronger future water PPPs.

J	Doan, P; Menyah, K				Doan, Phuong; Menyah, Kojo			Impact of Irreversibility and Uncertainty on the Timing of Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Toll road; Real option; Binomial lattice model; Deferral option	INVESTMENT	This paper argues that because of the irreversibility and uncertainty associated with build-operate-transfer (BOT) infrastructure projects, their financial evaluation should also routinely include the determination of the value of the option to defer the construction start-up. This ensures that project viability is comprehensively assessed before any revenue or loan guarantees are considered by project sponsors to support the project. This paper shows that the framework can be used even in the context of the intuitive binomial lattice model. This requires estimating volatility directly from the evolution of the net operating income while accounting for the correlation between the revenue and costs functions. This approach ensures that the uncertainties usually associated with toll revenues, in particular, are thoroughly investigated and their impact on project viability is thoroughly assessed. This paper illustrates the usefulness of the framework with data from an actual (BOT) toll road project. The results show that by postponing the project for a couple of years the project turns out to be viable, whereas it was not without the deferral. The evaluation approach proposed therefore provides a better framework for determining when and the extent of government financial support, if any, that may be needed to support a BOT project on the basis of project economics. The analysis may also be applicable to private sector investment projects, which are characterized by irreversibility and a high rate of uncertainty. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000615.

New Model for Identifying Critical Success Factors Influencing BIM Adoption from Precast Concrete Manufacturers' View	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM) adoption model; Critical success factors; Learn-to-rank algorithm; Policy recommendation; Precast concrete manufacturer; Survey	COEFFICIENT-ALPHA; USER ACCEPTANCE; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION; INNOVATION; DESIGN; RANK; IMPLEMENTATION; SERVICES	The construction industry is embracing the digital transformation to streamline the process from design to build. However, compared with design companies, precast concrete (PC) companies seem to be slow in the adoption of building information modeling (BIM). The paper thus intends to (1) understand the current BIM maturity levels in these companies via a survey among the PC companies; (2) develop a model for identifying critical success factors (CSFs) influencing BIM adoption from PC companies' view; and (3) give recommendations to the PC companies as well as policymakers. From the survey responses of 53 respondents from the PC industry in various countries including Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, China, Korea, Taiwan, the Middle East, and Finland, the study successfully identified a total of eight CSFs, which are regarded as the main contributions this research makes to the body of knowledge. Based on these CSFs, recommendations are provided to assist PC companies to become industry innovators. Some additional contributions are (1) a new BIM adoption model, which is a mix of a BIM maturity model and a BIM adopters' model and acted on by driving forces; (2) a new framework (called "PCBIM Hexagon" by the authors) consisting of driving forces from six areas: the government, ecosystem, company, team, process, and BIM software tool; and (3) a new approach for ranking the importance of the factors.

J	Agrama, FA				Agrama, Fatma A.			Multi-objective genetic optimization for scheduling a multi-storey building	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction management; Multi-storey building; Line of balance technique; Genetic optimization	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COST OPTIMIZATION; CPM	Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in various fields, however, optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of trade-offs between two or more conflicting objectives. This paper proposes developed Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that enabled multi-objective optimization for scheduling a multi-storey building. However, a trade-off between time and cost for habitation projects is required to face limited fund and increasing population environment. This problem has an important position for developing countries' governments because it's related to low cost habitation projects. Multi-storey buildings are classified as special repetitive projects because of skeleton constraints. Activities can be classified into: repetitive and non-repetitive ones. The present model enables construction planners to direct controlled time-cost construction plan by investigating optimal plans, generated from a set of feasible alternatives, which minimize project duration, total number of crews, and total work interruptions. This model satisfies the following aspects: 1) it is based on the line of balance technique; 2) it considers non-serial typical activity networks with finish-start relationship and both lag and overlap time between activities are allowed; 3) it utilizes a tool to identify activities in a typical repeated floor; and 4) it is developed as a spreadsheet template that is easy to use. Details of the model with visual charts are presented. An application example is analyzed to illustrate the use of the model and demonstrate its capabilities in optimizing the scheduling of a multi-storey building. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under the supervision of METI cooperated to develop and use technology roadmaps (TRM 1.0), which were conducted during 2005-2010. Based on this first attempt, we propose TRM Kaizen method to improve our methodology from the viewpoint of achieving the goals of industrial technology policy in a more effective and efficient way. Next, we extract the points to be reassessed in the technology roadmapping process based on our experiences of the application of the method. We consecutively propose an amendment, new technology roadmapping (TRM 2.0), with improvements to cope with the points mentioned above after 2014, and implement the technology roadmapping methodology for actual policy. Finally, the results of our practice are tested using TRM Kaizen method, and it is confirmed that issues of (TRM 1.0) have been almost fully resolved. The TRM Kaizen method illustrated in this article can be used as a practical methodology for more sophisticated technology roadmapping from the viewpoint of achieving the goals of industrial technology policy.

The purpose of this paper is to: analyze the project governance practices of public sector organizations, illustrate what kind of impact these practices have on agile software projects and describe the tensions of agile project governance. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on qualitative research strategy and applies elaborative logic with analyses of three case projects in the Finnish public sector. Findings - The findings of the research describe how project governance practices can be categorized into six dimensions: business case, contracting, controlling, steering, decision-making and capability building. The results illustrate how these practices either support or detract the performance of agile projects. The results also show that there are two interfaces to agile project that create most tensions to governance - the public sector and technology. Originality/value - The study contributes to both project management and information and communication technology theories by combining technical aspects of agile methodologies with micro-level project governance practices. The study also adds original value to academics by introducing the new concept of "agile project governance." The results of this study will allow public sector project organizations to design appropriate governance mechanisms for agile projects, and to identify the challenges and tensions that need to be considered and managed in the process.

Identifying the driving factors of successful megaproject construction management: Findings from three Chinese cases	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						megaproject management; driving factors; project success; case study; China	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; COSTS; RISK; RAIL	The construction of megaprojects has always resulted in extensive and long-term impacts on the society. However, the performance of megaproject management is poor, and improving it remains an urgent and necessary issue. Although many studies on megaproject success have been conducted, existing studies on the driving factors of successful megaproject construction are rather limited. Therefore, this study aims to systematically explore the key factors that can lead to successful megaproject construction management based on three cases: The Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway, the Three Gorges Dam, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Mixed research methods, such as literature review, case studies, and expert interviews, were used in this study. Consequently, 11 driving factors, namely, government support, public support, accumulation and application of technology and experience, development and innovation of technology, innovation and application of management system, organizational mode and structure, top management support, project culture, megaproject citizenship behavior, corporate reputation, and fulfillment of social responsibilities, were identified and grouped into five categories, namely, project environment, construction capabilities, organization, positive culture and behavior, and requirements for sustainable development. The contributions of this study lie in two aspects. First, the driving factors of successful megaproject construction are identified to deepen the understanding of industrial practitioners, assist them in focusing on key factors, and aid them in effectively managing megaprojects. Second, researchers could use the identified driving factors in conducting further empirical studies and apply them in future projects to enhance their chances of success.

Anticipated User Equity Impacts of a Proposed Transportation Infrastructure Finance Legislation: Case Study in Indiana	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							ROAD	State and city governments in the United States continue to emphasize user equity in all transportation policy areas, including project evaluation, finance, and operations. In 2016, the State of Indiana House of Representatives introduced House Bill (HB) 1002 in a bid to raise additional revenue for maintaining the state's road infrastructure. The bill included proposals to increase fuel tax rates and registration fees and implement new fees for alternative-fuel vehicles. As is the case with any new highway finance policy, it is important to project the efficiency and fairness of the proposed legislation. The Indiana Department of Transportation was tasked with forecasting the impact of HB-1002 on revenue generation and equity across the vehicle classes. This paper documents how the forecasts for vehicle use, revenue contribution, and costs incurred by vehicle class were developed by combining and synthesizing existing cost allocation, revenue attribution, and travel demand studies. The study found that HB-1002 would increase revenue by 55% and significantly reduce inequity across vehicle classes compared to the do-nothing scenario (the scenario in which HB-1002 was not adopted). It was found that in the do-nothing scenario, all vehicle classes, with the exception of Class 4 buses, were underpaying their cost responsibilities, whereas the adoption of HB-1002 was found to reduce this inequity greatly. The results of this case study can guide agencies to assess how changes in their road-user taxation and fee structures may impact not only revenue generation but also user equity.

J	Wang, LD				Wang, Long-de			Exploration of Strategies for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control and Relevant System Development in China	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						chronic disease prevention and control; strategy and system construction		Chronic non-communicable diseases have become a major threat to humanity. International studies have shown that of 57 million deaths worldwide in 2008, 36 million (63%) were caused by chronic non-communicable diseases; of these, 29 million (80%) occurred in low and middle income countries. The WHO predicts that if the current trend continues, the annual number of deaths due to chronic non-communicable diseases will increase to 55 million by 2030. Due to acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, along with population aging and rapid changes of people's lifestyle, the morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases are rapidly increasing in China. Therefore, dealing with the prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases has become one of the current major health issues for China to address. On the basis of summarizing the status of major chronic diseases in China, analyzing the key issues and key factors in chronic disease prevention and control, and reviewing and summarizing the experience from the previous projects, this paper proposes the following recommendations as strategies for chronic disease prevention and control and development of relevant system, which China should adopt. All relevant government departments should formulate corresponding policies; establish a coordinated and efficient work system with rational structure and clear division of tasks and responsibilities within the system. Implementation and development of "integrated medicine" in system is necessary. Work norms and requirements will then improve the performance and efficiency in chronic disease prevention and control in China.

J	Liu, HY; Subramanian, AM; Hang, CC				Liu, Hung-Yao; Subramanian, Annapoornima M.; Hang, Chang-Chieh			In Search of the Perfect Match: A Configurational Approach to Technology Transfer in Singapore	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology transfer; Commercialization; Information processing; Stakeholders; Bridges; Government; Uncertainty; Demand readiness level (DRL); information processing theory; multivalue qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA); public research institute (PRI); small and medium-sized enterprise (SME); technology readiness level (TRL); technology transfer		How do we match technology transfer sources to recipientsF In this paper, we approach this question by addressing gaps in two distinct streams of the literature. In the technology-transfer literature, the integrated pretransfer matching framework is in need of empirical validation, which calls for an empirical approach that can cope with its configurational, equifinal, causally asymmetric, and multinomial features. In the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) literature, the emerging variant multivalue QCA (mvQCA), one of the few techniques to tackle the above four features is in need of multivalue theory applications. Thus, these two seemingly unrelated literature hold the key to fill each others gap. To address the gaps, we leveraged the unique public research institute (PRI) to small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) transfer context in Singapore. We collected 188 responses from three stakeholders [i.e., research scientists and engineers, public research institutes (PRIs), and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)] who are involved in technology transfer. Our analysis suggested one necessary and six sufficient PRI-SME configurations that enhance the commercialization potential of the transferred technology. Furthermore, we identified three sufficient PRI-SME configurations that hinder the commercialization of technology transfer activities. Not only does our paper establishes the validity of pretransfer matching framework, but also introduces the mvQCA method to management scholars.

J	Facanha, C; Horvath, A				Facanha, Cristiano; Horvath, Arpad			Environmental Assessment of Logistics Outsourcing	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Environmental awareness is increasingly important to society, government, and industry, and there is a strong demand for sustainable development practices. The importance of supply chain management is critical, as it characterizes and influences the life cycles of all products. Within the major logistics trends, outsourcing has a significant potential to increase sustainability in the supply chain as third-party logistics providers (3PLs) focus on improving resource utilization and making processes more efficient. However, their motivation is largely economic, and an environmental perspective is rarely seen in 3PLs. As consumers demand greener alternatives and, subsequently, environmental regulatory measures are implemented, 3PLs will have to become more environmentally and socially aware in order to develop sustainability goals. This study compares two scenarios using life-cycle assessment (LCA): one where logistics functions are handled in-house, and an alternative scenario where such functions are outsourced to a 3PL. The impacts of logistics outsourcing on energy utilization, global warming potential, and fatalities are first quantified in the supply chain of an automobile. Even though vehicle operation, responsible for most of the impacts considered, is outside the domain of logistics functions, logistics outsourcing nonetheless has the potential to reduce energy use and global warming potential by 0.4-2% and fatalities by 0.8-3.3% throughout the entire life cycle of a typical automobile. Road and air transportation are found to account for most of the impacts in all selected metrics. Analyzing logistics outsourcing in the other sectors of the U. S. economy revealed the same trend as observed in the supply chain of an automobile.

J	Edirisinghe, R; Setunge, S; Zhang, G				Edirisinghe, Ruwini; Setunge, Sujeeva; Zhang, Guomin			Markov Model-Based Building Deterioration Prediction and ISO Factor Analysis for Building Management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Markov model; Deterioration prediction; ISO factors; Building performance	GAMMA PROCESS; RELIABILITY	While the Markov chain was successfully used for predicting the average condition of a network of assets under one influencing factor, incorporating the effect of a number of factors into a Markov chain model requires a separate analysis of each factor. In particular, modeling building deterioration is overly complicated due to the complexity in number and hierarchy of building components. The research study reported in this paper aims to combine the Markov chain with ISO factor method-based framework to offer a more reliable deterioration forecasting approach for buildings. This paper identifies major influencing factors for building deterioration. It investigates the ability to use Markov chain for deterioration modeling of a selected critical building component. The building condition inspection data from a local government agency in the State of Victoria, Australia, is used to calibrate a Markov deterioration model considering a number of influencing factors. To help demonstrate the concept, two factors influencing deterioration are considered in the analysis: outdoor environment and in-use condition. Validations of the models are undertaken using a subsequent inspection data set using Pearson's chi square test. A generic process for deriving Markov chain-based deterioration curves from discrete condition data incorporating factors influencing building deterioration is presented in this paper. Validated models and the method can be applied to reliably predict the deterioration of buildings with complex hierarchy, which gives a step change in building management.

National Culture Shapes Private Investment in Transportation Infrastructure Projects around the Globe	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable construction	IMPACT; VALUES; CONSEQUENCES	Recent decades have seen extensive use of public-private partnerships (PPP) in international infrastructure development from governments, private construction firms, and humanitarian organizations. Given the high social importance of civil infrastructure, considerable research attention has sought factors that lead to successful PPP. In a contribution to this body of work, and to the theory of the social sustainability of infrastructure, this paper presents statistical evidence showing that the choice of how to engage private investment in infrastructure is not culturally neutral. This analysis is built on a World Bank database of 1,792 railroad, seaport, airport, and toll road projects with private investment from 27 low- and middle-income nations and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Multinomial logistic regression shows that there are statistically significant relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the various methods used to enable private investment in infrastructure projects. For all transport project types aggregated together, high power distance index scores predict the use of private funds in projects involving the construction of new infrastructure, while high individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance scores predict the use of private funds in brownfield projects. Toll roads, which change a cultural norm regarding how most roads are accessed and paid for, emerged as a divergent technology type. Railroads are the technology type most strongly influenced by cultural dimensions. Engineers and policymakers may use these results to understand what forms of private investment in transportation infrastructure are more likely to be culturally acceptable in a wide variety of local contexts.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the capacity of risk allocation to encourage the implementation of environmental innovation, particularly sustainable energy innovation (SEI), within the private finance initiative (PFI) project delivery model. Design/methodology/approach - A four-case qualitative research methodology is adopted within the context of the UK government's building schools for the future programme. Findings - The findings identify that SEIs are encouraged on the innovative projects by the perceived clarity, appropriateness, and manageability of the risks associated with the project's energy performance on the PFI contract. The main SEIs were largely developed as strategies to manage long-term energy performance risks allocated to private sector actors and safeguard their long-term commitment to the project. However, the findings indicate that excessive perceived innovation-related risks, particularly capital cost risk, may restrict further SEIs to be implemented. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative case study approach adopted may limit the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications - The study and provides practical guidance to policymakers and project managers in developing strategies to support the implementation of SEI in PFI projects. Originality/value - The study attends to a significant gap in knowledge as there is a lack of conceptual and empirical work on managing innovative processes for sustainable energy in PFI projects.

The success of green construction projects is closely associated with the performance of project managers (PMs), while job satisfaction plays a major role in the performance of PMs. However, the emphasis placed on the job satisfaction of PMs in green construction projects remains minimal. The purpose of this paper is to identify the relationships between the job satisfaction of PMs and its key influencing factors in green construction projects, and to propose feasible strategies to improve the job satisfaction of PMs. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey is conducted, data collected from 105 construction PMs are analysed using structural equation modelling. Interviews with five industry experts are further conducted to substantiate the results. Findings The results identified four major components of job satisfaction, namely, "job content", "resource adequacy", "work context" and "the personality and competence of jobholders". The analysis also found that "technical requirement" and "split incentive" condition of green construction projects, "the expertise and awareness of PMs" and "demand and support from stakeholders" has significant impacts on PMs' job satisfaction. Furthermore, this study developed eight strategies to improve PMs' job satisfaction, including "increase recognition opportunities for PMs", "government incentives and financial support" and "introductory and training courses on green construction legislation and processes". Originality/value The findings assist construction companies in formulating measures to improve the job satisfaction and performance of PMs in green construction projects.

Several studies indicate that the DB project delivery system has advantages in project cost and schedule performance. Despite having comparative advantages, DB projects are found to be far from immune from cost overruns and schedule delay in those studies. It is critical to understand the effects of various factors underpinning the cost and schedule performance of DB projects. The overall objective of this research is to utilize cluster analysis and statistical analysis to identify factors with significant potentials to describe the variability of project cost and schedule performance in DB environment. Several control factors, such as evolving requirements from owners, unforeseen conditions, attributes of project teams, and major project characteristics were taken into account. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in innovative project delivery through empirical examination of underlying factors affecting project cost and schedule performance. The notable findings are (1) progressive DB is associated with the best cost performance, and its application could effectively reduce owner-directed changes; (2) project managers' experience, particularly the lack thereof, brings more variability to cost performance, while projects in the places with greater experience with completed projects show greater cost performance; (3) the effects of contract and procurement method on cost performance are significantly moderated by project and owner types; (4) unforeseen conditions are not necessarily related to cost performance; and (5) some unforeseen conditions (i.e., unforeseen inclement weather and unforeseen interruptions from government) are found to have statistically significant negative implications on schedule performance.

It is intended that this structure will orchestrate the various necessary actions, ranging from the identification of the complete organization's delivery scope, through to delivery disorders, activity structure, and the way in which these activities are to be managed. The current literature does not include a complete structure applicable to public service that can be widely used and with short learning time, such as the presented structure. Based on a business process management (BPM) cycle, the stages of planning, analysis, modeling, and optimization of processes were developed. In the planning phase, the typical activities of a sector responsible for the architecture and engineering projects and works of a public institution were identified and categorized, and possible dysfunctions were verified. Subsequently, analysis and modeling of the prioritized processes was performed, and finally, optimization and validation of the modeled processes were completed. The results obtained demonstrated that the proposal can be applied to seek improvements in public organizational environments regarding issues related to architecture and engineering projects and works through the management of their processes. Moreover, the lessons learned have indicated some common problems of the administrative units responsible for this type of activity that need to be addressed.

J	Gomez, J; Vassallo, JM				Gomez, Juan; Manuel Vassallo, Jose			Comparative Analysis of Road Financing Approaches in Europe and the United States	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Road funding; Road financing; Road taxation; United States; Europe; Gas tax	GASOLINE TAX; SYSTEM	Road infrastructure has a remarkable economic and social impact on society. This is why road financing has always drawn the attention of policymakers, especially when resources available for government spending become scarce. Nations exhibit differing approaches to dealing with road transportation financing. In the United States, the current system of road funding has been called into question because some regard it as insufficient to meet the amounts now required for road expenditures. By contrast, in most European countries, road charges are very high, but these revenues are not allocated for the funding of roads. This paper analyzes the balance between charging for the use of and expenditure on the road sector in the United States and compares the American policy with those of several European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Switzerland). To that end, a methodology is defined to calculate the annual amount of fee charges levied on light and heavy vehicles in the selected countries in order to compare those charges with annual road expenditures. The results show that road charges in America are noticeably lower than those paid in Europe. Additionally, the research concludes that in Europe, road-generated revenues exceed road expenditures in all the countries studied, so road charges actually subsidize other policies. By contrast, in the United States, the public sector subsidizes the road system in order to maintain the current level of expenditure. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted in three phases to identify and examine literature. A total of 68 papers were retrieved and were thoroughly reviewed to identify the drivers for e-procurement. Findings A total of 61 drivers were identified and subsequently developed into a categorization framework for synthesized understanding which reveals existing interrelationships. Although literature has consensus on some selected drivers, few studies have identified drivers relating to sustainability. Gaps were identified from the existing literature and directions for future research were proposed. Research limitations/implications Since this is a literature review, future research could conduct further investigations focusing on the research gaps identified. The framework developed presents a basis for further research to explore the drivers in various socio-economic environments. Practical implications This study provides valuable insights for improving the understanding of practitioners on the complex network of drivers for e-procurement. These findings stimulate discussions on benefits required for assessment in e-procurement adoption by practitioners. Originality/value This study provides the first comprehensive review of the drivers for e-procurement adoption in the construction industry, which was lacking in the existing body of knowledge.

J	Lin, CL; Tan, HL				Lin, Chien-Liang; Tan, Hai-Lin			Performance Measurement in the Public Sector: Example of the Building Administration Authorities in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Performance; Systems thinking; Data envelopment analysis; Social network analysis	EFFICIENCY; CONSTRUCTION; CENTRALITY; INNOVATION; NETWORKS	Modern government, if not well managed, cannot perform well in a pluralist society. Regarding the public administration performance of dealing with construction permits, Taiwan ranked last among the four little dragons in Asia. The primary objective of this study is to devise an innovative performance-measurement approach for the building administration authorities in Taiwan. Differences in performance and the underlying causes are further discussed. A two-stage study framework is adopted in this research. First, data-envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure the organizational and individual performance in the building administration authorities. Second, social-network analysis (SNA) is used to investigate the relations between an individual's centrality in the organization and their performance. There are three major findings of this work, as follows: (1)DEA can distinguish the effectiveness and efficiency of the individuals and work months in the building administration authorities, and the resulting analysis can be used to improve inefficient work months and individuals; (2)the results of SNA prove the positive relations between the organizational members' intrarelationships and their performance, and that individuals with higher centrality in the organization work more efficiently; and (3)cross efficiency and network centrality appear to be lowly correlated; thus further research is required to see if Chinese culture affected these results. The findings of this study can also be employed to effectively manage and allocate human resources and duties so as to strengthen organizational effectiveness and efficiency.

J	Kaliba, C; Muya, M; Mumba, K				Kaliba, Chabota; Muya, Mundia; Mumba, Kanyuka			Cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cost escalation; Schedule delays; Road construction industry; Zambia		The wealth of any nation is gauged by its performance in infrastructure provision through its construction industry. The construction industry is large, volatile, and requires tremendous capital outlays. For developing economies, road construction constitutes a major component of the construction industry. This means that much of the national budget on infrastructure development is channelled to road construction projects. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to identify causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. Using a detailed literature review, structured interviews and questionnaire surveys, the results of the study confirmed the prevalence of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects in Zambia. The study established that bad or inclement weather due to heavy rains and floods, scope changes, environmental protection and mitigation costs, schedule delay, strikes, technical challenges, inflation and local government pressures were the major causes of cost escalation in Zambia's road construction projects. On the other hand, delayed payments, financial processes and difficulties on the part of contractors and clients, contract modification, economic problems, materials procurement, changes in drawings, staffing problems, equipment unavailability, poor supervision, construction mistakes, poor coordination on site, changes in specifications and labour disputes and strikes were found to be the major causes of schedule delays in road construction projects. Appropriate project management practices are thus required to curb the causes and effects of cost escalation and schedule delays in road construction projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

It is one of the most important variables that need to be determined during the negotiation period. However, there are few methods available for calculating the value of this variable. Research described in this paper aims to develop a reliable, objective, and systematic model for determining a rational concession price for PPP highway projects based on pro forma financial statements developed during the feasibility study period. The pricing parameters and price risk factors of PPP highway project were first identified and compiled through a comprehensive literature review. A concession pricing model using System Dynamics technique was then developed based on concession pricing parameters and the effectiveness of the proposed SD-based concession pricing model was verified by a real toll tunnel project located in China. The test result shows that the proposed model is reliable, accurate, and suitable for the application by practitioners for concession price determination. To overcome the effect of risk factors on concession price, a pricing adjustment model using Case-base Reasoning (CBR) technique was proposed to consider the unquantifiable risk factors. It is believed that a rational and practical concession pricing model can create a 'win-win' situation for both the private investor and the host government. This research framework can also be used as a reference to study other facilities' pricing models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. PMA and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Causes of disputes, factors affecting dispute resolution and effective alternative dispute resolution for Sri Lankan construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Alternative dispute resolution; construction industry; disputes; Sri Lanka	ADJUDICATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS; BOARDS	Construction industry is typically vital to the economy of any country. It appears that on-going large-scale building and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have attracted numerous international contractors. Moreover, in Sri Lanka, there are several foreign investors, and to-be-funded mega government projects at their inception and initial stages, increasing competition which has already been fierce. However, these massive projects under various stakeholders with different interests usually initiate conflicting claims, if not resolved, will likely lead to disputes, and filing law suits. Once a dispute is crystallized, there are commonly used alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. However, the causes leading to the claims to form a dispute, and the effective ADR methods are largely dependent on the perspective of the stakeholders. This research aims to identifying those dispute causes, factors affecting the selection of dispute resolution methods, and the most effective ADR method in the perspective of different parties to construction projects in the Sri Lankan construction industry. First, an extensive literature review was carried out to identify the ADR context in Sri Lanka. Second, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted involving professionals representing various stakeholders such as contractors, clients and consultants. Survey responses were then analyzed using special purpose statistical software (SPSS). To determine the statistical significance difference among stakeholders' perception, Kruskal-Wallis H test was used with a 90% confidence level. This research thus provides additional insights into causes of claims and ADR selection from different perspectives.	[Illankoon, I. M. C.

Despite learning from defects being a frequent recommendation to reduce defects in the construction literature, there is scarce empirical evidence into how HAs actually learn from defects. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how HAs learn from past defects and induce change to reduce defects. Design/methodology/approach Guided by organisational learning (OL) as the theoretical lens, a 21-month action research (AR) project explored one HA's defects management and learning processes. Findings OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task which is reliant on a defects management team analysing defect data to identify priority areas. As such, learning from defects can be reduced due to peaks in workload if data analysis is a manual process. Furthermore, a dual learning approach plays a significant role for HA's learning consisting of designing out defects (codification) supported by networking (personalisation) to tackle issues of workmanship on site and those defects that cannot be designed out. Originality/value This study demonstrates OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task in HA's practice; and highlights the practical challenges of academia and industry co-production in AR in construction.

Design/methodology/approach - A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting the respondents for the study. These were experts working on various state housing construction projects in Ghana. Findings - Results from the study showed that the critical factors that contribute to project delays in Ghana are; delay in payment to contractor/supplier, inflation/price fluctuation, price increases in materials, inadequate funds from sponsors/clients, variation orders and poor financial/capital market. The critical effects of delays are cost overrun, time overrun, litigation, lack of continuity by client and arbitration. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to causes and effects of project delays in Ghana based on data collected from only one state institution. Due to geographic constraints the researchers were unable to sample state institutions across Ghana involved in various housing projects. Practical implications - This paper has documented the critical state housing construction project delay factors in Ghana. The results will help project managers and policymakers appreciate the effects of these delays on project outcomes. Social implications - Measures aimed at reducing cost of housing projects in Ghana can translate into significant benefits to the poor and support achievement of government objective of providing affordable housing to low income citizens. Originality/value - This research focussed on the key factors and best practices that lead to the success of state housing projects within the Ghanaian context.

J	Irizarry, J; Simonsen, KL; Abraham, DM				Irizarry, J; Simonsen, KL; Abraham, DM			Effect of safety and environmental variables on task durations in steel erection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In spite of the efforts by government agencies, labor organizations, and researchers in the field of health and safety, injuries and fatalities continue to affect the construction industry. In 2002 the construction industry had the undesirable distinction of having two of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with fatalities among structural steel workers at 58.2 per 100,000 workers (fourth highest rate) and among construction laborers at 27.7 per 100,000 workers (ninth highest rate). Costs associated with construction accidents, such as increased insurance premiums and medical expenses, and loss of productivity are also concerns in the industry. It has not been demonstrated how unsafe working conditions affect worker performance, and the impact of unsafe work practices on worker performance has not been quantified. This paper describes a methodology that included direct observation of steel erection activities and statistical analysis of task duration data. The data collected at steel erection sites included safety conditions such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), elevation of the work area, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, and worker performance in the form of task durations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis of 186 of steel erection task durations collected over a six-month period showed that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). the time of day during which the operation was being performed, the elevation at which the work was being performed, and the presence of decking below the work area had statistically significant effects on the durations of steel erection tasks.

This study is based on a mixed-method approach (Delphi and quantitative survey). The study revealed seven critical success factors of smart mobility. Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that factors like sustainable, innovative and safe transportation system, availability of ICT infrastructure, local accessibility of transportation infrastructure, availability of transportation infrastructure (bike, cycling, pedestrian mobility facilities), are the most significant smart mobility success factors. Also, a good consensus was achieved for all the success factors. The Mann Whitney test from the final Delphi result revealed no significant difference in the responses of the two groups of experts. Assessing the level of application of the smart mobility success factors revealed an abysmal application level according to the expert's opinion. This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it reveals the SM success factors that should be considered to achieve a sustainable smart mobility system in a city. The findings of this study will assist cities worldwide in developing smart mobility systems and further improve their competitive advantage. The study concludes that the evaluated success factors are significant in smart mobility systems development and application, based on expert's opinion. However, its level of adoption and application is still low in Nigeria. Therefore, it is recommended that the government and policy decision-makers in urban transportation infrastructure development should use the results from this study, as a scorecard to know lagging areas and factors that need significant improvement and application to achieve a smart mobility system.

The purpose of this paper is to calculate the workforce productivity changes of the US construction industry from 2006 to 2016, with the number of laborers as input and value of construction industry as output. Design/methodology/approach The present study introduced the data envelopment analysis (DEA) based Malmquist productivity index model to measure the workforce productivity of the US construction industry from 2006 to 2016. Findings The results indicated that the workforce productivity of the US construction industry experienced a continuous decline, except for the increases from 2011 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015. It was also shown that there were gaps in the workforce productivity development level among all states and nine regions in the US construction industry. Besides, the relationship between workforce productivity and four aspects, including real estate price, workforce, climate distribution and economic factors, was analyzed. Research limitations/implications The calculation of the productivity of the US construction industry is based on the premise that the external environment is fixed and unchanged from 2006 to 2016, but the multi-level DEA model for further calculation is required for obtaining more effective conclusions. Social implications This paper measures the workforce productivity of the US construction industry over the past 11 years, which added latest analysis and knowledge into the construction industry, providing decision-makers with advice and data support to formulate policies to improve workforce productivity. Originality/value This study provided both government decision-makers and industrial practitioners with important macro background environment information, which will facilitate the improvement of workforce productivity in the construction industry in different regions of the US.

J	Loosemore, M				Loosemore, Martin			Construction Innovation: Fifth Generation Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Innovation; Model; Fifth generation; Construction		Despite what many researchers, governments, and commentators say, there is a considerable amount of innovation that occurs in the construction industry. Negative opinions of construction innovation are often misinformed by data and methodologies designed to measure innovation in other sectors and by a misunderstanding of the realities of innovation in the construction industry. A theoretical model of innovation in construction is developed on the basis of fifth-generation innovation research. Through interviews with 58 thought leaders from across the Australian and United Kingdom construction industries, this model is contrasted with what happens in practice to refine a model of innovation that can form the conceptual basis for future research. The findings support but also contrast many aspects of the mainstream innovation literature around fifth-generation innovation. In particular, ideas around systemizing innovation do not sit comfortably with the way that innovation happens in practice in the construction industry. The organization of innovation in construction is a dynamic process that needs to move in response to the different stages of the construction process, starting with an organic approach in early design and tender stages and moving to a more systematic approach during the delivery phase, in which tight budgets and programs demand great discipline. Innovation late on occurs in response to problems rather than in anticipation of opportunities early on and demands a different management approach. Findings also support the crucial role of clients in construction innovation but suggest that most clients care little about this and do not have the tools to assess innovation in bids. There is a fundamental contradiction here that undermines respondents' preferences for market-led rather than regulation-led innovation, which needs further exploration.

J	Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ				Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ			Industry-centric benchmarking of information technology benefits, costs and risks for small-to-medium sized enterprises in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						benchmarking; benefits; construction; costs; evaluation; IT; risks; SMEs	SYSTEM	The evaluation of information technology (IT) is a perennial problem for businesses as they seek to improve their performance and sustain a competitive advantage. While businesses are increasing their expenditure on technology to keep abreast of competitors, organisations in the construction industry have become 'technological laggards'. Both the Federal and State Governments in Australia have recognized the pivotal role that IT can play in improving industry performance and consequently firms are being, encouraged to embrace IT. In obtaining performance improvements, the benefits, costs and risks of IT should be identified and subsequently managed and controlled. Yet, there is an absence of anchor measures that managers can confidently employ to monitor the performance of their IT investments. This paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey that sought to determine the benefits, costs and risks of IT investments from 126 small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Australian construction industry. The questionnaire findings revealed three key findings. First, different organisation types significantly differ in the amount they invest in IT but this is not influenced by firm size (i.e., in terms of turnover and number of employees). Secondly, strategic benefits vary with different organisation types. Third, the way in which employees adapt to change as a result of IT implementation differs with firm size. Based upon the reported findings a series of benchmark metrics for benefits, costs and risks of IT were propagated. These metrics can serve as a reference point for initiating benchmarking, which should form an integral component of the IT evaluation and learning process. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

One of these approaches is to leverage the value of emerging information technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architectural design. Leveraging these potentials requires promoting an appropriate context for the implementation and adoption of these new technologies. In response to the turbulent and multifaceted socio-technical nature of modern information technologies and the environmental uncertainty, architects enhance enablers to advance the architectural design process. Enablers are the preeminent factors that facilitate the implementation of new technologies and contribute to the sustainable development of projects and organizations. Given the lack of dedicated studies on the enablers affecting BIM application, this study aims to identify and classify these enablers in the architectural design phase. Following a systematic literature review approach, a comprehensive list of enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase was identified. The prepared survey questionnaire was distributed to 205 construction experts (i.e. project managers, employers, consultants, and contractors). The collected data were analyzed with the Robust Exploratory Factor Analysis method, ended up with classifying 36 enablers into four main categories: human skills, environmental, technological, and organizational factors. The findings of this study, considering the organizational enablers, recommend that the support of government officials to implement a particular validation process for BIM adoption is crucial. The contribution of this research lies in identifying and classifying enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase, with the potentials to be applied in real work practices to improve BIM capabilities and enhance BIM initiatives in construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method systematic review that integrates quantitative and qualitative analysis was adopted. The bibliographic data were extracted from the Scopus database, and a scientometric analysis was conducted to analyse the data quantitatively. Qualitative content analysis is then presented, which provided a basis for mapping out trends and gaps in current knowledge. Findings It is observed that there has been a rise in the number of studies on bioclimatic architecture over the last two decades. Past studies have focused on sustainability, building performance simulation, building climatology and energy use, solar energy applications and passive cooling. Artificial intelligence, algorithm coupling and acoustic comfort were some of the emerging areas discovered in this study. Research limitations/implications The study reveals research gaps that researchers can investigate. Practical implications The information provided can help the building industry stakeholders in decision-making. It serves as a guideline for maximising the potential benefits of adopting bioclimatic designs in the building industry. Furthermore, it provides references that aid policy formulation for government agencies and corporate organisations. Originality/value The study fills the literature gap caused by the need for a holistic literature review that relates bioclimatic architecture and its energy efficiency implications. It is also the first study on bioclimatic architecture that adopts a mix of scientometric and qualitative analysis for analysing past studies on bioclimatic architecture.

J	Tang, WB; Cui, QB; Zhang, FL; Chen, Y				Tang, Wenbin; Cui, Qingbin; Zhang, Feilian; Chen, Yan			Urban Rail-Transit Project Investment Benefits Based on Compound Real Options and Trapezoid Fuzzy Numbers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Urban rail transit; Investment benefits; Compound real options; Trapezoid fuzzy numbers	VALUATION; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY; SELECTION; MONEY; MODEL	A long investment cycle and complex environmental changes bring lots of uncertainty to urban rail-transit (URT) project investment, and lead to many investment risks. However, investors' aggressive flexible management strategies may effectively avoid the risks and create greater investment benefits. In order to scientifically evaluate the potential benefits brought from flexible management, this paper systematically builds an analysis framework for investment benefits evaluation based on real options theory. Previous studies have still been confined to the single option benefits measurement and the evaluation methods assume that expected investment cost and income were constant. To fill the gap, this study takes account of the interaction effects of several real options and uses fuzzy theory to relax some parameter hypotheses, then establishes a multiple-fold compound real-option benefits evaluation model based on trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Another contribution of this paper is that it provides a clear modeling approach for estimating the parameters of investment benefits volatility and discount rate by using historical open data in the financial market. A case study of the Changsha Metro Line 2 in China is discussed, and the empirical analysis shows that option benefits account for a large proportion of the entire investment returns. Moreover, the compound option benefits are about five times of the single option, so the implied option benefits, especially the compound option benefits, should not be ignored in the measurement of the URT project, and investors should be encouraged to actively implement flexible management strategies. Finally, this paper makes a sensitivity analysis of compound option benefits, and provides a basis for effectively reducing the government's subsidies and achieving profitability of URT project investment.

Strategies for Improving Safety and Health of Ethnic Minority Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety and health; Safety management strategies; Ethnic minorities; Hong Kong; Labor and personnel issues	DELPHI; MANAGEMENT	The construction industries of developed countries are faced with an aging workforce and a shortage of recruits. It is common for migrant workers/ethnic minorities (EMs) who are already part of the society to join the construction industry. With increasing involvement of EMs in the construction industry, effective strategies for improving their safety and health are urgently needed. The existing body of knowledge is mainly derived from research conducted in English-speaking countries with Western cultures. Research on safety of migrant/EM construction workers in multidialect Asian countries with Eastern cultures has been lacking. This study aimed to identify various strategies for improving the safety and health of EM construction workers from the Asian perspective. Twenty-two face-to-face semistructured interviews were performed with safety professionals in Hong Kong followed by two rounds of Delphi survey with 18 safety experts to verify the interview findings and rank the relative importance of the strategies. The study unveiled 14 strategies for improving the safety performance of EM workers. The three most important ones identified were (1)to provide safety training in EM native languages, (2)that government and industry associations should play an active role in promoting health and safety awareness of EM workers, and (3)to encourage EM workers to learn the local language. This study contributes to filling the research gap by evaluating the strategies for improving safety of migrant/EM construction workers in Asian countries with Eastern cultures in which English is not the first language. Research findings would assist occupational health and safety experts and relevant stakeholders in designing strategies for improving the safety and health of EM workers, which will ultimately improve overall safety performance of the construction industry.

J	Aldaghlas, H; Hui, FKP; Duffield, CF				Aldaghlas, Haya; Hui, Felix Kin Peng; Duffield, Colin Fraser			Initiation of capital projects in industries having an operational focus: an Australian stevedoring case example	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project initiation; Project delivery culture; Thematic analysis; Project management framework; Qualitative observation; Case study	MANAGEMENT	Purpose The initiation phase of capital projects is critical as this is where the highest number of options exist for modifying the project with minimal expenditure. Government and large organisations frequently involved in major capital projects have extensive procedures for this phase, yet organisations having an operational focus (like major container terminal stevedores), that only occasionally undertake capital projects face the dilemma of the trade-off between project planning and the management of operations. This research reported in this paper investigated the impact of industry operational considerations on the initiation of capital projects. Design/methodology/approach In addition to an extensive literature review, a living research investigation of real projects initiated by a stevedoring company operating in Australia has been observed; the primary author of this paper spent six months as a participant/observer and witnessed the initiation of 12 capital projects. The collected data was qualitatively analysed using a four-step coding method. Findings The findings confirm that project initiation is a challenge for organisations who only spasmodically undertake capital projects and available project management frameworks do not necessarily consider the impact of such an organisation's culture. Issues identified that may have a negative impact on the initiation phase include lack of workplace trust, high individualism, ineffective interdepartmental communication, lack of resources and engineering and safety complexity. Originality/value The study investigated an underexplored industry within the context of project initiation, using the Australian stevedoring as a case study. This initial investigation suggests that a tailored project management framework is needed for the initiation phase of projects to reflect the unique nature of the stevedoring industry and by inference other industries that have a strong operational focus.

However, complex, dynamic, and project-based nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties in achieving benefits of Lean implementations (i.e., improvements in the schedule, budget, safety, and quality). The major objective of this study is to propose a comprehensive success model for Lean implementation in the construction industry. Within this context, a set of success criteria are identified based on extensive literature research, and the criteria set are classified into seven categories namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication. Then, an analytical network process (ANP) model is developed in order to reveal the links between the attributes of success while computing the importance weights of these attributes by the expert team of five. Data used for the ANP model are collected from eight experienced civil engineers through a questionnaire administered in two parts. Delphi method was adopted in the questionnaire administration, where several rounds of questionnaires were sent to the group of experts. Lean training, availability of Lean tools and techniques and market share were found as the most important success factors of Lean implementation. The performance of the proposed model is tested on six different construction projects and the results were evaluated to validate the ANP model. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners and Engineering Managers with overcoming challenges in Lean implementation process and guide them about success parameters to consider and prioritize tasks when implementing Lean in their organizations.

Developing a building information modeling-based performance management system for public-private partnerships	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPPs; Performance management; Building information modeling (BIM); Web-BIM; Cloud; Database	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PPP PROJECTS; BIM; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; DESIGN; RISK; LIFE; INTEROPERABILITY; INFRASTRUCTURE	Purpose Effective performance management (PM) in public-private partnership (PPP) projects is critical to realizing value for money (VFM). This study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of problems existing in PPP PM and possible avenues for improvement, presenting an experimental system to verify that building information modeling (BIM) and other information communication technologies can improve PPP PM. Design/methodology/approach The mixed research method adopted in this study combined empirical research with experimental research. Semistructured interviews were used to ascertain the current situation of PPP PM with the help of Nvivo software. A BIM-based performance management system (BPMS), which combines BIM with Web and Cloud technology, was then constructed to achieve performance monitoring, performance measurement, and performance-based payment. Finally, a case study was introduced to explain the function application of the proposed system. Findings The case demonstration verified is found to verify that the developed BIM-based execution framework for PPP PM can effectively guide stakeholders toward achieving mixed PM, promote effective PM, and improve work efficiency with the support of BIM and other information and communication technologies. Originality/value Through the development of a BPMS for PPP projects, the effectiveness and efficiency of PM are improved. Practical PM applications are also provided to different stakeholders, through which the key performance indicators and the behaviors of the government and private-sector partners can be monitored to form a more comprehensive and reasonable PM mechanism and promote the realization of VFM in PPP projects.

Safety Management in Repair, Maintenance, Minor Alteration, and Addition Works: Knowledge Management Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety; Knowledge management; Repair and maintenance; Hong Kong	CONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATIONS; HONG-KONG	Safety of repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition (RMAA) works have long been neglected because RMAA works are often minute and only last for a short period of time. With rising importance of the RMAA sector in many developed societies, safety of RMAA works has begun to draw attention. Many RMAA contracting companies are small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that do not have comprehensive safety management systems. Existing safety legislation and regulations for new construction sites are not fully applicable to RMAA works. Instead of relying on explicit and well-established safety systems, tacit safety knowledge plays an extremely important role in RMAA projects. To improve safety of RMAA works, safety knowledge should be better managed. However, safety knowledge is difficult to capture in RMAA works. This study aims to examine safety management practices of RMAA contracting companies to see how safety knowledge of RMAA projects is managed. Findings show that RMAA contracting companies undertaking large-scale RMAA projects have more initiatives of safety management. Safety management of small-scale RMAA works relies heavily on the motivation of site supervisors and self-regulation of workers. Better tacit knowledge management improves safety performance. To enhance safety capability of RMAA contracting companies, a knowledge sharing culture should be cultivated. The government should provide assistance to SMEs to implement proper safety management practices in small-sized projects. Potentials of applying computer software technology in RMAA projects to capture, store, and retrieve safety information should be explored. Employees should be motivated to share safety knowledge by giving proper recognition to those who are willing to share. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Hon, Carol. K.

J	Oke, AE				Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel			Bonding capability of Nigerian contracting firms	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Guarantee; Bond; Contracting firm; Project stakeholder	CONSTRUCTION; IMPACT	Purpose The ability of construction contractors to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors depends on capital, experience, capacity and continuity. Using these criteria, the purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the bonding capacity of Nigerian contractors. Design/methodology/approach Factors required for bonding were examined based on a set of questions addressed to managers of contracting firms and personnel involved in issuing bonds and guarantees in commercial banks and insurance companies. The scorecard approach was employed to determine the bonding capability of the contractors. Findings Contractors' financial strength and past performance on previous projects are the two important factors considered by guarantors in granting bond to contractors. However, the condition surrounding the bond, the legal capacity of the guarantor to issue bond and the identity of the guarantor are mostly considered by contractors in approaching a potential guarantor. Using the scorecard approach, about one-third of contractors have the necessary requirements to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors. This ability of contractors is affected by years of experience of the firm but not by their location nor years of experience of their manager. Practical implications It is necessary for contracting firms to increase their capital base through merging, borrowing, etc., and also engage experienced professionals and workers in the execution of construction projects, as this will eventually improve their bonding ability. Social implications The study is limited to construction contractors registered with Ondo and Lagos State Governments and guarantors that are banks and insurance companies in Nigeria. Originality/value The paper specified various areas of concerns for Nigerian contracting firms in their bid to enhance their bonding ability. This will help them in overcoming various challenges and bottlenecks that may arise in securing bonds and guarantees from guarantors.

J	Shrestha, PP; Mani, N				Shrestha, Pramen P.; Mani, Nirajan			Impact of Design Cost on Project Performance of Design-Bid-Build Road Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design-bid-build; Design cost; Total cost growth; Construction schedule growth	NUMBER	The vast majority of highway and street projects in the United States are procured and constructed by state or local governments using the design-bid-build (DBB) project delivery method. In the DBB method, the contractors build the project according to the detailed design and specifications prepared by the engineers. Using the DBB method, the quality of design has an impact on the construction performance. To date, only a few studies have measured the effect of design cost on the project performance of the road projects. In order to determine the impact of design cost on construction cost and schedule performance, this paper analyzes a sample of 47 Clark County public road projects of Nevada and 17 road projects of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The sample includes projects completed between 1991 and 2009, and cost more than $3.43billion in construction value, converted to a 2010 base cost. Besides determining the impact of design cost on the cost and schedule growth of the road projects, this study also determines a correlation between the design cost percentage and the final project cost of the projects. The analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the design cost percentage and the total cost growth of the project. In addition, the design cost percentage was found to have a strong negative correlation with the final project cost for this sample. The t-test showed that the design cost percentage of road projects that have total cost growth less than or equal to zero was significantly higher than that for road projects that have a total cost growth higher than zero.

J	Zhang, YT; Tsai, CH; Liao, PC				Zhang, Yating; Tsai, Chung-Han; Liao, Pin-Chao			Rethinking Risk Propagation Mechanism in Public-Private Partnership Projects: Network Perspective	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure; Public-private partnership project; Social network analysis; Interrelated risk	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; WATER-SUPPLY PROJECTS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; PPP; MITIGATION; ACCIDENTS; SYSTEM; CHINA; TRUST	A large portion of public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in China have ceased without delivery, which has drawn attention to the need for effective risk management. Previous studies directly and/or independently correlated risks with consequences. This does not allow for an effective investigation of causal chain and propagation effects among risks. To address this research gap, this paper developed a risk network model to analyze risk interactions and their propagation mechanism in PPP infrastructure projects. A case study of a PPP water supply project in China highlighted the key risks and mitigation actions. The study showed that policy change is frequently a source of risk, government default is profoundly affected by other risks, and safety accidents are one of the critical risks leading to project failure, which previous studies have overlooked. Furthermore, PPP stakeholders should focus on decoupling the following risks to reduce the probability of PPP project failure: safety accidents caused by lack of managing/organizational ability, and safety accidents caused by insufficient/delayed financing. The results indicated that the risk network model can be applied in PPP risk analysis to identify unnoticed but pivotal risks with propagation effects. This paper contributes to the research on PPP project risk management in three ways. First, it encourages both theorists and practitioners to consider PPP risk management as a dynamic, nonlinear process. Second, it illuminates critical risks and propagation mechanisms that have been overlooked by previous studies, thereby supplementing the body of knowledge on PPP project governance/management. Additionally, it proposes effective mitigation actions within risk management practice, thus laying the foundation for management and governance strategies.

J	Miles, SB; Jagielo, N; Gallagher, H				Miles, Scott B.; Jagielo, Nora; Gallagher, Hannah			Hurricane Isaac Power Outage Impacts and Restoration	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac made landfall twice in Louisiana. Cumulatively, over 1 million customers lost electricity as a result of the hurricane, some for more than 10 days. As a disaster, Hurricane Isaac is relatively unique because of the opportunity to largely isolate impacts and decisions directly associated with the electricity outage and restoration from cascading impacts related to direct flood or wind damage. Louisiana emergency managers, business representatives, and public officials were interviewed to develop and analyze a case study of the outage and restoration event. Interviewees were asked about (1) the significant impacts from the outage, (2) what (if any) lasting effects would result from the outage, (3) the relative performance of power restoration, (4) the effectiveness of communication between stakeholders, and (5) factors influencing the public and political perception of restoration performance. Other collected data included content from news media, government documents, press releases, situation reports, and publicly available quantitative data. Results suggest that there were few long-term impacts from the outage, and restoration performance was not unusually slow. Even so, the electricity service provider was the subject of vocal criticism. The findings of the case study highlight the importance of all aspects of communication and awareness raising before, during, and after power outages, as well as further research to facilitate this. The study reinforces the need to improve power continuity using a wide range of technical, political, and organizational strategies. Research and policy development is particularly needed for improving continuity of transportation, health care facilities, and gasoline provision. Understanding of the sociotechnical role of electricity outages within broader disaster contexts can only be improved through further interdisciplinary research.

To explore the patterns of unsafe behaviors and promote accident prevention, a comparative analysis is conducted to analyze the behavioral risk chains of accidents for these two construction types in the Chinese construction industry using complex network (CN) theory. First, accident cases are collected from government websites, and unsafe behaviors are extracted and classified according to a summary list of several safety standards and operating procedures. Second, behavioral risk chain networks of accidents (BRCNAs) for the two construction types are established as directed networks. Pajek, a program for visualizing and analyzing large networks, is then used to construct network models. Finally, the topological parameters of the BRCNAs are calculated and compared. The results show that BRCNAs are both scale-free and small-world networks. The characteristics of the building construction BRCNA are related to individual workers, and the characteristics of the urban railway construction BRCNA are related to the working environment and supervisors. However, there are certain unsafe behaviors that play an important role in accidents in both construction types. These findings reveal the variations in interactions among unsafe behaviors that cause accidents in the two construction types to further understand the patterns of unsafe behaviors. This study is of theoretical and practical significance for improving accident causation models and supporting on-site safety management in the construction industry.

However, little is known about the factors contributing to NVA BIM implementation practices from different stakeholders' viewpoints. This study aims to identify the leading contributors to NVA BIM implementation activities in BIM-based building project delivery in Singapore, compare perceptions among stakeholders with different roles, firm sizes, and BIM implementation experience, and propose strategies for NVA implementation activity reduction. An extensive literature review and a pilot study were conducted to determine causes. The results of a questionnaire survey, statistical analyses, and four postsurvey interviews found that all 49 causes categorized by major stakeholders were critical. Among the most influential causes were "design models do not fit for intended downstream uses" (for architect/engineers) and "design changes are expensive once fabrication has commenced" (for manufacturer/supplier). The subgroup analysis indicated that contractors, especially those of small to medium size, perceived that the leading causes related to consultancy firms' reluctance to enhance design-construction integration and consider incremental changes, whereas stakeholders without much BIM practical experience probably underestimated the difficulties of conducting value-adding BIM diffusion activities. This study extends the concept of NVA activities to BIM implementation and recommends management strategies for each project role to implement BIM-based collaborative practices. The findings enable practitioners to better understand BIM diffusion and reduce their NVA BIM implementation activities for enhanced construction productivity.

J	Wang, ZX; Liu, JY; Guan, XY				Wang, Zhixiu; Liu, Junying; Guan, Xinya			Investigating the causal complexity of corruption in project-based organizations: a scenario analysis of bidding activity in the Chinese construction sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Organizational corruption; Construction sector; Configuration effect; Scenario survey	ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING; MORAL INTENSITY; BRIBERY; CHOICE; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; CONTEXT; DESIGN; PHASE; CSR	Purpose Although the global construction industry has made great contributions to economic development, industry corruption is a challenge for governments all over the world. This paper aims to investigate the causal complexity of organizational corruption by exploring the configuration effect of multiple induced conditions of corruption in the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach This study is focused on bribery, a specific form of corrupt behavior through a scenario-based survey role-playing game in which participants encounter bribery. A total of 400 Chinese construction sector participants were randomly recruited to complete this survey. Findings Compared with studies that have identified a number of factors associated with corruption in the construction sector, this study found asymmetry and complexity in the causality of organizational corruption. That is, when a variable causing corruption changes from one condition to its opposite - for example, from fierce to mild competition - the degree of corruption is not necessarily reduced as one may expect. Practical implications Anti-corruption measures should not rely solely on the net effects of discrete conditions and the interactions between multiple factors should not be ignored. In other words, anti-corruption strategies should not be implemented in isolation of their context, and pairing control measures with configurations is critical in controlling corruption. Finally, multiple configuration paths should be reconsidered when considering the degree of corruption reduction. Originality/value This study proposes a comprehensive analysis framework for addressing organizational corruption in the construction sector by investigating configuration effects of multiple induced conditions and offers a useful method for addressing corruption.

However, previous literature draws attention to distressed or failed PPP projects due to significant risks. In the quest for assessing risks and estimating the performance at the outset of a project, there is a need for a practical tool allowing in-depth analysis of the project conditions. This paper aims to develop a PPP Canvas which enables assessment of the project risk factors and determining the related compensation mechanisms that can be used to mitigate these risks or allocate them to the parties in a balanced way. The Canvas also helps to estimate a project performance score based on the significance coefficients determined by the Analytical Hierarchy Process. AHP results show that stability of economic environment, political support and government intervention are the most important risk factors in the local context. AHP can be repeated for each specific PPP project, as part of the PPP Canvas process, to foster discussion and analysis of the risks and compensation mechanisms across different geographical locations and PPP project types. The paper adds a new dimension to PPP risk assessment by making use of the Business Model Canvas approach and the inclusion of contractual compensation and penalty mechanisms. As the stakeholders become more informed of the project conditions and the risks involved, they can make better decisions throughout the project life-cycle and can benefit from the identified compensation mechanisms in contract drafting.

The database is branded as WATERiD and can be accessed through internet. Water infrastructure in the United States is aging poorly and municipal governments are struggling to find easy access to comprehensive information about achieving sustainability of their water infrastructure such as condition assessment, renewal engineering, subsurface utility engineering, best management practices, and cost of technologies. There are more than 50,000 water/wastewater utilities in the United States and no two utilities are alike. However, the lessons learned by a utility in the application of the commonly available technologies can be used as knowledge by other utilities. Because there was previously no easily accessible platform through which successful experiences and lessons learned could be shared, common mistakes including unnecessary change of orders are frequently repeated in different locations. The WATERiD database is enabling utilities to share their experiences and lessons learned, and is a single-point information center where all the relevant information about water-infrastructure sustainability can be found. To collect lessons learned and utility experience, more than 100 utilities throughout the United States and 30 additional international utilities were contacted. The data from utilities are compiled, taxonomically classified, and uploaded into WATERiD for sharing between the utilities. This paper describes a process for developing the database including database architecture, database-critical functionalities such as upload and categorization, and future development work. Sustaining and building upon the foundational WATERiD resources will continue to take the cooperation of utilities, organizations, and professionals from across the water-infrastructure industry.

J	Zhu, LY; Cheung, SO				Zhu, Liuying; Cheung, Sai On			Harvesting Competitiveness through Building Organizational Innovation Capacity	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Organizational competitiveness; Organizational innovation capacity; Impact	MANAGEMENT; CULTURE; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY	The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by the Chinese government promotes globalization through the integration of emerging economies within the region. The market of infrastructural developments so derived is attractive for international construction organizations, including those in China. Moreover, these developments are complex technically, culturally, and even politically. Fierce competition among international contracting organizations can be expected. Although price competition is common in construction contracting, increasing competitiveness through cost-cutting is no longer a sustainable strategy. Cutthroat pricing may provide a short-term edge in bidding, but increasing competitiveness through innovation will provide the determining advantages in these BRI projects. To engender innovation, an organization must first have the capacity to do so. It is therefore proposed that organizational competitiveness (OC) can be harvested through building organizational innovation capacity (OIC). This proposition was tested with data collected from 102 construction professionals and using structural equation modeling (SEM). A positive correlation was found in this OC-OIC relationship. It was further found that core competence is the powerhouse of OC. The adoption of appropriate company strategies and project performance were also found to be significant components. For OIC, the results show that the ability to learn, manage information, foster entrepreneurship through appropriate human resource management policies, and cultivate innovation culture are key contributors. These findings and the suggestions derived there from were further explored in a reflective study of an organization with notable innovations. It was concluded that manifesting these OIC building strategies will enhance OC and enable organization to better meet the challenges of the international construction markets. Thus, this paper also provides suggestions on how to put these strategies into practice. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Therefore, the Chinese government launched the National Air Pollution Control Plan (hereinafter referred to as the "Air Plan") in 2013-2017 to improve air quality and safeguard public health. In this study, an analytical framework for a cost-benefit analysis applicable to China was constructed, and the costs and benefits of the implementation of the "Air Plan" in 30 cities and provinces in China from 2013 to 2017 were evaluated. Results show that the total cost of implementation of the "Air Plan" is 1.6511 trillion RMB. The benefits of air quality improvement were determined to be 2.4691 trillion RMB through the willingness-to-pay method to calculate the economic loss of premature deaths. The net benefit related to the implementation of the "Air Plan" was 818 billion RMB. The public health benefit of air quality improvement was 1.5 times the cost of the nationwide implementation of the "Air Plan". At the provincial level, net benefits that reach 279.3 billion RMB were the highest in Guangdong, whereas the benefit-cost ratio, where the benefit was 5.5 times the cost, was the highest in Fujian. Estimations in this study can serve as a reference for China in formulating similar environmental policies and implementing the "3-year Plan to Defend the Blue Sky". In addition, these estimations have practical significance for advancing the long-term effective mechanisms of the cost-benefit analysis of China's environmental policies.

Design/methodology/approach The level of knowledge and adoption of VM practices, as well as the barriers to its adoption in the construction industry were assessed through a survey design. Construction professionals were sampled from the six geo-political zones in Nigeria through the use of a structured questionnaire. Factor analysis was conducted on data gathered on the barriers of VM. Findings The study revealed a moderate level of knowledge of VM among construction professionals. This implies that the problem of VM is not that of awareness, but readiness to adopt the system. The study also reveals that the barriers to the adoption of VM can be categorised under the general stakeholder's barriers, training and education barriers, client barriers and government/top management barriers. Practical implications This study was conducted across the six geo-political zones of the country as against common practice of selecting a particular region or states to represent the entire country. The findings therefore show a true reflection of the barriers to VM adoption in the country and its recommendations can to a large extent promote the adoption of VM in the country and also other developing countries where construction projects are executed through similar method, style and approach. Originality/value This paper highlights the possible barriers to the adoption of VM in Nigeria construction industry and provides ways to avoiding these barriers in order to achieve better quality construction and value for money.

J	Gledson, BJ; Greenwood, D				Gledson, Barry J.; Greenwood, David			The adoption of 4D BIM in the UK construction industry: an innovation diffusion approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Diffusion; Planning; Construction planning; Building information Modelling (BIM); 4D planning	PROJECTS; CAD; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; INFORMATION; DESIGN; COORDINATION; OVERRUNS; MEETINGS	Purpose - British construction industry KPI data collected over recent years shows a trend in projectsexceeding their time schedules. In 2013, the UK Government set a target for projects timeframes to reduce by 50 per cent. Proposed interventions included more rapid project delivery processes, and consistent improvements to construction delivery predictions, deployed within the framework of 4D Building Information Modelling (BIM). The purpose of this paper is to use Rogers' Innovation Diffusion theory as a basis to investigate how this adoption has taken place. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 97 construction planning practitioners were surveyed to measure 4D BIM innovation take-up over time. Classic innovation diffusion research methods were adopted. Findings - Results indicated an increasing rate of 4D BIM adoption and reveal a time lag between awareness and first use that is characteristic of this type of innovation. Research limitations/implications - Use of a non-probability sampling strategy prevents the results being generalisable to the wider construction population. Future research directions and methods are suggested, including qualitative investigations into decision-making processes around 4D BIM, and case studies exploring the consequences of 4D BIM adoption. Practical implications - Recommendations of how to facilitate the adoption of 4D BIM innovation are proposed, which identify the critical aspects of system compatibility and safe trialling of the innovation. Originality/value - This paper reinforces 4D BIM as an innovation and records its actual UK industry adoption rate using an accepted diffusion research method. By focusing on UK industry-wide diffusion the work also stands apart from more typical research efforts that limit innovation diffusion exploration to individual organisations.

J	Daniels, MP; Pate-Cornell, ME				Daniels, Matthew P.; Pate-Cornell, Marie-Elisabeth			Risk-Based Comparison of Consolidated and Distributed Satellite Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Architecture; consolidated; distributed constellation; dynamic decision process; satellites	SPACE-SHUTTLE; FRAMEWORK; FLEXIBILITY; TILES	Governments and large private satellite operators face a strategic decision for multipayload satellite programs: whether to use large consolidated satellites with multiple payloads or constellations of a few smaller spacecraft (here a "distributed" system). One advantage of the latter is that it allows faster replacement of failed payloads and more efficient insertion of new technologies. The costs and the benefits of each option are a function of a myriad of uncertain factors, including the sequence of decisions that have to be made during the lifetime of the program. We present a general model based on decision and risk analysis to support the choice between these two satellite architectures for a long-term program in Earth's orbit. This model is built on probabilistic risk analysis of satellite vehicles and includes the operational decisions that may have to be made later, such as the construction and launch of new satellites, either because one fails or because a new technology has become available. The value of each architecture is based on that of the data that the satellite system provides when it is operated according to an optimal policy. We compute the value of each satellite architecture, reflecting the uncertainties involved and the decision maker's risk attitude in optimal management decisions. This model thus yields the sensitivity of both satellite architecture and operational decisions to factors such as risk aversion and the anticipated rate of technology advancement. We find that in many circumstances, more risk-averse decision makers may prefer distributed satellite architectures and the flexibility that they provide, even at a potentially higher initial cost. We also show that distributed systems tend to be preferred when the payload technology is expected to improve rapidly over time.

J	Duncan, J				Duncan, J			Performance-based building: lessons from implementation in New Zealand	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building codes; governance; innovation; performance; performance-based regulation; regulation; New Zealand		New Zealand was an early adopter of a performance-based building code in 1992. The subsequent lessons learned from its implementation strategy are examined. Performance-based codes have decided advantages, but need careful implementation to capture these advantages. There are particular problems where the building code does not use specific numerical levels as the basis for mandatory performance requirements. A small fraction of houses built over the last decade developed 'weathertightness' problems. The resulting media and political focus has led to a full review of the Building Act (the legislation leading to the Building Code) and new legislation will be in place by late 2004. As part of this, the Building Industry Authority will be absorbed into a government department. This will be followed by a detailed review of the New Zealand Building Code between 2005 and 2008. Although the performance requirements remain unaltered, the 'Acceptable Solutions' that are deemed to satisfy the code have already been made more conservative and prescriptive to account for the lack of sufficient experience and understanding in some parts of the building industry. Other legislation is expected to address the asymmetry between the industry and its clients, including a builder licensing scheme and consumer protection systems. The key lesson is that implementation of performance-based building codes systems cannot simply be done by putting the documents before the industry. Successful introduction of performance-based building codes, and changes to them, must be accompanied by well-focused training programmes for all involved in the process, and especially the designers, the building control staff and the on-site workforce.

The purpose of this paper is to define and address this knowledge gap, through development of a model to map the associations among the primary factors affecting C&D waste at project, industry and national levels. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model is developed based on synthesising the findings of available studies on factors affecting C&D waste with a focus on developing countries. For collecting data, the study drew upon a questionnaire survey of 103 Iranian construction practitioners. The strength and significance of associations among these factors to modify and validate the model were assessed using the structural equation modelling-partial least squares approach. Findings - Major factors affecting C&D waste management and their level of importance were identified at project, industry and national levels. Results clearly showed that the government should review regulations pertaining to C&D waste management and make sure they are implemented properly. The "polluter pays principle" is a useful guide in devising effective policies and regulations for the Iranian context. Originality/value - This study contributes to the field through presenting the first major study on C&D waste management in Iran. The study provides a picture of C&D waste management status quo in Iran and encapsulates the factors affecting C&D waste management in the Iranian context at different levels within an integrated model. The findings have practical implications for policy makers and construction practitioners in Iran, similar developing economies and foreign firms planning to operate in Iran.

How to detect an unbalanced bid is a challenging task faced by theoretical researchers and practical actors. This study aims to develop an identification method of unbalanced bidding in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The identification of unbalanced bidding is considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. A data-driven unit price database from the historical bidding document is built to present the reference unit prices as benchmarks. According to the proposed extended TOPSIS method, the data-driven unit price is chosen as the positive ideal solution, and the unit price that has the furthest absolute distance measure as the negative ideal solution. The concept of relative distance is introduced to measure the distances between positive and negative ideal solutions and each bidding unit price. The unbalanced bidding degree is ranked by means of relative distance. Findings The proposed model can be used for the quantitative evaluation of unbalanced bidding from a decision-making perspective. The identification process is developed according to the decision-making process. The finding shows that the model will support owners to efficiently and effectively identify unbalanced bidding in the bid evaluation stage. Originality/value The data-driven reference unit prices improve the accuracy of the benchmark to evaluate the unbalanced bidding. The extended TOPSIS model is applied to identify unbalanced bidding; the owners can undertake objective decision-making to identify and prevent unbalanced bidding at the stage of procurement.

J	Wang, YH; Ye, G; Zheng, CL; Zhang, SL				Wang, Yuhe; Ye, Gui; Zheng, Chenli; Zhang, Shilian			Total factor productivity growth and its decomposition in the Chinese construction industry since China's accession to the World Trade Organization	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Total factor productivity growth (TFPG); Construction industry; Stochastic frontier approach; Interaction effects; World Trade Organization (WTO)		Purpose Since China's accession of the World Trade Organization (WTO), its construction industry has attained unprecedented growth. However, for the sources of this enormous growth, a controversy regarding the total factor productivity growth (TFPG) still remains in production practice and extant studies. In view of this, the purpose of this paper is to measure TFPG and to explore its sources in the industry post-WTO accession. Design/methodology/approach This study presents an innovative source analysis of TFPG. Stochastic frontier approach is adopted to measure TFPG and to explore its sources by decomposing TFPG into technical progress (TP), technical efficiency change (TEC), allocative efficiency change (AEC) and scale efficiency change (SEC). Although China joined WTO in 2001, to provide an effective baseline, the study period is from 2000 to 2017. Findings The empirical results reveal that TFPG presented an overall downward evolutionary trend, but it still maintained a high growth post-WTO accession. From the perspective of decomposition, TP was the main source of TFPG. Furthermore, as a neglected source, interaction effects among TP, TEC, AEC and SEC have been demonstrated to have a significant influence on the cumulative TFPG. Practical implications To make the results be reliable, the authors discuss the empirical findings mainly by revealing the reasons behind the evolutions of TFPG and its sources. Based on these revealed reasons, government and policy makers can further refine and summarize some more detailed and targeted policy implications to improve TFPG. Originality/value By providing many empirical evidences to solve the aforesaid TFPG controversy, this paper, therefore, enriches the body of knowledge on growth theories, especially at the level of industrial economics.

Eco-feedback systems are taking advantage of data streams from advanced metering infrastructure and are being widely implemented with the goal of increasing engagement in more sustainable behavior. However, the effectiveness of eco-feedback systems at an urban scale largely depends on how the information is communicated to and visualized by various communities. Advanced visualization technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), have proven to be efficient tools in information communication and visualization in diverse fields and present a promising opportunity in information representation for eco-feedback studies at scales larger than a single building. This paper examines the effectiveness of a VR-integrated community-scale eco-feedback system deployed across 54 buildings on Georgia Tech's campus by integrating 15-min increment energy consumption data into an interactive VR platform of the campus and conducting a user testing experiment on visualization characteristics, such as immersion, presence, involvement, and simulator sickness, along with system usefulness, that play a decisive role in users' preference and perceived energy-saving motivation toward the two systems. Yet, participants indicated polarized preferences for the two types of systems. This finding suggests that to increase the effectiveness of energy feedback at the urban scale as open urban energy data become more available, eco-feedback systems need to incorporate the specific preferences of the communities receiving feedback or be designed capable of displaying energy feedback that meets users' diverse preferences. In doing so, we may capitalize on the increasing data richness of energy consumption information in cities to more effectively encourage energy-saving behavior and meet the sustainability targets set by city governments.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to identify various determinants and validate their effects on the success of public construction projects in Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a questionnaire survey to collect data and structural equation modeling (SEM) to empirically examine the effect of determinants, namely, project manager's competence, owner's competence, management support and updates, scope clarity (SC), effective partnering, and monitoring and feedback on success of public construction projects which has been measured by performance on cost, schedule, quality and no-dispute parameters. Out of 407 questionnaires distributed among the selected respondents, a total of 200 completed questionnaires were received. The response rate was 49.1 percent. Findings The results depict that the investigated factors have a significant positive influence on the success of public construction projects with path coefficient of 0.82, the model is substantial in representing the relationship of the factors on the success of public construction projects and the factor "SC" plays a decisive role in the success of a project as it has a path coefficient of 0.98, and it is followed by "effective partnership, and owner's competency" having equal path coefficients of 0.96. Originality/value This work is original and has neither been published nor under consideration for publication elsewhere. This study can add value to the construction professional in public construction project management as well as the Government of Ethiopia.

J	Aboagye-Nimo, E; Wood, H; Collison, J				Aboagye-Nimo, Emmanuel; Wood, Hannah; Collison, Jodie			Complexity of women's modern-day challenges in construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Management; Integration	POLICIES	Purpose Although the UK construction sector has enjoyed a significant rise in the number of women joining the industry, there is undoubtedly more room for improvement. Numerous schemes have been initiated by government and other professional bodies to encourage more women to undertake a career in construction. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the organisational complexities of problems faced by women working in professional roles in construction. It thus initiates a dialogue on the lack of workplace flexibility and discriminatory practices that prevent many more women from joining. Design/methodology/approach A phenomenological philosophy is adopted. The research critically explores the views of women working in professional roles in six large construction firms in England. Findings It was widely acknowledged that the industry had improved significantly, however there are still concerns yet to be addressed. It was identified that women face new challenges when they attain senior roles. Furthermore, it is believed that the current glass ceiling theory and leaky pipeline theory are not adequate to study these issues. Research limitations/implications - Sample size and narrow focus on large construction firms are the limitations of the paper. Practical implications - Through academic and industry dissemination, the findings from this research encourage both men and women working in the construction industry to adopt inclusive practices that will help widen the pool of knowledge and expertise. Social implications This paper sheds light on a problem that is assumed to be eradicated once women progress to senior management roles. Originality/value This research presents an in-depth critical perspective of challenges faced by women construction professionals occupying decision-making positions.

J	Zhao, RJ; Moh, WH				Zhao, Ru-Jiang; Moh, Wung Hee			Development of New Modality Municipal Public Transportation for Guangzhou-Group Rapid Transit System as Supplementary Linkage from Guangzhou City Center to its Eastern Tourism Zone	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						public transportation system; innovative city transportation; Subway Mass Rapid Transit (MRT); Bus Rapid Transit (BRT); Group Rapid Transit (GRT); Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)		As one of the primary business centers of China, Guangzhou has been undergoing rapid growth and expansion. Over the past decade, the Guangzhou Municipality Government has significantly upgraded its transport infrastructure, especially with the highly beneficial expansion of its Subway Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Positive steps have also been taken to continue planning the construction of new roads, a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and other transportation facilities. Further administrative and regulatory measures have also been implemented to control the situation, such as the banning of motorcycles from the central city area and the limitation of new automobile registrations. However, Guangzhou continues to face serious challenges of traffic congestion in and around the city center owing to further intensification of its population with economic growth. The need to ease Guangzhou's stretched public transportation resources, and at the same time to support the realization of its "Eastward Advance" strategy, presents a unique challenge and opportunity to develop an advanced high-efficiency public transportation modality for Guangzhou, viz. the Group Rapid Transit (GRT) involving the use of automation-guided (driverless) smart-vehicles. This paper outlines the PRT/GRT (PRT: Personal Rapid Transit) smart-vehicle modality and also puts forth a proposal of Guangzhou's first GRT route as the city's first dedicated transportation link to the scenic landscape of the Eastern Tourism Zone. This GRT route will help in diffusing the city's traffic congestion as well as support the effectuation of Guangzhou's "Eastern Expansion" strategy, supplementing the ongoing expansion of the Guangzhou Municipality's subway MRT networks.

Design/methodology/approach Stakeholders and CFs were identified through literature review and document analysis. The Delphi method was used to screen the extracted stakeholders and CFs. The focus group methodology was applied to obtain evaluation matrices of relationships between stakeholders and CFs. A two-mode social network was formed to analyse the evaluation matrices generated. Findings Results of the analyses indicate that local governments and policymaking institutions, together with project investors, obtained high prioritisations in the stakeholders' group, whilst senior citizens and caregivers appear to rank last. For CFs, communities' environmental factors receive the most attention from stakeholders. Research limitations/implications Results of the analyses can only show similarities of the participating stakeholders' opinions on their concerns, and provide researchers and practitioners with initial ideas on analysing stakeholders and CFs at the briefing stage of promoting AFCs. For a specific project, the concerns and prioritisations would change. Diverse voices are necessary and case studies are in need. Practical implications Challenges in promoting AFCs in urban China are discussed, and a preliminary framework of the briefing stage is developed for practitioners to follow when promoting AFCs. Originality/value This study discusses which CFs should be considered priorities and what consensuses are generally reached by stakeholders. CFs are utilised to interpret stakeholders' relationships, influences and concerns on AFC projects when conducting the social network analysis (SNA).

J	Mbarika, VW; Byrd, TA				Mbarika, Victor W.; Byrd, Terry Anthony			An Exploratory Study of Strategies to Improve Africa's Least Developed Economies' Telecommunications Infrastructure: The Stakeholders Speak	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Economically developing nations; information technology infrastructure; Sub-Saharan Africa; telecommunications; teledensity	INFORMATION; INDUSTRY; INTERNET	To enjoy modern information technology applications for development, such as e-medicine, tele-edcuation, e-government, and e-commerce, the engineering management and information systems literature have vastly argued that there exist technological and nontechnological precursors to successful diffusion of such applications. Factors such as training local expertise and open competition that could be taken for granted in developed nations cannot just be ignored in the case of developing economies. The main measure of a nation's telecommunications infrastructure is teledensity-the number of main telecommunications landlines per 100 people. Africa's Least Developed Economies (LDEs), home to 33 of the 48 LDEs of the world, continue to suffer from poor telecommunications infrastructure. For most countries within this region, less than one telephone line is shared among 100 inhabitants, a serious hindrance in building other basic infrastructure such as the Internet and related technologies. For example, Congo and Eritrea still have less than 0.5 line per 100 people. This study examines the perceptions of Africa's technology stakeholders to solve the poor telecommunications infrastructure problems that hinder diffusion of relevant applications within the region. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and reported in this study. Findings reveal six pertinent factors (strategies) that would impact teledensity growth in Africa's LDEs. 1) Promote domestic and foreign investment in information and communications technologies. 2) Develop wireless and satellite infrastructure as a compliment (and not a replacement) to landlines. 3) Strive to be self-sufficient. 4) Enact governmental regulatory policies. 5) Build local capacity. 6) Privatize the telecommunications sector.

Social Network Analysis of Road PPP Equity Markets in Canada, Chile, and the United States	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Social network analysis; Public-private partnerships; Special purpose vehicle; Equity providers; Public-private partnership (PPP) procurement	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; RISK; PROJECTS; GOVERNANCE; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION; COMPANIES; MODEL	For several decades, governments around the world have increasingly used public-private partnerships (PPPs) to improve the road infrastructure sectors in their jurisdictions. In response, research has examined the managerial and organizational methods associated with PPP procurement processes. Although the PPP body of knowledge continues to grow, the functioning of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) formed to pursue PPP projects, particularly the relationships among SPV equity investors, remains largely unexplored. Building on concepts from the PPP and social network analysis (SNA) domains, the main goal of this study is to examine the patterns of behavior associated with SPV equity investors participating in the PPP tendering processes. The methodology uses data from public and proprietary databases to examine the networks of relationships among PPP equity providers within the road infrastructure sectors in Canada, Chile, and the United States over the last 26 years. The main outcome of this analysis is a characterization of the PPP equity markets in these three countries. Results show that PPP investors seemingly exhibit collaboration-based connections in the Canadian network, competition-based relationships in the Chilean market, and a combination of competition and collaboration features in the US network. Conclusions suggest that, despite their differences, the PPP networks studied are complex and self-organizing structures that exhibit preferential attachment mechanisms between central and peripheral players. Future studies are suggested to add insight on the ways that PPP markets and SPVs mutually influence one another and affect project performance. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Zhao, XB; Singhaputtangkul, N				Zhao, Xianbo; Singhaputtangkul, Natee			Effects of Firm Characteristics on Enterprise Risk Management: Case Study of Chinese Construction Firms Operating in Singapore	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Enterprise risk management; Construction firms; Firm characteristics; Structural equation modeling	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTORS; STRATEGIES; MODELS; SYSTEM; PLS	The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of regulatory pressure, firm ownership, and firm size on enterprise risk management (ERM) implementation in international construction firms. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire survey was conducted with 35 professionals from Chinese construction firms (CCFs) operating in Singapore. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The analysis results confirmed the three constructs of ERM implementation: commitment and involvement of top management (CITM), communication and understanding (CU), and execution and integration (EI). Additionally, the results showed that: (1)higher regulatory pressure led to a higher level of CITM and EI; (2)a higher level of government ownership contributed to a higher level of CITM, CU, and EI; and (3)larger firm size led to a higher level of CITM and EI. The quantitative results were complemented by qualitative evidence from six semistructured interviews, which validated the proposed framework. These findings are arguably the first to be presented for the construction industry and therefore add to the existing body of knowledge on ERM. Additionally, the findings can help management teams tailor their ERM practices in accordance with firm characteristics, thereby contributing to current ERM practices. Although this study is focused on ERM in Singapore-based CCFs, a similar research design and method can be used to investigate the role of firm characteristics in ERM implementations in construction firms located in other countries. The future development of the ERM body of knowledge can, for enhancement purposes, take into account various firm characteristics for implementation. Therefore, this study contributes to the ERM body of knowledge.

While the capacity of organisations is generally thought to be related to organisational performance, there is a lack of empirical insights concerning the contribution of procurement capacity of public organisations towards the attainment of procurement objectives in infrastructure procurement. Thus, it is unclear which aspects of the capacity of public procurement organisations contribute the most to the attainment of procurement objectives in the procurement of infrastructure. This research sought to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach The research used a survey of public procurement professionals which yielded 590 responses. Findings Exploratory factor analysis of 23 organisational capacity items revealed three components of organisational procurement capacity: "management of the procurement process"; "human and physical resources"; and "financial resources and management". Multiple regression modelling of the relationship between the components and the attainment of 12 procurement objectives further reveals that there is a significant positive relationship between the three components and all the objectives. However, "management of the procurement process" emerged as the greatest contributor to the attainment of seven objectives, whereas "human and physical resources", and "financial resources and management" were the greatest contributor to the attainment of one objective and four objectives, respectively. Originality/value The study provides strong empirical justification for investment in the development of procurement capacity of public agencies involved in procurement of infrastructure. Furthermore, procurement capacity development of specific capacity components can be prioritised based on the relative contribution of capacity components to the attainment of desired procurement objectives. This should be useful to government policymakers as well as multilateral organisations that fund infrastructure and procurement reforms in various countries.

J	Maceta, PRM; Berssaneti, FT				Maceta, Paulo Rafael Minetto; Berssaneti, Fernando Tobal			Comparison of project portfolio management practices in the public and private sectors in Brazil Characteristics, similarities, and differences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Developing countries; Case study; Public sector; Project portfolio	LOCAL-GOVERNMENT; DECISION-MAKING; PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; SUCCESS; IMPACT; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; FUTURE	Purpose Project portfolio management (PPM) is a managerial technique used to seek the strategic goals of organizations improving their performance. The public sector has some characteristics that differ from the private sector, since their management approaches are different. The purpose of this paper is to compare the PPM's practices and techniques in the public and private sectors. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the study case methodology through eight case studies that were undertaken in Brazil: four in public and four in private sectors. The field research used semi-structured interviews that were analyzed using the NVivo software. Findings In both sectors, strategic alignment is the goal of PPM, and the same tools are employed. The public sector displays better process documentation and lower risk awareness than the private sector, showing an improvement point for the public sector. The selection and prioritization criteria differ from each sector, showing the difference in the strategic goals of public and private sectors. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this paper are related to the number of organizations studied; however, the case studies represent organizations from different sectors and industries maximizing heterogeneity, but focusing on Brazil. Social implications The prioritization and effective allocation of projects spending in the Brazilian public sector could be improved with the comparison of their current practices with the ones used in private sector, increasing its transparency and cost allocation. Originality/value This study broadens the understanding of PPM in the public sector, which is a gap in the academic literature, comparing its practices with those used in the private sector.

Application of cutting-edge information and communication technologies (ICTs) can enhance the quality of construction training, and help in attracting youth to an industry that traditionally has a poor image and slow in uptaking innovation. This paper reports on the development of a novel mixed reality (MR) system uniquely targeted for the training of construction trade workers, i.e.,skilled manual workers. From a general training viewpoint, the system aims to address the shortcomings of existing construction trades training, in particular the lack of solutions for enabling trainees to train in realistic and challenging site conditions, while eliminating occupational health and safety risks. From a technical viewpoint, the system currently integrates state-of-the-art virtual reality goggles with a novel cost-effective 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head pose tracking system supporting the movement of trainees in room-size spaces, as well as a game engine to effectively manage the generation of the views of the virtual three-dimensional environment projected on the VR goggles. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the 6-DOF head pose tracking system, which is the main computational contribution of the research reported in this paper. Then, preliminary results reveal its value to enable trainees to experience construction site conditions, particularly being at height, in different settings. Details are provided regarding future work to extend the system into the envisioned full MR system whereby a trainee would be performing an actual task, e.g.,bricklaying, while being immersed in a virtual project environment.

Design/methodology/approach This paper has established an analytical framework to analyse the social sustainability of PPP projects. Using content analysis method, a single case study was carried out on the Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney, Australia. Findings The results show that there are many problems related to social sustainability in the project, due to which employees and patients were exposed to most of them. Some recommendations are provided, including to strengthen the supervision of the project, provide sufficient information, establish communication channels and stakeholder participation, improve hospital policies and procedures, and strengthen government support. Practical implications This paper can provide guidance for the stakeholders in a partnership, including the public and private sectors, to analyse the social sustainability implications, and then plan and implement hospital PPP projects to achieve social sustainability goals. Meanwhile, it can also provide important reference for the employees, patients, local community and society to assess social sustainability issues, and provide relevant inputs to inform decision-makers in the development, delivery and management of hospital projects. Originality/value The research will contribute to knowledge of social sustainability of hospital PPP projects. The proposed analytical framework can be used to analyse and assess the social sustainability of such projects from the perspective of stakeholders.

These studies have addressed the achievement of win-win from various perspectives. An integration of the constructs from these various perspectives improves approach to attaining win-win throughout the entire project delivery. This study, therefore, becomes the first systematic review to analyse PPP studies towards identifying win-win constructs and then integrates findings into a conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a four-staged systematic review method. This includes concept development, papers retrieval, selection of relevant papers and qualitative analysis. Thematic analysis was used at the qualitative analysis stage for the identification and categorization of constructs and finally, systems thinking was adopted in integrating the findings into a conceptual mode Findings The achievement of win-win between government and private investors is of much desire hence a more conscious approach towards it is ideal. A total of 40 constructs were identified and were later categorised into six components. Some constructs identified include optimal assessment and fair allocation of project risks, reasonable concessions period, flexible contracting, equal and active participation and co-ordination of public and private actors and strategic negotiation. Originality/value This paper provides an improved definition of win-win scenario in PPP infrastructure project delivery. Furthermore, the novel approach of integrating win-win constructs into a systemic conceptual model is very relevant to PPP body of knowledge and practice. The study concludes with plausible research directions to further improve the achievement of win-win in PPP.	[Eshun, Bridget Tawiah Badu; Chan, Albert P.

The Virtual Libraries (VLs) of respective journals were accessed directly to retrieve the related papers for the study. Popular search engines such as Google Scholar, the Web of Science, and Engineering Village were also used to complement the search process. From the review, universal drivers that promote the adoption of ICJV have been identified for policymakers and stakeholders' realization. The UK, Australia, Singapore, Turkey, and China have been the top countries noted for pioneering ICJV drivers' research. While the bulk of studies has come from developed countries, developing countries have also made a significant contribution. A conceptual framework has been developed to guide, determine, and assess the success of ICJVs based on 47 identified drivers. The framework consists of five major constructs of ICJV drivers: legal and market-driven drivers, strategic vision drivers, organizational and personal goal drivers, relationship building and operational success drivers, and capacity building drivers. These drivers act as a blueprint for the parties to the venture and could be used to determine the success and failure dynamics of ICJVs. The developed framework serves as a guide for all industry practitioners and decision-makers interested in adopting an ICJV. Further, it can facilitate the development of appropriate and effective policies by government agencies to promote the adoption of ICJVs. Moreover, the checklist and framework provide a strong foundation for researchers to conduct a further empirical investigation on the topic.	[Chan, Albert P.

J	Lappi, TM; Aaltonen, K; Kujala, J				Lappi, Teemu Mikael; Aaltonen, Kirsi; Kujala, Jaakko			The birth of an ICT project alliance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Institutional theory; ICT; Institutional entrepreneurship; Project alliances; Public sector	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; E-GOVERNMENT; DECISION-MAKING; GOVERNANCE; IMPACT; TRANSFORMATION; CONSTRUCTION; ISOMORPHISM; INTEGRATION	Purpose ICT projects, especially in the public sector, can have a substantial impact on society but are challenging due to organizational and technological complexities and uncertainties. Collaborative and cooperative project delivery models, namely, the project alliance method, can mitigate such challenges, but, thus far, have not been utilized in information and communication technology (ICT) projects. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the cross-field transfer process through which the project alliance model was applied to the ICT field from the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach An inductive case study of the ICT project alliance early stages was performed. Data were collected from the first known ICT alliance project, conducted in the context of the Finnish public sector digitalization. Findings The findings show how the activities of institutional entrepreneurs impact the cross-field transfer process during the ICT project alliance's early stages. Furthermore, the results illustrate the characteristics of an ICT project alliance and compare those with more traditional project alliances. Originality/value The topic and results of the study are original and contribute to institutional research by identifying and studying the micro-level processes associated with the cross-field transfer process. The study also builds an initial understanding of a new method of organizing ICT projects and contributes to the project alliance literature. The managerial implications of the findings allow project practitioners to understand the emerging characteristics of an ICT project alliance, and enable managers in the ICT field to adjust and prepare their own organizations and processes for the application of the project alliance model.

However, public projects usually face more constraints in adopting RC, as close relationships may lead to allegations of corruption. The aim of this study is to undertake a comparative analysis of drivers and barriers to adopting RC practices in public construction projects in two different markets viz, a centrally planned economy and a free market economy by investigating practices in Beijing and Sydney. The survey research design was adopted and data of public construction projects in Beijing and Sydney were collected using a structured questionnaire. The results revealed that relationship quality and level of harmony among contracting parties are significantly good in both cities. In Sydney, the level of inter-personal relations between contractors and consultants is significantly higher than in Beijing. It was found that the same 18 factors drive contracting parties in Beijing and Sydney to adopt RC practices, and in 6 instances, these are significantly greater drivers in Sydney. The barriers to adopting RC practices are totally dissimilar in both cities. Contracting parties in Beijing could not adopt more RC practices because of a lack of training in relational arrangement and public clients lack initiative in adopting RC practices. The conservative industry culture that encourages preservation of the status quo is also prevalent in Beijing. In Sydney, the only significant barrier is public sector accountability concerns. To cultivate readiness to embrace RC practices, it is suggested that industry professionals and the government adopt recommendations highlighted in this study according to the type of market structure.

The C&D waste can be classified into inert and noninert wastes, in which the inert waste is normally disposed of in public fills as reclamation materials and the noninert waste is dumped at landfills. Under the current waste generation trend, all landfills and public fills in Hong Kong will be used up within a few years. To tackle this problem, in December of 2005, the Hong Kong Government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme (CWDCS) to provide financial incentives to C&D waste generators to reduce waste and encourage reuse and recycling. This paper presents the results of a study to explore the perceptions of the Hong Kong construction participants toward the CWDCS after three years of implementation. The study was conducted by a survey with follow-up interviews to experienced professionals in the building industry. The results revealed no consensus view among the construction participants on C&D waste reduction, especially regarding on-site waste sorting and recycling. The findings also revealed that 40% of the survey respondents believed that waste reduction is less than 5% after CWDCS was implemented. The interviewees expressed that some waste generation was unavoidable, although a waste disposal charge has been imposed. In addition, 30% of survey respondents agreed that the cost of CWDCS was not high enough to raise awareness about waste management on construction sites. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000631.

To overcome these issues, the Hong Kong Government has been practicing the use of the New Engineering Contract (NEC) forms in several public works projects. However, despite the successful outcomes and the positive signs of adopting NEC, it appears that NEC forms of contracts are not widely adopted in the Hong Kong construction industry even after 25 years of their first introduction. The purpose of this paper is to identify the challenges and barriers for not implementing NEC widely in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach Based on a questionnaire survey data collected from 45 senior industry professionals, and six semi-structured interviews, the study evaluated the perceptions of construction professionals as to why NEC is still not popular in the industry and reported the relative importance of challenges in the implementation of NEC in Hong Kong. Findings The results reveal that "People are not willing to change," "Limited number of trained professionals" and "Insufficient case law and adjudication experience" are the most significant challenges and barriers in adopting NEC. These findings are also supported by the opinions of construction professionals through semi-structured interviews. Originality/value The empirical evidence of the study provides an insight into the challenges faced by the construction industry of Hong Kong. NEC form of contract is the way forward in order to create a better working environment conducive for all the parties that would result in better construction project performance and productivity.

The construction industry in developing countries is less competitive than its counterparts in the international construction market, and causes of this situation are multifaceted. Nation-related characteristics should be taken into account to produce competitive strategies for a specific construction industry, and this also leads to the situation that factors differ between countries, especially between developing and developed countries. Porter's diamond model is adopted to develop potential factors formulating the competitiveness of the construction industry, and 34 factors are identified within the Chinese constriction industry (CCI). In order to get empirical findings, a questionnaire survey is managed to investigate the significance of these factors, and factor analysis is also applied. Factor analysis further reveals six underlying factors: stable home market (F-I), supply chain management (F-II), corporate management practices (F-III), qualified professionals (F-IV), satisfactory business environment (F-V), and migrant workers (F-VI). The study provides insights in finding key areas that formulate the competitiveness of the CCI, as well as valuable implications for other countries. These research results provide some practical implications for practiced professionals and policy-makers to emphasize these critical aspects that determine the competitiveness of the industry, e.g.,creating a dynamic and advanced domestic market. However, as the market context and institutional environment vary significantly among different countries, similar studies in different construction industries would enrich the understanding of the competitiveness of the construction industry generally.

Investigation of Barriers to Entry into the Design-Build Market in the People's Republic of China	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design and build; Barriers to entry; Construction market; Factor analysis; China	PROJECT; DETERRENCE; DECISIONS	Although the design-build (DB) system has been demonstrated to be an effective delivery method and has gained popularity worldwide, it has not gained the same popularity in the construction market of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The objective of this study was to investigate the barriers to entry in the DB market. A total of 22 entry barriers were first identified through an open-ended questionnaire survey with 15 top construction professionals in the construction market of China. A broad questionnaire survey was further conducted to prioritize these entry barriers. Statistical analysis of responses shows that the most dominant barriers to entry into the DB market are lack of design expertise, lack of interest from owners, lack of suitable organization structure, lack of DB specialists, and lack of credit record system. Analysis of variance indicates that there is no difference of opinions among the respondent groups of academia, government departments, state-owned companies, and private companies, at the 5% significance level, on most of the barriers to entry. Finally, the underlying dimensions of barriers to entry in the DB market were investigated through factor analysis. The results indicate that there are six major underlying dimensions of entry barriers in DB market, including the competence of design-builders, difficulty in project procurement, characteristics of DB projects, lack of support from public sectors, the competence of DB owners, and the immaturity of DB market. These findings are useful for both potential and incumbent design-builders to understand and analyze the DB market in China. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000387.

J	Rousseau, D; Chen, Y				Rousseau, D; Chen, Y			Sustainability options for China's residential building sector	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building materials; China; developing countries; governance; housing; public policy; sustainability; technology transfer; urban development		China is engaged in a massive urban development programme, together with large infrastructure investments in road and transit systems. This development is occurring in the context of a shift towards a market economy, but China is still a developing country. China and the rest of the world are poised at a critical moment of decision. For China to provide an international standard of living for its entire population using the Western model of consumption would require vast resources. Many of these resources are relatively scarce in China, and the cost of imports at world prices is prohibitive for China. Furthermore, the future resource cost and impact on the environment of operating cities in China will be overwhelming if they are developed to conventional, Western standards. This has already been recognized for industry and utilities in China, where many modernizations and energy efficiency improvements have been made. However the residential sector, which is now the fastest growing sector in terms of energy and materials demands, has not received sufficient attention. One option is to advance the 'sustainable design approach' based on highly efficient buildings, transportation systems and utilities, and preserving the productive: capacity of land and restoring air and water quality. China has many resourceful traditions that can form a basis for a culturally specific approach to sustainability, but foreign assistance and technology transfer will be required, as well as Government policy incentives and their implementation within China. Especially needed are clean industry technology, durable and energy efficient building systems, renewable energy systems, and environmental cleanup and recycling systems.

However, such measurement, particularly in urban regeneration projects, is difficult because of the complex indicators and multiple stakeholders involved. The purpose of this paper is to measure the public participation level in urban regeneration projects in China. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a perception difference-based method to measure the public participation level in urban regeneration projects in China. Specifically, an indicator system consisting of 12 indicators from three categories was first purposed. A perception difference-based method that integrates ANOVA test and Tukey test were then developed. The method was validated using five represented projects, and the results are interpreted based on a proposed measurement matrix. Findings - Regardless of the type of indicator, the perception of the government aligns with the perception of private sector professions, however, deviates from the perception of citizens. By taking the mean score and the significance level among stakeholders of perception as two dimensions, different patterns of issues in the current participation practice in urban regeneration are manifested. Research limitations/implications - Theoretically, the proposed indicator system and perception difference-based method combined to provide a holistic view of public participation, which is verified to provide a better measurement. Practically, the authors' methodology helps in revealing issues in current participation practice and further leading to designing coping strategies. Nonetheless, the proposed method requires further validation in participation practices in China and other countries. Originality/value - By considering the perception mean and the significance level as two dimensions, a public participation measurement matrix is proposed. The performance in different indicators are classified into four stages accordingly, namely idling, starting, running-in and accelerating.

The decision to implement a PPP approach in an inexperienced market requires identification of potential PPP solutions to mitigate the problems associated with the public delivery of road projects. However, this issue of identification has not been addressed in previous studies. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a framework that identifies potential PPP solutions to public delivery problems. To address this issue, documents that provide first-hand PPP experiences were collected from five toll roads and bridge projects in Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Cote d'Ivoire. Furthermore, the authors conducted interviews with the key stakeholders of toll road projects in Ethiopia-a newly emerging, inexperienced PPP market. The resulting data were analyzed to explore the potential drivers of PPP adoption through a concept-mapping technique, along with case study aggregation. Based on the findings, a framework was developed that consisted of nine PPP-associated factors acting as a solution to 12 public delivery-associated problems. The results demonstrate that fostering economic development with the help of the private sector to raise project financing and constructing roads that can ease traffic congestion are the main potential drivers of PPP implementation in inexperienced PPP markets. This reveals that PPP implementation motives in the inexperienced PPP markets of developing countries are different from the motives in the experienced PPP markets of developing countries. The study findings would help inexperienced PPP markets to find PPP solutions to the problems associated with public delivery.

J	Babatunde, SO; Perera, S				Babatunde, Solomon Olusola; Perera, Srinath			Cross-sectional comparison of public-private partnerships in transport infrastructure development in Nigeria	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Nigeria; Critical success factors; Developing countries; Partnership; Procurement; Private finance	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; COST OVERRUNS; PPP PROJECTS; BOT PROJECTS; HONG-KONG; PERSPECTIVES; SECTOR; CHINA; URBAN; CSFS	Purpose - Although scientific research community has shown considerable interest in identifying critical success factors (CSFs) for public-private partnership (PPP) projects, yet effort at assessing and compare CSFs within similar PPP infrastructure projects received scant attention. The purpose of this paper is to identify, assess, and compare the CSFs in PPP transport infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted literature review and three PPP case studies including structured interviews and review of documentary reports in each case study. The outcome of literature review provided a total list of 26 identified success factors, which was used to design a case study protocol using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique. FMEA was conducted on each 26 identified success factor to assess their criticality in the three PPP case studies. Findings - The results of FMEA revealed a total of ten CSFs in the concession of the road; four CSFs in the concession of the airport; and eight CSFs in the concession of the seaport. Also, the cross-case analysis showed the three prevalent CSFs, this includes government involvement by providing guarantees, political support, and project economic viability. Practical implications - The study findings including lessons learnt in each case study would positively influence policy development towards PPP transport infrastructure projects and the manner in which partners (i.e. public and private sector) go about the development of PPP transport projects. Originality/value - This research would help PPP stakeholders to focus their attention and priorities in managing the identified CSFs in achieving long-term success in PPP transport infrastructure projects implementation.

J	Lin, ETA; Ofori, G; Tjandra, I; Kim, H				Lin, Evelyn Teo Ai; Ofori, George; Tjandra, Imelda; Kim, Hanjoon			Framework for productivity and safety enhancement system using BIM in Singapore	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; BIM; Safety; System	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; MODEL; GENERATION; KNOWLEDGE; CHECKING	Purpose - Despite recognition of its importance to Singapore's economy, the construction industry is plagued by poor safety and productivity performance. Improvement efforts by the government and industry have yielded little results. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for developing a productivity and safety monitoring system using Building Information Modelling (BIM). Design/methodology/approach - The framework, Intelligent Productivity and Safety System (IPASS), takes advantage of mandatory requirements for building plans to be submitted for approval in Singapore in BIM format. IPASS is based on a study comprising interviews and a questionnaire-based survey. It uses BIM to integrate buildable design, prevention and control of hazards, and safety assessment. Findings - The authors illustrate a development of IPASS capable of generating productivity and safety scores for construction projects by analysing BIM model information. Research limitations/implications - The paper demonstrates that BIM can be used to monitor productivity and safety as a project progresses, and help to enhance performance under the two parameters. Practical implications - IPASS enables collaboration among project stakeholders as they can base their work on analysis of productivity and safety performance before projects start, and as they progress. It is suggested that the BIM model submitted to the authorities should be used for the IPASS application. Originality/value - IPASS has rule-checking, hazards identification and quality checking capabilities. It is able to identify hazards and risks with the rule-checking capabilities. IPASS enables practitioners to check mistakes and the rationality of a design. It helps to mitigate risks as there are built-in safety measures/controls rules to overcome the problems caused by design deficiency, wrong-material-choice, and more.

J	Hong, T; Kim, H; Kwak, T				Hong, TaeHoon; Kim, HyunJoong; Kwak, TaeHyun			Energy-Saving Techniques for Reducing CO2 Emissions in Elementary Schools	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Schools; Energy efficiency; Energy consumption; Energy method; Carbon dioxide	PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM	Global warming has grown into a significantly intense global issue, prompting all nations to exert various efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emission, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The South Korean government is likewise working on reducing its greenhouse gas emission and, as part of its effort, it is currently promoting the Green-School Project. This project aims to create energy-saving schools by renovating deteriorated school buildings. In this study, CO2 emission reduction scenarios are sought by applying energy-saving techniques (ESTs) to educational facilities, and an optimal scenario is created by performing life cycle cost (LCC) analysis for each scenario. To this end, the amounts of energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction in two schools were evaluated using DesignBuilder simulation, based on 15 scenarios with combinations of four ESTs. LCC analysis was also performed. In terms of energy efficiency, CO2 emission reduction, and LCC analysis, the results showed that the most effective scenario is replacing the existing lighting with light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. The results also showed that there is a difference in energy efficiency, CO2 emission reduction, and LCC analysis based on the type and size of the school building. If the results of this study are considered in policy-making efforts by the Korea Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, CO2 emission in the maintenance phase for South Korean educational facilities is expected to be reduced, and an optimal maintenance process using a limited budget will also be feasible.

J	Beach, T; Petri, I; Rezgui, Y; Rana, O				Beach, Thomas; Petri, Ioan; Rezgui, Yacine; Rana, Omer			Management of Collaborative BIM Data by Federating Distributed BIM Models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN	The architecture engineering and construction sector is currently undergoing a significant period of change and modernization. In the United Kingdom in particular this is driven by the government's objective of reducing the cost of construction projects. This is to be achieved by requiring all publicly funded projects to utilize fully collaborative building information modeling by 2016. A common goal in increasing building information model (BIM) adoption by the industry is the movement toward the realization of a BIM as either a single data model or a series of tightly coupled federated models. However, there are key obstacles to be overcome, including uncertainty over data ownership, concerns relating to the security/privacy of data, and reluctance to outsource data storage. This paper proposes a framework that is able to provide a solution for managing collaboration in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) sector. The solution presented in this paper provides an overlay that automatically federates and governs distributed BIM data. The use of this overlay provides an integrated BIM model that is physically distributed across the stakeholders in a construction project. The key research question addressed by this paper is whether such an overlay can, by providing dynamic federation and governance of BIM data, overcome some key obstacles to BIM adoption, including questions over data ownership, the security/privacy of data, and reluctance to share data. More specifically, this paper provides the following contributions: (1)presentation of a vision for the implementation and governance of a federated distributed BIM data model; (2)description of the BIM process and governance model that underpins the approach; (3)provision of a validation case study using real construction data from a U.K. highways project, demonstrating that both the federated BIM overlay and the process and governance model are fit for purpose.

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to this effect, especially from the developing economies. The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap through a SS-centric analysis of feasibility study reports using a stakeholder salience perspective. Design/methodology/approach Feasibility study reports for 61 projects were obtained from various government organizations in India. The SS considerations were identified in the reports using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The former was based on content analysis and the latter was conducted using "VOSviewer" text analysis software. Findings SS considerations related to occupational health and safety, workers' employment practices and proactive involvement of communities and end-users were found to be inadequately addressed in the reports. Based on occurrences of the SS considerations, project-affected community was found to be the most salient stakeholder, followed by the end-users and the construction workers. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationship between the SS considerations and the type of project as well as the type of project delivery system. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of integrating SS considerations in feasibility study of construction projects. Its results provide useful inputs to decision-makers for orienting construction projects, right from the early phases, towards benefitting the disadvantaged and weaker stakeholders irrespective of their salience attributes. In developing economies, such interventions may improve quality of lives of a large number of project stakeholders and also cultivate a positive societal image of the construction industry as a respectful, ethical and employee friendly industry.

S. civil infrastructure will need to be refurbished or replaced in the coming decades. How to do so while considering various aspects of sustainability is a major challenge for engineers, utilities, and government agencies. Additionally, infrastructure decisions have a long time horizon and, as such, the implications of these decisions need to be considered over the life cycle of each project. This study describes a triple-bottom-line analysis that was performed in cooperation with a water utility in the Northeast to quantify the life-cycle economic, environmental, and social impacts of refurbishing or replacing a large water-storage tank. A hybrid environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted and included both on-site use of resources and emissions, as well as those that occur during production and transport of the various materials used in site preparation, construction, and maintenance. The proposed new tank would achieve better water quality and a different overall usable capacity, introducing additional complexity into the comparison. The analysis considered capital and maintenance costs, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, human health impacts, and ecotoxicity, as well as local societal impacts such as congestion costs, noise, and the effect of aesthetic changes on property values. The results show that refurbishing the existing tank is preferable to new tank construction across all environmental impact categories, both in absolute terms and when normalized by the amount of high-quality water storage provided. Economic and societal cost analyses also preferred tank refurbishment, with significant variations depending on maintenance schedule and assumed tank lifetimes. This analysis provides detailed, quantitative data to support project decision making at the municipal level and demonstrates generally the application of multicriteria sustainability assessment to civil infrastructure planning.

J	Wang, CF; Antos, SE; Triveno, LM				Wang, Chaofeng; Antos, Sarah Elizabeth; Triveno, Luis Miguel			Automatic detection of unreinforced masonry buildings from street view images using deep learning-based image segmentation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Unreinforced masonry building; Instance segmentation; Deep learning; URM; Masonry building; Street view image	DAMAGE; EARTHQUAKE; BEHAVIOR	Mitigation of seismic risk is a challenge for 70+ countries in the world. Screening the building stock for potential structural defects is one way to locate structures that are vulnerable to strong ground motion. Often in developing countries, masonry buildings are not reinforced or confined to withstand earthquake loads. It has been observed that such buildings cannot withstand the lateral loads imposed by an earthquake. An estimated 77 percent of the fatalities in the earthquakes during the last 100 years were caused mainly by the collapse of masonry buildings. Given the probability of severe damage or collapse in the event of an earthquake, identification and retrofit of such masonry buildings are critical. Screening of masonry buildings by conventional methods is usually a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This research presents an automated workflow for segmenting the presence of such buildings through the use of street-view images. The method uses deep learning techniques. An inventory composed of a set of street view images was collected from the streets of Oaxaca State, Mexico using a 360 degrees camera mounted on a car. These images were then annotated by trained engineers. Using the annotated dataset, an instance segmentation model was trained to detect and classify masonry buildings from the street view images. Using the model, we performed city scale detections of masonry buildings. We found the spatial distribution pattern of masonry buildings is correlated with the urbanization paths of the cities. The model could be used to produce large-scale automated detection of buildings at a fraction of the cost and in the fraction of the time of the alternatives. With affordable, accurate and massive screenings, governments can target these buildings for retrofit efforts and companies can assess the business opportunity of prevention (or "Building Better Before").

The main purpose of this study is to explore and provide insights into the impact and changes that have occurred in the construction sector due to COVID-19 and to present a mitigation framework to minimize the effects. Design/methodology/approach The scope of this study is limited to peer-reviewed articles in Scopus or Web of Science indexed journals. A systemized review was performed with bibliometric and content analyses of articles related to the impact of COVID-19 on the construction sector. Findings Through content analysis, the main topics discussed in the selected articles were grouped into 10 categories. Most of these studies were found to have focused on the challenges, impact, and health and safety at construction sites resulting from the pandemic. The study further identified 39 subtopics through detailed content analysis and organizes them into the categories of negative impacts, positive impacts and opportunities and barriers to COVID-19 safety guidelines in the construction sector. Moreover, the study developed a systematic mitigation strategy based on the recommendations of the literature review to reduce the impact of the current pandemic on the construction sector. The mitigation strategy presents separate set of measures regarding safety guidelines, process improvements, government intervention, psychological support and technology adoption. Originality/value The research insights provided in this study are useful for practitioners in guiding them to design effective strategies for addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises. Furthermore, a systematic presentation of the impacts, challenges and mitigation measures in this study will help researchers to identify existing gaps in the literature and explore other aspects of the impact of the pandemic on the construction sector.

J	Deng, XP; Low, SP; Li, QM; Zhao, XB				Deng, Xiaopeng; Low, Sui Pheng; Li, Qiming; Zhao, Xianbo			Developing Competitive Advantages in Political Risk Management for International Construction Enterprises	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Political risks; Risk management; International projects; Competitive advantage; International construction enterprise; Project planning and design	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; JOINT VENTURES; CONTRACTORS; DECISION; STRATEGY	International construction projects invariably involve political risks. This has been a persistent and pernicious problem encountered by international contractors. Various sets of variables have been suggested in the literature focusing on different aspects of political risk management (PRM) for international construction enterprises (ICEs). It is crucial to identify the relative importance and groupings of these variables. This paper aims to identify critical variables associated with PRM in international construction projects, and to analyze their rankings and underlying relationships. A total of 17 variables were identified through a literature review and consolidated by pilot studies with professionals in the international construction industry. Questionnaire instruments containing the 17 variables were sent out to the practitioners and academics, and 138 completed questionnaires were received. The top five ranked variables for PRM were (1) relationship with governments, (2) misconduct of contractors, (3) experiential knowledge of political risks, (4) relations with power groups, and (5) localization. Factor analysis was used as the data reduction tool and these 17 variables were further grouped into four resource dimensions, as follows: (1) relations, experience, acceptance, and localization; (2) recourse, organization, operation, and technology; (3) growth, ownership, leverage, and diversification; and (4) sustainability, opportunity, integration, and long-term. A management framework with both theoretical and practical meanings was finally developed for successful PRM in international construction projects. The findings would help the ICEs to clarify the highly prioritized variables and underlying factors which could be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the performance of PRM. Successful PRM would provide competitive advantages for the ICEs to survive and prosper in the host construction market, especially in those locations characterized by highly political risks.

To achieve this aim, a research methodology consisted of literature review and survey questionnaire was developed to accomplish three objectives. First, literature review was used to investigate the nature of the construction industry, identify and classify the causes of site accidents as well as their social and economic impacts on organizations and affected families. Second, a survey questionnaire was conducted with a representative sample of large and medium sized construction firms in Egypt to examine their perception of the causes of site accidents. Finally, outlining research conclusions and recommendations useful to construction firms and governmental organizations. The research identified 16 causes of construction site accidents. These causes were classified into three categories based on the party responsible for the occurrence of site accidents namely, workers, organization management and government. Results of data analysis showed that "Lack of housekeeping" and "Lack of governmental inspection for Safety" were ranked the highest causes of site accidents in the Egyptian construction industry, while "inefficiency of old safety equipment or no safety equipment at all" and "reluctance to input resources for Safety" were ranked the least causes. Moreover, Spearman correlation test showed there are relationships between many causes in which some causes may affect the occurrence of other causes. This research provides valuable information about the nature of the construction industry with particular focus on site accidents, causes and impacts of construction site accidents. The research tackled a topic that received scant attention in construction literature especially in the Egypt context. The work presented in this paper represents a synthesis that is important and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred in the Egyptian construction industry.

J	Tong, F; Azevedo, I; Jaramillo, P				Tong, Fan; Azevedo, Ines; Jaramillo, Paulina			Economic Viability of a Natural Gas Refueling Infrastructure for Long-Haul Trucks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							CYCLE GREENHOUSE GASES; PATHWAYS; HYDROGEN	Low natural gas prices offer an opportunity to expand the use of this fuel in new sectors, such as powering long-haul trucks. The non-return-to-base nature of long-haul trucks requires a large natural gas refueling infrastructure, for which the costs and benefits have not yet been assessed. This paper assesses the spatial distribution, capacity, and economic feasibility of a national natural gas refueling infrastructure for long-haul trucks in the United States. For a small share of natural gas-powered trucks in the total fleet (1%-5%), a national liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling infrastructure would require from 105 to 193 refueling stations at a capital investment of $263-$483 million (assuming a truck range of 320-960 km or 200-600 mi). The share of LNG trucks has to be greater than 15.2% (assuming the minimum truck range is 320 km or 200 mi), 12.4% (480 km or 300 mi), or 9.5% (960 km or 600 mi), so that the national infrastructure achieves net profits for baseline economic assumptions [$0.05/diesel gal. equivalent (DGE) profit margin, 7% discount rate, and 20 years]. Building a national compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling infrastructure requires more investment because a fast-fill CNG refueling station costs more and has lower capacity compared to an LNG counterpart. However, the CNG refueling infrastructure achieves better economic returns due to a higher assumed profit margin ($0.1/DGE). As the diesel price has the largest effect on the adoption of natural gas trucks, plans to build natural gas refueling infrastructures face significant challenges during times of low diesel prices. A practical strategy is to first target regional highway networks (such as those in California and Texas) to take advantage of high truck activities within regions, favorable market conditions, and supportive government policies.

Barriers Affecting Effective Application of Anticorruption Measures in Infrastructure Projects: Disparities between Developed and Developing Countries	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Global corruption; Barriers; Infrastructure; Project and organizational management	GREEN BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; PUBLIC PROCUREMENT; CORRUPTION; STRATEGIES	This study examines the critical barriers that obstruct the full potency and the intended effectiveness of anticorruption measures (ACMs) enforced to mitigate the pervasiveness of corrupt practices in project procurement and execution. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive review of related literature was conducted and resulted in the identification of 17 critical barriers. An expert survey was conducted with 65 experts from around the world involved in infrastructure project procurement and management using the purposive sampling technique. The analysis was conducted on a contextual comparative basis, thus, comparing the views of experts from the developed countries against the experts from the developing countries. The leading barriers identified by the respondents from the developing context were the absence of political will by government officers and statutory professional councils to fight corruption and personal attitudes, which include the lack of will to become involved in fighting corruption. The respondents from the developed world revealed that nonfamiliarity with ethical codes, the fear of being caught reporting, and personal attitude were the leading barriers. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the statistical difference regarding the barriers' criticality between the two contexts. This study contributes to a deepened understanding of corruption by examining the criticalities of barriers to the effectiveness of ACMs, which have not received the needed attention in the past. The study also reveals that the prevalence of corruption in infrastructure projects is not attributed to the causes and vulnerabilities only; it is also attributed to the identified barriers. As this study informs policymakers, anticorruption institutions, and academic and industrial researchers about the barriers that are likely to be encountered in enforcing and applying the stipulated ACMs, it is also intended to contribute to the strategic development of a more holistic approach in annulling corrupt practices in project procurement and execution.

Impacts of multi-layer chain subcontracting on project management performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multi-layer chain subcontracting; Project management; Project performance; Construction; Hong Kong	SYSTEM	This paper investigates the impacts of applying the multi-layer chain subcontracting system on project management performance with reference to Hong Kong construction industry. Multi-layer chain subcontracting system is widely used within construction industry as it is considered advantageous in many aspects such as better efficiency of subcontractors' operation due to their unique skills. However, the fact of poor quality products in construction practice raises the doubt about the effectiveness of the chain system. Accordingly, the reasons why the applications of the system contribute to poor project performance are examined. A survey conducted in the Hong Kong construction industry demonstrates that the multi-layer chain subcontracting system, while widely adopted, is largely flawed. Based on the survey results, application of multi-layer chain subcontracting system contributes largely to the poor performance across the all major aspects including quality and time management. cost control, and communication and coordination performance. The association exists between poor project management performance and the increase of the number of layers in the chain of the subcontracting arrangement. The long communication chain because of the increasing layers of subcontractors results in various problems such as communication errors, poor supervision on the bottom-layer contractors. Consequently overruns in cost and time, and abortive and remedial works are common. Recommendations for improving the practice are suggested and explored, including change the practice of the "lowest bid" to an approach which incorporate both price and technical performance, limit the number of subcontracting layers, restrain the use of "supply-and-fix" subcontracting arrangement, and enforce the implementation of government regulations. The findings of this study provide useful references in examining the practice of subcontracting system in other construction industries and identifying the areas where the improvements can be made for gaining the benefits of using the system.

J	Zhu, LY; Cheung, SO; Gao, XL; Li, Q; Liu, G				Zhu, Liuying; Cheung, Sai On; Gao, Xinglin; Li, Qian; Liu, Gang			Success DNA of a Record-Breaking Megaproject	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project; Project control; Incentivization	INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; INCENTIVE MECHANISMS; AGENCY-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; CONTRACTS; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MODEL	After 8 years of construction, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) came into use in October 2018. The HZMB is currently the world's longest oversea bridge. The HZMB is technically demanding for both the physical conditions and the stringent environmental protection measures. In addition, the involvement of three regional governments gave rise to complex coordination and communication issues. All these challenges called for supereffective project management. Notwithstanding, notable accomplishments were reported and more than 450 patents were obtained. For example, the rapid island formation technology used greatly shortened the construction period and saved cost. The project can be identified as a showcase of the latest oversea bridge construction technology. To unveil the success DNA of this record-breaking megaproject, an in-depth case study was conducted. While many reported case studies on the HZMB project have focused on the technical aspects, this case study takes a project management perspective. Through structured interviews, the HZMB project team members commented that the project reputation evaluation system (PRES) used in the project incentivized the contractors' performance through building an interorganizational relationship (IOR). This observation is in line with the proposition advocated in the IOR literature-an enhanced relationship has a positive effect on project performance. The comment of the project team member is further supported by the analyses of 28 sets of quarterly PRES evaluation scores that are reflective of IOR determinants. This study concludes that: (1) the PRES is an instrumental project management tool, and (2) one of the functions of the PRES is building IOR. The theoretical framework and empirical evidence showcase exemplary project management. Accordingly, it is further recommended that for megaprojects: (1) monetary reward cannot be the singular performance motivator, (2) IOR maintenance should be one of the planning foci of incentivization, and (3) there is no substitute for seamless communication in project management.

Enhancing the Knowledge of Construction Business Failure: A Social Network Analysis Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DEFAULT PREDICTION MODEL; CONTRACTOR DEFAULT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE FAILURE; DEA-DA; FIRMS; COMPANIES; INSOLVENCY; CENTRALITY; PROJECTS	The failure of construction companies is quite crucial because it results in unfinished projects and responsibilities that in turn result in many losses to governments, economies, owners, creditors, and surety companies. Previous research on the prediction of construction business failure utilized insolvency causes that were either arbitrary or based on the availability of data. Many scholars have shown the absence of, and need for, a holistic framework for the identification of the causes of construction business failure. As such, this paper reviews previous literature incorporating construction business failure applications, with the objective of identifying existing knowledge, current gaps, and needed future research directions on the different failure factors in a comprehensive approach. To this end, the authors (1) performed a meta-analysis of previous research work for a 30-year period spanning from 1988 to 2018; (2) identified and defined failure factors that impact the business operations of construction firms; and (3) utilized social network analysis to quantitatively identify the overlooked and missing construction business failure factors. Research results indicate that there are 20 factors that could collectively contribute to business failures of construction firms. It is also shown that there is a dire need for future research to better explore the impacts of some understudied critical factors, including the effect of inadequate company organizational structure and human capital on construction business failure. Another important finding is the absence of models that include a holistic incorporation of all 20 construction business failure factors. The findings herein are a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on construction business failure because they integrate the outcomes of previous works and use them to provide robust foundations for knowledge advancement. The presented guidelines are believed to close areas where an abundance of research work occurs and to unveil areas where additional research is necessary.

Design/methodology/approach The principle to evaluate the CR of PPP projects is to calculate three critical indicators: the default probability (DP), the recovery rate (RR) and the exposure at default (EAD). The RR is determined by qualitative analysis according to Standard & Poor's Recovery Scale, and the EAD is estimated by NPV analysis. The estimation of the DP is the focus of CR assessment because the future cash flow is not certain, and there are no trading records and market data that can be used to evaluate the credit condition of PPP projects before financial close. The modified CreditMetrics model and Monte Carlo simulation are applied to evaluate the DP, and the application is illustrated by a PPP project finance case. Findings First, the proposed method can evaluate the influence of the project's cash flow uncertainty on the potential loss of the bank. Second, instead of outputting a certain default loss value, the method can derive an interval of the potential loss for the bank. Third, the method can effectively analyze how different repayment schedules and risk preference of banks influence the evaluating result. Originality/value The proposed method offers an approach for the bank to value the CR under PPP project finance. The method took into consideration of the uncertainty and other characteristics of PPP project finance, adopted and improved the CreditMetrics model, and provided a possible loss range under different project cash flow volatilities through interval estimation under certain confident level. In addition, the bank's risk preference is considered in the CR evaluating method proposed in this study where the bank's risk preference is first investigated in the CR evaluating process of PPP project finance.

J	Ko, CH; Li, SC				Ko, Chien-Ho; Li, Shun-Chi			Enhancing submittal review and construction inspection in public projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Submittal review; Construction inspection; Public projects; Pull system; Concurrent Engineering	MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Execution results of public construction projects are a critical concern for the general public. However, submittal review for public construction projects is currently conducted using the push system, resulting in significant submittal inventory. Under this system, change orders require amendments to the submittal inventory, resulting in waste through unnecessary resubmission and re-review. Furthermore, the current construction inspection method uses hold points, thus design or construction problems may be hidden in the inspection inventory, producing defective work and resulting in further waste. The purpose of this research is to develop an Integrated Review and Inspection System (IRIS) using a pull system and Concurrent Engineering (CE). IRIS integrates the requirements of submittal review and construction inspection standards for government quality regulations including the Three Levels Quality Management System (TLQMS). A stable construction flow is established by removing waste from current review and inspection processes. Concurrent submittal review is pulled by the construction status to reduce submittal inventory, with the knock-on effect of reducing the impact of change orders on construction flow, while concurrent construction inspection shortens inspection intervals. Design and construction errors are immediately revealed and amended to avoid defective construction and its ensuing rework. To verify the feasibility of the proposed IRIS, eM-Plant simulation software is used to analyze a construction case. The conventional review/inspection systems and IRIS are compared using computer simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed IRIS could reduce submittal inventory, decrease the impact of change orders on project duration, establish an on-site culture of quality control, and create a stable construction flow. This research presents one of the first attempts to apply pull systems and CE to improve submittal review and construction inspection processes. Research results could provide guidance for the establishment of a collaboration platform for project stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Soibelman, L; Kim, H				Soibelman, L; Kim, H			Data preparation process for construction knowledge generation through knowledge discovery in databases	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						data processing; databases; neural networks; construction industry; data analysis		As the construction industry is adapting to new computer technologies in terms of hardware and software, computerized construction data are becoming increasingly available. The explosive growth of many business, government, and scientific databases has begun to far outpace our ability to interpret and digest the data. Such volumes of data clearly overwhelm the traditional methods of data analysis such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries. The traditional methods can create informative reports from data, but cannot analyze the contents of those reports, A significant need exists for a new generation of techniques and tools with the ability to automatically assist humans in analyzing the mountains of data for useful knowledge. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are tools that allow identification of valid, useful, and previously unknown patterns so that the construction manager may analyze the large amount of construction project data. These technologies combine techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases. This paper presents the necessary steps such as (1) identification of problems, (2) data preparation, (3) data mining, (4) data analysis, and (5) refinement process required for the implementation of KDD. In order to test the feasibility of the proposed approach, a prototype of the KDD system was developed and tested with a construction management database, RMS (Resident Management System), provided by the U. S. Corps of Engineers. In this paper, the KDD process was applied to identify the cause(s) of construction activity delays. However, its possible applications can be extended to identify cause(s) of cost overrun and quality control/assurance among other construction problems. Predictable patterns may be revealed in construction data that were previously thought to be chaotic.

Reza; Chen, Chuan; Ma, Le			Foreign Direct Investment in Infrastructure Projects: Taxonomy of Political Risk Profiles in Developing Countries	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Political risk; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Investment decisions; Cross-border investment; Infrastructure investment; Developing countries; Cluster analysis	TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE; GROWTH; FDI; DETERMINANTS; INSTITUTIONS; INSTABILITY; ECONOMIES; STABILITY; REFORMS; ENERGY	Political risk is a recognized deterrent to foreign direct investment in infrastructure (FDII) in developing countries. The sensitivity of FDII to political risk is amplified above that of common foreign direct investment (FDI) as a consequence of the distinguishing characteristics of FDII: larger capital commitments, longer payback periods, and greater dependency on government stability. Moreover, developing countries experience political risk at higher levels than developed countries. Nevertheless, the literature remains conflicted as to the exact impact of political risk on FDI and infrastructure investment. Some studies reported the impact of political risk as considerable, whereas others reported it as marginal when corrected for other factors. This study seeks to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the effect of political risk on FDII. It draws on a database of 90 developing countries from 2006 to 2015. The hierarchical cluster method and general least-squares regression are applied to analyze this database against further FDII moderators identified in the literature: gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, GDP growth rates, macroeconomic conditions, and infrastructure stock, as well as 12 political risk indicators. Findings reveal that in about half of the countries, FDII is indeed sensitive to political risk, whereas in the other half, it is less sensitive. Moderating these outcomes are economic factors. In countries with higher GDP but lower GDP growth and higher stocks of infrastructure, political risk plays a stronger role in deterring FDII. However, when countries have lower GDP but higher GDP growth and lower stocks of infrastructure, political risk plays a lesser deterrent role in FDII. The identification of this duality of developing country infrastructure investment profiles will be of practical interest to both capital investors and those seeking investment.

J	Ershadi, M; Jefferies, M; Davis, P; Mojtahedi, M				Ershadi, Mahmoud; Jefferies, Marcus; Davis, Peter; Mojtahedi, Mohammad			Comparative Analysis of PMO Functions between the Public and Private Sectors: Survey of High-Performing Construction Organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management office (PMO); Functions; Performance; Public and private sectors; Construction organizations	PROJECT-MANAGEMENT OFFICE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; LIFE-CYCLE; IMPACT; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT; INDUSTRY; ENGINEER; REALITY	Public and private organizations are distinct in terms of ownership structure and stakeholders because they approach project management processes and structures differently. Thus, it is likely that they operate project oversight structures such as a project management office (PMO) differently and focus on a diverse set of functions. This study is dedicated to investigating PMO functions in these two cohorts of organizations to highlight their functional contrast through a quantitative survey in the Australian construction industry. The sample includes PMO units in high-performing organizations delivering successful projects in the construction industry. A literature review was conducted to identify possible functions followed by an empirical survey to solicit expert comments on the importance of each function. The results of an independent-samples t-test revealed a significant difference in the importance of three functions including (1) benchmarking best practices, (2) project management compliance, and (3) project governance, which indicate a distinction between the underpinning role that PMOs play in the public and private sectors. Following this test, the relative importance index (RII) was calculated to compare the importance level of functions and rank them across two sets of public and private organizations. The unique value that this work contributes to the construction engineering and management global community includes (1) exploring similarities and differences of PMO practice in the public and private sectors and (2) revealing the most important PMO functions in high-performing organizations, which can be applied to enhance the chance of PMO success. The findings address a research gap in the literature and contribute to the extant body of knowledge on how to configure effective PMOs in the construction context.

J	Yasunaga, Y				Yasunaga, Yuko			Why and How ITRS Worked to Recover the Breakdown of "Scaling Law" in 2000s-Structural Frame Analysis of Si-CMOS Semiconductor Technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transistors; Manufacturing; Patents; Electric breakdown; Electronics industry; Silicon; (Dennard&apos; s) Scaling Law; ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors); Moore&apos; s Law; planar technology; semiconductor; Si-CMOS; technology roadmap		International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is referred to as one of the most successful roadmapping attempts in high-tech industries. ITRS constantly gave orientation to industries (device/equipment/materials), academia, and governments for continuing miniaturization. The 2000s, the period of utmost attention to ITRS, is also the period of gradual "breakdown" of Dennard's Scaling Law which stipulates the "technological merits" attained by miniaturization of Si-CMOS semiconductors: 1) shrink in chip size; 2) lowered power consumption, and 3) boosted computation speed, simultaneously. The author discusses that ITRS of 2000s had worked for "recovering" the "breakdown" of the Law and that it is attributed to the highly structured nature of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies in a frame of "(manufacturing) process-device structure-function." Then, he evaluates the validity of the hypothesis by analyzing wide range of technologies newly introduced in 2000s, namely 1) variety of supplementary methods for "prolonging" the life of Argon Fluoride Laser lithography; 2) high-k dielectric membranes and metal gate for reducing gate-leak current; and 3) low-k dielectric membranes and strained-silicon transistors to boost computation speed. Thus, the author concludes that 1) ITRS at least functioned to let the consensus (among early adopters) be "established" in wide range of research community; 2) under the "gradual breakdown" of Dennard's Scaling Law in 2000s, ITRS worked to keep the Si-CMOS semiconductor's "killing-three-birds-with-one-stone" nature; and 3) the success of ITRS in 2000s is attributed to the structural frame of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies characterized as "fixed-in-total and disruptive-in-parts."

J	Gan, XL; Chang, RD; Langston, C; Wen, T				Gan, Xiao-Long; Chang, Rui-Dong; Langston, Craig; Wen, Tao			Exploring the interactions among factors impeding the diffusion of prefabricated building technologies Fuzzy cognitive maps	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Technology; Construction; Simulation; Approach	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; PRECAST CONCRETE SYSTEMS; GREEN BUILDINGS; WIND POWER; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; POLICY; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDUSTRY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the interactions of factors impacting the widespread adoption of prefabricated building technologies and the intervention strategies to facilitate the development of prefabrication based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). Design/methodology/approach Through in-depth interviews with six stakeholder groups, namely, the government, developers, designers, contractors, manufacturers and researchers, 13 critical factors were identified and used to construct stakeholder-grouped FCMs, which were further aggregated into a collective FCM. The complexity and density of the collective FCM and the centrality of factors in the FCM were examined. Subsequently, a series of "what-if" simulations of the collective FCM were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting prefabrication. Findings The results show that three factors including market demand, cost, and policies and regulations have been mentioned by all stakeholder groups. However, these factors were ranked differently by stakeholder groups, implying that different stakeholder groups perceive the barriers to prefabricated building technologies differently. FCM simulations show that strengthening policies and regulations yield the strongest overall effect stimulating prefabrication, alleviating the organizational and environmental barriers more than the technological barriers, while improving the knowledge and expertise alleviate the technological barriers more. These measures need to be accompanied by other approaches, such as reducing cost and improving quality. Originality/value Few studies aim to analyze the interactions among the barriers to prefabrication, while this study specifically investigates this issue by illustrating the complex interactions using FCMs. Few studies also aim to identify the intervention strategies promoting prefabrication based on a quantitative approach, while this study employs FCM simulations to directly simulate the effectiveness of different strategies to facilitate prefabrication in a quantitative manner.

J	Dulaimi, M				Dulaimi, Mohammed			The climate of innovation in the UAE and its construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Climate for innovation; UAE; Leadership; Organizational culture; Construction performance		Purpose The ability to develop new products and services has motivated the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to enter the global race for excellence and surprise the world with its iconic construction innovations. The key challenge for the UAE is how to encourage and enable organizations, public and private, to embrace innovation as the norm and create a positive environment for innovation. In this context, this study was carried out with the aim of examining the factors that can create innovation-conducive climate in construction and the measures that can be used to assess such a climate. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports research effort to develop and test a conceptual model that hypothesizes relationships amongst different constructs that make up the climate for innovation in UAE organizations, construction and non-construction. In verifying the conceptual model and testing the validity of the hypotheses, a quantitative study was conducted based on data collected via questionnaire survey. A total of 101 respondents participated in the study, majority of whom were employed in private international firms, semi-public firms and private local firms. Findings The findings showed that, overall, the climate of innovation in the UAE organizations is moderately strong where construction firms performed slightly better than non-construction firms in demonstrating an innovation-conducive atmosphere. In this context, the results found a need for senior management to provide tangible support in terms of providing more resources for the skill base to develop further and seek better ways of developing creative solutions. The main conclusion provided evidence that leadership has positively influenced the climate for innovation and as a result delivered an improved business performance. Originality/value The research developed a new conceptual model and the constructs that can be used to understand the climate for innovation and assist researchers in examining the complex dynamics of innovation in the local construction industry.

J	Vogl, B; Abdel-Wahab, M				Vogl, Bernard; Abdel-Wahab, Mohamed			Measuring the Construction Industry's Productivity Performance: Critique of International Productivity Comparisons at Industry Level	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; International benchmarking; Construction industry; National accounts data; Performance measurement; Labor and personnel issues	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; TRENDS; US	The authors review work on international comparisons of construction productivity performance by providing an in-depth critique of the existing literature and highlighting the existing methodological challenges. Using studies and data on the United Kingdom's relative construction productivity performance as an exemplar, it is suggested that any investigation of international productivity differences in construction at the industry level is highly problematic because these productivity estimates do not compare like for like. Data definitions and coverage differ substantially across countries. In addition, deflators and exchange rates used to convert output into a common currency are unreliable. While the new standard industrial classifications 2007 could provide a better basis of cross-country productivity comparisons and further research on deflators, conversion rates, labor inputs, and capital stock estimates could improve the robustness of international comparisons, there are conceptual limitations to an industry-level approach. This paper's contribution is to discuss these methodological challenges in detail and propose a research agenda for enhancing cross-country productivity comparisons for informing government policy intervention on productivity improvement. The authors argue that cross-country productivity at the project level can enable a more detailed analysis of the tangible and intangible inputs to the construction process while accounting for the heterogeneous nature of the industry. However, the existing project-based productivity measures fall short of providing a common framework for systematically gathering comparable cross-country productivity data that could enable robust benchmarking. The authors conclude by calling for the need of facilitating the collection and analysis of robust project-level productivity data, e.g., through an international benchmarking club, in order to support effective policy intervention for enhancing construction productivity performance.

J	Hwang, S; Park, M; Lee, HS; Lee, S; Kim, H				Hwang, Sungjoo; Park, Moonseo; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Lee, SangHyun; Kim, Hyunsoo			Postdisaster Interdependent Built Environment Recovery Efforts and the Effects of Governmental Plans: Case Analysis Using System Dynamics	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case studies; Computer-aided simulation; Disaster recovery; Dynamic analysis; Rehabilitation; Project planning and design	NATURAL DISASTERS	Because diverse functional losses of the overall built environment (e.g., buildings, industrial facilities, and civil infrastructure) from a disaster event cause tremendous inconveniences to refugees, it is essential to implement swift recovery plans. However, in a post-disaster recovery situation, when resources and time are severely limited, there exist difficulties in implementing appropriate plans. These difficulties are attributable to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall recovery processes, caused by associated interdependency among the functions of a facility/infrastructure and the dynamic features of multiple recovery efforts. Thus, this research develops a system dynamics (SD) model to understand overall recovery efforts in the whole region from a holistic perspective. Based on an actual disaster case (the 2011 earthquake of Tohoku), this research conducts a case study to analyze the effectiveness of governmental plans. The simulation results show that governmental plans primarily aimed at recovering the daily lives of populations may not always be helpful for rapid restoration operations. The findings also suggest that considering the associated interdependency among built environment functions in recovery planning is key to supporting not only the rapid functional recovery of the facilities but also the improvement of poor restoration work environments. In this situation, the timely uses of preplanned and government-centered recovery programs (e.g., temporary housing and temporary debris movement) can be more effective with a comprehensive understanding of dynamic features in interdependent and multiple recovery efforts. Further, it is expected that these analytical capabilities have the potential to support recovery planners both in developing effective special recovery programs and in providing improved institutional strategies. Policy implications and lessons learned from a past recovery case can also be helpful in providing specific guidelines for future disaster recovery planning.

J	Kar, S; Jha, KN				Kar, Santu; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Exploring the Critical Barriers to and Enablers of Sustainable Material Management Practices in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable material management (SMM); Enabler; Barrier; Construction; Exploratory factor analysis; Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM)	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; PROJECT SUCCESS; PUBLIC-SECTOR; PLS-SEM; PROCUREMENT; ORGANIZATIONS; FRAMEWORK; DRIVERS	Sustainable material management (SMM) has great potential to lower the adverse environmental and social impacts of construction, which is a major concern. However, studies of SMM and its barriers and enablers in the construction industry are limited. Moreover, past studies failed to examine how these barriers and enablers influence the implementation of SMM practices. This study identified the critical barriers and enablers in the construction industry by examining their relationship with SMM practices. To address this, 17 SMM practices, 16 barriers, and 20 enablers were recognized from an extensive literature review and a discussion with three experts. Responses from 102 material management experts were collected conducting a questionnaire survey. Following this, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted to extract the factors. A hypothesized model was developed and tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), which indicated a significant relationship between barriers and enablers on the one hand and SMM practices on the other hand. Optimum use of resources and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives; stakeholders' commitment; health, safety, and environment (HSE) initiatives; government directives; and organizational initiatives toward SMM were found to be the critical enabling factors for SMM engagement, whereas inadequate strategies, policies, and regulations on SMM; inadequate resources and managerial attributes; lack of organization's and other stakeholders' support; and unethical professional practices were found to be the critical barriers to SMM engagement. This study will help construction practitioners and policymakers adopt an appropriate strategy for SMM engagement in the construction industry. Moreover, this study provides comprehensive insight into the critical factors influencing SMM engagement in the construction industry, which is unexplored in the literature, and thus adds value to the existing knowledge related to SMM.

Design/methodology/approach - Through a literature review and survey interviews the success criteria for the implementation process of PPPs are documented. Process success criteria findings are used to populate the content of the phase-oriented evaluation. The result is then tested, revised and improved through follow-up expert interviews. Findings - This paper identifies PPP project process success criteria. Using these criteria, a phase-oriented evaluation framework is developed. Moreover, in consultation with industry experts in the PPP field, eight evaluation aspects were determined: confirmation of project compliance and performance, confirmation of value for money, confirmation of financial affordability, trend analysis of annual performance appraisal, risk review and early warning, rebankability analysis, project externality analysis, benchmarking analysis of similar projects. These eight application aspects are analyzed in the light of the outcomes of the resulting phase-oriented evaluation framework. Research limitations/implications - The results of the research can only provide researchers and practitioners with generic insights regarding inputs into a phase-oriented evaluation of PPP projects. For any specific PPP project, the focus and priority of the evaluative content will vary. Practical implications - A phase-oriented evaluation of PPP projects is put forward. This will allow project stakeholders to better track the progress of projects throughout what can be a lengthy implementation stage. Originality/value - This study can provide governments and stakeholders with a new, theoretical understanding as to factors required of an effective phased evaluation of China's PPP projects. In that regard it will be significant value in PPP project policy and decision-making.

J	Gounder, S; Hasan, A; Shrestha, A; Elmualim, A				Gounder, Sheetal; Hasan, Abid; Shrestha, Asheem; Elmualim, Abbas			Barriers to the use of sustainable materials in Australian building projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainable materials; Sustainability; Building projects; Australian construction industry	CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; MATERIALS SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; GREEN BUILDINGS; DESIGN; MODEL; DRIVERS; OPTIMIZATION; INDICATORS	Purpose Although the adverse effects of construction activities on the environment and the need for sustainable construction practices are recognised in both research and practice, any significant shift in the selection and use of construction materials from the sustainability perspective has not taken place in many building projects. Still, conventional construction materials are widely used in building projects in both developed and developing countries. This study attempts to identify the main barriers to the use of sustainable materials in building projects in an advanced economy such as Australia. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a questionnaire survey approach to examine the main reasons behind the low usage of sustainable materials in building projects. Based on the relative importance index, exploratory factor analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis, the study examined the main barrier measures and barrier factors to the use of sustainable materials in building projects. Findings The findings reveal that critical barriers to the use of sustainable materials are related to cost and profit considerations, the unwillingness of the key stakeholders to incorporate these materials into building projects, lack of incentives and government policies. The factor analysis reduced the critical barrier measures into three factors: techno-economic considerations, cost and delay concerns and resistance to use. Furthermore, multinomial regression analysis based on the extracted factors identified techno-economic considerations as the main barrier factor to the use of sustainable materials in building projects. Practical implications The empirical results of this research can inform construction practitioners, organisations and policymakers on how to increase the use of sustainable building materials in the construction industry. Originality/value Identification of barriers to the use of sustainable building materials is a prerequisite to improve their uptake and use in the construction industry. The study fills a gap in the existing research on the use of sustainable materials in building projects in Australia.

This study also presents the possible directions that the PPP research may go towards in the future, arguably. Design/methodology/approach This study carried out a top journal-based search to identify the quality PPP articles published from 2009 to 2019. A total of 12 top-tier construction journals were systematically searched in the database of web of science (WOS), from which 279 PPP articles were identified for review. Findings The number of the identified articles, the titles of the journals, institutions, the most cited papers, and prevalent research methods were analyzed and compared. The existing PPP studies in construction journals were classified into seven streams. Through analysis of the PPP research status and gaps, five future research directions were revealed. Originality/value This study contributes to the current body of knowledge by revealing the research trend of PPP from 2009 to 2019. It presents the change of PPP development trend in the past decade through comparison with Keet al.(2009). It also reveals the major research streams and points out the directions that the PPP research may go towards in the future. Moreover, this study is helpful to the practice as well. It can enhance the practitioners' understanding of the PPP development in the past decade. In addition, it identified the research institutions contributing the most in the area of PPP, which may serve as valuable reference for practitioners to locate the best institutions for consultancy or collaboration.

J	Bowles, G; Morgan, J				Bowles, Graeme; Morgan, James			An evaluation of the performance of a large scale collaborative procurement initiative in the social housing sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Financial performance; Collaboration; Partnering; Social housing; Procurement efficiency		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors relating to the implementation of a new procurement initiative that affect performance and value for money (VFM). The study is based on a four-year research project carried out on behalf of the Scottish Government to monitor and evaluate the performance and efficiency of a bulk procurement vehicle for social housing. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers had a brief to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the procurement process and its influence on cost and efficiency targets. The study employed a mixed method approach with annual rounds of qualitative and quantitative data collection from project stakeholders including the contractors, consultants, clients and sponsor. Confidential semi-structured interviews were conducted on conclusion of the project to gauge views on how well the procurement process worked from the various perspectives and to reflect on the influence of the process on VFM. Findings - The procurement programme failed to achieve the capital cost and efficiency savings targets quantified at the outset and on this measure alone VFM was not demonstrated, although there were a number of reported benefits. A major factor was the extent of process and behavioural change required from the project team and, although a procurement consultant was engaged to facilitate this, the theoretical benefits of "best practice" were not realized. The picture was further complicated by rapidly changing economic conditions experienced, and debate about the robustness of original cost savings targets. Research limitations/implications - The findings and conclusions are of relevance and interest to clients and construction organisations undergoing change through adopting novel procurement processes. Originality/value - The empirical nature of the study provides a comprehensive evidence base for the performance of a collaborative procurement programme and an understanding of the potential difficulties in attaining the theoretical benefits of procurement innovation.

J	Luo, LZ; Mao, C; Shen, LY; Li, ZD				Luo, Li-zi; Mao, Chao; Shen, Li-yin; Li, Zheng-dao			Risk factors affecting practitioners' attitudes toward the implementation of an industrialized building system A case study from China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; Risk; Case study; Industrialized building system; Practitioner; Risk factor	OFF-SITE PRODUCTION; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; HONG-KONG; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; OFFSITE PRODUCTION; PREFABRICATION; BARRIERS; MODEL; INNOVATION	Purpose - An industrialized building system (IBS) is regarded as an effective residential building system that provides several benefits, including high quality, low cost, short time, good flexibility, reduced waste, and strong environmental performance. This system is considered to be valuable in promoting sustainable practices in China, where plans for urbanization have been established. However, the adoption of IBS in China is extremely limited. Potential risks exist and affect the attitudes of practitioners toward the use of this system. The purpose of this paper is to prioritize and analyze these risks and to develop corresponding strategies for mitigating these risks in China. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 24 risks that inhibit the implementation of IBS in China are identified through literature review and examined through interviews for consistency. A questionnaire survey is conducted to quantify the significance of these risks. Cronbach's coefficient a is employed to measure the internal consistency among the risk factors. The survey results are further analyzed using three case studies. Findings - The top five risks identified are "poor cooperation between multi-interface," "inappropriate design codes and standards for industrialized buildings," "lack of management practices and experiences," "enormous difficulty in achieving return on high initial investment," and "lack of a quality monitoring mechanism for the production process." The findings emphasize the government's leading role in promoting the new building system in its introduction and enforcement of adequate policies and regulations. Practitioners are also instrumental in establishing proper understanding and knowledge of IBS and its application. Originality/value - This study bridges the knowledge gaps on risk identification for implementing IBS in China. The findings provide practitioners and decision makers with valuable references for adopting adequate risk management methods and policies to promote IBS in China.

Data-Driven Predictive Modeling of Highway Construction Cost Items	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data-driven predictive modeling; Construction cost; Highway construction; Cost forecast; Regression analysis; Machine learning	PROJECTS; ERROR	The highway network is an economically necessary form of transportation that has a significant impact on the quality of the life of the citizens who use it. Cost overruns in highway projects have been a universal occurrence that jeopardize the development, maintenance, and expansion of this vital infrastructure. Incorrect cost estimations can drive decision makers to pass ineffective policies that have played a large role in the cost overruns of transportation construction projects. The existing prediction models in the literature are limited in one or multiple areas of modeling approach, inputs, and model development robustness. In this research, a model was developed to accurately predict the total construction cost of highway projects by utilizing machine learning algorithms. This study developed a modeling pipeline to automate much of the cost forecasting process, reducing the amount of manual work and dependence on skilled data scientists. This study used the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT's) critical highway construction cost items between 2001 and 2017 to test the model. The highways of Florida were selected for testing due to the states' population growth, high immigrant population, logistics, and hurricane frequency. This study used a pool of five categories of independent variables (69 variables total), including the construction market, energy market, socioeconomics, US economy, and temporal variables, which were compiled from relevant sources and existing literature. The results revealed that our linear model exhibits superiority in generalization and prediction of cost items over nonlinear models and is capable of accurately forecasting highway construction costs. Our suggested approach in this study also provides more accurate forecasts for the detailed cost estimation by considering the monthly historical information for the average 92.6% of the six highway construction types mentioned with a 92.51% prediction accuracy. By employing our developed model, local governments, network operators, contractors, and logistics sectors would be capable of a more exact prediction of highway construction costs.

J	Dolla, T; Laishram, B				Dolla, Tharun; Laishram, Boeing			Bundling/unbundling decision in PPP infrastructure projects - the case of Guwahati city, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Public procurement; Transaction cost economics; Public-private partnership (PPP); Agency theory; Infrastructure delivery; Theory building; Auction theory		Purpose Bundled mode of public-private partnership (PPP) procurement has been a widely advocated governance structure of infrastructure delivery. The purpose of this paper is to identify the various aspects of how this bundling phenomenon has to be played out in practice and examines the implications of such decisions. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal case study with an Indian municipal solid waste (MSW) PPP project provides the necessary evidence on the identification of constructs which are deemed important in the decision making of bundling in PPP MSW projects. Transaction cost economics theory, agency theory and auction theory informed the development of theoretical constructs. The longitudinal case study used interviews, observations and documents analysis. Findings This study has highlighted the complexity inherent in bundling decision, arising out of the relatively scanty rationale by which stakeholders first developed. Not only they are very different from the practice, but also many assumptions are proved otherwise. Poor sectoral developments, hindrances arguably caused to innovation, increase in transaction cost and a decrease in the competition along with ex post characteristics such as unfavourable transaction attributes made bundling a too early proposition to Guwahati MSW project. This study suggests that strong liability of the bundling phenomenon was the above the rationale of typical PPP bundling benefits envisaged in the extant literature. It also shows that poor practice and decision making by immature clients would lead to project failure. Research limitations/implications A cognitive map emerged from the study on the failure of Guwahati project. An empirical generalisation can be attempted using multiple contrasting case studies to make the theory more acceptable. Practical implications The case illustrated why naive clients should not try PPPs in a bundled model. Accordingly, the developed framework would help the governments to create the right projects catalysing the bundling benefits and harness the full potential of private sector participation in future PPP projects. Originality/value The current study would be novel in advancing the theory of bundling in PPP projects. This would be of interest to academia and to industrial practice and policy.

J	Murguia, D; Demian, P; Soetanto, R				Murguia, Danny; Demian, Peter; Soetanto, Robby			The role of the industry's cultural-cognitive elements on actors' intention to adopt BIM: an empirical study in Peru	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modelling; Construction industry; Peru; Cultural-cognitive elements; Institutions	BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; USER ACCEPTANCE; TECHNOLOGY; IMPLEMENTATION; SENSEMAKING; INNOVATION; DESIGN; ICT	Purpose The current understanding of building information modelling (BIM) adoption often neglects the industry context in which BIM is deployed. This is particularly problematic when policymakers are planning to enact top-down policies to promote BIM adoption in public-funded construction. Therefore, the aim of this study is to establish the industry-level factors that constraint or enable actors' intention to adopt BIM. Design/methodology/approach Using institutional theory with an emphasis on the cultural-cognitive elements, the authors aim to complement the understanding of BIM adoption by incorporating institutional elements into the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The cultural-cognitive elements were extracted from focus groups and interviews with architecture, construction and engineering (AEC) professionals in Peru. A modified UTAUT was empirically tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) with a dataset from 171 questionnaire responses. Findings The industry characteristics, standardisation, affordability and technology/methodology definition of BIM were found to be the cultural-cognitive elements having direct effects on individual reactions to BIM. These findings suggest that BIM adoption policies should focus on designing incentives schemes, training/educating professionals on BIM collaborative processes and developing/adapting applicable standards. However, a BIM adoption mandate would require policymakers to create collaborative procurement environments in tandem with information management and process standards. Practical implications Findings can be used by policymakers to significantly promote BIM adoption in contexts without a government mandate for public sector construction. Originality/value The study of institutional elements on BIM adoption is still limited. This study provides empirical evidence on how the cultural-cognitive elements of the industry context are associated with actors' intention to adopt BIM. Therefore, this study bridges industry and individual levels of analysis. Furthermore, this study enables policymakers to initiate actions that significantly encourage BIM adoption.

J	Kamunda, A; Renukappa, S; Suresh, S; Jallow, H				Kamunda, Andrew; Renukappa, Suresh; Suresh, Subashini; Jallow, Haddy			BIM in the water industry: addressing challenges to improve the project delivery process	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design management; Construction; Water industry	CONSTRUCTION; UK	Purpose The UK water industry is a private sector that has no government mandate to implement building information modelling (BIM) but would benefit from its use. Research has identified that fragmentation and inefficiency still existed in the water industry project delivery processes. These issues can be addressed by harnessing the collaboration that BIM brings by using emerging information technology. The UK water industry has had little research in the use of BIM in the project delivery processes over the years. Design/methodology/approach The aim of the research is to explore and examine BIM elements currently used in the water industry, as well as understand the organisational cultural support for BIM. It also investigated the adoption of BIM which will enable to improve water industry project delivery processes. An empirical study was performed in the UK given the relatively new and unexplored nature of the research problem, a qualitative research methodology was adopted. In total, 14 semi-structured interviews from six water sector organisations were conducted to collect data, which was then analysed using thematic analysis for inference and conclusion. Findings The study identified that BIM has already changed how projects are delivered by the water companies and their supply chain. Use of emerging technology such as Autodesk Revit, Civil 3D and virtual reality has gained traction and is leading organisations to continue investing in these areas to remain relevant. Although staff training was offered by all organisations within the study cohort, some interviews still thought that more can be done by their organisations as BIM is still maturing. Those interviewed regarded BIM models as data and information rich with the ability to enable the supply chain to obtain quicker approvals. Originality/value The paper provides a richer insight into the understanding and awareness of BIM elements used in the water industry to improve project delivery processes. This study suggests that the water industry supply chain has taken positive steps and started to benefit from BIM use. It also recommends that there is a need for cross-sector collaboration to capture and share best and worst practices relating to BIM adoption in the water sector.

J	Zhang, S; Chan, APC; Feng, YB; Duan, HX; Ke, YJ				Zhang, Shang; Chan, Albert P. C.; Feng, Yingbin; Duan, Hongxia; Ke, Yongjian			Critical review on PPP Research - A search from the Chinese and International Journals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Public-private partnership; Review; Chinese journals; International journals; Research; China	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; RISK ALLOCATION; RELIABILITY; BOT	A significant number of literatures have concentrated on diverse issues related to Public Private Partnership (PPP) both in China and abroad. However, there is no systematic analysis on the PPP research progress and status in Chinese journals, which is worth investigating because China is one of the largest PPP markets globally. In addition, there are many PPP publications in international journals based on the context of China. A comparative study is still missing between the PPP publications in Chinese journals and international journals. This paper hence aims to conduct a critical review of PPP publications from selected first tier Chinese journals and international journals. Based on a three-stage literature review research framework, 615 and 70 high quality research papers on PPP topics were selected from Chinese and international journals in the last decade between 2005 and 2014, respectively. Main research methods, research topics and research findings were then identified through content analysis and statistical analysis methods. It is found that in these two journals the frequently adopted research methods are case study, literature review, modeling, questionnaire survey and comparison; and the popular research topics include PPP models and their application, risk management, financing and economic issues, legal and procurement issues, government regulation and guarantee. Comparison analysis results show that in terms of order of popularity, there are more similarities in the research topics than research methods in Chinese and international journals. The outcomes of this paper contribute to the PPP body of knowledge through summarizing PPP research in Chinese journals and international journals in the context of China. In addition, the findings are valuable for Chinese researchers to embark future research on PPP. This paper also breaks the language barrier and enriches western researchers a better understanding of the research status of PPP in the context of China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Akanbi, T; Zhang, JS				Akanbi, Temitope; Zhang, Jiansong			Framework for Developing IFC-Based 3D Documentation from 2D Bridge Drawings	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Industry foundation classes; Automation; Building information modeling (BIM); Bridge information modeling (BrIM); Bridge construction	BIM	Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely accepted in the industry and extensively used in supporting many construction tasks. In the government sector, the USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has implemented building information modeling (BIM) for bridge construction. Hence, state DOTs are now faced with heightened pressure in complying with the FHWA's Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) standardization. Although BIM can provide many benefits to DOTs, current BIM-based platforms for bridges are not fully developed to process traditional two-dimensional (2D) bridge drawings for BIM-based computational tasks involving existing bridges, for example cost estimation. Bridges are a critical infrastructure in any nation's economy, and by law the DOTs are tasked with ensuring that they remain safe for use. To maintain bridges, engineers currently perform periodic inspections, assessing each part of the bridge to identify areas that require maintenance. Maintenance work items are then generated for these areas; these are usually computed traditionally or by systems that still rely heavily on manual inputs. Such processes are time-consuming and cumbersome, and depend on years of bridge technical expertise. To overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy of processes such as generating maintenance work items for bridges, we propose a framework for automatically (1) processing existing 2D bridge drawings for bridges built pre-BIM adoption in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry; (2) converting these record drawings into three-dimensional (3D) information models; and (3) converting 3D information models into industry foundation class (IFC) files. The developed 3D models using the proposed framework were compared against developed 3D models using the state-of-the-art method. Experimental results show that the developed framework can be used in developing algorithms that generate 3D models and IFC output files from portable document format (PDF) bridge drawings in a semiautomated fashion. The proposed method uses 3.33% of the time it takes the current state-of-the-art method to generate a 3D model, and the generated models are of comparative quality.

J	McGibbney, LJ; Kumar, B				McGibbney, Lewis John; Kumar, Bimal			An intelligent authoring model for subsidiary legislation and regulatory instrument drafting within construction and engineering industry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building regulations; XML; Authoring; Crown Legislation Markup Language; Akoma Ntoso; Ontology; SPARQL		Of primary importance within the domain of open data and more specifically open legislation, lies the essential central requirement for data to be available in a user-oriented manner; whereby the public and professionals alike can consume, share, reproduce it upon request and utilise it when time demands. Focusing specifically on subsidiary legislation (SL), current drafting workflows fall far short of addressing this vision. Whilst a significant amount of recent research has focused on less technical issues such as the actual definition of open data itself, the case for open data as to its management within a legal context, etc. due to the domain specific nature of producing robust and technically accurate open datasets, little work has been done on techniques for the drafting of legislative resources (in particular SL) as open data. To address this problem our work exercises a use-case driven from the domain of sustainable design and construction. As a validation vehicle, we select Scottish building regulations, which govern 32 local authorities across the country as a typical example of such legislation. Our work focusses on three areas of particular importance, (i) observing ongoing practice within the government organisations responsible for the drafting and publication of the aforementioned texts, (ii) understanding the means and methods utilised by local authorities which have been tasked with ensuring that standards of compliance are met within all cases of design and construction, and (iii) reviewing and understanding how construction stakeholders actually execute their activities with respect to the texts in question. The outcome of our study has resulted in a methodology and subsequent production of an intelligent XML authoring workflow model (DROID-SL) for such documents which displays how legal texts of this nature can be better consumed within our society.

J	Pirzadeh, P; Lingard, H				Pirzadeh, Payam; Lingard, Helen			Working from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Health and Well-Being of Project-Based Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; Mental well-being; Construction; Work from home; Work&#8211; life satisfaction; Pandemic	PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; FAMILY CONFLICT; PARADOX; DEMANDS; CONSEQUENCES; QUARANTINE; TELEWORK; PROFESSIONALS; RESOURCES; STRESS	In the ongoing attempt to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and flatten the curve, governments and employers have encouraged (and in some cases required) workers to work at home. This sudden widespread shift to home-based teleworking was not anticipated. Consequently, the ability to make provisions to ensure the health and safety of workers was limited. Further, in many cases, the shift to working at home has been involuntary and likely to continue for an extended period. The study presented in this paper aimed to examine the health and well-being experiences in a sample of professional/managerial workers who were engaged in teleworking as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation developed. Data were collected from workers in the Australian construction industry who were required to work from home on alternate weeks to reduce the number of people in project offices. A multiwave survey was conducted at three construction projects. Longitudinal analysis of the data indicated a consistent gradual decline in the mental well-being of participants. The analysis identified a positive and significant relationship between work-life satisfaction and mental well-being and indicated that the effects of work hours, work pressure, work engagement, and work-life interference on mental well-being were mediated by the extent to which participants were satisfied with their work-life balance. Combining these results with qualitative comments made by participants helped to understand their varying experiences during the pandemic and the impact on their mental well-being. The results highlight the importance of considering work-life satisfaction and creating opportunities for improved work-family balance when designing teleworking arrangements. The paper contributes to knowledge and practice by providing the evidence that helps organizations to maximize the health benefits and reduce the risks associated with home-based working during (and potentially beyond) the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the introduction of the BIM strategy has become a mandatory requirement by the government in order to reduce costs by 33% and speed up project delivery by 50% without sacrificing quality. Since then, the industry has seen a global reaction to the BIM Level 2 programme and a significant cost-saving in the UK of 1.2 pound billion in 2014/15, rising from 840 pound million in 2013/14. However, communication remains a major issue to achieve the BIM Level 3 as it requires all organisations involved to use a single platform to facilitate communication. This paper, therefore, fits within the BIM implementation programme by addressing the communication issues and construction defects on-site toward formulating a communication framework for the construction industry in the UK. This will help optimise communication and manage construction defects efficiently. The study takes advantage of the Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), the widely known management system and uses it to assign communication tools for each organisation in relation to the construction stages throughout two phases of data collection. Phase 1 involves two qualitative data collection methods of an in-depth review of the relevant literature (document analysis) and construction site observation. To facilitate site observation and data collection, the researcher collaborated with GF Tomlinson group, a Derby-based construction company, as the case study. Phase 2 involves an online survey, targeting a total number of 328 participants, including professionals and academics. Results of phase 1 are presented as the Communication Tools Assignment 1 (CTA1) and phase 2 results inform the Communication Tools Assignment 2 (CTA2). The study contribution is to develop a framework that recommends the appropriate communication tools for organisations at different construction stages, and which shows the possible types and causes of construction defects. Moreover, the study found three types of construction defects by applying 3D laser scanning for framework mentoring.

J	Pellegrino, R				Pellegrino, Roberta			Effects of Public Supports for Mitigating Revenue Risk in Public-Private Partnership Projects: Model to Choose Among Support Alternatives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership (PPP); Risk management; Revenue risk; Public supports; Win-win condition	PRICE-CAP REGULATION; REAL OPTIONS; GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES; CONCESSION PERIOD; HIGHWAY PROJECTS; PPP; ALLOCATION; SUCCESS	Public supports for mitigating revenue risk in public-private partnership (PPP) projects are used for attracting private financing for public infrastructure. The difficult assessment of impacts that these supports may have on PPP projects may lead to choosing a nonoptimal form of guarantee. The intrinsic PPP project characteristic of partnerships among different actors lasting a long period imposes the simultaneous achievement of competing objectives and a greater transparency in risk allocation. This paper proposes a structured model for assessing and benchmarking the impact of different public supports released to mitigate revenue risk in PPP projects, from the standpoints of the private and public actors, for choosing the public support that better ensures the achievement of a win-win condition. First, we quantify the net benefit gained by each party under three support instruments, namely the minimum revenue guarantee (MRG), least present value of revenue (LPVR), and price cap (PC), by identifying the condition of satisfaction of the involved actors and analyzing the probability that such condition is not achieved for each party. Then, by applying the Monte Carlo simulation, we benchmark and choose the public support that ensures compliance with the win-win condition. We use two case studies to apply the model and a plan of experiments for investigating how the choice of the optimal form of public subsidy for revenue risk mitigation may change based on contextual factors and project characteristics. The results reveal that public supports are not beneficial to all parties, since they generate, under different conditions, unequal net economic benefits for the two parties and/or unfair risk allocation. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the win-win condition achievement, in terms of actors' performance and risk allocation, depends on the characteristics of the project and of public supports. The findings of the study emphasize the importance of the accurate selection of the form of public support before its releasement in order to ensure a successful PPP.

Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups with project management practitioners were used to collect in-depth qualitative data. This was then supplemented with a questionnaire, which included both closed questions and the opportunity for free text answers. Findings - The problem of getting better at stopping projects is both common and difficult to solve. It has many facets, which include complex people and cultural issues, processes and procedures as well as financial reporting and project governance. In order to improve, therefore, it is useful to address these different facets in a coordinated way using a capability approach with a focus on business value. Research limitations/implications - The data from practitioners are retrospective, as their actions were not actually observed by the researchers as they were happening. This means that faulty recollection may influence the results but, it also allows for insights from reflection to be incorporated. Practical implications - An organizational capability approach focusing on all three aspects of capability; people, processes and technology, can help organizations get better at stopping projects. Specific recommendations are provided and analyzed in terms of their respective capability focus. Social implications - If performance in terminating projects is improved, it has the potential for significant benefits and cost saving for society in terms of improved government services and the ability to halt projects around new policy initiatives when emerging evidence shows they will not work. Originality/value - It provides detailed practitioner input on the problem of stopping projects and suggests recommendations for improvement in the context of a structured organizational capability approach with reference to a particular framework, IT-CMF.

J	Shalaby, A; Ezeldin, AS				Shalaby, Amira; Ezeldin, A. Samer			A model for work packages optimization in results-based-finance projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Results-based-finance; Work packages; Optimization; Sanitation; Model; UML	GENETIC ALGORITHM; CONSTRUCTION	Purpose - In many developing countries, the sanitation sector constitutes a major part of their strategic plans of reform. Yet with the very limited budget of the public treasury, countries opt to major lending institutions for funds. "Results-Based-Finance" is a new funding mechanism that has proven its efficiency in achieving the necessary reform in sanitation sectors. Due to the complexity of the funding tool, it is crucial to be able to decompose the project into smaller packages to be able to effectively control the project. The objective of this paper is to reach an optimum packaging scheme that enables the project to be successfully managed through better planning and cost control practices. Design/methodology/approach - With the aid of Unified Modelling Language (UML), an algorithm is developed to map the logic behind the model suggested with detailed illustrations of its different modules. Object-oriented processes and operations are modeled using different diagrams of the language, which automatically generate the optimum packaging combination. The packaging model is then implemented via a number of computer-aided programs. The Microsoft Excel 2019 is used for calculation purposes. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language is used to make the model user-friendly for non-engineering stakeholders. The Palisade's Decision Tools Suite is used for the optimization process Findings - The model is validated through a case study of a mega sanitation project located in Egypt. The model output is not only the content of the packages but also a complete managing plan which demonstrates many useful information to the decision-makers and government officials. Originality/value - The research aim is to provide the construction industry with a tool that makes the packaging process of mega projects funded through the "Results-Based-Finance" mechanism, done in an automated manner. Moreover, the packages are selected in a way to optimize the project cashflow. Having the optimum package size shall ensure better planning and a more accurate cost control. Yet it is a challenging task; especially, when the project cash flow is very sensitive and intolerant to delays like in the "Results-Based-Finance" mechanism.	[Shalaby, Amira; Ezeldin, A.

J	Tawiah, PA; Russell, AD				Tawiah, Paul A.; Russell, Alan D.			Assessing infrastructure project innovation potential as a function of procurement mode	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN	The delivery of infrastructure projects as long-term capital investments is impacted in most cases by critical issues of budget constraints, program delays, quality and safety concerns, and an increasingly complex stakeholder environment. Innovation, as it relates to the physical, process, organizational/contractual, and financial/revenue dimensions of a project, has a central role to play in not only contributing to the requirements set for a wide variety of project performance metrics but also improving upon them. Proposed in this paper is a theory in the form of a set of factors (drivers/inhibitors to innovation) and related state values that influence the potential for the identification and adoption of innovations that improve project efficiency or offer increased value. This theory is embedded in a supporting assessment framework to assist with selecting and structuring a project's procurement mode to enhance the innovation potential of a project from the perspective of a government agency tasked with such decisions. The framework was developed in response to a lack of tools to help practitioners with tasks relating to innovation assessment, especially in regard to conducting a public sector comparator analysis when a public-private partnership procurement mode is being considered among others; and aligning terms and conditions in bid documents, requests for proposals, and concession agreements in a way that fosters beneficial innovations to the extent that factor states can be controlled. The framework provides the project evaluation process with a means of assessing project innovation potential at the very front end of the procurement mode selection process, and is meant to be comprehensive yet simple and easy to use in practice. It can also be used by researchers to help analyze on a postproject basis reasons why innovations were or were not adopted for a specific project context. The framework is applied to case studies on two infrastructure projects in Scandinavia and the United States to demonstrate its application and to assess the role that choice of procurement mode had in influencing the innovations used.

The application of an ANP-Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to assess lean construction management performance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Engineering project; Lean construction management performance; ANP-Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation	6 SIGMA; IMPLEMENTATION; TOPSIS; LOGIC	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a method for assessing the lean construction management performance (LCMP) of engineering projects using the analytic network process-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (ANP-FCE) model. Design/methodology/approach Literature review and questionnaire surveys were used to achieve an evaluation index system for LCMP. The data needed to calculate the weights of the indices were derived from questionnaire surveys. The ANP and the Super Decisions (SD) software were used to calculate the weights of the indices and verify the validity of the weights. The FCE was adopted to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LCMP, and the validity of the evaluation results was verified by applying the validity degree of maximum membership principle. The applicability of the method for evaluating LCMP was validated by empirical research. Findings The proposed method for assessing the LCMP using the ANP-FCE model is validated to be feasible. Decision makers can easily identify the strengths and weaknesses of lean construction (LC) management of the evaluated project from the evaluation results. Research limitations/implications Some subjectivity may exist in the assessment process due to questionnaire surveys, and only one case has been studied to validate the applicability of the method. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to increase the number of LC experts and cases over the world to make the proposed method more standard. Practical implications The research is expected to propose an assessment method of LCMP for construction enterprises, provide a reference to develop assessment standards for LCMP for building associations or governments and help decision makers know the improving path of LC management. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature by summarizing the commonly used lean management tools for quality, cost, time, safety and organization in practice, and proposing a novel approach for assessing the LCMP of engineering projects. The study is useful for researchers, project managers and decision makers engaged in LC.	[Li, X. K.; Wang, X.

However, there is still an inadequacy of risk management applications in these projects and lack of research in this area. The study aims to improve the success of projects implemented through the BOT model in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach The study followed a sequential design including interviews and a questionnaire survey to investigate the perception of stakeholders from public and private sector regarding the probability of occurrence and the severity of impact of risks in BOT transportation projects in Vietnam. Quantitative data from the survey was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics to explore the priority of risks as well as the differences in the perception between the public and private sectors. Findings The results showed that the top five most significant risks in BOT transportation projects in Vietnam are: (1) problems with land acquisition and compensation, (2) inappropriate location of toll booths, (3) public resistance to pay, (4) high toll rate and (5) lack of cash flow. With the exception of "lack of cash flow," there were no statistically significant differences in the rankings of individual risks between the public and private sector. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation in the overall rankings of all risks for both sectors. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring the probability of occurrence and the severity of the impact of risks in BOT transportation projects in a developing country like Vietnam which has not been extensively explored yet. Second, it provides an insight into the perception of stakeholders from the public and private sector regarding the level of risks which is very useful for potential stakeholders in making decisions when they intend to participate in such partnerships. Third, it enables the Vietnamese government to establish suitable policies related to such projects. These contributions are very important in improving risk management in PPPs in developing countries.

J	Cheung, E; Chan, APC; Kajewski, S				Cheung, Esther; Chan, Albert P. C.; Kajewski, Stephen			THE PUBLIC SECTOR'S PERSPECTIVE ON PROCURING PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS - COMPARING THE VIEWS OF PRACTITIONERS IN HONG KONG AND AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public Private Partnerships (PPP); Procurement; Public Sector Interviews; Hong Kong; Australia	CONSTRUCTION	Hong Kong has been one of the early jurisdictions to adopt Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for delivering large public infrastructure projects. The development of this procurement approach in Hong Kong has followed an intricate path. As such, it is believed that there are a number of areas which are interesting to unveil. As part of a comprehensive research study looking at implementing PPPs, interviews with experienced local industrial practitioners from the public sector were conducted to realize their perspective on the topic of procuring public works projects. Amongst these interviews, fourteen were launched government officials and advisers. The interview findings show that the majority of the Hong Kong and Australian interviewees had previously conducted some kind of research in the field of PPP. Both groups of interviewees agreed that "PPPs gain private sector's added efficiency/expertise/ management skills" when compared to projects procured traditionally. Also, both groups of interviewees felt that projects best suited to use PPP are those that have an "Economic business case". The interviewees believed that "Contractor's performance" could be used as key performance indicators for PPP projects. A large number of critical success factors were identified by the interviewees for PPP projects; two of these were similar for both groups of interviewees. These included "Project objectives well defined" and "Partnership spirit/commitment/trust". Finally it was found that in-house guidance materials were more common in the organizations of the Australian interviewees compared to the Hong Kong ones. This paper studies the views of the public sector towards the topic of PPPs in Hong Kong and Australia, which helps to answer some of the queries that both academics and the private sector in these jurisdictions are keen to know. As a result the private sector can be more prepared when negotiating with the public sector and realise their needs better, academics on the other hand are provided a wider perspective of this topic benefiting the research industry at large.

Although BIM pedagogical studies have been performed in different institutions, there has not been sufficient research providing a global perspective of BIM education and students' perceptions toward BIM practice and application following their learning progress. The purpose of this paper is to adopt student samples from Swinburne University of Technology (SUT, Australia), Wenzhou University (WZU, China) and University of Brighton (UK) as three case studies to investigate the BIM practice and application-related perceptions and motivations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the thorough understanding of the BIM pedagogical delivery including teaching contents and assessment methods among the three institutions, a questionnaire survey approach was adopted to collect AEC students' perceptions of BIM. Within each selected case, statistical analysis was conducted to investigate both the overall sample and subgroup differences regarding students' opinions on BIM's functions (e.g. as a 3D visualization tool) and BIM usefulness in various industry professions, their motivation in BIM-related jobs and their perceptions of challenges encountered in BIM practice and application. Multiple factors influencing BIM learners' perceptions were discussed, such as pedagogical assessment approach, and individual factors (e.g. disciplines). Findings - The results showed that students were able to discern the latest industry practices and critical thinking in BIM movements. For example, SUT students perceived more challenges from the government legislation or incentive policies, which was consistent with Australia's BIM policy movement. WZU students tended to have less positive views on BIM usefulness. The results also indicated fewer differences regarding perceived challenges among students from these three institutions. Originality/value - This study contributed to the body of knowledge in managerial BIM by focusing on learners' perceptions from the perspective of students' understanding, motivation and individual views of BIM, which were insightful to both BIM educators and employers. By initiating the framework of BIM learning process and its influence factors, the current study serves as a point of reference to continue the future work in strengthening the connection between institutional BIM education and industry practical needs worldwide.

Ranking the risk categories in international projects using the TOPSIS method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						MCDM; TOPSIS; International projects; Risk categories	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; FUZZY TOPSIS; SUPPLIER SELECTION; LOCATION SELECTION; PLANT LOCATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ROBOT; PERSPECTIVE; ENVIRONMENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the risk categories which are predominant in international projects and to rank them according to their effect on project success. Design/methodology/approach - A literature survey of peer-reviewed journal articles, survey reports and books on project management is used as the research methodology. One among the various multi-criteria decision making methods named as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has been used to rank the risk categories according to their importance. The data for TOPSIS were collected through questionnaire as the research instrument. Findings - The findings derived from evaluation of the publications led to the identification of eight different types of risk categories associated with international projects. The TOPSIS method resulted into political risks, technical risks and design-related risks as the top three risk categories in international projects. Contractual and legal risks and fraudulent practices-related risks are relatively low-ranked risk category. Research limitations/implications - The findings will be useful in successful implementation of international projects as the knowledge of risk categories and their ranking will help project manager to plan the risk response strategies. A larger sample size for decision makers and more variety of projects can give more exhaustive risk categories and their ranking. Practical implications - This paper explores eight different risk categories in international projects. It represents the ranking of risk categories according to their importance in project success. This will be helpful to project managers for developing a general framework for planning the appropriate risk response strategies. Social implications - Governments of many countries around the world are encouraging their industries to undertake and successfully complete projects in foreign countries. However, many industries experience failure in projects as they fail to implement the risk management (RM) effectively in international projects. This research work provides the risk categories in international projects and their ranking which can assist in developing strategies to respond the risk appropriately. Originality/value - This paper uses the TOPSIS method for ranking major types of risk categories in international projects. It might represent new opportunities for rigorous and relevant research that would contribute to an in-depth knowledge of RM methodologies.

Design/methodology/approach A scoping literature review was conducted to identify the fourteen barriers to implementation of BIM, which were employed to design a questionnaire survey. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, mean score, Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance and multivariate techniques such as factor analysis. Findings The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of ranking of the 14 barriers factors among the groups; however no statistically significant differences among the 14 barriers to BIM. Based on the mean score ranking results, only three (out of 14) barriers are identified as critical (mean score greater than 3.5): few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, inexistence or inadequate government policies, and high cost of implementation. The results of the one-sample t-tests show that they were statistically significant differences in 10 out of 14 barriers as follows: few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, lack of demand for use and acceptance of BIM, inadequate contractual coordination, lack of specified standards, cost of data and information sharing, technological availability issues, reluctance of other stakeholders, business and cultural changes, data and intellectual property issues, and interoperability issues. The study, through factor analysis, categorized the fourteen barriers to BIM implementation into four principal factors. The factors are: technology and business-related barriers; training and people-related barriers; cost and standards-related barriers; and process and economic-related barriers. Practical implications The identification and assessment of the key barriers to BIM implementation would be useful for the construction professionals and other stakeholder of the construction industry with the view to advance BIM adoption in Nigeria. This could also be extended to other developing countries through considerations of the local economic conditions, given the status of BIM as being in the germinating stage of development in Africa. Originality/value The study provides insights on the barriers to BIM implementation across the Nigerian construction sector environments. The innovative aspect of the study is the identification of the ordered and grouped (composite) set of barriers to BIM which could be used to developing appropriate mitigating solutions.

J	Odediran, SJ; Windapo, AO				Odediran, Sunday Julius; Windapo, Abimbola Olukemi			Mitigating Risks in African Construction Markets through the Interactive Behavior of Resources and Capabilities in Multinational Construction Companies and Entry Decisions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						African construction markets; Entry mode; Entry model; International construction; Resources and capabilities; Risk mitigation model; Risk perception; Strategic entry decisions	FOREIGN-MARKET; POLITICAL RISK; EXPORT INTENSITY; JOINT VENTURES; FIRM SIZE; MODE; INTERNATIONALIZATION; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; CHOICE	The presence of African-based construction companies in African markets is low compared with their foreign counterparts. Unlike local markets, overseas markets exhibit more types of risk. Perceptions of risk in overseas markets differ, and levels of resources and capabilities influence them. Adequate perception of risk also influences entry decisions. This paper examines whether interaction exists between the level of resources and capabilities in South African construction companies (SACCs) and their choice of entry mode in entry decisions, with a view toward mitigating the perceived impact of risks and enhancing ease of entry into African construction markets (ACMs). Research data were collected through a convergent mixed-methods research approach from SACCs graded 8 and 9 in the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) register of contractors in South Africa. It emerged that the significant risks in ACMs are payment risk, volatility in exchange rate and currency, threat of terrorism, legal instability, red tape/legislative bottleneck, and unstable government. Revenues, number of employees, and years of international experience significantly influence SACCs' perception of administrative delays, red tape/legislative bottleneck, and difficulty in doing business in ACMs. Moreover, the perceived impacts of the difficulty of doing business, the threat of terrorism, and political uncertainty influence the choice of joint venture (JV) and contractual arrangement (CA) as ACM entry modes. The study established that an interactive relationship exists between the choice of JV and assets and JV and number of employees and between the choice of CA and number of employees that can mitigate the perceived impact of risks. The paper concludes that as SACCs accumulate financial, human, and experiential capital, their perception of risks in ACMs becomes more favorable. However, adequate perception of risks in markets enhances the strategic choice of entry mode, and the interactions between SACCs' resources and capabilities and decisions on entry into ACMs mitigate the perceived impact of risks. This enables SACCs to compete favorably for business opportunities in ACMs and international space.

There is currently no framework for implementing lean construction specifically tailored to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) construction industry. Existing lean construction frameworks are focussed on other countries and are less applicable in the KSA due to differences in socio-cultural and operational contexts. Design/methodology/approach This study employs the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique for data collection and analysis. First, following a survey of 282 construction professionals, 12 critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing lean construction in the KSA construction industry were identified by Sarhan et al. (2016). Second, 16 of these professionals who have 15 years or more experience were exclusively selected to examine the contextual relationship among the 12 CSFs. A row and column questionnaire was used for a pairwise comparison of the CSFs. A matrix of cross-impact multiplications (MICMAC) was applied to analyse the questionnaire data to develop an ISM model that can serve as a framework for implementing lean construction. Third, the framework was subjected to further validation by interviewing five experts to check for conceptual inconsistencies and to confirm the applicability of the framework in the context of the KSA construction industry. Findings The findings reveal that the CSFs are divided into four clusters: autonomous, linkage, dependent and driving clusters. Additionally, the findings reveal seven hierarchies of inter-relationships among the CSFs. The order of practical application of the CSFs descends from the seventh hierarchy to the first hierarchy. Originality/value The new framework is a significant advancement over existing lean construction frameworks as it employs an ISM technique to specify the hierarchical relationships among the different factors that contribute to the successful implementation of lean construction. The primary value of this study is the development of a new framework that reflects the socio-cultural and operational contexts in the KSA construction industry and can guide the successful implementation of lean construction. Therefore, construction industry operators such as contractors, consultants, government departments and professionals can rely on the framework to implement lean construction more effectively and successfully.

J	Wang, ZS; Xie, WC; Liu, JK				Wang, Zhenshuang; Xie, Wanchen; Liu, Jingkuang			Regional differences and driving factors of construction and demolition waste generation in China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction and demolition waste generation; Regional difference; Environmental Kuznets curve; STIRPAT model	CO2 EMISSIONS EVIDENCE; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; HONG-KONG; MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DYNAMIC-MODEL; STIRPAT MODEL; IMPACT; URBANIZATION; SYSTEM	Purpose The growth of the Chinese economy has resulted in a significant increase in construction and demolition waste (CDW), and regional differences in CDW generation are gradually increasing. The purpose of this study is to investigate the regional differences in CDW generation and the driving factors that influence CDW generation in different areas of China. To provide a systematic advisement for local governments to select the appropriate policy, reduce CDW generation. Design/methodology/approach The generation of CDW was calculated by region, based on the area estimation method, from 2005 to 2018. The relationship between CDW generation and economic development, and the driving factors of CDW generation in different regions of China, was investigated using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model and the STIRPAT theoretical model. Findings CDW generation of China increased at the average annual growth rate of 10.86% from 2005 to 2018. The main areas of CDW generation were concentrated in the eastern and central regions, while the proportion of CDW generation in the northeast region decreased gradually, and the changes varied significantly across different regions. The EKC between CDW generation and economic development was established for the whole country, North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China and Northwest China. Three main factors based on the STIRPAT theoretical model were identified and explained into a framework to reduce CDW generation. The results provided a useful theoretical basis and data support guide for devising effective policies and regulations for the Chinese context. Practical implications The findings from this study can ultimately support policymakers and waste managers in formulating effective policies for waste management strategies and CDW-specific legislation. Additionally, it can help the coordinated reduction of CDW generation across regions in China and can support construction enterprises (in their development strategies), similar developing economies and foreign firms planning to operate in China. Originality/value This study contributes to the field through the STIRPAT model on driving factors of CDW generation in the Chinese context, in different regions.

J	Li, Z; Zhang, SW; Meng, QF; Hu, X				Li, Zhen; Zhang, Shaowen; Meng, Qingfeng; Hu, Xin			Barriers to the development of prefabricated buildings in China: a news coverage analysis	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Prefabricated buildings; Obstacle factors; News analysis methods; Sustainability; China	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; MODULAR CONSTRUCTION; BIM; STAKEHOLDERS; NEWSPAPERS; DIFFUSION; SYSTEMS; RISKS	Purpose The Chinese construction industry is experiencing a rapid growth these days. Due to the requirements of energy conservation, emission reduction and construction waste management, the development of prefabricated buildings (PBs) has attracted much attention in the Chinese construction industry. However, the development of PBs are still in their infancy in China, which have been negatively impacted by many obstacles. It is of great significance to clarify and analyze these obstacles for the purpose of promoting the development of PBs in China. Due to the wideness and complex features of obstacles, the existing literature exploring the research topic lacks comprehensiveness. The purpose of this paper is to systematically identify and discuss the obstacles that hinder the development of PBs in China. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts the method of news report analysis based on the news reports retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and nine major portals in China. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method of content analysis was used to rank the obstacles according to their importance. Findings A total of 79 obstacles to the development of PBs in China are identified, and the 79 obstacles are divided into 8 dimensions. Among the Top 20 obstacles, the government dimension accounted for the highest number of 5, the market and consumer dimension and development organization dimension were 4, Manufacturing Enterprise of Prefabricated Components (PCs) dimension, construction organization dimension and design organization dimension were 2, logistics enterprise dimension was 1, and industry association dimension was 0. Among them, the biggest obstacle is the high transportation costs. Research limitations/implications First, data collection may not be very comprehensive. Second, this paper is only based on the obstacles in the development of PBs in China, and the universality of the management conclusions needs to be further strengthened. Practical implications The research results help the stakeholders in the Chinese PBs industry to better understand the barriers hindering the industry development in a systemic way, which will help propose appropriate strategies to address these barriers. Originality/value This paper clarifies the obstacles of China's PBs and makes an analysis, which is of great value to the development of China's PBs.

J	Zahoor, H; Chan, APC; Gao, R; Utama, WP				Zahoor, Hafiz; Chan, Albert P. C.; Gao, Ran; Utama, Wahyudi P.			The factors contributing to construction accidents in Pakistan Their prioritization using the Delphi technique	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pakistan; Developing countries; Delphi survey; Construction accidents; Contributory factors; Inter-rater agreement analysis	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; INTERRATER AGREEMENT; WORK BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CLIMATE; IMPLEMENTATION; MAINTENANCE	Purpose - The highest number of accidents in proportion to the employment rate is found in construction industry among all industries in Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to identify and prioritize the contributory factors of accident causation that can significantly reduce the rate of accident in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 32 contributory factors of accident causation were identified through a triangulation strategy comprising eight face-to-face semi-structured interviews with the academic and industry experts coupled with a comprehensive literature review. Delphi survey was then conducted among the four respondent groups (clients, contractors, safety official and academia) to prioritize these factors. A consensus was achieved among the respondent groups after conducting two rounds of Delphi survey. Finally, the results were validated using the technique of inter-rater agreement (IRA) analysis. Findings - All the shortlisted accident causation factors were graded as "important" to "extremely important". Moreover, a "moderate" to "strong level" agreement was developed among the respondent groups. The three most significant factors were highlighted as "poor enforcement of safety rules and regulations by the Government agencies", "insufficient allocation of safety budget and safety incentives by the client", and "insufficient provision of safety training and resources by the contractor". Practical implications - The findings will help the key stakeholders to prioritize their energies towards achieving zero accident in the construction industry. Moreover, addition of academic experts as one of the respondent groups will enhance the linkages between the academia and the industry practitioners. Originality/value - Besides highlighting the underlying causes of construction accidents in Pakistan, a detailed methodology is presented in this study for the analysis and validation of the Delphi survey data, which can be extrapolated in other regions and industries for elements prioritization. The findings of the study can also be generalized for other developing countries having similar work environment. The results validation through the use of IRA analysis is an addition to the field of construction safety research. The study also authenticates the applicability of IRA analysis to assess the agreement level among the respondents.	[Zahoor, Hafiz; Chan, Albert P.

J	Sinoh, SS; Othman, F; Ibrahim, Z				Sinoh, Saznizam Sazmee; Othman, Faridah; Ibrahim, Zainah			Critical success factors for BIM implementation: a Malaysian case study	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling; Construction planning; Project management; Organization	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; ERP IMPLEMENTATION; BUILDING-PROJECTS; ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; PERCEPTIONS; FIRMS; COORDINATION	Purpose This paper aimed to identify critical success factors (CSFs) of building information modeling (BIM) implementation among architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) firms in Malaysia using quantitative statistical methods. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted on the population of all AEC firms in Malaysia to rank the relative importance of 15 success factors (SFs) for BIM implementation in the firm on a 5-point Likert scale. The sampling frame consisted of all members registered with the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) from which 184 responses were received. The distinction between SFs and CSFs was achieved by a normalized mean cutoff value. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the relative groupings of the CSFs and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to examine the underlying relationships between the CSF groupings. Findings Results of this study validated 11 previously identified CSFs for successful implementation of BIM among Malaysian AEC firms. Non-technical factors such as management, leadership and coordination were found to have higher relevance compared to technical factors such as software and hardware. Ranking analysis of the CSFs found internal coordination factors to have more importance compared to external coordination factors. PCA revealed 4 principal components (PCs) from the 11 CSFs. Together, these four PCs explain 74.3% of the variance in the data. Also, six hypothesized relationships between these groupings were supported using PLS-SEM. Research limitations/implications This study found an interaction between internal and external coordination factors for the implementation of BIM. Future research could explore the dynamics of both intra- and inter-firm coordination, which may create an environment suitable for BIM implementation. Practical implications This study provides Malaysian AEC firms with a general strategy on how to approach the implementation of BIM within the firm. In addition, government initiatives should focus on increasing BIM competency of graduates entering the workforce. This can be achieved through the development of a national BIM curriculum. Apart from that, the implementation of BIM requires a radical shift in the traditional building delivery process, not just simply acquiring new software and hardware. Originality/value This study revealed that the interactions between different firms at the industry level can influence successful implementation of BIM at the firm level. CSFs for BIM implementation at the firm level have been extensively studied. However, few studies exist which explore the inter-firm collaborations at the industry level that facilitate successful BIM implementation.

J	Loosemore, M; Higgon, D; Osborne, J				Loosemore, Martin; Higgon, David; Osborne, Joanne			Managing new social procurement imperatives in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration; Intermediary; Social value; Social procurement; Social innovation	SECTOR; ENTERPRISES	Purpose This paper responds to the need for more construction project management research in the emerging field of social procurement. It contributes by exploring the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and project-based intermediation in meeting new social procurement imperatives. Design/methodology/approach A thematic exploratory case study analysis is presented of seventy-three interviews undertaken with stakeholders involved in a unique project-based intermediary developed by a major Australian construction company to leverage the power of cross-sector collaboration in response to social procurement imperatives on its projects, based on semi-structured interviews with 33 disadvantaged job seekers, 40 organisational stakeholders (employment agencies; not-for-profits, Indigenous, disability and refugee support organisations; training organisations; subcontractors; government agencies and departments; community organisations) and observational and documentary data over the duration of a unique project-based intermediary called a Connectivity Centre, developed by a major Australian contractor to deliver on its emerging social procurement requirements. Findings The results show that cross-sector collaboration within the construction industry can produce highlight numerous cognitive, behavioural, health, situational and affective social impacts for the project community and shared-value benefits for the range of organisations involved. However, it is found that cross-sector collaboration through project-based intermediation in a construction context is challenging due to the fragmented and dynamic nature of construction project teams and the communities they have to engage with. Encouraging people and organisations to collaborate who operate in industries and organisations with different and sometimes competing institutional logics and objectives (even if they are linked by common values) requires a set of knowledge, competencies and relationships not recognised in current global project management competency frameworks. Originality/value This research contributes new insights to the emerging but embryonic body of research into construction social procurement by demonstrating the value of emerging theories of social procurement, social value, cross-sector collaboration and intermediation in enhancing our currently limited understanding of the complex challenges involved in responding to new social procurement requirements in the construction industry. It explores and documents the potential value of project-based intermediaries in developing and managing the new cross-sector relationships, roles, relational competencies and practices, which are required to effectively respond to and measure the impact of emerging social procurement policies in the construction industry. These findings have a potentially significant social impact by providing new insights for policymakers and the construction industry, to optimise the industry's response to emerging social procurement policies.

J	Zhao, YJ; Qi, K; Chan, APC; Chiang, YH; Siu, MFF				Zhao, Yijie; Qi, Kai; Chan, Albert P. C.; Chiang, Yat Hung; Siu, Ming Fung Francis			Manpower forecasting models in the construction industry: a systematic review	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						Construction; Manpower planning; Forecasting model; Project management	LABOR DEMAND; TIME-SERIES; RESEARCH TREND; DELPHI METHOD; WORKFORCE; REQUIREMENTS; PRODUCTIVITY; DISASTER; TOURISM; FORCE	Purpose This paper aims to make a systematic review of the manpower prediction model of the construction industry. It aims to determine the forecasting model's development trend, analyse the use limitations and applicable conditions of each forecasting model and then identify the impact indicators of the human resource forecasting model from an economic point of view. It is hoped that this study will provide insights into the selection of forecasting models for governments and groups that are dealing with human resource forecasts. Design/methodology/approach The common search engine, Scopus, was used to retrieve construction manpower forecast-related articles for this review. Keywords such as "construction", "building", "labour", "manpower" were searched. Papers that not related to the manpower prediction model of the construction industry were excluded. A total of 27 articles were obtained and rated according to the publication time, author and organisation of the article. The prediction model used in the selected paper was analysed. Findings The number of papers focussing on the prediction of manpower in the construction industry is on the rise. Hong Kong is the region with the largest number of published papers. Different methods have different requirements for the quality of historical data. Most forecasting methods are not suitable for sudden changes in the labour market. This paper also finds that the construction output is the economic indicator with the most significant influence on the forecasting model. Research limitations/implications The research results discuss the problem that the prediction results are not accurate due to the sudden change of data in the current prediction model. Besides, the study results take stock of the published literature and can provide an overall understanding of the forecasting methods of human resources in the construction industry. Practical implications Through this study, decision-makers can choose a reasonable prediction model according to their situation. Decision-makers can make clear plans for future construction projects specifically when there are changes in the labour market caused by emergencies. Also, this study can help decision-makers understand the current research trend of human resources forecasting models. Originality/value Although the human resource prediction model's effectiveness in the construction industry is affected by the dynamic change of data, the research results show that it is expected to solve the problem using artificial intelligence. No one has researched this area, and it is expected to become the focus of research in the future.

Design/methodology/approach The barriers to implementing RL in CRIP sectors in India were identified using a Delphi study. The interdependencies were identified using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). Further, using the Matriced' Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee a un Classement (MICMAC) analysis, the barriers were classified on the basis of their driving power and interdependencies. Findings The study has identified ten barriers that can hamper the application of an RL system in CRIP sectors. The finding of the ISM model shows that macro level barriers such as lack of awareness of reverse logistics, insufficient government policies and unavailability of standard codes stimulate each other and also drive all other barriers. The organization-specific barriers operating at the strategic/tactical level, namely, company's rigid mechanism, lack of awareness of economic profits, inadequate company's organizational policies and lack of training, reluctance from stakeholders, scarcity of resources and finance from company are found at the intermediate level of hierarchy and they can be influenced by the barriers at the lower level and influence the barriers on the and higher levels. The operational level barrier namely "Inadequate Information Technology system" is at the top of the hierarchy and can be driven by all the barriers at the lower level. Research limitations/implications The present findings are based on the opinions of experts only from Indian CRIP sectors so the results may require to be validated in other contexts. Practical implications The structural model presenting the interdependencies will be a guide for the CRIP supply chain professionals in understanding and ranking the barriers they may face while implementing the RL system. Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by providing a set of barriers and their interdependencies faced during the implementation of an RL system implementation in CRIP sectors. It is one of the first studies which identifies barriers applicable to the CRIP firms in India and models their inter-dependencies. Additionally Consequently, these firms can make a move forward towards a circular economy by overcoming these interlinked barriers.

J	Liang, YP; Ashuri, BAB; Li, MS				Liang, Yunping; Ashuri, Baabak; Li, Mingshu			Forecasting the Construction Expenditure Cash Flow for Transportation Design-Build Projects with a Case-Based Reasoning Model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Accurately forecasting the construction expenditure cash flow of transportation projects is critical for state departments of transportation (state DOTs) to secure sufficient funding to cover their fiscal obligations throughout the project development timeline. However, there is no quantitative model to assist state DOTs in accurately forecasting expenditure cash flows for design-build projects. At the outset of awarding a typical design-build contract, the design has not been finalized to enable exact quantities for a detailed cost estimate. This issue represents a big difference between design-build and design-bid-build projects that makes estimating the project payouts more difficult for design-build projects. This research for the first time creates an expenditure cash-flow forecasting model for transportation design-build projects based on case-based reasoning and a genetic algorithm. The model utilizes information about project-specific characteristics and external market factors. The applicability of the proposed model is examined on a data set of 33 transportation design-build projects delivered by Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) from April 2007 to January 2020. The results show great accuracy in forecasting expenditure cash flows of these projects. The major contribution of this study lies on the creation of a new forecasting model, which enables reasonably accurate prediction of expenditure cash flow of transportation design-build projects. This research identifies that even early at the procurement phase of a design-build project when exact quantities and detailed cost estimates have not been fully developed, the combination of conceptual project information and local construction market indicators offers the capability to predict the future expenditure cash flow of the project through establishing similarities between the project to be awarded and historical design-build projects. This research provides a novel approach to quantify the similarities that will be used as critical inputs into a case-based reasoning algorithm for predicting the expenditure cash flow of the project using expenditure records of most similar historical projects in the design-build data set. It is anticipated that transportation agencies can benefit from the forecasting model presented in this study by enhancing their processes of estimating their financial obligations on the onset of letting design-build contracts. The forecasting model will help transportation agencies to avoid underestimating and overestimating the capital needed to build a design-build project during the contract duration. Therefore, limited financial resources of transportation government agencies will be utilized more efficiently and effectively, and the likelihood of running into disputes for fund unavailability and cost overruns will be reduced.

J	Keenan, M; Rostami, A				Keenan, Mark; Rostami, Ali			The impact of quality management systems on construction performance in the North West of England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Quality management; quality management systems; construction performance; North West of England	ISO 9001	As the total construction output in the North West of England (NWE) is forecast to rise by an average of 2.5% over the next five years. It is imperative for organizations in the region to improve their overall construction performance, particularly if they are to hit the targets presented by UK Government in the construction 2025 report. Despite the known benefits of quality management systems (QMS) its implementation in relation to construction performance is very limited, particularly in the UK. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether QMS can affect construction performance in the NWE. A pragmatic mixed method approach of sequential explanatory strategy was adopted to conduct this research. This initially involved a quantitative approach of questionnaire surveys to gain opinions and views of a representative sample of industry professionals based in the NWE. The quantitative results were analyzed to discover relationships in the data and further formulate the questions for the qualitative interviews. Three interviews with leading industry professionals were then conducted and the data was analyzed using a thematic approach. The themes identified in the interviews were then cross-referenced with the data discovered in the questionnaire survey and literature review. The findings provide a clear indication that the implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on construction performance in the NWE. Immediate improvements in efficiency of a construction organization when implementing a QMS were discovered, including greater managerial control and the recording and reduction in defects. Long term effects of changing company attitude by setting out company requirements and responsibilities through highlighting the significance of quality, and furthermore encouraging a culture of co-operation and teamwork, were also proven to increase construction performance as time progresses. To further enhance this research the focus could be on the whole of the UK. However, a greater amount of time would be required to gain the required representative sample. Furthermore, although the questionnaire survey was distributed equally within the selected sample, a greater number of respondents working for contractors responded. Therefore, the respondents of the questionnaire survey were not equal in terms of organization (client, contractor, sub-contractor, project manager). According to the best knowledge of the authors and through searching many sources, there are no specific studies examining QMS and their effect on construction performance in the UK and particularly in the NWE. Therefore, it is believed the study is the first of its kind. The study discovered many findings that can be considered as a contribution to practice and theory. Moreover, it can be considered as a fundamental base for future studies in this research area.

J	Badi, SM; Pryke, SD				Badi, Sulafa M.; Pryke, Stephen D.			Assessing the quality of collaboration towards the achievement of Sustainable Energy Innovation in PFI school projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Alignment of objectives; Complex Product Systems (CoPS); Effectiveness of communication; Private Finance Initiative (PFI); Project-collaboration quality; Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI)	RENEWABLE ENERGY; CONSTRUCTION; USER; PARTICIPATION; TECHNOLOGIES; PARTNERSHIPS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the quality of collaboration towards Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI) in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects. While the capacity of PFI to encourage collaboration towards innovation is largely advocated by its proponents; however, it remains to be supported by empirical evidence. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting the Complex Product System (CoPS) innovation management model, the authors assess the quality of collaboration at the interface between the innovation superstructure of public sector clients and users, and the innovation infrastructure of private sector designers, contractors and operators. Two interactional elements are examined upon which the quality of collaboration is assessed: openness of communication and alignment of objectives. The authors apply the model to four new-built PFI school projects within the context of the UK government Building Schools for the Future Programme. Semi-structured interviews with total of 50 key stakeholders were used as the primary data collection method. Findings - PFI has introduced a number of problematic issues weakening collaborative efforts towards innovation in the project environment. Particularly, the study underlines the restricting internal contractual relationships within the integrated Project Company and the misalignment of Design-Construction-Operation sustainability objectives. It also highlights ineffective communication with public sector clients and users brought in by the restricted nature of PFI engagement processes as well as the misalignment of public sector-private sector sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative nature of the chosen research methodology limits the ability to generalise. The research findings need to be confirmed or rejected by means of quantitative research as representative of all PFI projects. Practical implications - The study emphasizes the public authority's role in relation to providing the necessary conditions for the creation of a collaborative environment conducive to SEI in PFI projects. Originality/value - The study was able to expand the understanding of innovation and collaboration management processes in PFI projects in three respects: First, addressing the limited attention to innovation in PFI research, the study is the first to examine the quality of collaboration in PFI projects towards the implementation SEI. Second, examining the quality of collaboration in PFI projects through the lens of CoPS provides a new understanding of sustainability innovation and strongly indicates that the CoPS model should be expanded to account for the dynamics of innovation processes in the procurement of sustainable CoPS. Third, the explorative nature of the study was useful in generating research hypotheses that can form the basis for future research on SEI in PFI projects.

Reza			Patterns and trends in Internet of Things (IoT) research: future applications in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry 4; 0; Internet of Things; Sensors; Digitalisation; Construction; 5G; Scientometric analysis; Strategic roadmap	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; BLOCKCHAIN	Purpose The Internet of Things (IoT) provides exciting opportunities for the construction industry to solve its time and resource constraints and frequent defaults. This study seeks to identify and rank the perceived importance level of principal research areas associated with the IoT and the construction industry by utilising a scientific mapping tool (i.e. VOSviewer). Such knowledge would enable key drivers for successful adoption of the IoT and digitisation technologies to be outlined. An analysis of key drivers and research trends that facilitates the development of a roadmap for applying the IoT and digital technologies in the construction sector is therefore much needed. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to analyse published work as secondary data, where each publication represented a unit of analysis. A total of 417 peer-reviewed journal review articles covering the IoT within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilising qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings The results revealed a field of study in a fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation and offering single-point solutions instead of taking an integrated "holistic" approach. Key publication outlets were identified and the main focus of research undertaken being in the technical areas of smart buildings, smart construction objects and environmental sustainability. The major effects of adopting the IoT within the construction industry were identified as high-speed reporting, complete process control, data explosion leading to deep data analytics, strict ethical and legal expectations. Key drivers of the IoT adoption were outlined: interoperability; data privacy and security; flexible governance structures; proper business planning and models. Practical implications The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of the IoT in the industry. For government agencies and policymakers, this study offers a point of reference in directing the adoption of the IoT smoothly in the construction sector and provides guidelines and standards for maximising the potential benefits. Originality/value The study is the first scientometric review of the existing body of knowledge in the context of application of the IoT in the construction industry. Findings expose knowledge gaps in contemporary research, specifically, a broader consideration of organisational adjustments needed to accommodate the IoT usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the completion of a MiC-based 1000-bed hospital in Wuhan, China, in less than a month, has made the world, especially sophisticated economies, 'talking' about this new technology. However, MiC is an ultra-modern technology that has both its merits and demerits; balancing out between them to maximize the opportunities that MiC has to offer needs insightful decision-making from higher authorities. Therefore, there is a vital need to understand and analyze the two contrasting but related matters, 'benefits and challenges of MiC' to help decision-makers in formulating better strategies based on informed choices. Past studies on MiC reported benefits in terms of time, cost, quality, safety, and environmental and social impacts, however, lack a holistic synthesis of MiC benefits by considering data from both the literature and real case studies. Whereas, the assessment methodologies used to prioritize MiC challenges did not consider the hierarchical nature of these challenges and their relative importance, which in turn impact the prioritization accuracy. This study contributed to bridging these gaps. Firstly, MiC benefits have been extensively explored by adopting a mixed research approach integrating literature synthesis, structured discussions, and real case studies. Then, a list of challenges was explored through literature synthesis and further validated and shortlisted through the first set of interviews from MiC experts. The second set of interviews was aimed mainly at evaluating the performance of MiC and providing recommendations for improvement from the international perspective. The interviews revealed that MiC should be treated as a long-term strategy and would not necessarily be a cheaper option in the short run, however, it would be a revolution in terms of time, quality, sustainability, safety, and life-cycle costs. Following the interviews, a questionnaire survey was conducted to prioritize the challenges using the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) approach, namely, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), considering the hierarchical nature of challenges and their relative importance. The 'road network capacity' was found to be the most critical challenge. Finally, case studies were further carried out to reveal the measures that were adopted to mitigate the challenges in three international MiC projects. This research provides an interesting insight into the positive and negative aspects of using MiC for interested governments and construction stakeholders. It is anticipated that the benefits shall outweigh the drawbacks in the long run.

J	Darling, EJ; Whitty, SJ				Darling, Eric John; Whitty, Stephen Jonathan			The Project Management Office: it's just not what it used to be	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Standards; Best practice; Organizational knowledge; Project Management Office	REVIEWS; PMOS	Purpose - The Project Management Office (PMO) phenomenon is a dynamic and regularly evolving feature of the project landscape. The functions and practices expected of the PMO differ as widely as the industries and organisations, which host them. By uncovering the documented and undocumented history of the PMO and its practices the authors see how PMOs have developed to current times, how PMOs develop their ideas, how useful PMOs are, and what associated activities they partake in. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors conduct an extensive literature review of the academic and non-academic literature. The first phase involved searching academic journals and published theses. The second, deep searches with Google Scholar and Books using a variety of parameters to capture the changing nomenclature of the PMO over many years. These searches discovered lost academic literature within university libraries, examples of very early essays on the project office and numerous government reports on PMO and project office undertakings. Findings - This research reveals how the form and use of the structure we now call the PMO has evolved and adapted over time. In recent history the PMO has evolved to be the central repository for tools and methodologies for this non-operational work. The PMO has become an asset, a commodity to be traded upon and a badge to be worn to attain certain privileges. Research limitations/implications - This research identifies a number of deficiencies in existing literature. Particularly highlighting that many practices, methods and PMO typologies exist, frequently their custodians tout these as "best practice". Although some research has been conducted by academics on PMOs vast gaps exist in PMO literature. Practical implications - This research identifies a number of assumptions in practitioner literature and professional practice. Organisations both private and public are investing enormous resources in the pursuit of enhancing project management outcomes often turning to the PMO concept to resolve their problems. However there is limited evidence to suggest PMOs create a favourable return. If the authors were to use medicine as an example, prior to a scientific approach in medicine the field relied on potions and magic, however medicine changed to evidence-based practice this has lead to enhanced life prospects. An evolution in project management doctrine may enhance outcomes. Originality/value - This review of the PMO which possesses archaeological attributes in it's historical context adds a rich understanding to organisational knowledge by considering the history of the PMO and the dramatic shifts in its purpose over a prolonged period of time. The discussion draws out the critical PMO topics to be addressed and includes a critique of practitioner and academic knowledge.

J	Umar, T				Umar, Tariq			Challenges of BIM implementation in GCC construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modelling; International construction; Organization; Knowledge management; Project management; International practice	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ENERGY RESOURCES; ADOPTION; SAFETY; PROJECTS; DELAY; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; TYPOLOGY; CLIMATE	Purpose In some regions including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region where construction is one of the main industries, the implementation of BIM is still at a slow rate. This article attempts to know the current situation of BIM and explore the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach that includes a systematic literature review and a survey questionnaire was adopted to achieve the aim of this research. For the systematic review, four main databases were search considering a period of 2010-2019 to identify the main challenges in the BIM implementation. A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. A structured questionnaire developed on these challenges was sent to 206 selected from the top construction organizations from all over the GCC region. Findings A total of 39 different challenges from 47 documents were classified into four main categories. The respondents for the questionnaire were selected from the top construction organization from all over the GCC region. A large number of the respondents (69.79%) reported that their organizations are planning for BIM implementation in their future projects. The results show that top challenges fall under the main categories of "Organization", "Technical", "Government and Legal" and "Environment". Research limitations/implications While the paper provides an overview of BIM in a global context, however, the dynamics and maturity of the construction industry in different regions are quite different from each other. Since the data collected in this research is from the GCC region, the results are more relevant to the GCC region. Practical implications The finding of this research identifies the main challenges which GCC construction is facing in the implementation of BIM. The finding will, therefore, be useful for the key stakeholders to develop strategies to overcome these challenges and pave the road to take the advantages of BIM implementation in construction. Social implications The BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry will not only improve the performance of the industry but will also open the doors for new opportunities and employment. The BIM implementation in construction will help the region to achieve Goal 9 (industrial innovation and improved infrastructure) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Originality/value The results of this study help to understand the overall situation including the challenges in the BIM implementation in the GCC construction industry. This study will be helpful for all the stakeholders to develop strategies for the effective implementation of BIM in the GCC construction industry.

J	Budayan, C; Okudan, O; Dikmen, I				Budayan, Cenk; Okudan, Ozan; Dikmen, Irem			Identification and prioritization of stage-level KPIs for BOT projects - evidence from Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Key performance indicators; Public-private partnership; TOPSIS; Performance management; Project performance	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP; KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PPP ROAD PROJECTS; OF-THE-ART; LIFE-CYCLE; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; BALANCED SCORECARD; MEASUREMENT SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and prioritize key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used for stage-based performance assessment of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects. Design/methodology/approach This research was conducted through focus group discussions and face-to-face questionnaires. Firstly, stage-level KPIs for BOT projects were identified by conducting a literature survey. The list of KPIs that can be used for measuring performance at different stages of a BOT project was finalized by conducting focus group discussions with 12 participants. The data related to the importance of identified KPIs were collected via a face-to-face questionnaire in which 30 high-level managers participated. Based on these data, KPIs were prioritized considering eight different stages of a BOT project by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Findings The research findings reveal that 63 stage-level KPIs can be used for measuring the performance of BOT projects at eight different stages, which are "feasibility study and preliminary plan," "announcement and submission of application," "evaluation and selection," "negotiation and signing of concession agreement," "design," "construction," "operation" and "transfer." The most important KPIs were determined as "comprehensiveness of project technical feasibility," "detailed tendering procedure," "effectiveness of concessionaires' technical knowledge/capability evaluation," "good relationships between government and concessionaire," "technology transfer," "effectiveness of quality control," "effectiveness of facility management" and "effectiveness of hand-back management" for each stage. The findings can be used by companies to evaluate performance at each stage of a BOT project and, if necessary, take the necessary actions for performance improvement at the stage level. Research limitations/implications The main limitation is the size of the sample, which represents the perspectives of 30 Turkish high-level managers on KPIs in BOT projects. Besides, the selected method, namely, TOPSIS, does not provide quality measures related to the outputs; therefore, it is difficult to see the inconsistencies among the experts. Practical implications The study findings will help in devising appropriate performance evaluation practices for BOT projects to overcome the shortfalls of the existing practices and systems proposed in the literature and help in achieving the superior performance while developing infrastructure through the BOT route. Originality/value This paper proposes a process-based approach for measuring the performance of a BOT project considering eight different stages. It fills a research gap in the public-private partnership literature by focusing on stages rather than phases. The results can be used by practitioners to establish stage-level performance management systems for BOT projects.

J	Li, J; Greenwood, D; Kassem, M				Li, Jennifer; Greenwood, David; Kassem, Mohamad			Blockchain in the built environment and construction industry: A systematic review, conceptual models and practical use cases	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Blockchain technologies; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); Socio-technical systems; Use cases; Project Bank Accounts (PBAs); Regulations and compliance; Built environment; Construction industry	DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY; SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS; ELECTRICITY; SECURITY	The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (FBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.

These new regulations provide information for designers based on Brazil's climate requirements, with specific advice related to lighting systems, HVAC and the thermal envelope of buildings. Nevertheless, requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category without clear criteria. To address this, the paper proposes guidelines for naturally ventilated environments in which specific thermal and air movement acceptability goals must be achieved. The guidelines are based on results from field experiments in non-residential naturally ventilated buildings in different climatic zones as well as drawing on other studies. The proposed guidelines consider occupants' adaptive potential as well as thermal and air movement acceptability. Combining thermal acceptability with air movement acceptability is a key design challenge. Permissible operative temperature ranges are based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard, and minimum air velocity requirements within the occupied zone are specified. Considerations also included 'active' occupants and specific control over openings and fans. Le Gouvernement federal bresilien encourage depuis peu les initiatives en faveur des economies d'energie, et tout particulierement les initiatives << Performances Thermiques des Immeubles - Zones Bioclimatiques Bresiliennes et Directives de Construction pour les Logements a Faible Cout >> et << Reglementation Federale pour l'Etiquetage Volontaire des Niveaux de Rendement Energetique des Immeubles Commerciaux, Publics et de Services >>. Ces reglementations nouvelles fournissent aux concepteurs des informations basees sur les exigences climatiques du Bresil, et s'accompagnent de conseils specifiques relatifs aux systemes d'eclairage, aux systemes CVCA et a l'enveloppe thermique des immeubles. Neanmoins, les exigences relatives aux environnements interieurs a ventilation naturelle apparaissent comme une categorie ouverte sans criteres clairs. Pour traiter ce probleme, le present article propose des directives pour les environnements a ventilation naturelle dans lesquels des objectifs specifiques d'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air doivent etre atteints. Ces directives sont basees sur les resultats d'experiences de terrain menees dans des immeubles non residentiels a ventilation naturelle dans differentes zones climatiques, mais s'appuient egalement sur d'autres etudes. Les directives proposees prennent en consideration le potentiel adaptatif des occupants aussi bien que l'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air. Reussir a combiner l'acceptabilite thermique et l'acceptabilite en matiere de circulation d'air pose un probleme de conception essentiel. Les plages de temperature de service admissibles sont basees sur la norme de confort adaptatif ASHRAE 55, et les exigences minimales quant a la vitesse de l'air dans la zone occupee sont precisees.

J	Mangioni, V				Mangioni, Vince			Evaluating the impact of the land acquisition phase on property owners in megaprojects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Megaproject; Compulsory acquisition; Dispossessed owner; Roadworks		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the land acquisition phase and site assembly of land for large scale infrastructure road projects and its impact on property owners. A review of one of the largest roadwork projects currently underway in Sydney Australia demonstrates the adverse impact that has resulted in property owners challenging the approach used by government to acquire land for this project. Similar case studies are used to set out the key measures that should apply internationally in mitigating challenges from property owners in the land acquisition phase. It further shows that while adequate statutory provisions are important, it is the practices of acquiring authorities that ultimately determine the success and expedition of this initial important phase of these projects. Design/methodology/approach In measuring the factors that impact the acquisition of land by negotiation in contrast to acquisition by compulsory taking, a case study methodology is used. In this approach, the author reviews two completed projects and the factors that contributed to their success. These are contrasted with the primary case study currently underway in Sydney, the WestConnex project in which a number of adverse factors have emerged that have impacted this project. The review of these cases examined provides options for reforms that should be adopted both in the WestConnex case and across projects internationally. Findings It is demonstrated that the impact of the land acquisition phase on property owners with limited ability to rehouse within the same or surrounding locations, results in increases to challenges. This factor has prompted increases in the number of cases that have proceeded to court and potentially impacts the public perception and site assembly phase of large scale road projects. The inability for impacted property owners to relocate themselves has resulted in a breakdown in the ability for acquiring authorities to achieve acquisition by agreement. This is evidenced by significant increases in the number of properties that have been acquired by compulsion since 2016. It is found that the operational provisions of the land acquisition processes were obsolete in NSW, particularly those leading up to acquisition that was originally designed to assist owners. The paper finds that the most important phase of a megaproject is the planning and consultation phase, which includes most importantly the way in which impacted owners are informed, assisted and compensated. It is concluded that the processes engaged in by acquiring authorities rather than the statutory provisions available, will determine the success of the land acquisition phase and perceptions of the project. Originality/value The primary contribution of this paper is defining the changing landscape that has led to the adverse impact on property owners in the site assembly process for large scale projects. It identifies the reforms that will enhance opportunity for owners to relocate and rehouse which will expedite the acquisition phase of megaprojects and restore acquisition by agreement rather than by compulsion. This in turn will contribute to improve public perception of large scale projects in urbanised locations.

J	Kassem, MA; Khoiry, MA; Hamzah, N				Kassem, Mukhtar A.; Khoiry, Muhamad Azry; Hamzah, Noraini			Theoretical review on critical risk factors in oil and gas construction projects in Yemen	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction project; Oil and gas; Yemen; Risk factors	COST OVERRUNS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; DELAY; TIME; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; MODEL	Purpose The oil and gas construction projects are affected negatively by the drop in oil price in recent years. Thus, most engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies are opting to optimize the project mainly to mitigate the source of risks in construction to achieve the project expectation. Risk factors cause a threat to the project objectives regarding time, cost and quality. It is additionally a vital component in deviating from the client's expectation of productivity, safety and standards. This research aims to investigate the causes of risk in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review from various sources including books, conference proceedings, the Internet project management journals and oil and gas industry journals was conducted to achieve the objectives of this study. This initial work was predicated strictly on a literature review and the judgments of experts to develop the risk factor framework for the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Findings The authors found a few studies related to risk factors in oil and gas construction projects and shared a similar view about general construction projects. However, only a fraction of the factors accepted have included the variances of other studies on a regional basis or specific countries, such as the Yemen situation, due to the differences between the general construction industry and oil and gas industry. Moreover, the factors of these attributes were still accepted due to their applicability to the oil and gas industry, and no significant variances existed between countries. Research has indicated that 51 critical factors cause risks in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Such risk factors can be divided into two major groups: (1) internal risk factors, including seven critical sources of risks, namely client, contractor, consultant, feasibility study and design, tendering and contract, resources and material supply and project management; and (2) external risk factors, including six sources of critical risk factors, namely national economic, political risk, local people, environment and safety, security risk and force-majeure-related risk factors. A risk factor framework was developed to identify the critical risk factors in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to the oil and gas construction projects. Practical implications Practically, this study highlights the risk factors that cause a negative effect on the success of oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. The identification of these factors is the first step in the risk management process to develop strategic responses for risks and enhance the chances of project success. Social implications The identification of risks factors that cause the failure of construction projects helps develop response strategies for these risks, thereby increasing the chances of project success reflected in the oil and gas sector, which is a main tributary of the national economy in developing countries. Originality/value This research is the pioneer for future investigations into this vital economic sector. Given the lack of resources and studies in the field of construction projects for the Yemeni oil and gas sector, the Yemeni government, oil companies and researchers in this field are expected to benefit from the results of this study. The critical risk factors specific to the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen should be further investigated with focus only on Yemen and its oil and gas industry players.

Philip; Stone, Andy; Davies, Michael			Exploring energy integration between new and existing developments	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						domestic energy; energy strategy; neighbourhood planning; on-site renewables; supply-and-demand model; zero carbon	UK; SYSTEMS; DEMAND	The UK government has ambitious goals to reduce national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and has targeted the new and existing built stock with measures to improve building performance and provide more local and centralized renewable energy. New dwellings are proposed to be 'net-zero carbon' by 2016, which includes proposals to offset CO2 by integrating new and existing development. To what extent can new zero-carbon communities be more readily achieved through increasing the integration between new and existing domestic developments? A methodology is presented for determining the ratio of on-site renewable energy supply to energy demand for a series of densities using a simplified model. Options that increase the proportion of existing dwellings served by a new development to balance further energy demands are presented. The practical opportunities and constraints are considered for integrating new and existing domestic development to achieve net-zero carbon. Meeting net-zero on-site annual energy requirements through on-site energy resources is possible even at high urban densities, with annual average supply/demand ratios of approximately 2.3. Also, integrating existing dwellings may offer an opportunity to improve supply/demand ratios for further CO2 reductions; low densities are shown to have annual supply/demand ratios of approximately 9.5. Although a finer temporal scale illustrates the limitations of an annual average and the variable nature of on-site energy resources; this straightforward method can act as a catalyst in achieving net-zero-carbon communities. Le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni s'est fixe des objectifs ambitieux de reduction des emissions de dioxyde de carbone (CO2) au niveau national et a decide de viser le parc bati existant et les constructions neuves par des mesures destinees a ameliorer les performances des batiments et a fournir davantage d'energies renouvelables locales et centralisees. Il est propose que les nouveaux logements soient << zero carbone net >> d'ici a 2016, ceci incluant des propositions pour compenser le CO2 par l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux. Dans quelle mesure peut-on parvenir plus facilement a de nouvelles communautes zero carbone en augmentant l'integration entre les ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux? Il est presente une methodologie permettant de determiner le rapport entre l'offre en energies renouvelables locales et la demande en energie pour une serie de densites d'habitation en utilisant un modele simplifie. Sont presentes des choix qui augmentent la part des logements existants desservis par un nouvel ensemble de logements afin d'equilibrer les demandes d'energie supplementaires. Les possibilites et les contraintes pratiques relatives a l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux pour atteindre le << zero carbone net >> sont examinees. Il est possible de repondre a des besoins energetiques annuels locaux << zero carbone net >> par des ressources energetiques locales, meme avec des densites urbaines elevees, pour des rapports annuels moyens offre/demande d'environ 2.3. De plus, le fait d'integrer les logements existants peut donner la possibilite d'ameliorer les rapports offre/demande afin de reduire encore les emissions de CO2; il est montre que des densites d'habitation faibles presentent des rapports annuels offre/demande d'environ 9.5. Bien qu'une echelle de temps plus fine illustre les limites d'une moyenne annuelle et la nature variable des ressources energetiques ocales, cette methode simple peut faire office de catalyseur pour realiser des communautes << zero carbone net >>.

J	Rashed, A; Mutis, I				Rashed, Ahmed; Mutis, Ivan			Trends of integrated project delivery implementations viewed from an emerging innovation framework	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Integrated project delivery; Science mapping; Technology innovation systems	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COLLABORATION; DESIGN; SCIENCE; IPD; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose Research into integrated project delivery (IPD) has attracted increased attention over the past 2 decades, and a significant number of IPD studies have been published more recently. The purpose of the study is to explore the state of IPD to reveal innovative areas of focus. Design/methodology/approach The research presented puts forward a science mapping and bibliometrics methods to study systematic analysis of IPD scientific output published between 2006 and 2020. It uses a framework from emerging literature relating to innovation to incorporate a perspective of the process of innovation for the analysis of IPD. The adapted framework from the literature on innovation, called the Technology Innovation System (TIS), has functions that reveal novelty in the existing structures of IPD. The framework uses the analysis of scientific output from science mapping and bibliometric study techniques, using the ScienceDirect (SD) and Web of Science (WoS) databases as sources. The framework analyzes factors involved in the development and diffusion of the IPD approach and charts new knowledge development on IPD. Findings From the analysis, future implementation of IPD will converge on cases of collaboration, as a systemic feature, among participating stakeholder teams. A significant and robust effect resulted from collaboration and integration as major mechanisms influence opportunities, problems and solutions within construction firms using IPD, marking a future trend. Reports further substantiate the importance and focus on collaboration and integration between IPD practitioners. With the same dynamic and gradual prominence, building information modeling (BIM) and new technology applications demonstrated the importance of the development and diffusion of IPD in the form of, for example, digital government initiatives. It is expected that the trend for IDS and resource mobilization functions will continue to grow - clear evidence of the benefits of the IPD approach in the construction sector. New evidence for gaining cognitive and normative legitimacy emerged. The expansion of new avenues for further legitimation is expected to enable growth. Research limitations/implications Beyond the innovative approach of viewing IPD from the emerging innovation framework, the research presented fully contributes to IPD literature, providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art status and a quantitative analysis of IPD scientific output, thereby illuminating promising work areas for future research into IPD. The main limitation is related to the dynamic process of indexing of IPD literature in the WoS and SD - although many new research publications are added in the discipline, only a part of them have been indexed in the WoS and SD core database. Practical implications The study revealed key evolving trends within the field, including instructive findings and implications concerning possible deficiencies. Based on factors from network visualizations and quantitative evaluation from major influential articles, journals and authors, future critical IPD implementation focus will be on BIM and sustainability concepts - centerpiece concepts for the evolving line of IPD growth and development in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. Social implications This study fills the gap created in a shortage of studies mapping out the most critical contributions in journals, authors and research perspectives related to IPD. It presents a framework that can be used as an objective procedure to evaluate the topic. It is expected that the study will serve as a cornerstone for researchers in this field, as it provides a bibliometric analysis and presents trends using an analytical framework of innovation. Originality/value The research presented is a keystone in the foundation of the literature review on this topic. The research draws on an existing framework for innovation - the TIS, developed from innovation studies using a robust theoretical framework to enable further analysis of IPD. This approach is one of a kind, using the results of scientometric analysis to study the scientific landscape and knowledge output of IPD in the AEC community. Science-mapping bibliometric analysis was conducted to shed light on IPD trends and explain factors that back or support the development and diffusion of IPD, including shaping and enabling evolution and growth. The framework helps to shed light on the interaction of socio-technical structures (i.e. stakeholders, technologies and rules) embedded in the industry, which helped create, direct and advance IPD in the project delivery system.

J	Kavishe, N; Jefferson, I; Chileshe, N				Kavishe, Neema; Jefferson, Ian; Chileshe, Nicholas			An analysis of the delivery challenges influencing public-private partnership in housing projects: The case of Tanzania	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Questionnaire survey; International practice	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; MIXED-METHODS; FAILURE FACTORS; HONG-KONG; PPP; MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; MALAYSIA; PROFESSIONALS; ALLOCATION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to identify and rank the challenges influencing the delivery of the housing public-private partnership (HPPP) in Tanzania; and second, to suggest solutions in the form of a conceptual public-private partnership (PPP) framework model that will address the identified challenges and boost the chances of success. Design/methodology/approach Using a convergent parallel (concurrent) mixed method approach, data were collected from 28 stakeholders involved with HPPP projects in Tanzania using a hand-delivered and e-mail survey and 13 semi-structured interviews with public and private sector respondents. The quantitative data included subjecting the 19 challenges as identified from the literature to parametric tests such as one-sample t-tests and descriptive statistics tests such as measures of central tendencies and frequency analysis through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 22.0). Qualitative data employed content analysis. The research was further underpinned by a number of theoretical perspectives such as Gidden's structuration theory, contingency theory, relational and equity theory. Findings The top five ranked challenges influencing the delivery of HPPP were inadequate PPP skills and knowledge; poor contracting and tendering documents; inadequate project management; inadequate legal framework; and misinformation on financial capacity of private partners. The least six ranked and most significant challenges based on the one-sample (single) t-tests were as follows: Poor risk allocation; inexperienced private partner; unequal qualification and contributions of expertise; poor enabling environment to attract competent partners; inadequate mechanisms for recovery of private investors' capital; and high costs in procuring PPP projects. The qualitative study further confirmed the challenges and cited the reason for the failure of joint venture projects as the lack of motivation for undertaking similar PPP projects. Despite the increased awareness of PPP projects and associated marginal benefits, the main impediment to the uptake and delivery of PPP housing projects remained the lack of skills and expertise. Research limitations/implications The proposed framework model is not yet tested, but since this paper is part of the ongoing research, the next stage involves the testing and validation of the model. Future studies could test the applicability of the proposed framework in other HPPP projects in Tanzania, and in other similar developing countries. Second, the validated framework can contribute towards addressing similar challenges as well as providing guidance. The proposed framework model is not yet tested, but since this paper is part of the ongoing research, the next stage involves the testing and validation of the model. Furthermore, recommendation for future research is to test the alignment of the identified challenges to the proposed remedial solutions across the five phases within the proposed PPP framework with a number of case studies. Practical implications The identified challenges were used to form the basis of the framework presented in this paper. Furthermore, these provide useful information, thus leading to increased awareness to enable successful delivery of HPPP in Tanzania. Similarly, both the government and policy makers could use the findings as the basis for re-examining the existing PPP policy and regulations, and reflecting on the existing situation with a view to improving the delivery of future HPPP projects. Originality/value The empirical study is among the first that identifies and ranks the challenges of PPP for housing projects delivery within the Tanzanian context. The identification of the challenges enabled their ranking, resulting in the mapping out of the most critical challenges. Furthermore, using the Gidden's structuration theory, the study illustrates how institution mechanisms (structures) address these delivery challenges, thus influencing the implementation of HPPP in Tanzania, and how individual stakeholders (human agents or agency) are able to make choices (advocated solutions) in dealing with the challenges. More so, these constraints (challenges) as identified and viewed through the contingency and equity theoretical lenses form the foundation for developing the PPP conceptual framework. The proposed framework would thus serve as a mechanism for providing practical solutions as well as reducing the level of severity of the identified challenges.

J	Alade, K; Windapo, AO				Alade, Kehinde; Windapo, Abimbola Olukemi			Developing effective 4IR leadership framework for construction organisations	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						4IR; 4IR leadership; Construction; Effective leadership; South Africa	EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE; TRAITS; STYLES; PERSONALITY	Purpose Globally, the business organisations are experiencing a transformation due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The need for an effective 4IR leadership has placed new demands on organisations to develop and select leaders to effectively lead the organisations in the 4IR era. Hence, it becomes important to understand the attributes for an effective 4IR leadership. This study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. The hypothesised relationships from the framework were tested using a survey of 416 senior construction executives across the nine provinces of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the study objectives, an online survey was sent to construction firms across the nine provinces of South Africa. "Construction", for the purpose of this study comprised building and civil engineering firms listed on the construction industry development board (cidb) register of contractors in South Africa. The target group was the upper echelon executives, i.e. Chairman, CEOs, managing directors and chief operating officers, and the survey was directed to contact e-mail of the study samples. The professional service providers (architects, consultants and surveyors) were not part of the survey sample. The database of the organisational leaders was obtained from the cidb. The online survey was created on the 23rd of August 2019 and closed on the 23rd of April 2020, thereby making the duration of the survey eight months. The total number of respondents at the time of closure of the survey was four hundred and sixteen (416). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of the results. Findings This study validates the effective 4IR leadership framework as proposed by Alade and Windapo (2019) by empirically examining relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership. The findings from this study have shown that effective 4IR leadership is positively associated with leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Hence, an effective 4IR leader must spread the knowledge and understanding of the 4IR opportunities and threats in the organisations. The leader must ensure that the executives in the construction organisation become change conversant and ensure that the employees acquire 4IR skills. Multiple leadership intelligence is essential to effective 4IR leadership. These multiple intelligence are the ability to adapt knowledge and skills to different situations, ability to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, a high level of understanding, ability to process and analyse information and ability to utilise knowledge from many disciplinary boundaries. Research limitations/implications This study is focused on construction business organisations in South Africa. As such, similar studies on 4IR leadership effectiveness can be carried out in other countries and across other organisations. Future studies should also consider using a case study approach specifically focused on organisations with high implementations of 4IR technologies. Interacting with the leaders of such organisations and their employees will give a broader perspective in understanding the reasons of their effectiveness. Practical implications The leadership of construction organisations must partner with the academia, industry players and team members in their efforts to implement 4IR in their organisations. Also, the existence of a positive association between leadership traits and effective 4IR leadership implies that to ensure a 4IR-driven work process in construction organisations, the leadership must embrace disruption and quickly respond to change. Further, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that appropriate leadership styles are required for effective 4IR leadership. The appropriate leadership style for effective 4IR leadership requires the leadership of construction organisations to delegate some of the 4IR function. The 4IR function must be performed based on the challenges that are associated with 4IR. The positive correlation between leadership intelligence and leadership styles makes it possible to conclude that the competencies of leadership of construction organisations in a 4IR-driven change depend on the level of leadership intelligence of the executives of construction organisations. It is evident that 4IR will change the business environment; hence, leadership intelligence is required to adapt construction organisations to the change dynamics. This study has provided information on what 4IR leadership entails in construction organisations. The study has contributed a framework for ensuring effective and smooth flow 4IR implementation in construction organisations through a purposeful leadership that combines leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Social implications This research will be useful to government agencies and board members of construction organisations, in appointing leaders to see the construction industry and organisations perform better in the 4IR era. Young individuals who are also aspiring to take on leadership role in the industry will benefit from this study. Originality/value This study is a new and original research that seeks to investigate the need for an effective 4IR leadership in construction business organisations. Construction as an industry is usually criticised for her slow response to change. Since leadership is required to drive the change agenda, this study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised.
