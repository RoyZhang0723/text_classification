J	Kang, Y; Kim, C; Son, H; Lee, S; Limsawasd, C				Kang, Youngcheol; Kim, Changwan; Son, Hyojoo; Lee, Seungtaek; Limsawasd, Charinee			Comparison of Preproject Planning for Green and Conventional Buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green buildings; Sustainable development; Construction costs; Project management; Green building; Sustainability; Preproject planning; Project Definition Rate Index; Cost performance	CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; DESIGN; SAFETY; MODEL; COST	The importance of green buildings has been frequently highlighted. However, barriers such as greater complexity, lack of understanding of sustainability, and the perception of a greater possibility of cost overrun have hindered the dissemination of green buildings. More planning efforts for green buildings can presumably help mitigate these barriers. This paper investigates preproject planning efforts for green and conventional building projects. Project-level data were collected (124 in total, 71 from conventional building projects and 53 from green building projects), with project data consisting of general information about the project, a Project Definition Rate Index (PDRI) survey, and cost performance. The project data were categorized into four groups based on their project type (green and conventional) and cost performance (actual cost on/under budget and over budget). For the four groups, a two-way analysis of variance test was used to compare the degree of preproject planning efforts measured by PDRI. The analysis indicated that green projects tend to have more investment in preproject planning efforts than conventional projects, and the difference was marginally statistically significant at the level of =0.05. In addition, a comparison of the mean PDRI values of the four groups revealed that green projects with a superior cost performance invest more in preproject planning efforts than other groups, and the difference was statistically meaningful. From the interaction effect, we also found that the impact of preproject planning on cost performance is more critical for green projects than for conventional projects. Regarding the preproject planning category, we found that green projects with superior cost performance tend to involve more planning with regard to business strategy, project requirements, site information, building programming, and building/project design parameters. These findings make two contributions. First, the findings help practitioners justify additional preproject planning efforts for green projects. Second, some of the results of this study will be useful to practitioners initiating sustainable projects by helping with the determination of which aspects of green buildings should involve more extensive planning. These findings will help reduce the possibility of cost overruns and allow more green projects to be deployed in order to address the need for sustainability.

There are various trade-offs between functionality and design, which often lead to an issue of whether sustainably designed buildings would meet stakeholder requirements. This paper provides a novel integrated structure for assessing green buildings realistically based on stakeholders' fuzzy preferences. In particular, the paper uses the analytic network approach (ANP) to evaluate the correlation matrices in a quality function deployment (QFD) framework. A case study on green building index assessment in Malaysia illustrates the proposed integrated method. Sensitivity analysis validated the customer-stakeholder agreement towards the design of the green building. Cluster analysis was also used to group design specifications prior to the analysis.

This is even more important to green construction projects. There is a noticeable surge in the number of green construction projects. Green construction projects require contractors that have certain capabilities in addition to the traditional capabilities. This article highlights the key criteria for selecting contractors for green construction projects. Twenty criteria were identified based on literature review. These criteria were categorized into five groups: firm characteristics, firm record, commercial and technical bid, environmental and socio-economic. A survey was then developed and sent to professionals from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The respondents evaluated the selection criteria using pair-wise comparison using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Forty-eight responses were collected. The results show that the top five criteria are the bid price, energy management, technical bid, proposed time and water management. The results show that sustainability-related criteria (environmental and socio-economic groups) are important with a combined weight of 0.386.

J	Han, YL; He, TZ; Chang, RD; Xue, R				Han, Yilong; He, Tianzhi; Chang, Ruidong; Xue, Rui			Development Trend and Segmentation of the US Green Building Market: Corporate Perspective on Green Contractors and Design Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Engineering news record; Green building company; Green building market	CONSTRUCTION; BARRIERS; DRIVERS; IMPACT; CHINA	In the past decade, the architecture, engineering, and construction industry has witnessed increasing growth in the green building market and continues to expect a promising future. Although companies in the industry have played a significant role in developing the green building market, scarce studies have analyzed changes in the market from the perspectives of these corporations. Also, few studies classify green building companies by characteristics. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we explored the characteristics of the US green building market from a corporate perspective, specifically investigating green contractors and design firms. We first collected data of 464 top US green building companies identified by the Engineering News-Record over the past decade and explored the development trend of the green building market, based on the green revenue generated by these companies. We found that the general growth trend in the US green building market in the past decade could be divided into three stages: a rapid-growth stage (2000-2008), a steady-growth stage (2009-2013), and a maturity and transformation stage (2014-2016). We then categorized the 464 organizations into three groups with distinct characteristics by k-means cluster analysis techniques, including mature green building companies, sector-oriented green building companies, and primary-stage green building companies. This study provides the academic and practitioner communities with a holistic understanding of the development of the US green building market from the view of burgeoning companies. Corporate-level management systems and sustainable practices of the three clusters of green building companies also provide guidance for construction companies in the various stages of transformation towards sustainability to adopt different strategies.

JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Financial performance; Sustainability; Organizational strategy; Economic value added; Return on equity; Construction industry	FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; MARKET VALUE; BUILDINGS	Green principles have been increasingly incorporated into planning, design, construction, and maintenance processes in the engineering and construction industry. Along with the growth of the green initiative, going green not only demonstrates corporate social responsibility, but may yield significant economic benefits. This study compares financial performance between green and conventional firms in the engineering and construction industry. A total of 22 sample companies used in this empirical analysis are categorized into two groupsgreen versus conventional firmsin accordance with Engineering News Record and Newsweek green company lists. Two groups are compared in terms of short-term financial performance, long-term economic value, and market value. The analysis shows that green firms outperform conventional firms on return on equity (17.4 versus 8.2%) and economic value added margin (0.35 versus ). However, the green strategy has not yet been factored into corporate market value. The findings yield important managerial implications for engineering and construction organizations to integrate sustainability into their business operation.

This study investigates the challenges of implementing green building in four provinces of South Africa to categorise the key challenges. Drawing from a literature review and a quantitative inquiry approach, primary data were collected from 106 construction professionals with green building experience. This was complemented by descriptive and inferential statistics, namely exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The descriptive analysis using the mean score (MS) ranking technique revealed that higher up-front costs for green building and costs associated with green technologies and materials, and certification for green buildings were identified as key challenges to implementing green building projects. Furthermore, the EFA based on Monte Carlo parallel analysis revealed that the underlying grouped factors for the challenges were: 'data and motivation management system'; 'regulatory and steering factors'; 'inadequate skilled professionals'; 'behavioural barriers' and 'the cost of green building'. The results provide a valuable reference for construction professionals to institute a mechanism for evaluating performance periodically to identify challenges relating to green building projects. It is proposed that early identification of challenges and taking proactive steps to rectify problems is essential for green building to gain a competitive advantage over the traditional construction methods and may subsequently help ensure continual survival in the industry.

However, limited studies have addressed the vagueness and complexities during the selection process, particularly in multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) circumstances. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a group decision model using a modified fuzzy MCDM approach for green supplier selection under a complex situation. Design/methodology/approach The proposed study develops a framework for sorting decisions in green supplier selection by using the hesitant fuzzy qualitative flexible multiple attributes method (QUALIFLEX). The synthetic consistent or inconsistent indexes were used to calculate all alternative suppliers by normalizing the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix. Findings The proposed framework has been successfully applied and illustrated in the case example of CB02 contract section in Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project. The results show various complicated decision-making scenarios can be addressed through the proposed approach. The synthetic (in)consistent indexes are able to calculate all alternative suppliers by normalizing the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix. Originality/value The research contributes to improving accuracy and reliability decision-making processes for green supplier selection, especially under vagueness and complex situations in megaprojects.

The sizes of individual buildings and the extent of dispersion among buildings in a group dramatically influences the local ecological environment and landscape. However, there is a lack of effective methods for evaluating the distribution of buildings, and it is difficult to plan and manage the arrangement of buildings in green spaces. Based on geostatistical methods for describing the distribution of geographic objects, this study presents the Index of Distribution (IOD) to describe the distribution, pattern of buildings in green spaces. Yuhuatai Park and Qingliangshan Park of Nanjing are chosen as cases to verify the effectiveness of the IOD. This paper also presents a genetic algorithm-based model that can generate the plan of buildings corresponding to a specific IOD. The model provides considerable flexibility in buildings locations. The results of the model can be used as a valuable reference in the planning of buildings in green spaces. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hwang, BG; Zhao, XB; Tan, LLG				Hwang, Bon-Gang; Zhao, Xianbo; Tan, Lene Lay Ghim			Green building projects: schedule performance, influential factors and solutions	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Singapore; Buildings; Green building; Retrofitting; Delay; Schedule	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; LESSONS; DELAYS	Purpose - The purposes of this paper are to: investigate schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; identify the critical factors that influence the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; and provide solutions to improve schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey were conducted and responses were received from 34 firms experienced in green building projects in Singapore. After the data from the survey had been analyzed, face-to-face interviews were conducted with two senior project managers to solicit comments on the survey results. Findings - This study identified the degree of project delay in 98 new green building projects and 51 retrofitting green building projects in Singapore. The result indicated that 22 percent of the Singaporean green building projects were plagued with delay and retrofitting projects had a significantly higher likelihood of delay and significantly longer extension than new projects. In addition, "consultant cooperation to solve problems" was the most influential to schedule performance of both new and retrofitting green building projects, and the two project groups agreed on the overall ranking of the factors affecting schedule performance. Research limitations/implications - There may be geographical limitation on the conclusions drawn from the findings. Also, the sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. In addition, the majority of the respondents were contractors as other project players were reluctant to respond to the survey. Practical implications - This study provides a clear understanding of the schedule performance of green building projects as well as the critical factors that should be highlighted when constructing green building projects. Also, strategies to overcome the negative impact of these factors allow practitioners to better deal with the potential causes of delay and to attain the schedule performance. Originality/value - Although construction delays have been widely investigated in previous studies relating to construction management, few have attempted to analyze the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green buildings. Thus, this study adds significantly to the existing research on both green building and construction delay.

W.; Wang, Jiayuan			Modelling stakeholder-associated risk networks in green building projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green building project; Risk; Stakeholder; Social network analysis	INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS; CONSTRUCTION; STRATEGY; DESIGN; IMPACT; CHINA	This research aims to model the interactive networks of the risks associated with different stakeholders in green building projects and to gain an understanding of the key risk networks. Case studies of green star accredited office building projects were undertaken in China and Australia. Case data were collected through focused group workshops, face-to-face interviews and desktop studies, and analysed by using social network analysis methods. The results show that while reputation risk is important in both countries, the ethical risk of 'assessment experience and fairness' has been highlighted as crucial in the Chinese context. The results further show that government plays an important role in improving the societies' knowledge and awareness on green technology uptake in China.

However, there is no comprehensive study that explores the important project management factors from the perspective of architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms, whose decisions can significantly affect the environmental performance of building projects. In Singapore, Green Mark, a certification for green building, has become a compulsory requirement for all new buildings. AEC firms are now facing challenges on how best to attain Green Mark certification with minimum cost and resources. The purpose of this research is to identify the controllable critical project management factors for delivering Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher Green Mark ratings. Nineteen controllable project management factors were first identified from related literature, and then a survey was carried out to collect data needed to perform the principal component factor analysis. The factor analysis revealed that the controllable project management factors could be grouped into five major components, namely, (1) human resource-oriented factors, (2) technical and innovation-oriented factors, (3) support from designers and senior management, (4) project manager's competence, and (5) coordination of designers and contractors. Finally, multiple regression analysis was applied. It was found that the coordination of designers and contractors and technical and innovation-oriented factors are the most critical success factors, and possible reasons are discussed. With the help of the research findings, project organizations in Singapore will manage their Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher rating levels in a more efficient and effective way.

J	Dammann, S; Elle, M				Dammann, Sven; Elle, Morten			Environmental indicators: establishing a common language for green building	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						consensus building; decision support systems; environmental indicators; green building; social construction of technology (SCOT); sustainability assessment		Environmental indicators for buildings have the potential to serve as a means of making the environmental impacts (and possibly benefits) of buildings visible to all relevant actors. In addition, indicators facilitate the consideration and management of an array of environmental issues in the relevant decision-making situations. The broad acceptance of indicators across different groups of decision-makers in different phases of a building's life cycle is especially important when indicators are not mandatory, but are to be used in voluntary bottom-up initiatives. The objective of the present study was to investigate if (and to what extent) a consensus on environmental indicators for buildings as 'a common language for green building' can be reached among core actors in the Danish building sector and what such indicators could look like. Based on an analysis of current indicator systems and a qualitative investigation of the views of different actor groups on environmental indicators for buildings, the areas of consensus and lines of conflict between the actor groups were identified. Four different technological frames were used to identify four different perceptions of environmental indicators. Applying the theory of the social construction of technology (SCOT) in a prospective way, the findings show that a closure of the indicator-debate on the basis of an all-actors consensus within the near future is unlikely. Instead, three likely scenarios are described for the future development of the indicator debate and the directions for different actors are identified to create a common language for the use of green building indicators.

J	Stenberg, AC				Stenberg, Ann-Charlotte			Green ideas travelling across organizational boundaries	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						community of action; community of practice; green building; identity construction; innovation; organizational culture; policy implementation; sense-making; travel of ideas		In the last few decades, environmental commitment has become a powerful discursive means of mobilizing actors and developing distinct organizational identity. However, the prevalent uncertainty in society concerning the interpretation and operationalization of concepts, such as `green', `sustainable', `environment' and `ecology' allows for interpretative flexibility. Accordingly, individual members or groups of members in organizations operationalize the concept green in ways that make sense to their working contexts' specific ontology, epistemology and ideology. Based on a comparative case study of three Swedish municipal housing companies, the paper examines how green ideas are translated as they travel across organizational boundaries, and how these notions become embedded within different organizational processes, and thus set external as well as internal boundaries. The underlying assumption is that the meaning of `green' shifts depending on which organization and sphere of society is in perspective. Therefore, the paper traces spatial shifts in meanings of `green' as these travel across organizational boundaries, from the local governmental authority, via the Parent company, to the three individual companies studied. Comparing the companies' official environmental statements with the organizational members' representations of green shows discrepancies in talk and action, which may have implications for the companies' internal identity as well as for the creation of an external image. Furthermore, these discrepancies are traced to different communities of action and practice, i.e. those who make strategic environmental decisions in the companies are not the same as those who possess environmental expertise.

J	Bangwal, D; Tiwari, P				Bangwal, Deepak; Tiwari, Prakash			Environmental design and awareness impact on organization image	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design management; Building information modelling; Construction planning	SUSTAINABLE OFFICE BUILDINGS; GREEN BUILDINGS; OCCUPANT SATISFACTION; CORPORATE IMAGE; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; LEED; SYSTEMS; ENERGY; MODEL	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how environmental design features of a green building contribute to the formation of employees' organization image (OIM) through better environmental awareness (EAW) within employees. Design/methodology/approach Based on a comprehensive literature review on environmental design features of a building, a theoretical model was proposed for investigation. Three putative paths linking workspace (WSP) to EAW, departmental space (DSP) to EAW and EAW to OIM were then tested relying on a survey data of 362 employees collected from three Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified buildings by using structural equation modeling methodology as prescribed by Hair et al. Findings Significant evidence was found in support of all three purposed paths. Further, the study found that workspace and the DSP together explained around 46 percent of the variance in employee's EAW, which then explained around 54 percent of the variance in the formation of the employees' OIM. Research limitations/implications - The study drew data only from green certified organizations. Future research should involve other green organizations or a larger sample of green buildings. The size and character of the sample were restricted by organizational constraints. Practical implications - The organizations need to be extremely cautious of green concerns during the design phase in order to capitalize on the yields of better employees' OIM. It also motivates the other organizational group toward the green building concept to increase the employees' EAW and to enhance organizational values and image. Originality/value - While the green concept has been a significant research topic for more than decades, barely any research has been conducted that focuses specifically on environmental design features of a green building on employees' EAW and OIM. This study tries to make a link between green building design features with employees' EAW and OIM. These links are rare in Indian perspective.

J	Hu, M; Shealy, T				Hu, Mo; Shealy, Tripp			Overcoming Status Quo Bias for Resilient Stormwater Infrastructure: Empirical Evidence in Neurocognition and Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; BARRIERS; POLICY; CONSTRUCTION; ACTIVATION; MANAGEMENT	Green infrastructure solutions like bio-retention systems, permeable pavements, and water harvesting programs are cost-effective for stormwater management and more adaptive to a changing climate. However, implementing green infrastructure is constrained by status quo bias. Status quo bias inhibits solutions that do not align with industry norms. The research presented in this paper tests how the formal expression of opinion by city officials for green infrastructure in a municipal resolution neutralizes the effects of status quo bias. Engineering graduate students trained in stormwater management were asked to evaluate two decision scenarios while wearing an instrument that measured brain activation. Each decision scenario included one green and one gray solution. Half of the graduate students randomly received additional information about a newly approved green infrastructure resolution. Students who received this information were significantly more willing to recommend the green over gray option. The resolution reduced their perception of risk associated with green infrastructure. Students who received the resolution perceived risk about cost and performance of green infrastructure as significantly less than the control group. The change in perception about risk was also observable in their brains. The students who received the resolution exerted significantly higher levels of neurocognitive activation in the brain regions associated with risk processing corresponding with a reduction in perceived risk. These results present both behavioral and neurocognitive evidence for how small interventions to the engineering decision-making process can significantly change how engineers construct preferences and make decisions. Municipal resolutions can help overcome status quo bias by suppressing perceptions of risk that arise when deviating from social or industry norms. These results offer a new type of data for how information about engineering is cognitively managed in the brain and how the presentation of this information influences engineering outcomes. These findings offer an initial mind-behavior relationship and opens a new avenue of research in engineering management to explore how engineers cognitively make decisions and the influence of cognitive biases on engineering design.

J	Alamdari, AM; Jabarzadeh, Y; Samson, D; Sanoubar, N				Alamdari, Ardalan Marandi; Jabarzadeh, Younis; Samson, Daniel; Sanoubar, Naser			Supply chain risk factors in green construction of residential mega projects - interactions and categorization	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk management; Construction; Supply chain	EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFICATION; MEGAPROJECTS; BARRIERS; MODELS; SYSTEM; IMPACT; DELPHI	Purpose Green construction has begun implementing sustainable and environmentally friendly practices, but there has not yet been an assessment for green construction supply chain risks in the literature. Identification and assessment of potential risks will result in more appropriate risk mitigation strategies to overcome disruptions affecting higher performance. Thus, this study aims to identify green construction supply chain risks of residential mega-projects. Design/methodology/approach Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) provided a hierarchical model composed of seven layers that elucidated the driving influences between the elements. Matrice d'impacts croises-multiplication applique an classement (MICMAC) analysis classified the elements into the driver, linkage and dependent variables based on their dependence and driving powers, providing a clearer understanding of risk factors and their influential characteristics. Using experts' knowledge and experience is compatible with the subjective nature of 'supply chain risks' and is more suitable while collecting pertinent quantitative data which is far more challenging. Findings Tenable output, using an international expert group, addressed key risk factors. Technical expertise and skilled labor, key customers, and corporate culture are found as elements with most driving power, and the final product and logistics coordination and supply chain configuration found as the most dependent risk factors. Managerial implications addressed the most fundamental risk sources and suggested practical proactive risk management approaches to maximize green supply chain performance. Originality/value Identified supply chain oriented key risk factors of the residential green mega projects add novelty to the context of green construction projects' supply chain management. And eliciting the influential relations of the key risk factors provide a bigger picture of key risks in green residential mega projects that can be extended by sub-risks related to process activities. Assessing supply chain risks' interactions in the context of green residential mega projects is a novel contribution to mega construction-project management's body of knowledge. Also, the key risk factors were categorized based on the characteristics known as driving power and dependence.

J	Raouf, AM; Al-Ghamdi, SG				Raouf, Ayman M.; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G.			Framework to evaluate quality performance of green building delivery: construction and operational stage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Green buildings; quality performance; project delivery systems; sustainability; construction quality; operational quality	PROJECTS	Quality performance in construction is the degree of compliance with the specifications against which the work was executed. Green buildings extend the compliance to sustainability-related aspects to ensure that the energy and water consumption is conserved, promote a healthy indoor environmental quality and reducing the detrimental impacts of the construction activities on the environment. The operational stage reflects the construction workmanship and the effectiveness of the design solution to achieve the sustainability requirements through the overall building performance. Procedures for maintenance and overhauling extend the longevity of buildings. Green buildings exhibit underperformance caused by inadequate construction practices and a lack of understanding of the operations and maintenance practices. This research serves to tackle this problem through a comprehensive and forward-looking framework to depict construction- and operation-related quality activities through an integrated definition for the function modeling (IDEF0) process model. Semi-structured interviews and a focus group validate the framework's suitability and its implementation offered revelations from industry practitioners on the factors affecting quality procedures from assigned metrics, liaison of staff from different project lifecycle stages, green building technologies, commissioning and retro-commissioning and impact of project delivery systems adopted especially in isolating operational liaison. The contributions of this work reinforce the impact of quality on the sustainability objectives that a green building is envisioned to serve, and through capturing the pre-, during, and post-construction lifecycle, the compliance and performance quality aspects are combined in a more integrated manner.

Prior to contractor selection, prequalification is an important step, which requires contractors with certain capabilities in addition to traditional features. This study aims to develop a systematic and practical model for prequalification in GB projects using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach by adopting the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach The AHP model with 8 main criteria groups and 25 sub-criteria is structured based on literature review and professional opinions accompanied by a pilot study. Then, interviews with experts, who are experienced in the development and application phases of GB projects in Turkey, are arranged to collect judgements. The agreement levels between different groups of experts are analysed via Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Model applicability is tested on six hypothetical contractors for practicality. Findings The results show that i) financial capabilities, ii) legal status and iii) sustainability groups are the top three main criteria, while i) compliance with schedule requirements of the client, ii) current legal status including suits, iii) negative litigation history records, iv) contractor's compliance capacity to client's sustainability checklist for the proposed project and v) sustainability with lower life cycle cost (durability, maintenance, constructability) are the top five sub-criteria. Originality/value There is a gap in the literature analysing contractor prequalification phase in GB projects. This study attempts to fill this lack provided with a practical evaluation tool.

The resulting framework for BIM-based organizational capabilities development comprising of three hierarchical layers - technology, process and outcomes - is explained. Design/methodology/approach For this study, BIM has been identified as an enabler and a process for achieving lean and green outcomes on construction projects. Based on a detailed literature review, this paper identifies the organizational capabilities needed by the architecture, engineering and construction organizations to effectively implement BIM on construction projects. The study has been conducted through a sequential mixed-method approach involving semi-structured interviews, focus groups and qualitative comparative analyses. Findings It was discovered that to attain desired project outcomes, an organization needs to embrace an underlying BIM adoption culture not only within its project teams but also within the organization as a whole. The study also concluded that an integrated approach to BIM usage - connecting it with lean and green initiatives - on construction projects resulted in improved project outcomes, especially ones targeting lean and green aspects of improvements. Practical implications The proposed outline for BIM-based organizational capabilities will help the organizations focus on the human factors along with the technical factors while striving for successful usage within their organizations. Originality/value Using the organizational capabilities matrix, this paper highlights the importance of technical and social skill sets of an individual employee and their role in developing the organizational capabilities to gain the desired lean and green outcomes.

J	Chan, APC; Darko, A; Ameyaw, EE; Owusu-Manu, D				Chan, Albert P. C.; Darko, Amos; Ameyaw, Ernest E.; Owusu-Manu, De-Graft			Barriers Affecting the Adoption of Green Building Technologies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Green building; Barriers; Construction industry; Sustainable development	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CONSTRUCTION; DRIVERS; AWARENESS; DESIGN	Green building (GB) is gaining increased acceptance in the construction industry as a viable solution for meeting the growing demand for environmentally friendly or healthy buildings. However, the uptake of GB technologies is not as apparent as it should have been. This paper aims to examine the criticality of various barriers preventing the wider adoption of GB technologies. Results from statistical analyses of 104 questionnaire survey responses from GB experts around the world are presented. The results validated the criticality of 19 of the 26 barriers used for the survey. Respondents from different countries and with diverse backgrounds displayed broad consensus on the criticality levels of the barriers. Resistance of stakeholders to change and higher cost are identified as the most critical barriers to implementing GB technologies. Generally, the various groups of respondents shared similar views on the number of barriers affecting the industry; however, respondents with more than 15years of experience in GB perceived fewer barriers. The factor analysis showed that the barriers to GB technologies adoption could be grouped into five main interrelated components, which suggest the need for holistic and integrated strategies to overcome the barriers. The findings of this paper could help policy makers identify specific problems in GB technologies adoption and develop suitable strategies for their wider uptake.

Environmental assessment in construction using a Spatial Decision Support System	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Environmental assessment; Building; Spatial system	GREEN BUILDING CHALLENGE; LAND-USE; GIS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	This research proposes a Spatial Decision Support System based on the Geographical Information System (GIS) to evaluate the environmental performance in construction. The system has been designed to add a spatial component to the current tools for the inspection and management of the sustainability of buildings and to assist the planners in their decision-making. The multi-criteria evaluation method developed in the Green Building Challenge and implemented in the software SbTool has been used as a reference. The evaluation method presents a hierarchical structure of criteria and variables which is applied to buildings spatially indexed in GIS and the environmental data of the buildings comes from an external data-base developed in Access. In order to validate the system, the environmental assessment of a group of residential, industrial and public service buildings during the phases of operation was simulated. The application of this tool in the inspection and environmental assessment of buildings allows the geographical scale of analysis to be extended to a group of buildings within the area of interest and consequently to extend the limits of its usefulness within the field of planning and environmental assessment.

In this regard, through the lenses of qualified and competent GB developers (GBD) and real estate agents (REAs) using judgment sampling technique, this paper aims to evaluate the factors stimulating the purchase intention of Malaysian homebuyers. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the interval-valued fuzzy Delphi method (IVFDM) to identify influential factors, while the cybernetic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (CFAHP) for prioritizing the identified factors according to their significance in nationwide promotion of GBs is utilized. Findings The findings, which are consistent with those reported in the literature and validated by the focus group, uncover the most prominent factors that drive the purchase intention of GB homebuyers. The results indicate that the homebuyers are familiar with the benefits of GB; however, the benefits are not sufficient to overcome the perceived "high cost" of green practices. Hence, homebuyers still seek financial incentives, which is a clear indication that financial issues are the most motivating factor. Practical implications Increase in informative promotion of GB is necessary, particularly among prospective homebuyers in developing countries where GB adoption is in its infancy. Frontline players (those who are responsible for wider promotion) can utilize the factors that this study found to be important to identify appropriate steps to increase prospective homebuyers' motivation for purchasing greener dwellings. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, review and identification of the most cited determinants that have been reported in the context of the subject. Second, this paper presents the most significant determinants in a developing country setting through the lenses of Malaysian experts in the area. Third, improvement measures could be implemented in Malaysia and other developing countries to promote the GB paradigm with an aim to make the building environment more sustainable.

Dynamic Network Analysis of Stakeholder Conflicts in Megaprojects: Sixteen-Year Case of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; RISKS; PARTICIPATION; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; CENTRALITY; FRAMEWORK	Stakeholder conflicts are hard to avoid in the implementation of megaprojects due to the diverse interests and aims among stakeholders. The previous study does not provide much evidence on dynamic patterns of stakeholder conflicts in the project duration from the planning to the construction and handover stage. Therefore, this study established a network-based framework to analyze the dynamics of stakeholder conflicts by detecting the critical conflicts and the affected relationships among stakeholders with a 16-year case study of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project. Finally, a stakeholder-conflict map was proposed to provide management strategies considering the conflict criticalness and stakeholder participation of each stakeholder conflict. After reviewing 1,748 official documents from 2003 to 2018, the chronological features of environmental conflicts, neighboring conflicts, and traditional conflicts are detected. The changes of stakeholder relationships in the project duration are discussed by five stakeholder groups: local industry, green group, supervision group, construction group, and governmental organizations. The Mirror Z strategies of stakeholder conflicts are proposed in the phases of planning, construction, and handover, respectively. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Sustainable construction projects are riskier than traditional projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the risks in sustainable construction projects in the UAE. This will help project participants to properly manage these risks in their projects. A list of thirty risks was identified based on literature review. These risks were grouped into five categories: management, technical, green team, green materials and regulatory/economic. A survey was then developed and sent to professionals from the UAE. The respondents evaluated each risk in terms of its probability of occurrence and potential impact. Forty-four responses were collected. The thirty risks were ranked based on the risk severity (probability multiplied by impact). The top five risks are shortage of clients' funding, insufficient or incorrect sustainable design information, design changes, unreasonably tight schedule for sustainable construction and poor scope definition in sustainable construction. Risk identification and assessment are important part of project risk management. This allows for appropriate risk response planning and control.

Biophilic Construction Site Model: Enhancing the Motivational and Humanistic Value of the Green Construction Site	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biophilia; Construction; Ergonomics; Performance; Sustainability; Wellbeing; Labor and personnel issues		85% of a construction worker's work-day is spent on the construction site. This means that a large part of a worker's health and wellbeing could depend on the construction site and its environs. Construction work, which is inherently stressful due to the ever present threat of fatalities and injuries, compromises the ergonomic reality and human sustenance on construction sites. This necessitates the need to create a beneficial and comfortable environment that is motivational, inspirational, and healing. The biophilic construction site model (BCSM) which involves methodology of 'greening construction sites', is proposed as a healthy means of tapping into the natural resources of the construction site environment. It is intended to create a comfort zone on the construction site that would generate a symbiotic benefit to enhance its humanistic value and engender the health and wellbeing and creative performance of workers. The paper reports on a case study in the form of a focus group study and a comparative analysis of two similar construction sites in the Northern Cape region of South Africa. The findings present the healthy inter-nurture existing between a living construction site and its human occupants as a cost effective psychotherapeutic intervention in sustainable sites initiative and ergonomics, which according to research findings is as of yet missing in the construction management body of knowledge (CMBOK). The paper conclusively recommends the 'greening of construction sites'; specifically the inclusion of plants within site offices, welfare facilities and worksite premises; as a relevant means of harnessing nature's healing and rejuvenating essence towards a more productive goal in construction.

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one of these technologies and brings its own set of challenges and problems with a resulting mutual articulation of this technology and the building. A Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approach explores how negotiations between informal groups of project actors with shared interests shape the ongoing specification of both BIPV and the building. Six main groups with different interests were found to be involved in the introduction of BIPV (Cost Watchers, Design Aesthetes, Green Guardians, Design Optimizers, Generation Maximizers and Users). Their involvement around three sets of issues (design changes from lack of familiarity with the technology, misunderstandings from unfamiliar interdependencies of trades and the effects of standard firm procedure) is followed. Findings underline how BIPV requires a level of integration that typically spans different work packages and how standard contractual structures inhibit the smooth incorporation of BIPV. Successful implementation is marked by ongoing (re-)design of both the building and the technology as informal fluid groups of project actors with shared interests address the succession of problems which arise in the process of implementation.

J	Metham, M; Benjaoran, V; Sedthamanop, A				Metham, Mathagul; Benjaoran, Vacharapoom; Sedthamanop, Akepong			An evaluation of Green Road Incentive Procurement in road construction projects by using the AHP	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Analytic hierarchy process; bid evaluation; incentive procurement; emissions; road construction	DECISION-MAKING; SELECTION; COST	Road construction is an important activity which emits a huge amount of greenhouse gases. Voluntary actions to reduce the emissions from construction practices have rarely received attention from contractors because eco-construction methods tend to incur extra project costs and induce the bidders' concern to lose the bidding competitions. This study developed an incentive procurement system named Green Road Incentive Procurement (GRIP) to persuade contractors to adopt environmental-friendly construction methods. Initially, GRIP proposed six highly potential alternative construction methods of emission reduction for which bidders could choose as their preference. To ensure the acceptance and collaboration of this new GRIP, a survey study was conducted on two directly involved parties of road construction projects, contractors and public owners, which were selected as a sample group. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to evaluate an opinion by three options based on eight criteria. The results showed that both contractors and the public owners gave the highest weighted scores for the GRIP full implementation alternative. The users' readiness was an AHP criterion, which both parties were mutually concerned as the highest significance. These results confirmed that both involved parties agreed with the concept of GRIP and were pleased to cooperate with the GRIP implementation.

Design/methodology/approach Through in-depth interviews with six stakeholder groups, namely, the government, developers, designers, contractors, manufacturers and researchers, 13 critical factors were identified and used to construct stakeholder-grouped FCMs, which were further aggregated into a collective FCM. The complexity and density of the collective FCM and the centrality of factors in the FCM were examined. Subsequently, a series of "what-if" simulations of the collective FCM were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting prefabrication. Findings The results show that three factors including market demand, cost, and policies and regulations have been mentioned by all stakeholder groups. However, these factors were ranked differently by stakeholder groups, implying that different stakeholder groups perceive the barriers to prefabricated building technologies differently. FCM simulations show that strengthening policies and regulations yield the strongest overall effect stimulating prefabrication, alleviating the organizational and environmental barriers more than the technological barriers, while improving the knowledge and expertise alleviate the technological barriers more. These measures need to be accompanied by other approaches, such as reducing cost and improving quality. Originality/value Few studies aim to analyze the interactions among the barriers to prefabrication, while this study specifically investigates this issue by illustrating the complex interactions using FCMs. Few studies also aim to identify the intervention strategies promoting prefabrication based on a quantitative approach, while this study employs FCM simulations to directly simulate the effectiveness of different strategies to facilitate prefabrication in a quantitative manner.

Mapping this content to established practices provides a useful approach for engineering managers as these practices have already established implementation insights and guidelines as well as measurement and evaluation mechanisms. In this work, an integrated hierarchical decision-making network model was developed to model the interdependencies of decision options, generate weights of these options, and map the same to established sustainable manufacturing practices.

J	Liao, KW; Lee, YT				Liao, Kuo-Wei; Lee, Yi-Ting			Detection of rust defects on steel bridge coatings via digital image recognition	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Digital image process; Steel corrosion; Rust area; Color space; Least square support vector machine	COLOR	One of the major expenses for steel structures is the anti-corrosion maintenance tasks. The maintenance of a steel structure depends on regular inspections, and visual inspections are often adopted in Taiwan. Using the naked eye to determine the rusted area percentage greatly depends on the experience of the inspector, resulting in subjective results. As an alternative, an algorithm consisting of three different approaches is proposed to automatically process images. The Hue percentage and coefficient of variation (COV) of the gray levels are used to divide images into three groups in which each group is assessed using a specific recognition technique. The three proposed techniques are the following: the traditional K-means method in the H component, the double-center double-radius (DCDR) algorithm in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space and DCDR in the Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space. Additionally, the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) was adopted to predict the radii in the DCDR approaches. One hundred images, mostly collected outdoors, were used to verify the proposed algorithm. Promising performance was observed, particularly for images with non-uniform illumination.

Owing to the growing complexity of organizations and economy in general, this trend is expected to continue to remain a high priority for organizations. Continuous performance evaluations that utilize both qualitative and quantitative information play a significant role in sustaining efficient and effective business processes. Therefore, the literature offers a wide range of performance evaluation methodologies to assess the operational efficiency in various industries. Majority of these models, however, focus solely on quantitative criteria, avoiding the interrelations and dependencies between qualitative and quantitative measurements. Furthermore, these methodologies tend to utilize discrete and contemporary information eliminating historical performance data. With these motivations, this paper proposes an integrated approach combining fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and artificial neural network (ANN) methodologies for performance evaluation. In the proposed model, DEMATEL and ANP methodologies are utilized in a group decision-making concept to obtain priorities of the evaluation criteria. Following this, an ANN model is designed and trained with historical performance data collected from the organization and the results of the fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP model. The outcomes include the relational data among the criteria and alternatives used in the model in addition to their relative rankings. A food industry case study is presented to demonstrate the steps of the proposed model.

Environmental and sustainability assessment tools for buildings and neighbourhoods have been developed to promote sustainable building, but their usage has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated self-reported knowledge and usage of such tools among competitors and jury group from 10 European countries involved in the international architectural competition A New City Centre for Kiruna' in Sweden. The questionnaire revealed that 13% used environmental assessment tools or management systems in the competition, although 47% had used them previously. Tool users reported greater knowledge of how to handle environmental impacts than non-users. However, the self-rated experience of handling various environmental impacts, in the competition and in general, was low for both groups. Nevertheless, the self-rated importance of environmental impacts was high among all participants. Based on this study, it is concluded that environmental assessment tools, issues and goals can be better integrated into the processes of early design in planning and building projects, and in architectural competitions. Furthermore, to limit environmental impacts in building and planning projects, professionals need to be educated about environmental strategies and solutions.

J	Putra, HC; Hong, TZ; Andrews, C				Putra, Handi Chandra; Hong, Tianzhen; Andrews, Clinton			An ontology to represent synthetic building occupant characteristics and behavior	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Synthetic population; Occupant model; Occupant behavior; Building simulation; Occupant; Agent-based modeling	ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; GREEN; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; APPLIANCES; DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; PROFILES; PATTERNS	Since the introduction of the occupant behavior Drivers-Needs-Actions-Systems (DNAS) framework in 2013, researchers have used the framework or further developed it based on their case studies, which include efforts to collect new data on occupant behaviors. The effort is often costly for the relatively few new data points added. Problems emerge when the already collected data do not meet the modelers? interoperability requirements. Previous studies addressed this issue by developing more sophisticated ontologies that enable integration with other datasets and synthetic data methodologies that would meet unique research applications. This paper presents an extension of the DNAS framework for the representation of synthetic occupant data to support various applications and use cases across the building life cycle. An agent-based modeling application is one of our motivations that requires more elaborate characteristics of an occupant-agent or a group-of-agent. The extension, built upon a review of the literature, introduces new elements to the framework that fall into five categories, including socio-economic, geographical location, activities, subjective values, and individual and collective adaptive actions. On-going research includes identifying occupant datasets and developing data fusion methods to generate synthetic occupants, as well as to demonstrate its applications in agent-based modeling coupled with building performance simulation.

Managing the LEED Analysis for the New Civil and Environmental Engineering Complex at Mississippi State University	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sustainability; Sustainable sites; Indoor and environmental quality; Materials and resources; Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design; Energy and atmosphere; Water efficiency; Management		Mississippi State University (MSU) represented by its Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) department is currently in the design-development stage for the construction of a new CEE Complex (CEEC). The CEE is garnering a new focus on sustainability with special emphasis on environmentally responsible design, construction, and operation of constructed facilities. To promote the aforementioned goals of sustainability, the authors have mentored a group of 23 undergraduate junior students under the High-Performance Sustainable Construction class to provide a comprehensive Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) analysis for the new CEEC. Based on the 2009 Reference Guide for Green Building Design and Construction, this paper presents a detailed overview showing (1)which credits are attainable in light of the current available design documents; (2)which credits are not incorporated in the current design documents but are achievable with some modifications and amendments; and (3)which credits are not obtainable regardless of any reasonable new design proposals. This case-study research shows that CEEC can possibly earn up to 71 points to acquire a LEED Gold certification. In addition, this study shows how undergraduate students can be mentored through active learning techniques to be effective and efficient participants in societal developments through their university curriculums.

Sustainable property funds: financial stakeholders' views on sustainability criteria and market acceptance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						key financial stakeholders; market acceptance; responsible property investment; sustainability criteria; sustainable real estate funds	ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS; ANTHROPOCENTRIC ATTITUDES; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; AGE-DIFFERENCES; RISK; LIFE; IMPACTS; CHOICE; STOCK; QUESTIONNAIRE	Sustainable property (real estate) funds (S-REFs) have started to enter international finance markets. An investigation in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland examined two key questions: (1) the sustainability criteria that institutional real estate investors and real estate fund (REF) suppliers regard as important for the market success of S-REFs; and (2) how they assess the market acceptance of such funds. Focus groups were conducted to define sustainability components for S-REFs from a market success perspective. A questionnaire study was then undertaken to assess the two key questions. Factor analysis identified four independent sustainability factors: (1) building materials and energy; (2) expenses, return, and flexibility; (3) green space design; and (4) landscape and natural ecology. In the factor analysis, the set of criteria relating to sustainable social infrastructure did not form an independent factor. In total, 76% of the responding institutional investors decided on an S-REF investment, and 38% reported accepting return shortfalls against the REF benchmark. The market acceptance of S-REFs by institutional investors depends on cognitive drivers, institutional context, age, and family status of investors. These results can inform the design of S-REFs, marketing strategies, and sustainability ratings.

A geographic information system (GIS)-based systematic approach towards exploring the impact of the urban built form and the heat island phenomenon on domestic space heating needs and heat-related mortality is demonstrated. The physical properties of individual dwellings were inferred from existing GIS databases as a function of given attributes (such as the form and age of the property). Localized annual heating degree-days (HDD) across London were predicted using a site-specific model. Each dwelling was modelled using a modified version of the steady-state annual domestic energy model. The energy consumption profiles generated were subsequently compared with existing top-down regional energy statistics. In addition, local environmental factors such as built density, green coverage ratio, and land surface temperature were extracted from a combination of GIS and satellite image data sources. By mapping these factors across the Greater London Area, their influence on the risk of heat death during the 2006 heatwave was examined. The model could potentially be utilized to inform urban-scale policies relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the identification of heat-vulnerable population groups across London.

Integrating Worker Health and Safety into Sustainable Design and Construction: Designer and Constructor Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Safety risk; Prevention through Design (PtD); Research methods; Statistical analysis; Sustainable construction		Sustainable building design and construction is gaining rapid growth within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency of building projects by incorporating efficient and effective materials, technologies, and strategies into the building process. However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Hwang, BG; Zhao, XJ; Yang, KW				Hwang, Bon-Gang; Zhao, Xiaojing; Yang, Kay Wei			Effect of BIM on Rework in Construction Projects in Singapore: Status Quo, Magnitude, Impact, and Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building Information Modeling; Rework; Time; Cost; Construction project	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; COST; RISKS; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; SYSTEM; GREEN	Rework is a pervasive problem that adversely impacts the performance of construction projects and has become one of the most common concerns of the industry and academia. The rapid popularization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is deemed useful for controlling rework and its resulting cost and time overruns. However, little empirical research has been done to show the impact of BIM implementation on rework in construction projects. As a result, by comparing two groups of projects (with and without BIM implementation), this paper first aims to assess and compare the rework status quo as well as the rework magnitude and impact by project type and by rework source. This study also proposes a set of practical strategies that can help prevent rework in projects with BIM implementation using a fuzzy set theory-based model. To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature review was conducted, followed by pre-interviews, a questionnaire survey, statistical analyses, and post-interviews. The results of the analyses and interviews show that the projects with BIM implementation tend to have experienced lower incidence, magnitude, and impact of rework relative to projects without BIM implementation. BIM implementation is also found to have a significant impact on reducing rework arising from owner change, design error/omission, design change, and vendor error/omission. The identified top three strategies to utilize BIM to reduce rework are use of BIM throughout the design and construction phase, design reviews, verifications, and audit to reduce system errors, and rework tracking system to prevent future occurrences of rework. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study makes the first attempt to measure the effects of BIM implementation on rework in construction projects using actual project data. The findings of this study enable practitioners to implement strategies to minimize rework with BIM implementation, improve projects' cost and time performance, and improve the efficiency of project delivery.
