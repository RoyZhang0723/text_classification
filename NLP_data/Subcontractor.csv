J	Polat, G				Polat, Gul			SUBCONTRACTOR SELECTION USING THE INTEGRATION OF THE AHP AND PROMETHEE METHODS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subcontractor selection; multi-criteria-decision-making; AHP; PROMETHEE; GAIA; sensitivity analysis	BLOCKS MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS; EVALUATION SYSTEM; DECISION-MAKING; CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; CRITERIA; MODEL; SUB; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTS	On many construction projects, especially building projects, 80-90% of the tasks are performed by subcontractors. Since the success of the project highly depends on the performances of the subcontractors, selecting the right subcontractor for the right job is critical. Main contractors generally tend to select the subcontractors that offer the lowest bid price. However, working with unqualified and insufficiently financed subcontractors may result in inefficiencies and failures. Thus, a combination of several compromising and conflicting criteria underpinning financial capacity and competencies of the subcontractors should be considered during the subcontractor selection process. This paper proposes an integrated decision approach, which employs analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) together, for the subcontractor selection problem. In the proposed approach, AHP is used to analyze the structure of the subcontractor selection problem and to determine the weights of the criteria, and PROMETHEE is employed to obtain complete ranking and perform sensitivity analysis by changing the weights of criteria. The proposed approach is applied to a problem of selecting the most appropriate subcontractor to be worked with in an international construction project. Company management found the proposed decision approach satisfactory and implementable in future subcontractor selection problems.

The high impact of subcontractors on the construction process means that the selection of subcontractors is a sensitive activity. Previous investigations documented the selection of subcontractors based on criteria but did not consider the number of subcontracted tasks. This paper explores allocating the best portion of tasks to subcontractors while optimizing the risk and cost in the fixed project schedule. The study's main finding demonstrates that subcontractor selection without attention to the order allocation is not a realistic approach; therefore, a hybrid model that applies continuous ant colony and fuzzy set theory is proposed.

J	Kumaraswamy, MM; Matthews, JD				Kumaraswamy, MM; Matthews, JD			Improved subcontractor selection employing partnering principles	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Despite the increasing extent of subcontracting in construction, the importance of subcontractor selection is frequently underestimated. While the subcontracting element needs more attention in contractor selection itself, subcontractor selection techniques themselves need considerable improvements. This paper examines how such techniques can beneficially draw from improved multicriteria contractor selection methodologies in general, and specifically from recent developments in client-contractor partnering. It is shown how partnering may be profitably extended further into the supply chain, i.e., into subcontractor selection. A European case study illustrates the development of a subcontractor selection process that incorporated partnering principles. Despite the longer and costlier selection process, it was found that subcontractor pricing levels were reduced by about 10% to account for anticipated efficiencies arising from the proposed partnering. Markedly better time and cost control was achieved on the pilot project. The relationships between all project participants were also found to have improved considerably. Such observations confirm the value (1) of expanding the partnering "envelope" to encompass subcontractors in general; and more specifically, (2) of assessing the potential for such extended partnering as an integral part of the subcontractor selection process.

Subcontractor schedule control method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Trade coordination and claims documentation is a challenge on any project, particularly for specialty subcontractors. The writers introduce a schedule control method initiated by the subcontractor, which facilitates coordination and communication between a subcontractor and other project participants as well as documentation to the prime contractor. A case study illustrates the preparation of a trade-specific critical path method (CPM) schedule, which is updated on a regular basis. The writers also address the interrelationship between the CPM schedule, internal reporting, schedule of values, and labor tracking. It is difficult to ensure that all subcontractor-produced documentation is complementary, but it is well worth the effort when it comes to supporting a claim. Monthly schedule updates and narratives communicate the conflicts, issues, and schedule constraints the subcontractor experiences or anticipates on a project, thereby providing contractually required notice to the prime contractor during the project. This increases the likelihood of resolving issues during the project, while simultaneously protecting a subcontractor's position if change order requests are denied or if back charges are levied prompting a subcontractor to enforce its rights, execute a claim, or proceed to litigation.

As one of the most important factors influencing subcontractor behavioral intentions, perceived justice from previous collaborative experience affects the willingness of a subcontractor to cooperate with a general contractor in the future. In this paper, a model is built based on social exchange theory to examine the relationship between justice perception, relationship value, and subcontractor willingness to cooperate (WTC). Analysis of data from 122 subcontractors demonstrates that distributive justice and interactional justice positively affect WTC, and relationship value from the general contractor partially mediates such effects. However, procedural justice does not significantly affect WTC. The study provides a new perspective for examining the internal mechanisms between subcontractor justice perception and WTC. The findings will also help general contractors understand how their behaviors affect subcontractor WTC, thus providing practical implications for subcontracting management.

Although subcontracting is a usual phenomenon in the construction industry, insufficient attention to the subcontractor selection strategy may pose some major threats to a project. Having in mind the significance of such risks, the optimization of subcontractor selection is essential for the success of the project. The importance of risk management in selecting subcontractors and the direct relation between risks and returns in most projects are two main motives for using the concept of portfolio in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to propose a model to allocate the best portion of project's task to some subcontractors in order to reach the optimized portfolio of subcontractors and main contractor. This is a new approach in the subcontractor management; therefore, after presenting the model, an illustrative example will be presented for better understanding.

Social network conformity and construction work plan reliability	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social network analysis; Job site interactions; Social influence; Conformity; Construction subcontractors; Work plan reliability	LABOR FLOW RELIABILITY; FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES; PRODUCTIVITY	In a large construction project delivery is usually handled by numerous subcontractors. Work plan reliability (WPR) of subcontractors is an essential element for improving project performance. Previous research mainly focused on the consequence of the WPR variability of a subcontractor on the following subcontractors in the project task-sequence. Construction industry lacks a good understanding of the social aspect of the subcontractors' WPR. Plausibly and arguably, construction subcontractors and their interactions/relationships in a project constitute a network, conceptualized as a "social network". "Social conformity" is one of the various social influehte types that results in a change of performance/behavior in order tuft in a group. This research aims to understand how conformity plays a role in the subcontractors' performance particularly in their WPR. The objective of this paper is to develop an analytical approach to 1) demonstrate the impact of conformity on the WPR of subcontractors, and 2) identify the role of social network in conformity occurrence in a construction project. Two construction projects, each including a general contractor overseeing several subcontractors, were Studied. Findings show that deviation from norms decreases as project proceeds. It also shows that the tendency of subcontractors to follow the norms of their neighborhood (local) is higher than their willing to follow the project norm (global). The research contributes to the body of knowledge as it proposes a social network based approach for the first time to explore how the subcontractors' WPR in a construction project can be under the influence of the conformity phenomenon. Understanding the subcontractors' manner can be useful for project managers when they need to establish a long-term working relationship with a particular subcontractor, or when they need to know much effort is necessary to spend on improvement initiatives of planning reliability.

Although previous research efforts have analyzed factors related to subcontractor performance in regular financial conditions, there remains only sparse knowledge of how subcontractors are to survive when economic conditions become dire, as they have in recent times in the Spanish construction market. In this research, in-depth interviews with managers of relevant Spanish subcontracting companies were carried out, resulting in the identification of eight factors for subcontractor survival: project delivery method, demand, financial capital, relationship assets, managerial assets, human assets, legal framework, and geographic scope. The project delivery method used by the owner and also by the main contractor is mainly based on price. As a result, the subcontractors' bids get lower, making them unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, subcontractors do not get financial support from banks easily to cover their additional financial costs. These facts push subcontractors to get a guarantee of payment by the main contractor, and subcontracting companies may even ask for payments in advance. Subcontractors also seek long-term relationships with the contractor. These trusting relations are very often a prerequisite to qualify and bid for contracts. Subcontractors have to continuously improve, plan ahead, and adapt quickly to the new environment. Therefore, subcontractors must remain flexible and maintain a lean hierarchical organization. Doing so makes it is easier for subcontractors to compete in both their native markets as well as abroad. To this end, the most successful subcontractors have become international during the expansion phase of the economic cycle; many of them went abroad with the help of a contractor from their home country.

Thomas; Skitmore, Martin			DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR SUBCONTRACTOR APPRAISAL USING A BALANCED SCORECARD	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction subcontractor; performance appraisal; balanced scorecard	SELECTION; CRITERIA; SYSTEM; MODEL	Subcontractors contribute significantly to construction projects and their performance can seriously affect overall project success. It is crucial, therefore, to appraise the performance of subcontractors to ensure they satisfy the client's expectations and project requirements. To increase the transparency and accuracy of subcontractor appraisal, the baseline and target performance levels should be set at the outset so that the appraisers and those being appraised realize exactly what standards are to be achieved. The balanced scorecard, being a powerful tool for performance appraisal, offers a potentially good approach for modeling the subcontractor appraisal process. In this paper, an approach to developing a balanced scorecard subcontractor appraisal model is proposed and demonstrated through a questionnaire survey administered in Hong Kong and from which the baseline and target performance levels for large-scale skilled subcontractors are identified. A case example is used to illustrate the operation of the model. Finally, a means by which the model may be validated is demonstrated through the use of field experts. The results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a balanced scorecard model that can help improve the transparency of subcontractor appraisal despite the baseline and target performance levels changing according to the project characteristics, subcontractor categories and size.

Benefit of Cooperation among Subcontractors in Performing High-Reliable Planning	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Subcontractors; Cooperation; Benefit allocation; Work-plan reliability; Game theory; Simulation modeling; Lean construction	PARADE GAME; CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; RELIABILITY; IMPACT; TRADE	As construction projects get larger and more complex, subcontractors can benefit from cooperation and by forming an alliance, such as partnering. Previous studies have discussed the benefit of cooperation or partnering among subcontractors and between them and other project stakeholders. However, there has been limited research to quantify the benefit of cooperation among subcontractors in performing high-reliable planning (HRP). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to quantify the benefit of cooperation among subcontractors in increasing their planning reliability at an operational level. Although HRP reduces the variability in a production system that significantly benefits the downstream subcontractors, it requires every subcontractor to put more time, cost, and effort into the planning stage, which may not be cost-effective for upstream subcontractors. To model the described situation, a simulation model (built by simulation software) was integrated with a cost model that identifies the relationship between cost and work-plan reliability (WPR) level. By utilizing different benefit-allocation models and evaluating their solutions, the paper demonstrates that a contribution-based benefit-allocation (CBBA) model using a game theory framework can provide the most acceptable and incentivizing solutions for the benefit-allocation problem. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in lean construction by quantifying the benefit of subcontractors' cooperation in increasing their planning reliability.

J	Lew, YL; Hassim, S; Muniandy, R; Hua, LT				Lew, Yoke-Lian; Hassim, Salihudin; Muniandy, Ratnasamy; Hua, Law Teik			Structural equation modelling for subcontracting practice: Malaysia chapter	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Questionnaire survey; Management	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS PERFORMANCE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; IMPACTS	Purpose Most of the previous studies conducted on the subject of subcontractors often focussed on a single phase of subcontracting practice; either on registration, selection of subcontractors or on monitoring of subcontractors without much integration to other different phases involved. Thus, on the basis of that reason, the purpose of this paper is to link the gap between different phases of subcontracting practice. This study also attempts to explore the relationships between the key criteria used by general contractors in selecting subcontractors before job awarding (CSSC) and the key criteria used for monitoring subcontractors during construction work (CMSC); which will then include an investigation of the effects these criteria have on project performance (PP). Design/methodology/approach The data obtained from a total of 162 G7 contractors in Malaysia were analysed. The interrelationships between the criteria and the effects of these criteria on PP were investigated simultaneously by employing a single model based on structural equation modelling (SEM) method. Findings The final model has discovered four major criteria that are often considered during the selection of subcontractors namely, communication, relationship, general obligation and resource management of a subcontractor. Meanwhile, the major criteria that are referred to in the monitoring of subcontractors are workmanship, awareness of environment, health and safety and communication and relationship. The four CSSC were found to be interrelated among themselves and affected CMSC during the construction stage. The research also revealed that the criteria used in monitoring subcontractor do affect the performance of a project. Thus, based on the result of this investigation, the monitoring of subcontractor is essential in discerning the performance level of a project.

J	Ng, STT; Luu, CDT				Ng, Shiu-tong Thomas; Luu, Chris Duc Thanh			Modeling subcontractor registration decisions through case-based reasoning approach	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction subcontractor; case-based reasoning; subcontractor registration	SYSTEM	Acknowledging the importance of exercising a more stringent control over subcontractors, an influential industry report urges the establishment and maintenance of a Construction Subcontractor Registration (CSR) system. One key aspect of a credible and sustainable CSR system is to ensure that those companies seeking registration are assessed according to reliable standards and mechanisms. In practice, many managers rely on intuition, experience or predictive judgment to deal with the dynamic but interrelated requirements originating from various subcontractor and work categories. Being an artificial intelligence approach that mimics human problem solving skills, the case-based reasoning (CBR) approach should have potential in providing a flexible, transparent, objective and simple CSR system. This paper describes the development of a case-based CSR system. The results of this paper should improve our understanding on the process of CSR, evaluation criteria and information requirements. The case-based CSR model will also help formulate a more structured standard for the evaluation of subcontractors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Martin, L; Benson, L				Martin, Loosemore; Benson, Lim			Relationship quality in construction projects: A subcontractor perspective of principal contractor relationships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Subcontractors; Construction; Relationship quality; Principal contractors; Supply chain management	BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; TRUST; INDUSTRY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERCEPTIONS; INTEGRATION; DEPENDENCE; BEHAVIORS; FAIRNESS	One of the defining characteristics of the construction industry is its subcontracting model of project organisation. Surprisingly, despite the criticality of the subcontractor/principal contractor relationship to successful project out-comes, research into this important relationship has been fragmented, disorganised and under-theorised. Mobil-ising theories of relationship quality to address this gap in knowledge, a survey of three hundred and thirty seven tier-one subcontractors in the Australian construction industry was undertaken to explore what factors influence relationship quality between subcontractors and principal contractors, whether these factors vary across the sup-ply chain and how they affect overall relational satisfaction. The findings give subcontractors a missing voice in this important debate and provide a more nuanced understanding of this critical project relationship from a novel theoretical perspective. They indicate that from a subcontractor perspective, subcontractor/principal contractor relationship quality is determined by six key factors: integrity respect and fairness; prompt payment; willingness to negotiate risk and price; effective communication; concern for worker health, safety and well-being; and op-portunities for early involvement in planning and design. Conceptually, when these factors are organised under the three dimensions of relationship quality theory (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), the results show that trust is by far the most important determinant of relationship quality. However, subcontractors cannot be treated as a homogeneous group and the factors that influence relationship quality and the importance of trust vary sig-nificantly between large and small subcontractors and by the amount of turnover-dependency in a relationship. Conceptually, the findings are important for refining the concept of relationship quality in a project management context and for helping construction project managers to improve often tenuous subcontractor relationships in an increasingly competitive industry where the quality of these relationships is a critical determinant of project outcomes and competitive advantage.

J	Reeves, K				Reeves, K			Construction business systems in Japan: general contractors and subcontractors	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business systems; construction business system; contracting system; contractors; subcontractors; Japan		The Japanese construction sector is characterized by the predominance of large general contractors, with multiple layers of small contractors and subcontractors working under their umbrella. Against the background of huge construction demand created by modernization (starting in 1868) and the resultant changes in the construction business (building style, materials and project scale), large general contractors and subordinate subcontractors gradually created a distinctive contracting system. The development process of the construction business based on collaboration and not free competition is discussed with particular emphasis on the unique nature of the contracting system using historical- and institutional-based analyses. One of the competitive strengths of general contractors lies with project organization at construction sites. How the subcontracting of building projects is controlled by general contractors and how subcontractors respond to their subordinate position is explored. Current strengths, inefficiencies and problems of the construction business are identified and possible systemic reforms are suggested, such as the development of competent subcontractors to revitalize the Japanese construction industry along actions for contractors, subcontractors, private- and public-sector clients.

Through involvement at different levels, subcontractors may undertake up to 90% of the total value of large construction projects. Due to the lack of systematic relationships and communication among different parties involved in construction projects, many beneficial opportunities such as short-term partnering may stay hidden and unknown during the course of projects. Although partnering is well documented in the literature, quantitative approaches have not been common for determining the value of partnering and developing practical methods for allocation of its benefits. In this study, we discuss how subcontractors can benefit considerably from joint resource management in construction projects. We present a short-term partnering case in which subcontractors form an alliance, agreeing to put all or some of their resources in a joint pool for a fixed duration of time and to allocate the group resources using a more cost-effective plan. Cooperative game theory is suggested as the basis for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation among the cooperating subcontractors. First, a resource-leveling model is used to build subcontractors' characteristic functions for all possible subcontractors' coalitions. Then, various cooperative game theoretic solution methods are applied for allocation of cooperative gains among the subcontractors. Finally, to ensure that the identified allocation rules are applicable and stable in practice, acceptable allocations are identified using various stability analysis methods. Results show that considerable savings can result from full cooperation among subcontractors based on group rationality as opposed to individual rationality.

The objectives are to understand the translating process of specific enterprise demands to the evaluating criteria and the weight calculation process. Design/methodology/approach A three-stage model of subcontractor selection was designed based on quality function deployment (QFD), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and improved grey correlation analysis (IGCA). In the proposed model, specific enterprise demands are translated by the QFD method, and the weights of the criteria are determined by the IGCA. The AHP is used to quantify the exporters' experience and construct the judgment matrix, which is used as inputting of the grey correlation analysis. Findings The proposed model provides a feasible process for subcontractor selection by fully considering the actual requirements of the project. By combining the company requirements and project requirement to put forward the requirements of the target subcontractor, the selection process ensures that the selected subcontractor and the project have a higher "fit" Originality/value Few researches on construction subcontractor selection have taken into account the "voice" of the company's stakeholders. Therefore, this paper designs a three-stage construction subcontractor selection model by introducing QFD to achieve the transmission of "voice" in the subcontractor selection process, so as to take full consideration of the project objectives and the needs of the company's stakeholders. Meanwhile, in order to decrease the subjective of weight calculation, this paper designs an AHP-IGCA allocation method to determine the weight of relevant indicators. By integrating the proposed weight calculation method and QFD method, the subcontractor selection results become more reasonable and objective.

Subcontractors who directly handle a major portion of all construction activities have a highlighted role in the building industry, so suitable subcontractor selection has a direct effect on the productivity of construction operations. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive model for subcontractor selection based on the fuzzy preference selection index. The improvement of the proposed model lies in the fact that it has found a way to eliminate the weighting criteria phase in selecting the optimal subcontractor where weighting attributes is a challenging task. The consistency test is presented for investigating the accuracy of model results with the previous scientific work.

Relative Importance of Subcontractor Selection Criteria: Evidence from Singapore	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; PERFORMANCE	Subcontractors carry out a large portion of the work done in construction projects. Thus, selecting the right subcontractor essentially contributes to the project's success. We designed a choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the relative importance of four criteria in the subcontractor selection process of main contractors from Singapore: price, technical know-how, quality, and cooperation. Although main contractors adopt a multicriteria selection process and perceive all four criteria to be important for their choice decision, the actual choice situation reveals that price is still by far the most important selection criterion, followed by quality, cooperation, and technical know-how. Main contractors are not willing to compromise on price but accept a lower performance of a known subcontractor on the remaining criteria.

It helps shift risk from the main contractor to the subcontractor and promotes specialization. Inadequate subcontracting management, however, may result in an adversarial relationship between main contractors and their subcontractors, uncoordinated on-site execution, and disappointing quality and schedule fulfillment. New subcontractor management methods and tools are being developed and tested as part of a collaborative research project led by the Catholic University Production Management Center with the participation of the Chilean Construction Chamber and several construction companies. The experience gained by testing prototype tools and methods on selected projects enabled us to develop an on-site evaluation method based on lean principles and partnering practices. This method allows main contractors to help subcontractors improve their performance by providing them with periodic feedback. It also supports subcontractor selection based on their previous performance, which helps foster collaborative relationships with those that consistently perform well. The results of the application of the method in two case studies are discussed.

J	Kim, K; Paulson, BC				Kim, K; Paulson, BC			Agent-based compensatory negotiation methodology to facilitate distributed coordination of project schedule changes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						scheduling; project management	SEARCH	Change is ubiquitous in construction project schedules and there are many interrelationships and interdependencies in project schedule changes. Therefore, a schedule change in the work of a subcontractor might affect schedules of other subcontractors, as well as the project deadline. The subcontractor should resolve schedule conflicts with other affected subcontractors. This implies that there is a need for a methodology for the distributed coordination of project schedule changes (DCPSC). This paper presents a novel agent-based compensatory negotiation methodology to facilitate the DCPSC wherein a project can be rescheduled dynamically through negotiations by all of the concerned subcontractors. The methodology consists of a compensatory negotiation strategy based on utility of timing, multilinked negotiation protocols, and message-handling mechanisms. A simple case example illustrates the. methodology. The methodology makes new contributions in both theoretical and practical areas. In practice, this methodology will improve project network schedules, by lowering the sum of the cost of the subcontractors associated with their resource constraints. In theory, the methodology provides a distributed coordination methodology that can improve interaction and collaboration among agents and people.

To protect the best interest of contracting firms, subcontractors should be carefully selected. Previous studies have been focusing on the factors leading to the success of subcontracting work without paying much attention to those factors contributing to the organizational success. To gain a better insight on the success factors for subcontracting organizations, a survey which focuses on equipment-intensive subcontractors has been conducted in Hong Kong with various construction stakeholders. Acknowledging that equipment-intensive subcontractors may have their peculiar needs and characteristics, this paper strives to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for this type of subcontractors. Seventeen CSFs for equipment-intensive subcontractors have been identified, and the results indicate that majority of them are internal factors. A one-way ANOVA test has been carried out, which confirms the consistency in perceptions of different construction stakeholders surveyed. Through a factor analysis the CSFs are grouped into six major components namely: (i) market position; (ii) equipment-related factors; (iii) human resources; (iv) earnings; (v) managerial ability to adapt to changes; and (vi) project success related factors. The findings of this research should not only help subcontractors to improve their performance but also to assist main contractor to identify a successful equipment-intensive subcontracting firm.

The performance of construction projects will be adversely affected if the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are not properly managed. Therefore, the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are becoming more and more important to the success of construction projects. Based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey in the Hong Kong construction industry, the relationship between main contractors and subcontractors was studied. Main contractors in the local industry can be classified into four clusters according to the nature of their relationship with subcontractors, namely, adversarial, coopetitive, collaborative, and partnering. Furthermore, the impact of these relationships on main contractor competitiveness and the critical factors affecting collaborative/partnering relationships and main contractor competitiveness were also explored. The findings of this research reveal that good relationships with subcontractors are positively and advantageously associated with main contractor competitiveness. A long-term partnering relationship, based on win-win principles, is more likely to benefit both parties in construction practice. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The results highlight the current subcontracting practices of main contracting firms that have resulted in a long-lasting market share abroad. Toward this aim, a detailed questionnaire was administered to 96 construction companies. Turkish and host countries' subcontractors were shown to be frequently employed in international projects. However, subcontracting firms from other countries were found to not be used. Main contracting companies generally select subcontractors in the periods after the main tender or after the project's start. Although many of them often work with previously known subcontracting companies and do not take into account the lowest bid price as the primary criterion, systematic processes or models are not used to select the best subcontractor. Most importantly, main contractors not only use subcontractors but also carry out activities using their in-house resources. Hence, this study will not only be a step for further works that can be performed by potential researchers who may find interesting similarities or differences between their countries and Turkey, but also assist contractors who plan to strengthen their positions and to increase work opportunities in the international market.

A new technique for subcontractor selection by adopting choosing by advantages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Subcontracting; subcontractor selection process; subcontractor selection factors; choosing by advantages; construction projects	BLOCKS MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CRITERIA; SYSTEM; PRODUCTIVITY; PROCUREMENT; IMPACT; MODEL	Proper selection of subcontractor is considered as an important criterion in the successful management of the various construction projects. Previous methods used for subcontractor selection (SS) suffered several drawbacks such as: its complexity and being time consuming. The main aim of this study is to propose a new technique for SS by adopting Choosing By Advantages (CBA). The selection factors for subcontractor are determined. CBA principals, steps, merits and some of its applications in the construction context are demonstrated. Proposed SS technique is then developed, implemented on a case study and compared with recent methods in literature. The main contributions to the body of knowledge are as follows: (1) propose equations which determine exactly how to assess the percentage advantage for each factor for quantitative factors, qualitative factors with different grades/ranks, and qualitative factors on a yes/no basis and (2) subcontractors attain a positive utility when they are able to combine a low price with a superior level of five factors, which are: reputation, acknowledgement certificates, qualification of staff, amount of work in the last five years, and estimated time of the project. Globally, this technique is highly beneficial to industry practitioners because it will facilitate the subcontractor selection process.	[El-Kholy, A.

J	Lee, HS; Seo, JO; Park, M; Ryu, HG; Kwon, SS				Lee, Hyun-soo; Seo, Joon-oh; Park, Moonseo; Ryu, Han-guk; Kwon, Soon-seok			Transaction-Cost-Based Selection of Appropriate General Contractor-Subcontractor Relationship Type	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Relationships between general contractors and subcontractors are generally formed on a project-by-project basis. However, because of the competitive nature of the construction industry, this traditional arrangement can result in adversarial relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, which can jeopardize potential or ongoing collaborative construction plans. To avoid this problem, close, long-term relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, as in strategic partnerships, must be established. Unfortunately, forming and sustaining such relationships can be time-consuming and cost-intensive. Furthermore, this type of relationship does not necessarily enhance cooperation or work performance. For contractors to successfully establish effective partnerships with their subcontractors, they must select the appropriate relationship by considering the different characteristics of the subcontracted work involved. Based on transaction cost theory, the findings of this study show that transaction costs incurred by general contractors and subcontractors vary according to the type of relationship established. Therefore, for the purpose of comparing transaction costs incurred in both competitive and partnership relationships, transaction-cost-based profit models for both general contractors and subcontractors are developed, respectively, for each relationship type. As well, by applying different strategies to maximize profits in each relationship, and by simulating the parameters affecting the nature of the subcontracted work, the conditions and relationships under which general contractors' profits are optimized have been determined. Finally, based on simulation, practical guidelines for choosing the most appropriate relationship type are proposed.

The developed EFHNN combines neural networks (NN) and high order neural networks (HONN) into a hybrid neural network (HNN), which acts as the major inference engine and operates with alternating linear and non-linear NN layer connections. Fuzzy logic is employed to sandwich the HNN between a fuzzification and defuzzification layer. The authors developed and applied the EFHNN to assess subcontractors performance by fusing HNN, FL and GA. Enhancing subcontractor performance assessments are crucial in terms of providing to general contractors information on historical contractor performance essential to guiding a selection of appropriate subcontractors for a specific current or future subcontracting need. Results show that the proposed EFHNN may be deployed effectively to achieve optimal mapping of input factors and subcontractor performance output. Moreover, the performance of linear and non-linear (high order) neuron layer connectors in the EFHNN was significantly better than performances achieved by previous models that used singular linear NN.

When there is a concurrent delay by multiple subcontractors, or between the GC and other subcontractor(s), there has not been a uniform approach as to how the liquidated damages are apportioned. Previous research seems to ignore this issue. This paper first reviews some relevant court cases. Using a warehouse project as a case study, it then examines different practices that the GC could take in apportioning damages of concurrent delays to both himself/herself as well as to the responsible subcontractors. Results are very inconsistent between and within the apportionment practices. This supports an alternative hypothesis that apportionment is an important issue. Practitioners should specify which apportionment practice will be used and under what circumstances it will be applied in their subcontracts. Researchers may develop a more consistent and reliable approach for this type of apportionment.

Subcontractor Evaluation and Management Framework for Strategic Partnering	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; CONSTRUCTION	Recently, main contractors have shifted their attitudes about subcontract procurement to more strategic and long-term partnering philosophies. The objective of this study was to present a framework for subcontractor evaluation and management to help main contractors develop more strategic and productive relationships with their subcontract partners. As the strategic performance feedback model, the balanced scorecard concept was adopted with modification. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the framework with subcontracting strategy, performance indexes, weighting, evaluation of subcontractor performance data, and feedback methods. The research results obtained can be useful as a guideline of subcontractor management for long-term partnering and also to enhance overall productivity within the construction supply chain.

It is the most widely used industry performance indicator because a small number of representative items covers a wide range of costs. The construction industry consists of various facility types that can be organized into many subcontractors' works. Unfortunately, the existing cost indexes have difficulty monitoring the fluctuation of the subcontractors' costs since they select representative items in macro-scale terms, such as the type of construction or facility. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop a selection model that can select the effective representative items included in the subcontractors' costs. To determine the characteristics of the subcontractors' costs, the curve estimation function of SPSS (R) 12.0 for Windows was applied to the priced bills of quantities of 30 multi-family housing projects. The results of the analysis show that the relationship between the coverage ratio and the percentage of the number of representative items follows Pareto's principle. Based on this, a selection model of representative items was developed, using the tangent function. The case study that was conducted to verify the usability of the model revealed that the proposed model can efficiently select the effective representative items from the cost items of each subcontractor's work included in multi-family housing projects.

Cluster, analyses were used to classify the firms into different groups based on four strategic tradeoffs, including the balance of product mix, the degree of research and development involvement, the breadth of technology scope, and the institutional sources of innovation. Six distinct technology strategies were then derived statistically; they were classified as opportunistic subcontractors, plural marketers, technological explorers, focused branders, hierarchical controllers, and professional subcontractors. Our study demonstrated that most of the firms remain in the same technology group over time. Yet, shifts in the firms' technology strategies are likely, notably the movement to the groups of opportunistic subcontractors and professional subcontractors. We also found that a relatively large group of firms shifted their strategies from groups of hierarchical controllers and professional subcontractors to the opportunistic subcontractors group, and from the plural marketers group to the focused branders group. In terms of profit differentials of technology groups, we found that, during an economic boom, technological explorers and focused branders had higher financial performance. In an economic recession, hierarchical controllers and professional subcontractors maintained higher profit margins. Conversely, throughout the period of study, opportunistic subcontractors had consistently poor financial performance.

However, much of the research carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) on construction-tendering has been done from the perspective of the relationship between the contractor and client. This paper addresses that gap by identifying and examining the major barriers to effective pricing of tenders by subcontractors and the business environment of their commercial relationships with contractors. A questionnaire study involving 94 subcontractors and semistructured interviews with five of them was conducted in 2011. The primary barriers to providing better cost-certainty and quality of response in quotations to contractors relate to quality of documents, bidding time, competition, resource levels, information and communication technology, unethical behavior by the contractor, uneven collaborative relationships, input specificity, level of relationship that exists, and the time to assimilate and provide the output response. Contractors and clients should help address the barriers. For contractors, this can enhance competitiveness, profitability, and supply-chain relationships. For clients, this can lead to better project outcomes because subcontractors form a major part of the organizational structure of projects. Addressing the concerns expressed by subcontractors may also require a collaborative approach, perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation and plan of action.

J	Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A				Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A			Proposed subcontractor-based employee motivational model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENTS PERCEPTION; CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; INDICATORS	The intent of this research was to identify the factors that promote positive motivational behavior in construction subcontractor crews. The factors affecting motivation, goal-setting, workforce needs, and incentives were investigated to determine the attributes for a subcontractor employee motivational model. A survey addressing these four categories was distributed to subcontractor foremen and supervisors to establish a list of motivational factors. The statistical analysis of the survey results aided in the final development of the proposed subcontractor based employee motivational model, which includes such components as confidence and competence as being reinforced by quality of work, incentives, safe performance, praise, and a sense of belonging. The proposed model provides industry practitioners with another level of understanding of the motivation sequence of the subcontractor's labor force. Perhaps the most interesting finding was related to the attributes found in relation to workforce needs. A common link "feeling of being a member of the team/crew" was discovered between "praise" and "job security." It was surmised that essentially a worker must first receive praise before they feel as if they are a member of the team/crew and once they feel like a member of the team, they then begin to acquire feelings of job security. The results of this study further reinforce the findings of several previous behavioral studies. Future research should attempt to validate the model using a larger sample size incorporating multiple general contractors.

Managing relationships with suppliers and/or subcontractors in such projects is even more critical due to additional dependency on them to complete the job. Yet it is not clear which factors influence such relationships in IEPC projects. This study intends to close this gap in the extant literature. Data has been collected from professionals involved in IEPC projects and it has been investigated how various aspects of relationship with suppliers and/or subcontractors may influence project outcomes. Logistic regression and neural networks have been used to analyze the data and subsequently identify four critical factors: service provided by suppliers and/or subcontractors, continuous improvement, supplier and/or subcontractor delivery reliability, and effective problem solving, which impact IEPC project success to the greatest extent. The findings suggest that the main contractors should pay particular attention to these aspects of relationship management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

While there has been research into the impacts of various forms of industrialized construction on the construction sector, surprisingly there has been little research into the impacts on subcontractors. The lack of subcontractor's voice in the industrialization debate is important to address since they operate at the coalface of the industry where the impacts of such changes will have a significant impact. The resource based view of the firm (RBV) is used as a theoretical lens to study these potential impacts through interviews with senior executives and managers of six major subcontracting firms which have worked with off-site bathroom pod technologies in Australia. It is found that the key subcontractor resources affected by this off-site technology are human, financial, intellectual and social and that subcontractors will need to pursue strategies which develop new skills, knowledge, networks and deeper supply chain collaborations if they are to turn the potential risks associated with off-site into potential opportunities to achieve competitive advantage.

Among other factors, the self-interested behavior of stakeholders, called autonomous agents (AAs) in game theory, has affected LC performance. AAs make decisions for their own benefit rather than for the sake of the project. This paper presents an exploration of the potential impacts that the behavior of subcontractors, as AAs, have had on the performance of LC tools, such as the last planner system (LPS). A qualitative approach was used to collect data through personal interviews with 74 participants in eight projects, built by four construction companies, throughout Texas. A quantitative approach was used to analyze the interviews. The findings were as follows: (1) subcontractors behaved as AAs; (2) the LPS did not prevent the behavior of subcontractors AAs, but it supported the management of issues by the behavior of the subcontractors as AAs; and (3) the behavior of subcontractors as AAs affected LPS performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on engineering management by identifying a problem affecting LC, prompting academics and practitioners to investigate solutions that will benefit the labor productivity of the industry.

It is assumed that construction contractors and subcontractors play a great part in adopting or neglecting an innovative technology due to different factors. We believe this reluctance attribute would be a common factor between these two groups of construction actors and it would further be an indication of sort of behavior these groups have in common. This study intends to make a major contribution to the body of knowledge by investigating BIM feasibility for SMEs. The research method consists of application of a structured online questionnaire distributed Online, out of which 70 responses from the industry were collected and analyzed. Inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing were applied to check the associations among categorical variables via Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Mann-Whitney U Test. The factors between contractors and subcontractors in terms of organizational, technological, economic, and social attributes were compared. Further, contractors were grouped in terms of BIM and software usage, firm size, and partnership by Cluster Analysis. The results show the rankings for contractors were different from the rankings for subcontractors with respect to technological feasibility and the rankings of contractors were all higher than those of subcontractors when partnership was introduced as a differentiating variable.

Modeling Interfirm Dependency: Game Theoretic Simulation to Examine the Holdup Problem in Project Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Game theory; Holdup problem; Innovation; Project networks; Simulation models	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INNOVATION; SELECTION; ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; AUCTIONS; SYSTEM; COSTS	Subcontractor selection strategies used by contractors can significantly affect short-term project and long-term organizational success. Existing research on subcontractor selection strategy implicitly assumes that the evaluation of subcontractors depends on current conditions. We extend this perspective by integrating an agent-based simulation model with game theory to examine whether precontract partner selection strategies that do not consider subcontractor selection as a repeated game may lead to a version of the holdup problem. The holdup problem we investigate focuses on relationship-specific investments in learning after the introduction of an innovation or organizational change across a project network. A minimum total cost strategy may decelerate the rate of adaptation to an innovation or organizational change, thereby proving that the holdup problem can exist in project networks. The findings contribute to subcontractor selection strategy literature by simulating the impact of the holdup problem in project networks, distinguishing task interdependence as a moderating variable, and identifying that the minimum total cost strategy can be a suboptimal strategy for project networks adapting to systemic changes.

In this paper, a system dynamics-based approach is introduced for SC selection process which is modeled considering a complex inter-related structure of different factors influencing the SCs' work quality (SWQ). To this aim, cause and effect feedback loops are used to build a qualitative model (causal loop diagram). Afterward, the relationships among various factors are determined by using the expert's judgment to construct the quantitative model (stock and flows diagram). Finally, the model is evaluated by applying a real construction project and also evaluated by carrying sensitivity analyses on different factors. The developed model is expected to help the general contractor in making a fair judgment to assess the SWQ during the execution time of activities as well as before the beginning of the work packages.

Yet relationships between main contractors and subcontractors continue to be influenced by issues that promote vicious circles of distrust. This research investigates the trust influencing factors in main contractor subcontractor relationships on projects. Empirical data was gathered from across four case studies through semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations and document reviews, and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that the change management process, economic climate, payment practices, perceptions of future work opportunities, job performance and the project-specific context influence trustfulness and trustworthiness of the different parties. The findings also imply that stronger trust in the main contractor's supply chain can only be realised and sustained through promotion of trustworthiness-induced rather than benefit-induced trustfulness.

J	Jang, S; Jeong, Y; Lee, G; Kang, Y				Jang, Sejun; Jeong, Yeonsuk; Lee, Ghang; Kang, Youngcheol			Enhancing Subcontractors' Participation in BIM-Based Design Coordination under a DBB Contract	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						BIM; Design coordination; Subcontractor; Subcontracting; Motivation	INTEGRATED PROJECT DELIVERY; IMPACT; MEP; PERFORMANCE	This paper introduces a two-step subcontracting process for building information modeling (BIM)-based design coordination under a design-bid-build (DBB) contract. Although integrated project delivery (IPD) is known to be an ideal contractual method for BIM projects, DBB still has been the dominant contracting method, owing to the complexity of IPD, as well as regional regulations. BIM-based design coordination under DBB can effectively reduce design errors through the value engineering process. However, in practice, the cost reduction realized under DBB is minimal because, unlike under IPD, DBB contracts do not provide incentives for subcontractors to reduce costs. This study proposes that subcontracting be divided into two phases: preconstruction and construction. Only subcontractors who meet the target costs during BIM-based design coordination in the preconstruction phase win the right to work during the construction phase. From case studies, this study finds quantitative cost reductions from this change in the preconstruction process. This study also reveals the manner in which this two-phase process impacts subcontractors' attitudes toward cost-reduction efforts. These findings contribute to maximizing the efficiency of BIM-based design coordination, which will eventually contribute to more efficient delivery of construction projects.

Using interviews with five of the top 20 UK contractors and one medium-sized contractor, this study explored how main contractors manage the H&S influence of subcontracting with a focus on their in-house measures. Some in-house measures found are: restricting the layers of subcontractors on projects; working with a regular chain of subcontractors; implementing a H&S reward scheme for subcontractors; and insisting on non-working subcontractor foremen who have direct responsibility for the safety of workers in their trade. These measures appear to be influenced by clients, industry peer groups, and the moral justification for occupational H&S, and they offer inter-organisational learning opportunities for contractors in devising measures to mitigate the H&S influence of subcontracting. These findings should also allay concerns that removing some of the legislative hurdles in connection with ongoing red tape debate will result in poorer H&S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Chalker, M; Loosemore, M				Chalker, Mathew; Loosemore, Martin			Trust and productivity in Australian construction projects: a subcontractor perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Trust; Collaboration; Supply chain management; Communications; Productivity capacity	SUCCESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between trust and productivity from a subcontractor perspective. More specifically it investigates: the perceived level of trust that currently exists between subcontractors and main contractors; the factors affecting trust at the project level; the relationship between trust and productivity. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line survey was undertaken with of 112 senior construction managers working for tier-1 and tier-2 subcontractors in the Australian construction industry. The survey was based on a combination of validated questions from Lau and Rowlinson's (2009) interpersonal trust and inter-firm trust in construction projects framework and Cheung et al.'s (2011) framework for a trust inventory in construction contracting. Findings - In contrast to the large number of research projects which have highlighted a lack of trust in the construction industry, the findings show that level of trust that Australian subcontractors have in main contractors is generally high. However, bid shopping is a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry which acts to undermine trust. The findings also provide strong evidence that high levels of trust influence productivity on site by enabling greater collaboration, better communication and greater flexibility, agility and informality in project relationships. Research limitations/implications - This research was undertaken in the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and within an economic boom. It is quite possible that outside this regional context which tends to dominated by larger construction firms and in an alternative economic context that the results of this research could be quite different. This possibility needs to be investigated further. Practical implications - The results indicate that this relatively healthy level of trust is down to good communication and empathy on the part of main contractors to the subcontractor's welfare. While the results showed that bid shopping is clearly a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry, subcontractors also felt that their contracts were clearly defined and that they were given sufficient time to innovate on their projects. This suggest that new communications technologies can be used to build trust through the supply chain. Given that much of the construction supply chain is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses, the challenge of diffusing these new technologies into this business environment should be a priority. Social implications - Trust in basis of effective collaboration which has been shown to produce numerous social benefits such as greater equity and justice in business relationships and higher levels of productivity and safety. Originality/value - The originality of this research is in using theories of trust to give subcontractors a greater "voice" in the construction productivity debate.

However, trust is also vulnerable and fragile. After trust is built, trust is not necessarily maintained throughout a project. Thus, after trust is violated, it is important to repair trust to sustain the role of trust. This study aimed at finding trust-repair strategies and their effectiveness between contractors and subcontractors in China through 19 in-depth interviews. This study found that subcontractors' trust-repair strategies included show of positive attitude, immediate action, self-justification, denial and excuses, correction and penance, and apology. Contractors' trust-repair strategies included promise, paying a part of the progress payment, and paying off the progress payment in arrears. Immediate action, correction and penance, and paying off the progress payment in arrears were effective trust-repair strategies. This study develops the theory of trust repair in the construction industry and provides information to support decision making by contractors and subcontractors to better repair and maintain trust.

In this research, the overall subcontracting supply chain of a construction project is considered as a global procurement system and an optimal combination of subcontractors can be obtained within this system, Combining the quick response mechanism of information technology with portfolio theory in financial management, an integrated XML (eXtensible Markup Language) of Accelerated Subcontracting And Procuring (ASAP) model was proposed. The ultimate goal of this study is not only to develop a web-based decision support system for general contractors to accurately decide an appropriate trade-off between risk and profit for different combinations of subcontractors, but to take the subcontracting and procuring process into re-engineering through omnipresent Internet.

J	Korb, S; Sacks, R				Korb, Samuel; Sacks, Rafael			Agent-Based Simulation of General Contractor-Subcontractor Interactions in a Multiproject Environment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; LEAN CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTION FLOW; MODEL; IMPACT; COST; GAME	The behavioral dynamics of general contractors and subcontractors in bidding, construction planning, and production control influence the outcomes of construction projects. To date, researchers have modeled these interactions in the context of stand-alone projects. While much has been learned, questions arise concerning the validity of these models, because projects are not islands-they are affected by the markets in which general contractors compete for subcontractor resources. LeapconX is a marketwide simulation that can model an unlimited number of construction projects, subcontractors, and residential building projects in any given market region. It enables testing of production system innovations, revealing the impacts not only on companies implementing the innovations, but also on companies that do not. The system was validated through simulation using data for the Newark, New Jersey metropolitan area. Three production control innovations were tested at three levels of market penetration. Comparison of the results with those of single-project simulations for the same innovations confirms that market dynamics moderate outcomes. LeapconX enables both construction management researchers and practitioners to predict the likely outcomes of a wide variety of procedural and technological innovations, with little cost and no risk to actual projects.

To fill this gap, this paper aims to examine the relationships between safety leaderships of project owners, contractors and subcontractors and discover leadership dimensions which significantly impact construction safety performance. An impacting mechanism involving owner safety leadership, contractor safety leadership and subcontractor safety leadership are hypothetically proposed and empirically tested. The results show that significant relationships exist between safety leaderships of the three key stakeholders. Project safety culture acts as a significant mediator in these relationships. In addition, among all leadership dimensions of owners and contractors, safety influence and role modeling has the widest range of influence on project safety culture and other stakeholders' safety leadership. As such, it is suggested that owners and contractors should cultivate charisma and the ability of being influential about ideals in project managers and require them to behave as role models for others. The results also show that the caring dimension of leadership is more required in the frontline environment. Supervisors need more attention and support from the contractor in their well-being and organizational identification for the project. In conclusion, this paper establishes clear leadership impacting paths from owners to site supervisors of subcontractors in construction projects, which provides insights into effective ways to implement managerial measures and publicize policies and values to construction sites.

SORTING SUBCONTRACTORS' ACTIVITIES IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WITH A NOVEL ADDITIVE-VETO SORTING APPROACH	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subcontractor management; multiple criteria analysis; Additive-veto sorting approach; sorting	FRAMEWORK; TOPSIS; NEGOTIATION; CRITERIA; AHP	Selection processes in civil engineering infrastructure projects might require more time and effort than the decision-makers involved in these projects are normally prepared to devote to running them. A novel approach is proposed to sort these activities into dasses that represent their impact on the project, namely additive-veto sorting model, which should be considered before any bidding procedure. Therefore, problems regarding the client's satisfaction caused by subcontractors can be avoided, and the decision-makers involved in the selection problem can devote to each dass an effort compatible with the impact that activity might have on the project. The novelty of this method is that it was built to reflect the quasi-compensatory rationality of decision-makers in the construction industry; it provides them with insights on subcontractors' activities, and it is grounded on and inspired by a real case study. 'I he new parameters proposed within this model introduce the idea of vetoing an activity being assigned to a class when this activity is incompatible with the decision-maker's preferences. By using this novel method, the authors sncc'eded in finding results that avoided a complete compensation amongst the factors considered, taking into account ranges that would be of significant importance in the decision process.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing from supplier development theories and practices in the manufacturing sector, a mixed interpretivist and empirical methodology is adopted to examine the body of knowledge within literature for conceptual model development. A self-reporting survey questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale is used to assess 30 construction professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of 37 SC development practices classified into five categories. Descriptive statistics, weighted means, and t-tests are used for data analysis. Findings SC prequalification, commitment, incentives, evaluation and feedback practices can be effective in generating high-performing SCs. Practices that require more direct involvement and linkages between GC and SC are perceived to be less effective. Research limitations/implications Theoretical contributions include a framework to foster future research to advance knowledge and understanding to enhance the adoption of SC development practices in the construction sector. Practical implications Implementation of ranked SC development practices can equip GCs with a network of high-performing SCs for improved competitive advantage and revenues. Originality/value The proposed conceptual model expands discussions on the modification of supplier development theories and practices currently utilized in the manufacturing sector toward their application in the construction sector. This research differs from previous research, which primarily focused on the manufacturing sector.

However, the subcontractor's voice is largely absent from the social procurement debate, despite employing the majority of people in the construction industry. Addressing this gap in social procurement research, a survey of seventy Australian subcontractors was undertaken to explore perceived barriers to integrating six disadvantaged groups targeted by social procurement policies into the construction workforce (Indigenous people, people suffering disability, women, disengaged youth, migrants and refugees, ex-offenders). Results indicate that rather than reducing disadvantage for the most marginalised groups in society, satisficing behaviour in complying with emerging social procurement policies could have the opposite effect. Subcontractors see significant business risks associated with safety, productivity and costs with disengaged youth being perceived as the highest risk cohort, followed by migrants and refugees, people suffering disability, ex-offenders, women and Indigenous workers and employment priorities reflect these perceptions. Perceived barriers to employment vary significantly across these groups with smaller and younger firms perceiving the greatest barriers - particularly for women and Indigenous workers. Practically, the results highlight the potential risks which social procurement policies present to vulnerable people if they are introduced without sufficient support and regard for an industry's culture, structure and capacity to deliver. Conceptually, taking this research forward, the results highlight the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and intersectionality as theoretical frameworks to better understand how these groups experience working in the construction sector.

Previous research has acknowledged that social interactions among supervisors and workers shape safety implementation on work sites. However, a detailed examination of the nature and impact of these social interactions has been missing. An ethnographic method was deployed in which a researcher spent approximately 100 h attending four construction sites over a 6-month period. This deep embedded research method enabled the nature and impact of social interactions to be explored. Organized safety walks and informal walk-arounds were attended, during which interactions were observed and conversations were held with project participants, including foremen, professional health and safety advisors, supervisors, and workers. Field notes and comments were subjected to thematic content analysis. Different understandings of safety were apparent, with key differences emerging in relation to the role attributed to the principal contractors' site safety rules. The social ecosystem at the four sites was also embedded within broader construction industry practices, in particular competitive tendering and price-based selection. The results reveal limitations inherent in traditional technical approaches to understanding safety in the construction site environment because these approaches tend to ignore the social and power relations at play. The results reveal that safety at the principal contractor-subcontractor interface is better understood as an emergent property of a complex ecosystem of social relationships and interactions.

To overcome this challenge, the Kano model is applied to classify the selection criteria into five categories including must-be, reverse, one-dimensional, attractive, and indifferent. Data were obtained via a questionnaire based on Kano model concepts to categorize the identified selection criteria. The obtained results show that the selection criteria can be categorized into three categories; must-be, one-dimensional, and attractive. According to this categorization, the weight of criteria is extracted by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Then, a fuzzy multi-attribute decision framework is developed to select the best SC with two main components, screening by the must-be criteria category and selection based on the one-dimensional and attractive criteria categories. A case example of the framework application and the results of a questionnaire are presented and validate acceptance of the framework accuracy.

Case Study to Identify Barriers and Incentives to Implementing an Engineering Control for Concrete Grinding Dust	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health and safety; Management responsibilities; Engineering controls	LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS USE; CRYSTALLINE SILICA DUST; HEARING PROTECTION; EXPOSURE; INTERVENTION; SAFETY; HEALTH; INDUSTRY; QUARTZ	Research has indicated that respirable crystalline silica dust exposure is a serious health hazard in the construction industry. One source of this hazard is the dust generated by drilling, sawing, chipping, and grinding concrete. There are several options for controlling this hazard, one of which is the use of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) directly attached to the cutting tool. Implementing an engineering control presents a challenge on the construction work site where it is often difficult to determine who will take the initiative for introducing an innovative strategy. This study examines the implementation of an LEV system on an overhead grinder illustrating the roles that various members of the construction team played. The results of the case study found that key factors that affected implementation were: (1) a cooperative relationship between individuals employed by the general contractor and the concrete subcontractor; (2) the effect of high airborne dust levels on scheduling the work of other subcontractors; (3) the public relations effects of high dust levels in a downtown area; and (4) the concrete subcontractor perceived benefits that exceeded the short-term cost of the intervention.

The results reveal that the networks become dense over time and exhibit distinct scale-free properties. Furthermore, these macrolevel characteristics of network dynamics significantly relate to the structure-based preferential attachment effect, the ownership similarity effect, the geographic proximity effect, the negative scale similarity effect, and the ownership-based individual covariate effect, which operates at a microlevel. The findings not only provide a network view of how construction organizations select subcontractors in projects, but also contribute to broadened understanding of how project-based collaborative networks among firms in the construction industry evolve as complex adaptive systems whose macrolevel dynamics closely relate to a set of micro-organizing mechanisms.

Empirical Assessment of Internationalization Strategies for Small and Medium Construction Companies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internationalization; Small and medium construction companies; Entry mode; Evolutionary paths; Foreign experience; Cultural effects	JOINT VENTURES; ENTRY MODE; FOREIGN ENTRY; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; TRANSACTION; SURVIVAL; CULTURE; CHOICE; COST	In the wake of increased globalization, more small and medium construction companies (SMCCs) are expanding into the global market. However, the international construction industry is different from the domestic with respect to resource, regulations, culture, entry strategies, and risk levels among other factors. This paper explores various ways and modes of internationalization for SMCCs under 13 key hypotheses that are relevant to the issues of internationalization from the perspective of SMCCs. To verify these hypotheses, this study used actual data from 560 cases of SMCCs' overseas projects performed between 1990 and 2007. It was found that SMCCs' entry scheme as prime contractors was more rewarding than in the case of subcontractors. Moreover, SMCCs are likely to evolve from subcontractors engaged with home-country contractors to subcontractors engaged with foreign contractors. Also, cultural distance is positively related to performance, but the effects of cultural properties are not as strong compared to the international manufacturing industry. The results are expected to help SMCCs build internationalization strategies by determining promising entry modes, proposing possible evolutionary paths to enter overseas projects, and assessing cultural effects in reference to SMCCs' successful performance.

This research regards trust as a two-dimensional construct, distinguishing the control and coordination functions of contractual governance, and explores their effects on negotiation behavioral strategy; this research also examines the moderating effects of bilateral lock-in. The empirical results from a survey of 272 Chinese general contractors and subcontractors reveal that there is a positive relationship between trust, including both goodwill trust and competence trust, and interest-based negotiation behavioral strategy. However, increasing contractual control will increase the adoption of a rights-based negotiation behavioral strategy, while contractual coordination governance will reinforce the adoption of an interest-based behavioral strategy. Both Chinese general contractors and subcontractors tend to rely more on trust under higher degrees of bilateral lock-in. The research findings offer an advanced and nuanced understanding of how trust and contract affect negotiation behavioral strategy in construction subcontracting. The authors also discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings and future research for governance mechanisms in construction.

Total quality management (TQM) has been recognized as a successful management philosophy in the manufacturing and service industries. TQM can likewise be embraced in the construction industry to help raise quality and productivity. Two case studies of construction companies showed how TQM can be successfully implemented in the construction industry. The benefits experienced include reduction in quality costs, better employee job satisfaction because they do not need to attend to defects and client complaints, recognition by clients, work carried out correctly right from the start, subcontractors with proper quality management systems, and closer relationships with subcontractors and suppliers. TQM performance measures were also reflected through top management commitment, customer involvement and satisfaction, employee involvement and empowerment, customer- supplier relationships, and process improvement and management. Finally, a framework for implementing TQM in construction is recommended.

However, their deployment in the field of construction is less well understood. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to investigate whether 'best practices' such as these, could be applied in sectors of the construction industry to provide sustainable competitive advantage. To facilitate the investigation an action research based methodology was employed in which the researchers took an active role in the change process. This method was chosen because of its practical orientation, its predisposition to longitudinal case based applications and its suitability to 'proof of concept' initiatives. This research was carried out over a three year period and focused on the implementation of these practices with a view to improving the performance of a subcontractor in the construction industry. The outcomes of the research indicate that, despite the high levels of uncertainty and product variety that characterise the industry the principles of close coupling value chain functions can be applied to subcontractor operations that are primarily manufacturing orientated and that improvements in production and assembly productivity are possible with the result that total costs can be reduced and delivery performance improved.

J	Huang, XY; Hinze, J				Huang, XY; Hinze, J			Owner's role in construction safety	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTABILITY; COSTS	Despite dramatic improvements in recent decades, the construction industry continues to be one of the industries with the poorest safety records. Recent improvements are due, in part, to the concerted efforts of owners, contractors, subcontractors, and designers. While past safety studies have investigated the roles of contractors, subcontractors, and designers, the owner's impact on construction safety has not been previously investigated. This paper will present the results of a study on the owner's role in construction safety. Data were obtained by conducting interviews on large construction projects. The relationship between project safety performance and the owner's influence was examined, with particular focus on project characteristics, the selection of safe contractors, contractual safety requirements, and the owner's participation in safety management during project execution. By identifying practices of owners that are associated with good project safety performances, guidance is provided on how owners directly impact safety performance.

In Spain, despite the Ley de Ordenacion de la Edificacion (Building Regulation Act), which establishes a general framework to promote overall building quality, construction defects in residential buildings remain a pervasive problem. An analysis of 3647 construction defects is presented which identified the location within the building, subcontractors and building element in 68 residential building developments undertaken by two large Spanish contractors. The research reveals that the most common defects that arise during construction are related to the stability of the structure and inappropriate installation of roofs and facades. These technical faults are caused by poor workmanship rather than by the quality of the materials or products used. By comparing these results with a previous study on defects after handover, it can be concluded that while the nature of defects during construction is basically technical, at handover it is aesthetic or technical.

Despite its importance, little research has been conducted to investigate the challenges that contractors and subcontractors face in measuring productivity accurately at the trade level. As a result, this study aims to identify critical challenges in the measurement of trade-level productivity and to explore plausible solutions for these challenges in order to improve productivity assessment in the industry. On the basis of an extensive literature review and a survey and interviews with industry experts, a total of 17 critical challenges and 24 plausible solutions were identified and analyzed statistically. The findings from this study will help to shed light on the difficulties that contractors and subcontractors encounter during trade-level productivity measurement, and will identify solutions that can be used effectively to deal with these challenges.

Traditional procedures of subcontracting procurement tend to limit the opportunities for price negotiation and cooperative relationships between contractors and neglect potential issues such as engineering interface, construction risk, and waste. Based on case studies of construction projects, we propose a "lean" subcontracting procurement process (LSPP) drawing from lean construction theory. The process consists of a novel Seven-Arrangement operation plan and four types of standard operating flows. Not only does the proposed LSPP help subcontractors eliminate various types of waste in construction projects, it also establishes a common information platform and cooperative environment that help participating contractors understand the work emphasis of each operation and the whole operation in sequence. As a result, the relationships between participating contractors become cooperative, potential risks in construction projects can be discovered early, and profits are shared between contractors. Thus, this process allows contractors to obtain long-term benefits.	[Yin, Samuel Yen-Liang; Tserng, H.

Therefore, accuracy of construction project cost estimates is pivotal in project success. Several studies have determined factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates. Comparatively less information is available for construction industries in developing countries. This study identified factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates for construction projects in Pakistan. Cost data was collected for 46 completed construction projects. Four dimensions 60 factors were considered. Dimensions included: project characteristics, project team, estimating procedures, and (costing related) information items. A rigorous analysis framework based on principal component analysis and regression analysis was used. Involvement of the contractor in the estimation procedure and labour rates were found to be the most significant factors. Early involvement of the contractor can result in realistic estimates through timely input from subcontractors, materials suppliers and manufacturers among others. This also helps in controlling labour costs as most of the construction projects in Pakistan employ labour through subcontractors.

By means of these parameters, experts in construction enterprises apply a five-point scale in order to evaluate enterprise relations with four transactors within its microenvironment. The parameters describing relationships are adopted as assessment criteria. The question of selecting the best construction enterprise for cooperation is a multi-criteria issue. The author's solution is based on the ELECTRE III method and elaborates two alternative methods of selecting the best construction enterprise on the basis of the analysis of partnering relations between construction enterprises being studied and their transactors within the microenvironment and indicates one of the above introduced methods as preference.

J	Park, SH				Park, Sung Ho			Whole Life Performance Assessment: Critical Success Factors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Whole life costing (WLC) has become the best practice in construction procurement and it is likely to be a major issue in predicting whole life costs of a construction project accurately. However, different expectations from different organizations throughout a project's life and the lack of data, monitoring targets, and long-term interest for many key players are obstacles to be overcome if WLC is to be implemented. A questionnaire survey was undertaken to investigate a set of ten common factors and 188 individual factors. These were grouped into eight critical categories (project scope, time, cost, quality, contract/administration, human resource, risk, and health and safety) by project phase, as perceived by the clients, contractors and subcontractors in order to identify critical success factors for whole life performance assessment (WLPA). Using a relative importance index, the top ten critical factors for each category, from the perspective of project participants, were analyzed and ranked. Their agreement on those categories and factors were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. All participants identify "Type of Project" as the most common critical factor in the eight categories for WLPA. Using the relative index ranking technique and weighted average methods, it was found that the most critical individual factors in each category were: "clarity of contract" (scope); "fixed construction period" (time); " precise project budget estimate" (cost); " material quality" (quality); "mutual/trusting relationships" (contract/administration); "leadership/team management" (human resource); and " management of work safety on site" (health and safety). There was relatively a high agreement on these categories among all participants. Obviously, with 80 critical factors of WLPA, there is a stronger positive relationship between client and contactor rather than contractor and subcontractor, client and subcontractor. Putting these critical factors into a criteria matrix can facilitate an initial framework of WLPA in order to aid decision making in the public sector in South Korea for evaluation/selection process of a construction project at the bid stage.

Various solutions and policies have been proposed and analysed in-depth in previous studies. However, limited studies have focused on the integration of advanced technologies to address SOP issues. The aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates practical advanced technologies to address SOP issues in the construction industry. A concurrent mixed-method design was adopted to (a) identify the industry's perspective on what advanced technologies can be accepted to address SOP issues through a questionnaire survey, and (b) identify the use of advanced technologies through a live construction project as a case study. Subsequently, a data flow diagram framework was developed to articulate the whole process flow of how the system delivers automatic payments to subcontractors upon the completion of their contractual obligations and work done. This research contributes new and practical insights into the application and integration of smart sensors, oracles, BIM, blockchain technology and smart contracts in addressing SOP issues in the construction industry.

However, research has primarily focused on new build and has neglected refurbishment projects which become relevant due to an aging building stock in Sweden and Europe. Various actors are involved in refurbishment projects which makes it important to study each actor as well as tensions between them. By using a service ecosystem perspective and relying on 38 interviews, this paper aims to investigate tensions and barriers between actors within the service ecosystem of CDW for refurbishment projects in Sweden. Based on the results, spatial barriers are the most mentioned barrier which also create the highest number of tensions between project and contractor mother firm, subcontractors, waste recycling firms and society/citizens. The majority of the tensions are found between projects and the contractor mother firms, followed by tensions between projects and clients and projects and subcontractors. Unlike previous studies investigating only one of the actor's waste management practices, this paper contributes by investigating the interactions between seven different actors which is important for improving waste management practices in refurbishment projects.

J	Tomczak, M; Jaskowski, P				Tomczak, Michal; Jaskowski, Piotr			New Approach to Improve General Contractor Crew's Work Continuity in Repetitive Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LINE-OF-BALANCE; SCHEDULING METHOD; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; CHALLENGES	A significant number of construction projects involve repetitive processes. Planning them occurs to be a complex task. Network methods traditionally applied to construction scheduling prove inefficient in the case of repetitive construction projects (RCPs) due to the increased number of relationships among processes, locations (units), and resources. Frequently, the aim of scheduling RCPs is making the full use of the resources' capacity, thereby ensuring continuity of the crews' work. To achieve this, the planner typically allows discontinuity of some secondary processes to shift resources to the key processes, allowing optional modes of process delivery and introducing soft precedence relations between processes. This paper presents a new way of increasing the continuity of work of a general contractor's crews in RCPs by employing subcontractors' crews. A deterministic mathematical model of the mixed-integer linear problem of a repetitive (nonlinear) project was formulated to find a schedule that minimizes the downtime of the general contractor's crews under constraints of a maximum acceptable total project duration and a maximum acceptable cost of the works commissioned to subcontractors; the model accounts for the limited availability of crews. Application of the model is illustrated by an example. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Loss or lack of collaboration between project partners is seen as the most significant professional and project execution in the construction industry. This study aims to identify the enablers, i.e. governing factors of collaboration. This study applies a systematic review methodology to explore the literature and achieve the objectives. In the process of this systematic literature review, a total of 800 articles were identified in the construction domain, out of which 110 articles were found to be relevant for this study. The 'citation analysis' was performed on the articles identified by 'content analysis' as relevant to this study, which focused on the issue of the construction industry and issues of subcontractors. The findings identified that trust, commitment and reliability are the enablers of collaboration in construction projects. Providing due attention to the enablers of collaboration, i.e. 'trust, commitment and reliability' in the context of the project execution decisions, can facilitate collaboration and thus enhancing project productivity.

However, most construction project management programs are ineffective for project prompt responses, especially with respect to change management. This work presents a novel construction project management system called the web project-based change management (WPCM) system. The WPCM system responds to changes in information efficiently in order to facilitate change management among project participants (e.g. general contractor, suppliers, and subcontractors) in a construction project environment. Capable of increasing information sharing in construction change management, web-based technology can also provide cost savings via the Internet. A case study involving a commercial building project in Taiwan demonstrates the effectiveness of both the proposed WPCM system and information sharing in change control during the construction phase. In addition to increasing the efficiency of change control and management for a general contractor, as well as dynamic project tracking and management, the proposed system enables subcontractors and suppliers to access and manage the change information timely. Future work should implement the system functions comprehensively and apply the system to additional projects more strictly for further verification of its reliability.

Inter-organizational unfairness in the construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Business relations; fairness; injustice; risk; supply chain	ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; CORRUPTION; PERCEPTIONS	There are numerous examples of unfair inter-organizational business practices in the construction industry. Conflict and confrontation, corruption, bid-shopping, insecurity of payment and supply chain exploitation are just some examples which have been documented over several decades in many countries. There have been numerous initiatives to make the construction industry a fairer business environment, but these have been largely developed in a conceptual vacuum. Consequently, few advances have been made in making the industry a fairer place to do business. To address the lack of theory in this area and provide a conceptual foundation for future improvement, theories of organizational justice were used as the basis for a survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. The findings reveal that mainstream theories of justice may need refinement and reorganization to be applied to a construction industry context. Furthermore, in contrast to much previous research, the results indicate that levels of interpersonal, social and informational justice are high within the Australian construction industry. However, they also show that more can be done to improve levels of procedural and distributive justice, particularly in relation to subcontractors and suppliers in the construction supply chain. Many of these findings are transferable to other countries which are culturally, contractually and organizationally similar to the Australian construction industry.

J	ul Hassan, F; Le, T				ul Hassan, Fahad; Le, Tuyen			Computer-assisted separation of design-build contract requirements to support subcontract drafting	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Contractual requirements; Design-build contracts; Subcontracts; Subcontractors; Natural language processing; Machine learning; Text classification; Text mining	DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION	Construction projects delivered using the Design-Build (DB) method include a single contract which defines requirements associated with various disciplines involved in the project. Consequently, DB contractors often need to develop several subcontracts including only a subset of requirements from the main contract. The current manual practices for subcontract drafting are error-prone and time-consuming. The study developed a novel classification model using machine learning for classifying DB requirements into three predefined categories including design, construction, and operation and maintenance. The paper compared various training approaches to perform DB requirement classification including traditional algorithms (i.e., Naive Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor), and two state-of-the-art deep neural networks architectures (i.e., convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network). In addition, it examined the effect of different feature types, feature selection, feature weighting, and ensemble methods on the model training performance. The classification models were trained on a large dataset of over 3000 contractual clauses, and the best model achieved an impressive precision of 93.20%, a recall of 93.08%, and an F-score of 92.98%. The study is expected to assist contract administrators in extracting the precise scope of subcontractors in less time and effort.

J	Yao, HJ; Chen, YQ; Zhang, YB; Du, B				Yao, Hongjiang; Chen, Yongqiang; Zhang, Yangbing; Du, Bo			Contractual and relational enforcement in the aftermath of contract violations: the role of contracts and trust	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Contractual enforcement; Relational enforcement; Contracts; Trust; Contract violations	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INTERORGANIZATIONAL TRUST; COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR; GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; COLLABORATION; COMPLEXITY; ALLIANCES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish an integrated framework of the antecedents of enforcement after contract violations in construction projects and to examine whether contract provisions (control and coordination provisions) and trust (goodwill and competence trust) affect enforcement mechanisms (contractual enforcement and relational enforcement). Design/methodology/approach A survey method was employed to test the hypotheses. The authors collected data from the Chinese construction industry, and general contractor respondents were asked to answer a questionnaire about a contract violation by one of their subcontractors. Findings Control provisions and competence trust are positively related to contractual enforcement, but goodwill trust is negatively related to contractual enforcement. Relational enforcement is influenced by goodwill trust and competence trust. Research limitations/implications This study treats contract violations as a given variable, and it focuses on contract violations by subcontractors. The cross-sectional design makes it difficult to confirm the causality of the relationships. Practical implications Overly strict contractual enforcement can generate disputes and a vicious cycle of retaliation, and overly severe relational enforcement can damage a potentially profitable long-term relationship. In construction projects, the violating party will benefit from this study to avoid excessively contractual enforcement and relational enforcement, thus developing a more collaborative atmosphere on the current project and even establishing a solid long-term relationship. Originality/value This study extends the project management literature by investigating the antecedents of enforcement after contract violations, an area not yet fully researched.

J	Chester, M; Hendrickson, C				Chester, M; Hendrickson, C			Cost impacts, scheduling impacts, and the claims process during construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							METHODOLOGY	Construction mismanagement results in multiple problems that can cascade throughout the work force chain, affecting the schedule and leading to damages to multiple parties. Although the problem may start with a single subcontractor, it can result in all contractors feeling some impact to their work. In this paper, a case study is presented of a project with seven different mismanagement scenarios. A description of each scenario is provided as well as a quantification of the damages that result from the problem. A construction claims section is also included that addresses many of the issues that could result from a claim for each of the seven scenarios. A discussion is presented outlining possible preventative steps to minimize the damages from the problems presented.

Impacts of multi-layer chain subcontracting on project management performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multi-layer chain subcontracting; Project management; Project performance; Construction; Hong Kong	SYSTEM	This paper investigates the impacts of applying the multi-layer chain subcontracting system on project management performance with reference to Hong Kong construction industry. Multi-layer chain subcontracting system is widely used within construction industry as it is considered advantageous in many aspects such as better efficiency of subcontractors' operation due to their unique skills. However, the fact of poor quality products in construction practice raises the doubt about the effectiveness of the chain system. Accordingly, the reasons why the applications of the system contribute to poor project performance are examined. A survey conducted in the Hong Kong construction industry demonstrates that the multi-layer chain subcontracting system, while widely adopted, is largely flawed. Based on the survey results, application of multi-layer chain subcontracting system contributes largely to the poor performance across the all major aspects including quality and time management. cost control, and communication and coordination performance. The association exists between poor project management performance and the increase of the number of layers in the chain of the subcontracting arrangement. The long communication chain because of the increasing layers of subcontractors results in various problems such as communication errors, poor supervision on the bottom-layer contractors. Consequently overruns in cost and time, and abortive and remedial works are common. Recommendations for improving the practice are suggested and explored, including change the practice of the "lowest bid" to an approach which incorporate both price and technical performance, limit the number of subcontracting layers, restrain the use of "supply-and-fix" subcontracting arrangement, and enforce the implementation of government regulations. The findings of this study provide useful references in examining the practice of subcontracting system in other construction industries and identifying the areas where the improvements can be made for gaining the benefits of using the system.

The objective of this study is to improve the current practices for evaluating sub-contractors performance. Drawbacks of current evaluation process are discussed firstly. The appropriateness for adopting the Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM) for improving the drawbacks is studied. A Sub-contractor Performance Evaluation Model (SPEM) is then developed by employing the EFNIM. The effectiveness of the proposed SPEM is validated by performing case study of a real general contractor. Validation results show that the proposed method accurately measures sub-contractor's performance enhancing the current practice of evaluation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Potential for implementing relational contracting and joint risk management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper focuses on the outcomes of the second survey in a broad Hong Kong-based study on joint risk management (JRM) through relational contracting (RC). The questionnaire survey itself focused on issues relating to the formation of a coalesced team for JRM at the postcontract stage, comprising owners, consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Results indicate the greater importance of more relational, trust, and joint responsibility-related factors in general, both for selecting different parties and for building a successful relational contract. While some differences in group perceptions emerge, respondents recommend mobilizing project participants at earlier stages of projects, that is, mostly before the contract award, and they strongly support the JRM option for managing various unforeseen risks. Respondents also suggest adjustment/extension of contract provisions for managing unforeseen events, indicating emerging preferences for flexibility in contracts. All these are indicative of a perceived trend toward more RC, teamworking, and collaborative working environments.

One of the innovative solutions to avoid, eliminate or at least reduce plan variation is the adoption of last planner system (LPS). This research highlights the importance of eliminating plan variation in the production planning and control process in Gaza Strip as a key improvement in the delivery process of construction projects through the use of LPS. This research applies a survey strategy that uses two data collection methods, including questionnaire and interview. The results show that several elements of LPS already exist in Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, these elements do not follow the same approach of LPS. The main challenge is the involvement of many subcontractors. The primary variation cause is the unavailability of materials. The critical success factor is the top management support.

J	Elghamrawy, T; Shibayama, T				Elghamrawy, Tarek; Shibayama, Tomoya			Total quality management implementation in the Egyptian construction industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Total quality management (TQM) has been recognized as a successful management philosophy that can be successfully implemented in the construction industry. By examining the Japanese contractors working in Egypt and comparing their managing systems to the local ones, a comparative analysis of the two contractors working in the Egyptian field is presented in this paper to illustrate how TQM can be implemented effectively in the Egyptian construction industry. Bearing in mind the location bound nature of the production process, the competitive bidding, which emphasizes cost and the absence of the quality culture of the clients, subcontractors and site operatives are some of the constraining factors for implementing the quality policy. Based on the research findings, the paper presents some features of the Japanese construction industry that could be implemented in the Egyptian field in addition to a new model for TQM implementation that appropriates the Egyptian construction industry.

This framework is intended to be integrated in e-marketplaces to comply with the major technological advances in the construction industry. A novel feature of the system is that it allows bilateral evaluations between companies to better understand general contractor-subcontractor relationships and to improve the level of transparency within the construction sector. The performance assessment system incorporates other innovative features, such as the ability to specify a set of performance indicators suitable for inclusion in e-marketplaces covering three different perspectives: company reliability, operation performance, and bid attributes.

This study reviews the case of Hong Kong, in particular the consequence of high & growing rate of subcontracting and what project managers can do. Based on statistics and elemental cost analyses, we find that as much as 80% of the value of building works is undertaken by small subcontractors. Whilst subcontracting provides the industry with specialized services as well as organizational and managerial flexibility, it has also been attributed to the labour intensity and the lacklustre performance of the industry. It relies on project manages to make the best use of what subcontracting has to offer, whilst avoiding its pitfalls. An assessment of the extent and issues of subcontracting helps us understand how project management could enhance the performance of the projects and then the industry.

J	Kubal, MT				Kubal, MT			The future of engineered quality	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Total quality management (TQM) has not yet been successfully applied or recognized for any industry-wide improvements within the engineering and construction professions. In today's litigious climate, legal dependencies by entities involved in the development, design, and construction of a project have prolonged and even prevented the making of trust relationships among project participants. Without the open communications and mutual support that derive from trust-based relationships, it will be an uphill battle to effect substantive quality improvement industry-wide. The answer lies in the establishment of long-term project team relationships. Rather than work together on a:single project, with only a compressed time in which to develop a mutually productive professional relationship, participants in a long-term partnering relationship work together project after project, enabling them to achieve quality improvements through repeated interaction. In addition, subcontractors and suppliers must be brought into the team relationship from the earliest project concept stages-a bottom-up approach to total quality management (TQM) implementation.

However, the definition of optimal work packages is currently challenging and time consuming. A method was developed to allow the work packaging process to be carried out in a more accurate and efficient way, using data from Building Information Models (BIM). This method is based on a bottom-up approach that can take into account relations between specific components, and the consequent interruptions that will occur in the construction processes. The method incorporates BIM data in Design Structure Matrices and Domain Mapping Matrices to automatically generate a list of proposed work packages with minimal interfaces. An application of the method in a case study demonstrated that it can accelerate the work packaging process, and allow alternative solutions to be explored at an early stage in the project.

It is during this period that the project team is formed; subcontractors are finalized; the orders of material and equipment are placed; and project plans are made. Despite its importance, few studies have been conducted in this field, especially for international contractors who face many complex situations in project buyout. This paper presents the study conducted for the project buyout management for the Chinese International Contractors (CICs) in developing countries, with focus on the project buyout management under different overseas management structures, and the key influencing factors. It discusses the characteristics of CICs in developing countries; investigates the project buyout management under different overseas management structures; analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each overseas management structure to project buyout, and identifies the major project buyout influencing factors. The results of this research will benefit both the industry practitioners and the academic researchers in this area.

The outlined system seeks to support a benchmarking system that has been recently established in the Chilean construction industry by incorporating qualitative management aspects in addition to performance indicators. Different analyses were made to determine trends in the sector and to establish correlations between qualitative aspects coming from surveys and quantitative aspects coming from performance indicators. Thirteen construction companies participated in the initial application of the benchmarking system. A correlation analysis found that safety performance was strongly related to companies having superior planning and control, quality management, cost control, and subcontractor management policies. A factor analysis found that central office priorities focus on strategic management policies having longer-term competitive impact, while site management emphasizes tactical management dimensions having short-term impact. There is scope to elevate the profile of continuous improvement initiatives to strategic significance at the central office level.

TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) is a practical and useful technique in dealing with multi-attribute decision making problems, and has been widely employed in the construction management and other fields. The modification and extension of TOPSIS to a group decision environment is investigated in this study. In the proposed group decision making model, we both adopt the Minkowski distance function to solve the over-weighted problem in the original TOPSIS technique, the grey number operations to deal with the problem of uncertain information, and the aggregation approach to integrate experts' evaluations. Finally, an illustrative example of subcontractor selection is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We additionally propose that these relationships are moderated or mediated by the collaborative climate (i.e. the trust and commitment among partners) in the project and moderated by the overall project characteristics (i.e. how challenging the project is in terms of complexity, customization, uncertainty, value/size, and time pressure). Based on our contribution, future research can test the framework empirically to further increase the knowledge about how procurement factors may influence project performance.

This study aims to redesign a virtual organisational structure for such projects. Two-pronged action research was adopted. The survey was to redesign the virtual organisational structure. The case study was to validate the virtual structure redesigned and conduct an in-depth description of the application of the virtual organisational structure on real prefabricated projects. The result shows that the virtual organization's core actors are client, general contractor, designer, and PC manufactory. The chain of command starts with the client, and ends with peripheral actors such as subcontractor elements. Meanwhile, prefabricated buildings that adopted the virtual organisational structure proposed are better managed and have better project performance than those that did not. This study contributes to the knowledge of the management for prefabricated buildings by showing that a virtual organisational structure needs to incorporate stakeholder salience attributes and stakeholder relationships.

It examined 9,028 change orders for 237 apartment housing projects in South Korea. Prior to the analysis, the change-order factors were classified into five categories and the work types into eight categories in order to form a risk matrix. The severity and frequency distributions of each cell were calculated based on the risk matrix. Because the amount of loss can vary depending on the construction cost, severity was defined as the amount of loss relative to the construction cost. Using this, the authors calculated the loss distribution of each cell and combined them to derive the total loss distribution. The analysis results confirmed that field conditions had the largest overall impact on change orders. This was ascribed to the limitations of estimating and reflecting various situations that can occur at construction sites during the initial design stage. A high loss of change orders was also confirmed to occur in the finishing work and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) work. Because the finishing work consists of various work types, multiple subcontractors proceed with their tasks simultaneously, which makes coherent coordination relatively difficult and increases the frequency of changes to the design. For MEP work, the frequency of design changes is high because various interference phenomena may occur depending on the complex pipelines and wiring diagrams. This paper proposes an LDA comprising a prerisk assessment and postevaluation and feedback method. The preresponse is measured as a cost contingency calculation tool. In other words, response strategies are proposed against expected and unexpected losses at three levels after the total loss distribution has been derived by aggregating various risks: namely, cost contingencies at the project level, equity capital at the company level, and insurance at the catastrophic level. The proposed postevaluation and feedback method evaluates the target project after its completion by identifying points of cost overrun in the cumulative distribution constructed in advance with the LDA and by analyzing detailed items for each risk factor in the same manner. Thus, this method can be used to verify the ability of a subcontractor. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The construction progress is captured, analyzed, and documented respectively using sensing, machine intelligence, and as-built building information models (BIM). The progress data is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is then broadcasted to a smart contract which administers payments and transfers lien rights respectively using crypto currencies/tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The method was successfully implemented for payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment administration. Future work should further explore the connections between off- and on-chain realities.

The greatest contribution of this paper is a novel model for e-negotiation using an adaptation of the FITradeoff method for group decision and negotiation with an unbiased mediator agent so as to reduce the number of interactions needed to reach an agreement. The elicitation process included within the negotiation model sees to it that the cognitive effort that the negotiators need to make is reduced because partial information and strict preference statements can be used. The mediator agent facilitates the negotiation phase, thereby allowing a general contractor to compare subcontractors and to decide if there should be a 1-1 or 1-N negotiation process. Moreover, this agent conducts the negotiation process and presents the best and suboptimal agreements to the negotiators. A prototype was built to test the model using data from a real construction project.

J	Vaux, JS; Kirk, WM				Vaux, James S.; Kirk, W. Max			Relationship Conflict in Construction Management: Performance and Productivity Problem	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TASK CONFLICT; INTRAGROUP CONFLICT; DECISION-MAKING; RESOLUTION; LEADERSHIP; BEHAVIOR; TRUST	Performance and productivity in construction management are essential for schedule and profit considerations, but are often diminished by conflict. Task conflict provides incentive for decisions and innovative solutions, whereas interpersonal conflict, also referred to as relationship conflict, is detrimental to performance and productivity because it affects schedules, cognition and collaboration efforts, and the morale of the team. This qualitative study investigates how relationship conflict affects performance and productivity among construction management professionals. Interviews were conducted in 18 construction firms with 25 construction management professionals, including project executives, senior project managers, project managers, and superintendents. The goal is to understand the antecedents and consequences of relationship conflict within construction management, and discover methods used to mitigate these effects. Key antecedents producing relationship conflict are lack of communication, old-school attitude, and lump-sum contracts. The key individuals generating relationship conflict are the owner or owner's representative, subcontractors, and superintendents. Consequences of relationship conflict include schedule delays, lowered morale and motivation, and reduced profit, whereas mitigating factors are good communication and trust building.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the applicability of kitting by focusing on its impact on work performance and requirements for management. The authors conducted a case study to analyze a kitting intervention in a general contractor and logistics company, comparing four renovation projects in the indoor construction phase with and without kitting. Findings indicate that kitting can stabilize assembly work and increase workplace utilization and on-site labor productivity. However, it requires centralized material logistics, smooth information flow between operations, and subcontractors' commitment to the production model. This research contributes to the connection between material logistics and work performance, suggesting that kitting should be linked to a redesign of the general production model toward a synchronized takt-based production system. The research is limited to four projects.

Collection and distribution of accurate, reliable and timeous information describing the states of the processes and products are essential. This study examined the effect of an information system based on building information modeling (BIM) on the decisions made by construction trade crews when determining their sequence of work. A prototype system, called "KanBIM", was used by subjects working in a virtual construction site experimental setup using a virtual reality CAVE linked to a discrete event simulation engine, to guide their performance of "virtual" work in a building with sixteen apartments. The use of the system improved the process flow and eliminated waste. It gave the subjects situational awareness, leading them to perform the right work, reducing rework and time wasted.

There were 258 sets of questionnaires assessing the level of importance given to 106 substantial resources underlying six organizational capabilities of Thai construction firms that were analyzed. Using factor analysis, these 106 items were reduced to 14, which were termed strategic assets. These 14 strategic assets were then classified based on their influence on the six organizational capabilities. The results indicate that Thai construction firms concentrate mostly on developing excellent reputation, creating strong bargaining power with suppliers and subcontractors, and strengthening the firm's financial stability. However, they do not give much importance to effective risk and investment management, continuous development and innovation, and explicit strategic management. These findings provide in-depth insight to comprehensively understanding a Thai construction firm's capabilities. These 14 strategic assets should thereafter be used to develop a practical tool for managers of construction firms to evaluate their firm's strengths and weaknesses as well as to identify strategic assets required to enhance competitiveness in the market.

Delivery and performance of a low-energy ventilation and cooling strategy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; commissioning; feedback; monitoring; natural ventilation; passive downdraught cooling; procurement; project delivery; sustainable construction	ASSESSING BUILDING PERFORMANCE; FEEDBACK; DESIGN	There is an appreciable literature exploring environmental design strategies for low-energy, naturally ventilated and cooled buildings, but less is recorded about their implementation in practice. The commissioning and monitoring of the passive downdraught-cooled UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), London, is reported. The building contractor, his suppliers and subcontractors experienced considerable difficulty in achieving defect-free environmental systems, adversely affecting the practical delivery of the strategy for an extended period. The design team was closely involved throughout this period to assist in establishing a stable controls regime reflecting the design intent. However, this intent was itself modified by feedback provided by monitoring. The widely used professional appointment and construction contracts employed for this project do not envisage the need for such extensive commissioning. However, it is argued here that the new generation of advanced naturally ventilated buildings, much encouraged by policy-makers worldwide, will require just such a comprehensive commissioning exercise to deliver anything like their full designed performance.

Recent research efforts have focused on the quantitative evaluation of delay impacts. The literature suggests that the construction industry is in need of additional research to systematically relate the causes of delays to their impacts. To overcome this limitation, this paper analyzes delay causes in activities that were not completed as scheduled. The paper contributes to a methodology to examine the qualitative (delay causes) and quantitative (time performance) dimensions of the delay issue. The paper proposes two indicators, as follows: (1)reason for noncompliance (RNC) as an indicator that characterizes scheduling failures, and (2)delay index (DI) as a time-performance indicator that describes the impacts of delay on critical and noncritical activities. The paper presents two building projects as case studies, with planning and subcontractors as the primary RNCs that have the greatest impact on time performance. Planning was the most harmful delay cause on time performance.

J	Siew, RYJ				Siew, Renard Y. J.			Health and safety communication strategy in a Malaysian construction company: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						health and safety (H&S); communication; strategy; construction; company	ACCIDENTS; INDUSTRY	The accident statistics for the construction industry remain high when compared to other industries. This is not surprising given the fragmented nature of this industry and the involvement of multiple stakeholders in a project. Poor communication on health and safety (H&S) related issues has been identified as a major cause of incidents/accidents and is recognized as a key challenge to construction practitioners. Such communication typically gets diluted as it goes down the chain of command from top management to the project team. The aim of this paper is to report on the actual implementation and administration of H&S communication of a Malaysian construction company targeted at both internal and external stakeholders. The intrinsic case study approach is adopted to provide an in-depth analysis of the H&S communication model.

After collecting data from 135 BIM experts from various capital projects in the mainland of China, 95 value flows among 7 BIM-related stakeholders were quantified, including 69% intangible value and 31% tangible value flows. Owners were then selected as focal organizations to analyze 49,775 value cycles starting from and ending with owners. 9 top-ranked value cycles, 3 most important stakeholders (BIM consultants, general contractors, and subcontractors), and 20 top value flows were identified and discussed to enable owners to formulate effective strategies to drive BIM value realization. These results can provide a visualized tool to quantify the perceived value of BIM stakeholders and to formulate value-based strategies to encourage the "buy-in" decisions by stakeholders.

J	Eriksson, E; Nilsson, T				Eriksson, Erik; Nilsson, TorBjorn			Partnering the construction of a Swedish pharmaceutical plant: Case study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROCUREMENT; TRUST; MODEL	In recent years increased interest in cooperative arrangements, such as partnering, has been noticeable in the construction industry in many countries. To facilitate cooperative relationships many aspects of the traditional procurement procedures need to be changed. The research presented in this paper offers an analysis that compares empirically observed partnering procurement procedures with conceptual prescriptions provided by a transaction cost economics framework. The empirical illustration shows that the case client has reduced the focus on price and authority and instead facilitated a relationship based on trust and cooperation, through procurement procedures involving joint specification, limited bid invitation, bid evaluation based on soft parameters, joint selection of subcontractors, standard contracts coupled with relational norms, usage of collaborative tools, and contractor self-control. The procurement procedures chosen result in a governance form rather similar to the one prescribed by the conceptual model. Furthermore, the project participants are satisfied with the project result and also consider the procurement procedures performed suitable. Hence, the results provide both theoretical and empirical support to the implementation of partnering procurement procedures in construction projects characterized by high complexity and uncertainty.

This study examines the current usage of SM within the construction industry. It also analyzes the potential risks and rewards and the collaborative and innovative aspects of these online applications. To understand this, an SM log was developed to track activity on popular SM platforms for 10 construction organizations. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from construction organizations that were familiar with SM as a company resource. The main finding was that traditional SM platforms are being used within the daily operations of construction companies. Popular sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are being used to share industry events with the communities of followers. LinkedIn, on the other hand, is being used to develop professional networks and assist in recruitment. However, conventional forms of communication, e.g., emails and telephone calls, continue to be the preferred methods of connection with vendors and subcontractors. Uses of SM for collaborative and innovative initiatives outside the organizations' boundaries are minimal. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Risk allocation in public construction projects: the case of Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk factors; risk allocation; construction project; public projects; Jordan	MANAGEMENT	Proper risk identification, assessment, and allocation can reduce cost and time delay. This study identifies, assesses and allocates risks in public construction projects in Jordan with the goal of reducing the overall costly claims and disputes. Based on extensive literature review, the study identifies 62 risk factors that are grouped under 14 categories. The respondents were asked to estimate the probability, impact and proper allocation of these risk factors. Based on 208 valid responses, the results indicate that the top ranked risk factors are delays in client's payments, poorly tailored contract forms, competition, delay in approval of permits, default by subcontractors, unclear specifications, material prices fluctuations, different construction standards, change in design, and poor design. The respondents of the study recommend 4 risk factors to be shouldered by owners, five risk factors to be shouldered by contractors, and 42 risk factors to be shared by the contracting parties. The results of the study also help practitioners to allocate risks to the stakeholder who is more capable to assesses, controls and manages these risks. The generated risk priority can be used to prioritize the risks for response planning.

Decisions must constantly be made concerning effective utilization of available resources. Reentrant workflow patterns, where a trade crew returns multiple times to the same space, make production control particularly difficult. We present a method for pull flow control at the operational level through real-time prioritization of pending work packages and daily regulation of crew assignments and trades' production capacities. Application of various heuristics was evaluated using discrete-event simulation of a representative construction project. The experimental results emphasize the importance of dynamic control of allocation of production resources to those mature activities that ensure subsequent (downstream) flow. The most successful policy was to use the second reentrant activity as a bottleneck and to regulate the capacity of the trade with reentrant flows to ensure sufficient feeding of new work to successive crews.

How to successfully implement an ERP system in an organization is always a hot research topic for researchers as well as a pending problem for an organization that wants to implement it. This research is a case study on the selection of system suppliers and contract negotiation during the ERP implementation of a local construction company in Taiwan. After reviewing the common key success factors discussed in the literature, this study discussed seven issues: coding system, working process reengineering, priority of ERP functionality implementation, customization, participant roles, consultant role and performance level of subcontractor, which also affected the implementation. Lessons learned from the case study in discussed seven issues are valuable for a construction company in deciding to implement an ERP system. This research suggests that additional case studies are necessary for the successful application of ERP systems in the construction industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The assumption that an industry familiar adjudicator will provide a reliable and consistent decision in comparison with the expectation of the industry as a whole has not been tested. This paper presents the results of a study on the reliability and consistency of construction arbitration through the examination of a variety of arbitrators' decisions on the same construction dispute scenario. Data was collected from attorneys, owners, owner representatives, contractors, and subcontractors. Compilation of the survey results finds little consistency in the arbitrator's awards, but with much thoughtful care in award consideration. The results suggest that the arbitrator's industry background does not influence the arbitrator's award. There is also no significant award bias due to the arbitrator's education level or years spent in construction business. The results also indicate that previous arbitration experience does not predict the award outcome. This paper concludes that construction arbitration is wholly unpredictable. However, the result will be a well-reasoned and unbiased decision.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Relational selection for collaborative working arrangements	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PRINCIPLES; CONTRACTS; SUCCESS	Procurement arrangements for collaborative working arrangements (CWAs) should arguably provide suitable protocols under which different project partners can interact effectively and maintain harmonious relationships and mobilize their collective efforts towards common project objectives. Technical abilities of different project partners for carrying out the works are important. Also critical are their "soft" or "relational" qualities to work jointly and synergistically in the project team. The aims of the reported study are to examine the importance of a single set of different factors for selecting consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and clients for CWAs; and to assess the relative importance of various factors and strategies for building CWAs. Data were collected internationally from 17 countries through a questionnaire survey and statistical analyses were conducted. Results attribute varying degrees of importance to various factors for selecting different project partners and suggest an interrelated and consolidated selection approach in general, except for "selecting" clients. The study confirms that trust and business ethics related factors and strategies are more helpful for CWAs than some others. Outcomes of this study are expected to benefit both industry practitioners and researchers, in exploring, designing, and implementing suitable CWAs and selecting appropriate project partners.

However, as social consciousness and personal welfare demands increase, social conflicts among external stakeholders, such as local residents, local and central governments, and NGOs, have become more critical factors in enhancing project viability. In Korea, these conflicts have an impact of US $70 billion annually on social costs. To alleviate social conflicts and costs, this study aims to propose a conflict management framework based on twenty-two representative public construction projects. This study identifies and frames the various causes, impacts, and resolutions of conflicts through the case history of project viability. Through these findings, five types of conflict scenarios were derived: project termination, early mitigation, late mitigation, project enforcement, and late occurrence. Furthermore, this study suggests root causes, pathway of conflict propagation, and characteristics of each conflict scenario, which will assist project stakeholders in developing sustainable management for conflict solutions in line with each project's unique situation.

J	BERNOLD, LE; SALIM, M				BERNOLD, LE; SALIM, M			PLACEMENT-ORIENTED DESIGN AND DELIVERY OF CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The use of reinforced concrete in the United States is steadily increasing, and with it the need for designed and fabricated reinforcing bars (rebar). Traditionally, the detailing of the rebar is done by the fabricator, who is required to have the shop drawings approved by the civil engineer in charge of the structural design. Subsequently, the rebar is fabricated and shipped to the site where an independent subcontractor places the rebar according to the detail design. Research has shown that the delivery of construction material is strongly related to the productivity of construction processes, such as laying rebar. However, traditional rebar fabrication and shipment is geared towards minimizing the set-up time of the rebar bending machine. As a result, rebar is cut, bent, and bundled according to shape and size without considering the sequence of placing the bars. This paper presents an alternative way to design and deliver concrete reinforcement that is based on computer integration and feature-based design concept. Detailing data generated with CAD software is used to create rebar placement plans, shipping schedules, and assignments of lay-down area on the construction site. Based on experiences with the application of the system, steps necessary for its implementation are discussed.

Effective safety management not only reduces contractors' incident rates and compensation costs, it also enhances productivity and efficiency in project execution. In addition, better safety performance increases contractors' competitive advantage in the market by providing better values to their clients. This paper presents a case study of an on-site safety management program launched by a general contractor (GC). The initial findings, based on quantitative measurement of incident rates and safety violations, are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Overall, the program is effective in reducing jobsite accidents/incidents and safety violations in the GC's organization while having less effect on subcontractors' safety performance. This research also finds no linear relationship between incident rates and safety violation rates, indicating that these two measurements are uncorrelated and that both of them need to be used in evaluating jobsite safety performance and the effectiveness of a safety program.

LEAPCON: Simulation of lean construction of high-rise apartment buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHANGE ORDERS; IMPACT; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEM; MODEL	A lean model has been proposed for the construction management of high-rise apartment buildings with customized apartment designs. It incorporates a number of changes to traditional management practice, including single-piece flow with pull scheduling, work restructuring, and multiskilling. A simulated construction process scenario was devised for experimental evaluation of the model. The simulation was first implemented as a live management game, in which participants played the roles of the clients, general contractor, and subcontractors. Eleven runs with different teams indicated that the lean model increased throughput, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle time. However, the limitations of the live simulation led the writers to implement a discrete event computer simulation of the same process. The computer simulation reinforced the findings of the live simulation and emphasized the specific beneficial effect of single-piece flow under pull scheduling. The lean model may be of immediate interest to construction planners and managers because it enables full customization with minimal waste and no additional resources. The demonstrative clarity of the lean model simulation, both live and computerized, makes it a powerful tool for education and research.

J	Sacks, R; Goldin, M				Sacks, R.; Goldin, M.			Lean management model for construction of high-rise apartment buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHANGE ORDERS; PRODUCTIVITY; PRINCIPLE; IMPACT	Execution of the finishing works in high-rise apartment buildings is made complex by the need to customize apartments to the varying requirements and designs of individual clients. The conventional construction planning practice of progressing upward from floor to floor breaks down in the face of the arbitrary sequence in which clients finalize their decisions. The results are long cycle times for delivery of completed apartments and corollary high levels of work in progress, budget and schedule overruns, and general dissatisfaction with the process on the part of the developer, contractor, subcontractors, and the clients. Application of lean construction principles to this problem has led to development of a management model that adopts pull scheduling, reduced batch sizes, and a degree of multiskilling. The main benefits expected are an enhanced ability to provide customized apartments, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle times. The model was first formulated in theory, then tested using a management simulation game and computer simulation, and subsequently, developed for practical application. This paper presents an analysis of conventional practice, the theoretical background to the lean approach, and the specific management changes proposed.

In this regard, the aim of this study is to identify the most frequent, severe, and important causes of schedule delays affecting public constructions projects in Burkina Faso to enhance the managerial capability of project managers. This research was conducted by questionnaire survey to solicit the causes of schedule delays from 140 Burkinabe experts (clients, contractors, and consultants). After analyzing their frequency, severity, and importance index using a quantitative statistical method, the top five most important delay factors were ranked as follows: financial capability of the contractor, financial difficulties of the owner, equipment availability of the contractor, slow payments for completed work, and poor subcontractor performance by the contractor. A comparison of the causes of schedule delays in 11 countries to validate the results of the study showed that financial capability of the contractor was not only the most encountered factor in delays for Burkina Faso's construction industry, but also appeared in many other Asian and African countries.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the primary causes of delays in the construction phase of building construction projects in China. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire survey approach was adopted across the four typical cities in China, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen. In total, 115 sets of valid responded questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Findings The results show that the causes of variations, delays in progress payments, exceptionally low bids and subcontractors' poor performance and communication issues were the most important causes of delays in China. Originality/value This research is the first questionnaire survey on the causes of delays in the construction phase of building construction projects in China. The comparative analysis shows two unique causes of delays in the Chinese construction industry, such as difficulty in claiming indemnity and unreasonable upfront capital demanded by client. It also reveals different ranked causes of delays as per distinguished political and economic situations in China. The research findings can be referred by construction projects in other countries that are funded or partnered with China.

J	Priven, V; Sacks, R				Priven, Vitaliy; Sacks, Rafael			Effects of the Last Planner System on Social Networks among Construction Trade Crews	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building construction; Last Planner System; Social network analysis; Communication; Coordination theory; Production control; Project planning and design	COMPANY	Lean system thinking concerning the mechanics of construction production systems suggests that the Last Planner System (LPS) improves workflow by creating pull flow and by filtering work packages for maturity. However, empirical evidence shows that even where implemented only partially, LPS can still improve workflow. The authors hypothesize that the LPS engenders a social network among the subcontractors, which enhances coordination. Twelve residential construction projects were studied using action research over periods from 7 to 16months to measure the impact of the LPS on social networks. Centrality degrees of trade crews rose significantly and the number of active essential communication channels roughly doubled when comparing projects with low and high planning best-practice index scores, showing that where the LPS is more thoroughly implemented, social networks are strengthened. The results contribute new understanding of the LPS and its mechanism. The LPS not only functions on the technical level to improve production control, it also has social impact, building relationships among construction teams that can contribute to improved coordination.

J	Zeng, SX; Tam, CM; Deng, ZM; Tam, VWY				Zeng, SX; Tam, CM; Deng, ZM; Tam, VWY			ISO 14000 and the construction industry: Survey in China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						construction industry; China; surveys; environmental issues	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	The rapid growth of the Chinese economy sparked off a great volume of construction activities, but the damage caused by construction activities to the environment is indisputable and has alerted some large Chinese construction firms to seek effective environmental management. The ISO 14000 series offers a framework for managing construction operations to improve environmental performance. To discover the conditions of implementation of ISO 14000 in the construction industry, a structured questionnaire survey was conducted whose results show that the major motivation for implementing the system was to seek entry to the international construction market. Other motivations include standardization of the environmental management procedures for internal operations, obtaining social recognition, gaining confidence from clients and a better corporate image, enhancing the environmental awareness of subcontractors, and cleaner sites as a result of better housekeeping. However, some obstacles remain along the path, such as the financial burden, poor rates of return for most firms, low environmental awareness, and inadequate legal enforcement. Based on the analysis and discussion, the paper concludes that the government should take the lead in encouraging training, providing financial support, and improving the legal framework to promote ISO 14000 for the Chinese construction industry.

Construction Bidding and the Winner's Curse: Game Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting	MODEL; AUCTIONS	In the construction industry, competitive bidding has long been used as a method for contractor selection. Because the true cost of construction is not known until the completion of the project, adverse selection is a major concern. Adverse selection is when the winner of the contract has underestimated the project's true cost. Thus, the winning contractor will most likely earn negative or at least below normal profits. The winner's curse is when the winning bidder submits an underestimated bid and is thus cursed by being selected to undertake the project. In the multistage bidding environment, where subcontractors are hired by a general contractor, the winner's curse may be compounded. In general, contractors suffer from the winner's curse for a variety of reasons including inaccurate estimates of project cost; new contractors entering the construction market; minimizing losses in case of recession of the construction industry; strong competition within the construction market; differential opportunity costs, which can affect the behavior of contractors; and the intention to win the project and then remedy the losses through change orders, claims, and other mechanisms. Using a game theory approach, this paper aims to analyzeand potentially reduceindustry exposure to the effects of the winner's curse in construction bidding. To this end, the authors identify the degree of the winner's curse in two common construction bidding environments; namely, single-stage bidding and multistage bidding. The objective is to compare the aforementioned two construction bidding environments and determine how learning from past bidding decisions and experiences can mitigate the winner's curse. To this end, and through defining the relationship between the construction bidding and auction theory, the authors utilized a three-step research methodology that involved (1)presenting the symmetric risk neutral Nash equilibrium (SRNNE) as an optimal bid function; (2)developing simulation models for single and multistage construction bidding processes; and (3)analyzing the results of the simulation models, which is based on an actual dataset of projects provided by the California Department of Transportation. This research demonstrated that the majority of general contractors and subcontractors suffer from the winner's curse in both single-stage and multistage bidding environments. Moreover, from a winner's curse perspective, the multistage bidding environment incurs more losses than the single-stage bidding environment. However, through learning from past experiences, the multistage bidding environment provides contractors with a better opportunity to avoid the winner's curse if compared with the single-stage bidding environment. This research should be beneficial for the profession to better understand the bidding decision-making processes. For future work, cooperative game theory can be applied with the integrated project delivery principles to help all associated parties mutually achieve their project objectives.

This study examines the relationships between six external knowledge sources and two types of innovation processes (exploratory and exploitative) in construction firms. The study is based on survey data from 167 managers in construction firms in Hong Kong. The partial least squares structural equation modeling results show that knowledge from clients and suppliers each significantly affects exploratory and exploitative innovation. Knowledge from universities and research institutions significantly affects exploratory innovation but not exploitative innovation. The other three sources (subcontractors, joint venture partners, and competitors) have no significant effects on either innovation type. The study is among the first to empirically explore the links between external knowledge and innovation (exploratory and exploitative) from a process perspective. It also extends open innovation research into the context of construction, showing the knowledge search activity of construction firms and how it influences innovation processes with practical implications for practitioners.

To investigate the causes of rework in construction projects, a total of 39 causes were first identified through a comprehensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with 13 experienced construction professionals in China. A questionnaire survey was further conducted to prioritize these causes, in which unclear project process management, poor quality of construction technology, and the use of poor construction materials rank the highest. Finally, a factor analysis revealed 11 major underlying dimensions of these causes, relating to design management, communication management, field management, project scope management, project process management, active rework, project plan changes, subcontractor management, contract management, owner capability, and the external environment. The contribution of this work lies in its examination of the underlying causes of rework perceived by construction professionals in the world's largest developing country, which is characterized by its unique economic and social systems. In particular, newly identifed causes of contract management, active rework, and scope management help expand existing knowledge of the underlying causes of rework for the global construction community.

Although a considerable body of literature has discussed when and how PBFs use agents, little is known about the nature of the agency relationships between PBFs acting as principals and their agents and how these relationships may be associated with the practices used by PBFs to govern their agents' behaviour. The purpose of this conceptual study is to provide further insight into the characteristics of PBFs' agency relationships and to identify and describe alternative approaches used for managing them. Our analysis reveals that PBFs' agency relationships differ significantly regarding actor goals, risks, and availability of information across the project life cycle. Based on our findings, we propose a typology of the upstream agency relationships of a PBF consisting of four ideal types: operational, trustful, volatile, and strategic agency relationships. We argue that the development of agency relationships is a dynamic process which is contingent to the temporal orientation of the principal and the agent as well as congruence of goals between the principal and the agent.

At present, it is unclear if and to what extent construction safety risk tolerance vary across broad geographic regions. To better understand patterns in these sociocultural constructs, a survey of building trade contractors and subcontractors was administered. Using principal component analysis and K-means clustering, the determinants of risk tolerance were analyzed for 11,997 construction workers from 17 countries via controlled sampling for equal representation. The analysis showed that risk tolerance is influenced and linked by individual and sociocultural determinants, i.e., affective associations, control beliefs, safety culture, and risk-taking attitudes. Differences and distinct groupings were observed when the derived global risk tolerance scores were compared to country-specific risk-tolerance scores. This study contributes to the literature by empirically identifying determinants of risk tolerance and quantifying cross-cultural disparities in risk tolerance. It was found that the natural grouping of countries, based on their risk-tolerance determinants, coincides with their ancestral heritage and socioeconomic systems. The results can be used to inform policymakers, stakeholders, safety professionals, and industry leaders to improve safety decisions in the workplace, promote strong situational awareness, design structural policies, and implement safety programs.

This research is significant as the outsourcing of scaffolding is integral to its use and productivity toward LNG infrastructure project completion. As such, this paper presents the research undertaken on the subcontracting of scaffold manufacturing, supplying and delivering. It focuses upon the organisations, management and control in scaffolding subcontracting. A comparative analysis of three organisations was carried out to reveal issues with current practice in manufacturing, supplying and delivering scaffold products for assembly onsite. Their management and control approaches are also compared and contrasted. It is found that, while the divided contract approach may help save costs, enhance market exposure and is ideal when choice of subcontractor is limited, its risks can impact upon the entire project and be difficult for the contractor to control. The limited background in scaffolding studies and importance of subcontracting within LNG infrastructure projects has made this research timely. This paper identifies issues in relation to quality assurance, warranties and rework, which have the potential to mitigate any cost benefits obtained from subcontracting practices within this supply chain.

Almost all projects in Yemen face challenges to attain the preplanned outcomes. This paper aims to uncover and assess the critical factors causing failure to the construction industry. At initial study?s stage, a comprehensive literature investigation on academic articles was carried out to determine 62 critical factors causing failures to the industry. Then, a quantitative study was carried out using questionnaire survey as a method to obtain the data. 5-points Likert type scales were applied to assess the factors. Then, the factors were categorized into five different groups. Collected data from the survey was analyzed using SPSS software based on relative importance index (RII) and standard deviations for ranking purposes. The study found that, the top ten ranked factors among 62 factors are poor construction management, frequent change of design, continuous suspension of work, shortage of raw materials, hiring uneducated contactor, low salary for engineers and construction workers, cash flow and financial difficulty, delay of progress payment to subcontractors, financial difficulty faced by owners and poor financial control and management. Results from this study are recommended to the Yemeni government in improving the current state of its construction industry.

J	Syben, G				Syben, G			Contractors take command: from a demand-based towards a producer oriented model in German construction	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						project coalition; institutional change; tendering; construction business system; client; architect; contractor; Germany		The construction process in Germany is traditionally dominated by the client and its agent - the architect. This results in severe problems for the construction companies which do not enter into the process until all the important decisions have been made. In particular, the rate of utilization of their facilities is more or less fully dependent on other actors rather than themselves. Recently, the larger construction companies with nationwide and international activities have initiated changes to take over the construction process and assume the leading position within the project coalition. This has been achieved by integrating parts of the construction project that have been under the command of other actors. At the beginning of the process, this concerns part of the work traditionally performed by the architect on behalf of the client, at the other end it concerns the function of the client itself. So it is the producer who - inside a deep crisis which affects the whole of the industry over the last few years - takes command inside the construction process. This will result in restructuring the entire industry and will cause severe problems for other actors, in particular the small and medium construction companies degraded to subcontractors only.

As a precursor to decreased rework and enhanced safety performance, this study appraised the correlative causes of rework and safety incidents. To do this, 20 rework causes that undermine safety performance were first identified through the literature review. Using a survey questionnaire involving Malaysian construction professionals (owners, consultants, and contractors), the causes were prioritized based on frequency, severity, and importance indices. The five leading rework-safety causes were ranked as follows: poor coordination, insufficient communication, poor subcontractor management, improper supervision and inspection, and poor site management. Spearman's rank correlation tests revealed a significant agreement between the respondent groups. An exploratory factor analysis identified the five major underlying causal dimensions of rework and safety incidents to relate to the substandard management of equipment and machinery, poor project management practices, inherent dangerous, dirty, and difficult (3D) characteristics, improper production planning and work pressure, and inadequate personnel competency and knowledge. This paper bridges the identified knowledge gap concerning the dimensionality of rework and accident causation in construction, and the findings provide guidance for devising preventive measures for simultaneously addressing rework and safety problems.

A comprehensive safety climate questionnaire survey was conducted with all sites and employees of a leading construction company and its subcontractors in Hong Kong. In total, 4,719 records were returned from 54 sites. By means of factor analysis, a 15-factor Structure that defines the dimensions of the safety climate has been extracted. Compared with previous research studies, the roles and influences of fellow workers, and safety resources on the safety climate are emphasized. The results also confirm the feasibility of exploring common factors of the safety climate in the construction industry. Through further analysis, logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the safety climate and personal characteristics. Statistically significant relationships were found between safety climate and personal characteristics. including gender, marital status, education level, number of family members to support, safety knowledge, drinking, habits. direct employer, and individual safety behavior. This research is a case study and the results are derived from the data of one company. but the methodology of this research may be useful as a model for further research, and the findings may provide useful information for construction managers and safety practitioners in the construction industry to improve their safety culture.

During the project, many interface problems may arise, and their severities may vary and affect the overall project performance. This research was conducted to identify the causes of design-construction interface problems in large building construction projects in Palestine. To achieve the research objectives, a comprehensive literature review, pilot study and questionnaire survey were carried out to collect information on these causes. Responses from 34 consultants and 30 contractors were analysed. The results revealed that the top 10 extreme significant causes are unstable client requirements', lack of proper coordination between various disciplines of the design team', awarding the contract to the lowest price regardless of the quality of services', lack of skilled and experienced human resources in the design firms', lack of skilled human resources at the construction site', delaying of dues payments', lack of specialized quality-control team', lack of professional construction management', delaying the approval of completed tasks' and vague and deficient drawings and specifications'. Spearman's rho coefficient was 0.64, which indicates that the overall level of correlation between Palestinian consultants and contractors in the context of this research can be identified as moderate.

Using Nigeria as a case study, the research developed strategies for improving the regulation of construction H&S in a complex regulatory environment. Semi-structured interviews, analysled thematically, was adopted. The proposed H&S improvement strategies include contextualised construction H&S legislation that will enable the establishment of a homogenous but flexible regulatory system. This will be overseen by an independent National Construction H&S regulator but with the controlled support of selected industry and social actors. The regulatory process will include persuasion (such as negotiation), punitive measures, education and awareness strategies. The proposed strategies also include that H&S legislation should stipulate duties for clients, contractors and subcontractors including goal-based legislation with mainly absolute duties, and prescriptive legislation or guidance. This should not be misconstrued as oversimplifying complex phenomena. The study could help policymakers and H&S experts in countries such as Nigeria develop strategies informed by realities of H&S regulatory complexities, in increasing the chance of workability and acceptance of the strategies proposed by the regulated.

The risk assessment of PPP projects is essential in ensuring project success. The objective of this study is to develop an Analytic Network Process (ANP) based risk assessment model for hydropower investments, and a tool to facilitate quantification of risk ratings based on this model. The results show that the three most important risk factors that affect the overall risk rating of a PPP hydropower investment are legal risks, contractor/subcontractor risks, and operator risks. In addition, the three most important risk clusters were identified as stakeholders, government requirements, and resources, whereas market was the least important cluster. The tool that measures the risk rating of a PPP of hydropower project was tested on ten real cases, and satisfactory results were obtained in terms of its predictive capability. The contributions of this research include (1) identification of the risk factors and clusters of factors associated with PPP hydropower investments; (2) determination of the priority of each risk factor and cluster; (3) development a tool that guides the investors through the risk assessment of PPP hydropower investments.

J	Lim, BTH; Loosemore, M				Lim, Benson T. H.; Loosemore, Martin			The effect of inter-organizational justice perceptions on organizational citizenship behaviors in construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Inter-organizational justice; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Project management	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; INFORMATIONAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS; COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR; CLAIMS PROCESS; WORKPLACE; MEDIATOR; ROLES	Project management literature has long argued that inter-organizational justice is a key driver of successful construction project delivery. It is argued that when people believe business transactions are fair, they are more likely to exhibit positive organizational citizenship behaviors such as working harmoniously, giving discretionary effort, respecting others, and collaborating to resolve problems. However, there has been little empirical evidence to support these assertions. To address this knowledge gap, an online survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers from across the construction project supply chain was undertaken. The results show that project participants' organizational citizenship behaviors are influenced by their perceived interpersonal justice in business transactions. However, the findings also offer a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and inter-connectedness of these relationships in showing how one type of inter-organizational justice acts on another in influencing project organizational citizenship behaviors. The results indicate that interpersonal justice is a key ingredient in bringing about positive organizational citizenship behaviors in construction projects and that project performance can be enhanced if project managers treat project participants with politeness, respect, and dignity.

This study, limited to the building sector, is a systematic literature and testimonial search of the perceived motivations and benefits or challenges for choosing LPS. It substantiates the claims of those perceptions through a structured survey of senior and mid-level managers. Quantitative statistical tools infer that practitioners who use LPS experience more reliable planning, better supply chain integration, and less work flow time. However, managers who directly implement LPS are faced with external resistance from clients and subcontractors, and feel that their organization does not offer the necessary incentives for adopting LPS, indicating a possible clash of paradigms. The case studies and testimonials were available in the literature referenced in the paper, but the survey and the method for analysis are new and have not been published elsewhere, either wholly or in part.

However, it has seldom been addressed in grain bin projects which have a stricter requirement for on-time delivery to ensure prompt and appropriate grain storage. The aim of this study is to investigate the significant causes of delay in grain bin construction projects in China. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature review and 15 structured interviews were carried out, and a self-administered questionnaire was sent out to 108 respondents with experiences in constructing grain bin projects. Results showed that the top five delay causes for grain bin construction projects were 'shortage of adequate equipment,' 'poor communication among contracting parties,' 'problems with subcontractors,' 'inadequate experience of the design team' and 'frequent change orders by clients.' Also, results showed that the most significant delay cause category in grain bin construction projects was contractor-related causes. This study has provided the industry and academia with a deep understanding of the delay issue ingrain bin construction projects, which has also reinforced the knowledge body of delay research in the construction engineering and management domain.

J	Collinge, W				Collinge, William			Stakeholder Engagement in Construction: Exploring Corporate Social Responsibility, Ethical Behaviors, and Practices	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder management; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder theory; Corporate social responsibility (CSR)	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; MANAGEMENT	Stakeholder engagement is an undertheorized area of construction project management research. Often simplified as an act of corporate social responsibility, the complexity of the engagement concept means its processes and consequences evade closer scrutiny and analysis. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of stakeholder engagement to reveal its theoretical and practical complexity; two complimentary models of stakeholder engagement are mobilized to analyze empirical data from a hospital case-study project. The result is a retheorization of stakeholder engagement as a complex entwined process of responsibility, organizational action, and work package requirements where stakeholder engagement and agency (i.e., ethical treatment of stakeholders) are understood as separate variables that result in shifts among responsible, paternalistic, neoclassic, and strategic behaviors. The contribution lies in a more sophisticated understanding of stakeholder engagement being attained: shifts between stakeholder engagement and agency define relations between parties in corporate social responsibility (CSR) terms; the ethical aspirations of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) organizations are impacted by daily project activities; and the unique characteristics of stakeholder engagement in construction (e.g., binding of party interests, effect of subcontractor entry, and collective blame/praise) are brought into focus. Resulting recommendations include periodic review of engagement activity to ensure the CSR strategic objectives of organizations are aligned to stakeholder engagement work.

J	Martin, H; Ramjarrie, K				Martin, Hector; Ramjarrie, Karrisa			Cloud Contractor Selection Model for Design-Build Open Tender	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multicriteria; Decision theory; Expert system; Uncertainty; Fuzzy set; Cloud computing	GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR; DELPHI METHOD; SUBCONTRACTOR SELECTION; MULTIPLE CRITERIA; HIERARCHY PROCESS; RANK REVERSAL; AHP; VIKOR; PREQUALIFICATION	For transparency and accountability, public sector clients typically select a contractor using lowest-price open tendering. This paper focuses on improving the selection of a design-build contractor by modeling the inherent uncertainties associated with open tendering. Although there are numerous methods for selecting a contractor, few consider, and even fewer have accounted for, random uncertainties associated with open tendering. In the absence of a structured approach that includes cognitive uncertainty modeling, the risk of choosing a subpar contractor and consequent project failure increases. Cloud theory uses a normal distribution membership function to infuse fuzzy set theory with probability theory. The application of cloud theory in a case study to order the preferred contractors improves decision-making quality and, consequently, confidence in the derived outcome where uncertainty exists. By accounting for both fuzzy and random uncertainties expressed by decision makers, this formulation for contractor selection increases the potential to achieve client performance goals. The proposed new approach reduces the risk of project failure by offering a unique understanding of how to more efficiently choose a design-build contractor. It narrows the model prediction and practice gap by providing an alternative to selecting the lowest bidder.

We derive equilibrium decisions on product quality levels and identify the conditions under which the manufacturer outsources production. We first study the case of symmetric outsourcing where the manufacturer outsources both high-end and low-end products, and obtain the following managerial insights. Symmetric outsourcing tends to enlarge product differentiation within a product line, quality levels under symmetric outsourcing are lower than those under symmetric insourcing when the manufacturer's marginal quality cost is medium, and the size of the product line decreases with both the subcontractor's production cost under outsourcing and the manufacturer's production cost under insourcing. When allowing asymmetric sourcing where the manufacturer outsources one product and insources another product, we find that the sourcing strategy reverses the effect of the manufacturer's nonquality cost on quality levels where nonquality cost represents marginal production cost independent of quality level, and asymmetric sourcing may be taken when the manufacturer's nonquality cost is low and symmetric outsourcing should be taken when the manufacturer's nonquality cost is high.

J	Badalpur, M; Nurbakhsh, E				Badalpur, Mohammadreza; Nurbakhsh, Ehsan			An application of WASPAS method in risk qualitative analysis: a case study of a road construction project in Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk assessment; risk qualitative analysis; road construction project; WASPAS method	FUZZY AHP; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; PRICE; MODEL	Today, the focus on risks and uncertain events is one of the essential goals of any organization. If hazards are not taken into consideration at the planning stage it could be dangerous during project life cycle. Therefore, risk assessment is so important which has been extensively investigated by many researchers in recent years. This research suggested a method based on a combination of two WSM models (weighted sum model) and WPM (weighted product model), known as the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method which was employed to assess negative effects of risks on project. This method has capability and more accuracy compared to independent methods in alternatives ranking. The WASPAS method is one of the new multi-index decision-making techniques which has been adopted and employed in many areas. In this research, we identified and evaluated the risks of a road construction project in Iran which the results showed inaccessibility/inappropriate of barrow pits, loss of key manpower during project life cycle, employing inexperienced subcontractors are of the most important risks among identified risks. Also this paper suggested the WASPAS method as a suitable method with more accuracy among MCDM techniques for evaluating of risks in a real situation.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently.

The safety climate serves as an outline of the basic safety culture's features and forewarns on safety-related problems. This study aims to investigate safety climate information in international construction projects, and find out specific factors affecting perceptions of safety climate in an international context. A questionnaire survey was administered on five construction sites contracted by Chinese international contractors. A total of 571 valid questionnaires were collected from this survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis reveals that nationality, religious beliefs, and employment mode can significantly affect perceptions of safety climate from different facets. In the present case, Chinese workers tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than their Vietnamese coworkers. Workers with religious beliefs tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than those without such beliefs. Finally, workers employed by subcontractors tend to have more positive perceptions of the safety climate than those employed directly by the main contractor. The findings identify the crucial factors affecting safety climate, which in turn enable practitioners to create a positive safety culture to enhance safety performance in international construction projects.

J	Genc, O				Genc, Olcay			Identifying principal risk factors in Turkish construction sector according to their probability of occurrences: a relative importance index (RII) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction sector; exploratory factor analysis (EFA); relative importance index (RII); risk factors; risk management	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; MODEL	A construction project has many phases, all of which involve various risks. The first step in risk management is risk identification. The literature lacks to address identifying key risk factors affecting construction projects concerning the variables' likelihood of occurrences. The goal of this paper is therefore to investigate key risk factors affecting Turkish construction sector based on their probability of occurrences by using Relative Importance Index (RII) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). 201 valid responses to a questionnaire detailing 33 risk variables are analyzed using RII and EFA. The results emphasize that disaster and force majeure, project management, technical management, external, and design-estimation are the main risk factors in the construction projects. It is also found that using unqualified subcontractors/workers/staff during the process, delays in payments, economic matters such as inflation, speculations on prices, late change-order requests of project stakeholders and, failure to complete the work within expected budget limits are the top five most-likely risks while flood, boycott, landslide, attack, hurricane, tornado risks are rare. Through the findings, practitioners that consider defined risk factors when evaluating the potential risk management approaches may increase the accuracy of their risk response method and related cost estimates.

Typically these issues are problematised separately using different theoretical frameworks, yet at the most fundamental behavioural level they have a common cause which lies in the "unjust" treatment of one person by another. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the conceptual understanding of these hitherto separated but conceptually linked problems. Design/methodology/approach - A survey 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. Findings - Surprisingly despite widespread academic concerns about injustice in the construction industry, there are not significant concerns within the industry community. Contrary to much research about the poor culture of the construction industry, the results indicate that the relatively low levels of perceived injustice are institutional rather than cultural. The research also highlights the plight of middle management, which appear to consistently suffer the highest levels of injustice across all its theoretical categories. Research limitations/implications - Sample size and Australian focus. Practical implications - Informs organisational policies to reduce injustice in the construction industry. Social implications - By reducing injustice, this research will improve the fairness of business practices in the construction industry. Originality/value - Application of justice theories to conceptualise unfair construction practices.

While the EVMS measures project-level costs and scheduling performances, the LPS measures the percent plan complete (PPC), which indicates the level of planning reliability. This paper investigates the relationship between planning reliability at the operational level and project performance at the management level (i.e., the success or failure of a project). Analyzing the empirical data of 23 residential projects of a large construction company, the authors find that, while the production plan in the weekly schedule is correlated rigidly with the daily plan in successful projects, such a rigid correlation is not observed in unsuccessful projects. To understand this finding, the authors further conducted interviews with project stakeholders. Taken together, this study suggests that an emphasis on LPS indices causes subcontractors to engage in myopic behaviors such as modifying operational-level indices. Consequently, management-level production plan rigidity is at risk. The findings in this paper offer valuable insights and help project stakeholders understand the attributes of operational-level and management-level indices and their relationships.

J	Sun, Y; Fang, DP; Wang, SQ; Dai, MD; Lv, XQ				Sun, Yu; Fang, Dongping; Wang, Shouqing; Dai, Mengdong; Lv, Xiaoquan			Safety risk identification and assessment for Beijing Olympic venues construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; CHINA; INJURY	New technologies, new materials, and innovative designs have been extensively adopted in Beijing Olympic venues construction. The extreme requirements for time deadline and competition function expose the venues construction to high risks. These risks would potentially bring negative impacts on the site safety performance. Meanwhile, there is a lack of systematic management for safety risks in China's construction industry, especially for large projects such as the Beijing Olympic venues construction. This paper identifies and assesses safety risk factors inherent in Beijing Olympic venues construction with the involvement of 27 experienced and highly respected experts from government agencies, the construction industry, and academe through brainstorming, workshop discussions, and questionnaire surveys. The finding reveals that more than half of the critical safety risk factors are from contractors and subcontractors such as: lack of emergency response plan and measures; workers' unsafe operation, and contractors ignoring safety under schedule pressure. Based on these critical safety risks, a risk register is composed and a model is developed in application of the analytic hierarchy process to assess the status of risks on site safety. The model has been attempted in two Olympic venue projects under construction and the validity has been approved. The risk checklist, register, and assessment model developed in the paper were integrated into the risk management system that has been used for Beijing Olympic venues construction.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified approach for JVC selection. The proposed approach integrates competitive information and collaborative information, focusing on the hesitant fuzzy variables of the bid evaluators. An optimization model is established based on the maximizing deviation (MD) principle to determine the criterion weights objectively. Then, the weights of the bid evaluators are obtained through calculating the relative closeness coefficients of each bid evaluator and the group from the JVCs to the fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS). All the potential JVCs are ranked through minimizing the deviation model based on the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach. A case study of the JVC selection process for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (a large-scale island and tunnel engineering project) was conducted to illustrate the proposed approach. The results showed that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can select the contractors with good collaborative performance. This is important for the practice, because collaborative criteria are reflected in the key criteria currently used in JVC evaluation and selection. The findings from this study can help the JVC manager to identify a JVC with good collaborative performance and control the project risk from the initial stage.

J	Chua, DKH; Godinot, M				Chua, DKH; Godinot, M			Use of a WBS matrix to improve interface management in projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Many researchers agree that smoother construction would result from better communication between designers and constructors about specific requirements and constraints for construction that can be incorporated into the design. The same principle can be generalized to apply to all the phases of a construction project (design, equipment procurement, transport, delivery, installation, and testing, as well as hand-over activities), to the different partners (main contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers), and even internally to the teams working on different parts of a system for the same contractor. Specific requirements and constraints at work interfaces that are technical, organizational, temporal, and geographical in nature have to be made transparent so that they can be managed and resolved to avoid unnecessary reworks and delays. This paper proposes to use the work breakdown structure (WBS) concept to improve work interface management. In the manufacturing industry, the WBS concept is well exploited by crossing a horizontal breakdown of production activities with a vertical breakdown of final products, thus obtaining a WBS matrix, which is more complete and useful than the classical WBS tree. In this paper, the WBS and interface management concepts are first clarified. Then, it is proposed to transpose the WBS matrix concept into the construction industry and to analyze, in a case study, how it may be used to improve interface management. The case study involves the construction of a segment of a mass rapid transit system comprising many specialty trades spanning track works, power supply, signaling, passenger vehicles, and control.

J	Aibinu, AA; Papadonikolaki, E				Aibinu, Ajibade A.; Papadonikolaki, Eleni			Conceptualizing and operationalizing team task interdependences: BIM implementation assessment using effort distribution analytics	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Building information modelling; construction; effort distribution; team collaboration; performance assessment	PERFORMANCE	Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a technological innovation currently at the forefront of digital transformation in the built environment. To achieve satisfactory outcomes with BIM, adopters need to find the most appropriate implementation strategy that is economically efficient. The research discussed here explores why and how distribution of effort spent on various tasks over project life cycle can be used as a metric for assessing and improving the performance of BIM implementation. Using quantitative data collected from a single in-depth case study of a BIM-enabled design and build project and subsequent interviews with three project actors and 11 BIM experts, to validate and triangulate the findings, we explore the use of effort data to analyze and visualize effort distribution patterns. The visualizations revealed the dynamics of team collaboration and task interdependences in BIM-enabled work and their impact on effort distribution. Lack of timely input by the contractor, subcontractors and suppliers influenced unusual patterns in the distribution of efforts indicating potential sources of inefficiency and unnecessary costs in the BIM process; thereby revealing the pivotal role of procurement structure and suggesting the need for timely involvement of key project participants. The contribution of this work is twofold. Methodologically, effort distribution analytics can provide insights that managers can use to improve BIM implementation process. Theoretically, the findings can be used to support informed decision-making, control cost, optimize resources, manage cash flow and to structure fees.

Although previous research has concluded that the safety climate of an organization is significantly affected by communication among its individuals, only a limited number of construction studies have explored this relationship as mediated by organizational fit. To redress this deficiency, this study investigated the association between communication and safety climate mediated by person-organization (P-O) fit. First, a baseline of communication responsibilities was established by analyzing project-related documentation from four subcontractors in China. Through a review of this documentation, 80 responses were collected, which were subjected to social network analysis (SNA) to develop metrics that gauge communication performance. By analyzing person-organization fit in terms of communication [as determined by degree centrality (POF-D) and betweenness centrality (POF-B)], the association between communicative performance and safety climate was established. The analyses revealed that high POF-D can yield an organizational environment that restricts team communication, thus limiting the opportunities to improve the organization's safety climate. In contrast, high POF-B can generate a more relaxing atmosphere in which managers promote open communication, thus facilitating the improvement of the organization's safety climate. Given these findings, this study provides a new perspective for investigating the relationship between communication and safety climate in the construction industry. As such, it provides the basis for future research in this area.

J	Esmaeili, B; Hallowell, MR				Esmaeili, Behzad; Hallowell, Matthew R.			Diffusion of Safety Innovations in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Safety management; Diffusion	META-ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; ORGANIZATIONS; STRATEGIES; PATTERNS; ADOPTION; HAZARDS; HEALTH; TOOL	Safety performance in the construction industry has improved significantly in the past four decades. This improvement has been attributed in part to the increased implementation of injury prevention strategies. Although the relative effectiveness of these strategies has been studied in previous research, there has been no attempt to evaluate their diffusion. To address this gap in knowledge, 12 highly effective administrative safety innovations were identified in literature, and 58 firms were interviewed to investigate their adoption rate. The diffusion patterns of the identified safety innovations were explored using four common innovation diffusion models: the internal, external, Bass, and Gompetz. The findings indicate that the internal and Bass models have the highest explanatory power and that internal factors are the most influential factors in adoption of safety innovations by construction firms. It was also found that project-specific training and safety meetings (91%), frequent worksite inspections (91%), and safety and health orientation and training (90%) are the three most commonly adopted safety innovations, and employment of a site safety manager (62%), subcontractor selection and management (64%), and substance abuse programs (69%) were the three innovations most infrequently implemented. The implication of the findings is that the construction industry has now reached saturation with respect to traditional injury prevention strategies and new safety innovations are needed.

J	Ho, PHK				Ho, Paul H. K.			Analysis of Competitive Environments, Business Strategies, and Performance in Hong Kong's Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Competitive environments; Business strategies and performance	GENERIC STRATEGIES; DIFFERENTIATION; APPLICABILITY	Nearly all construction works are traditionally awarded through a competitive tendering process. A contractor's competitive strategy thus determines its success or failure in different competitive environments. This study aims to explore the contingency relationships between the competitive environments, business strategies adopted and contractors' subsequent performance in the construction industry. The study was based on Porter's competitive-force framework to analyse competitive environments in the construction industry, together with the modified version of Porter's generic strategies of cost leadership and differentiation. The performance measure was based on the profit margin on turnover. Five hypotheses were developed and tested by comparing the resultant performances of two generic strategies with five competitive forces. Questionnaires were used to collect data to test the five hypotheses. Significant interactions were found between three industrial competitive forces (the threat of new entrants, the intensity of rivalry among competitors, and the bargaining power of clients) and two business strategies (the low-cost strategy and the differentiation strategy). The main effects were found to be significant for the remaining two competitive forces (the threat of a substitute and the bargaining power of subcontractors and suppliers). In general, these results confirm the proposition made by this study that contingency relationships exist among three industrial competitive forces, low-cost and differentiation strategies, and contractors' performance.

J	Ng, ST; Tang, ZW				Ng, S. Thomas; Tang, Ziwei			Labour-intensive construction sub-contractors: Their critical success factors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labour-intensive sub-contractor; Construction; Critical success factor; Factor analysis	SUBCONTRACTORS; PERFORMANCE	What contributes to the success of sub-contractors is a key concern of the construction industry as the performance of sub-contracting firms is far from satisfactory. While certain studies have been carried out to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for sub-contractors, it is unrealistic to assume that these CSFs are relevant to all types of sub-contractors. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to establish a set of CSFs for those construction sub-contractors which are labour-intensive in nature. To achieve that, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong. A set of CSFs pertinent to labour-intensive sub-contractors are first identified through descriptive statistics. The CSFs are then compared with those pertinent to equipment-intensive trade specialists. Finally, the identified CSFs are grouped into three components through a factor analysis. Through the survey, nine factors are identified as critical to the success of labour-intensive sub-contractors, and these CSFs are grouped into three components viz, the managerial performance, financial performance, and labour-intensive specific factors. The findings of this study provide a good basis for labour-intensive sub-contractors to improve their success at project and organisational levels. The identified CSFs will also provide a solid foundation for future research into the key performance indicators and benchmarks for labour-intensive sub-contractors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

J	Russell, MM; Howell, G; Hsiang, SM; Liu, M				Russell, Marion M.; Howell, Gregory; Hsiang, Simon M.; Liu, Min			Application of Time Buffers to Construction Project Task Durations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Time; Buffer; Uncertainty; Labor and personnel issues	PRODUCTIVITY	For this research, a time buffer is defined as the extra time added during planning to individual task durations to compensate for uncertainty and protect against workflow variation to assure a predictable hand-off to subsequent crews. Although previous research has acknowledged this addition of time buffers, their use in practice has not been studied. This paper reports on what causes people to add and size time buffers. A nationwide survey was administered to project managers, superintendents, and foremen to identify the most frequent and severe reasons for adding time buffers to construction task durations. Forty-seven buffer factors were grouped into nine categories: project characteristics, prerequisite work, detailed design/working method, labor force, tools and equipment, material and components, work/jobsite conditions, management/supervision/information flow, and weather. Contributions to the body of knowledge include (1)identifying the 12 most frequent and severe causes of time buffer; (2)analyzing (understanding) how buffers are viewed differently by foremen, superintendents, and project managers, between trades and between general contractors and subcontractors, and the perception among different levels of experience; and (3)investigating how companies that do not regularly use the Last Planner System and those that do view those factors differently. Additionally, the research quantitatively developed risk profiles of the buffer factors through an integrated risk assessment approach. Understanding the application of time buffers and their associated frequency and severity will help construction managers address potential problem areas and inefficiencies in a prioritized manner.

Despite these advances there remains a tendency for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) to be used as the medium to assist in the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I) systems within heavy industrial engineering projects. In this paper, a retrospective OOM (i.e., Systems Information Model (SIM)), for the E&I systems of a utility facility, which was constructed for an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the purpose of undertaking a construct ability assessment prior to the commencement of construction is presented and discussed. The CAD drawings and cable schedule produced by the EPC were provided to an E&I organization to undertake a constructability assessment; errors, omissions and information redundancy were identified and quantified. The SIM model was then used to examine a tender proposal from a construction subcontractor (CS) of the EPC; discrepancies were identified and it is suggested that differences arose due to the prevailing errors and omissions. The potential use of a SIM during construction as a quality assurance/control (QA/QC) is then examined, as it is suggested that it can be used to ensure the development of an 'As-built' model and provide a realistic representation of the constructed asset, which safeguards its integrity for operations and maintenance.

J	Zhang, SB; Chen, JY; Fu, YF				Zhang, Shui Bo; Chen, Junying; Fu, Yafan			Contract complexity and trust in construction project subcontracting	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract; Trust; Psychological perception; Bilateral transaction-specific investment; The Chinese construction industry	TRANSACTION COST; FORMAL CONTRACTS; INTERFIRM COOPERATION; GOVERNANCE; MECHANISMS; PERFORMANCE; EXCHANGE; DETERMINANTS; ALLIANCES; DECISION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to unpack the "black box" of the relationship between contract and inter-organizational trust, both theoretically and empirically. Two mediators, namely perceived safeguard and restriction, are identified to build up two seemingly contrary possible paths between contract and trust from current literature. Both paths are tested in the context of Chinese construction industry due to our access to sample. Design/methodology/approach A survey of 295 contractor-subcontractor relationships from Chinese construction industry was conducted. A three-step multiple regression model was employed to test the mediating effect of perceived safeguard and restriction. Then, a hierarchical regression model was used to test the possible moderating effect of bilateral transaction-specific investment. Findings The empirical results support the mediating effect of perceived safeguard between contract and trust in the construction subcontracting industry. Bilateral transaction-specific investments enhance the positive effect of contract on safeguard perception. Originality/value Theoretically, this study contributes to governance literature by opening up the "black box" of the relationship between contract and trust. It provides a better understanding of how and when contract complexity impacts trust, instead of simply focusing on whether contract and trust act as complements or substitutes. Practically, this study provides guidelines for construction firms to decide the degree of contract complexity under various degrees of bilateral transaction-specific investments to enhance the other party's trust, so as to improve performance outcomes.

J	Sierra, F				Sierra, Francisco			COVID-19: main challenges during construction stage	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						COVID; Impact; Contractor; Construction; Assessment framework; Health and safety		Purpose This paper reviews the current literature on the major challenges faced by building contractors in the UK due to COVID-19 to create an evaluation framework. Design/methodology/approach A PRISMA scoping review systematically maps the information published and establishes the potential challenges, as a precursor to a literature review that synthesises the data available to establish an initial COVID-19 evaluation framework to build a rationale for a future series of studies. Findings The research identified these seven challenges: health and safety on-site, economic cost, possible legal exposures, manpower availability, instability of the supply chain and subcontractors, and the uncertainty related to the constant and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. The magnitude of each challenge was also found to differ depending on the size of the contractor, the rigor of local regulations and the sector where the contractor works. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to increasing understanding on the subject and provides an initial assessment framework, based on these seven parameters, so that contractors can analyse their weaknesses and plan specific priorities so that their companies can remain competitive, minimising the impact of COVID-19 and possible future waves. Originality/value This research is timely and relevant as it produces the first academic review on how COVID-19 has affected contractors and the construction stage. This document gives a holistic view of the new scenario created by COVID-19 and creates a self-assessment system for contractors to test their resistance to COVID-19.

J	Koc, K; Gurgun, AP				Koc, Kerim; Gurgun, Asli Pelin			Stakeholder-Associated Life Cycle Risks in Construction Supply Chain	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction supply chain; Supply chain risks; Content analysis; Supply chain life cycle; Supply chain stakeholders; Focus group discussion	MANAGING RISKS; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; FUZZY	Numerous inherent risks impose a systematic risk identification approach to achieve supply chain performance goals in construction projects. This paper investigates supply chain risks in construction projects with respect to life cycle and corresponding stakeholders. The research was organized with two stages. In the first stage, a systematic literature review accompanied by a content analysis was conducted based on risks in construction supply chains (CSCs) to identify research gaps, suggest future research directions, and support subsequent steps. Then, three focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed by industry representatives to (1) specify life cycle risks in CSCs, (2) associate specified risks to related stakeholders, and (3) ensure the role of each stakeholder in CSCs. Results of the content analysis indicate that relationship, communication, and sustainability are the most frequently examined research areas, while innovation and organizational learning, supplier vulnerability, and negotiation are overlooked in the literature. Based on sessions of FGDs, 135 risks were categorized into 10 phases of construction supply chain life cycle (SCLC) as requirement and demand, design, tendering and contracting, manufacturing, logistics, hand over, inventory, installation, winding up, and control and maintenance. Main contractor, subcontractor, supplier, and client were found as the critical decision entities in tendering and contracting, installation, logistics, and requirement and demand phases, respectively. The findings can be useful for researchers by indicating research gaps, and for construction companies seeking to increase their supply chain performance through life cycle and stakeholder approaches.

J	Bajjou, MS; Chafi, A				Bajjou, Mohamed Saad; Chafi, Anas			Exploring the critical waste factors affecting construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction waste; Waste reduction; Factor analysis; Lean construction; Environmental performance; Sustainable construction	LEAN CONSTRUCTION; BUILDING-PROJECTS; COST OVERRUNS; MANAGEMENT; GENERATION; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; INDUSTRY	Purpose Waste is typically encountered during the building's life cycle, from the design phase, through the construction phase, to modification and demolition. Most of these construction wastes are unnoticed or unattended by project managers, which lead to serious environmental problems. Effective waste reduction strategies will require a thorough and detailed understanding of the causes of construction waste. Hence, this paper aims to explore critical waste factors (CWFs) affecting the performance of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review was carried out to determine these factors based on previous studies, from which a questionnaire was developed. Series of statistical analyses such as reliability analysis, Spearman Correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and factor analysis were performed on a total of 330 valid responses to identify latent factors responsible for wastes occurrence. Findings This study reveals 31 CWFs through evaluation of prior relevant studies carried out in several countries and then adjusted and validated through semistructured interviews. The significant differences in views within various groups of respondents with different organizational characteristics are highlighted. The results of factor analysis showed that there are six principal components extracted with 66.3% of variance explained (material-related factors; subcontractors and workers; planning, communication and coordination; people involvement and financial issues; people development strategies; and external factors). Originality/value This study differs from other studies in the literature by gathering all relevant waste factors including those related to nonphysical waste such as time, budget, workers and equipment. Furthermore, this paper will be of great interest to both practitioners and researchers since it brings various recommendations concerning the prevention/reduction of waste through lean construction for more sustainable construction projects.

Empirical Study of the Risks and Difficulties in Implementing Guaranteed Maximum Price and Target Cost Contracts in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guaranteed maximum price; Target cost contracting; Pitfalls; Risks; Difficulties; Hong Kong.		Over the past few decades, both the guaranteed maximum price (GMP) and target cost contracting (TCC) arrangements have been regarded as alternative integrated procurement strategies for clients to mitigate risks, minimize claims, integrate the diverse interests of a complex construction project, and offer incentives to provide value-added services. However, the adoption of GMP/TCC contracts may also generate significant risks and difficulties that merit considerable attention. This paper aims to provide a concise review of the potential pitfalls of the GMP/TCC scheme in general and identifies the key risk factors and potential difficulties associated with GMP/TCC in comparison with other procurement strategies in construction in particular via an empirical survey of clients, contractors, and consultants in Hong Kong. The survey data gleaned from 45 valid replies were analyzed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, and Spearman's rank correlation test. The survey results indicated that "involvement of inexperienced or claim-conscious contractors in a project procured by a GMP/TCC contract" was considered to be the most significant risk factor; while "design development must keep pace with main contractor's program for tendering the domestic subcontractors' works packages" as the major difficulty in implementing GMP/TCC projects. The research findings derived from this study are particularly essential in assisting the contracting parties to mitigate the detriments brought about by potential risks or difficulties when embarking on GMP/TCC contracts. It has also generated valuable insights into developing effective recommendations for alleviating the barriers to GMP/TCC success for future construction projects.	[Chan, Daniel W.

J	Mahamid, I				Mahamid, Ibrahim			Impact of rework on material waste in building construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Material waste; rework; buildings; steel reinforcement; concrete	GENERATION; INDUSTRY; COSTS	This study aims at identifying the relationship between material waste and rework in building construction projects in the northern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To elicit the views of professionals in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia about rework factors, material waste factors and the relationship between rework and material waste, 82 questionnaires were distributed and 70 were returned. The study reveals that the main rework causes on construction sites are errors and omissions, lack of labour skills, non-conformance with specification requirements, inadequate supervision, and scope changes. While the study concludes that the top causes of material waste are using untrained labours, rework due to workers' mistakes, frequent design changes, selecting the lowest bidder contractor/subcontractor, and design and construction detail errors. To develop regression models that describe the relationship between rework and material waste, data from 47 building projects were collected. The predictive models emanating from the current study indicate a significant relationship between rework and material waste on construction sites in Saudi Arabia. Equally, the nature of the relationship is directly proportional, i.e. the higher the rework cost the higher the material waste and conversely the lower the rework cost the lower material waste. Results of this study will draw attention to potential causes that contribute to material waste and rework on construction sites. It may also help construction practitioners in the derivation methods and strategies to minimize rework and material waste and hence, enable improvements of construction industry to be made. The recommendation of this study may also apply to other developing countries.

J	Kim, MK; Wang, Q; Li, H				Kim, Min-Koo; Wang, Qian; Li, Heng			Non-contact sensing based geometric quality assessment of buildings and civil structures: A review	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Geometric quality assessment; Literature review; Buildings and civil structures; 3D laser scanning; Photogrammetry	DISCREPANCY FEEDBACK; INFORMATION MODELS; DAMAGE DETECTION; MACHINE VISION; LASER; BRIDGE; DOCUMENTATION; ELEMENTS; QUANTIFICATION; VALIDATION	Geometric quality assessment (QA) of buildings and civil structures is an essential process in a construction project. Timely geometric QA is able to prevent construction delays and cost overruns, maintain the performance of in-service facilities, and extend their service life. Geometric QA based on manual measurement has been proven to be time-consuming, unreliable and costly. Therefore, non-contact sensing technologies have been widely deployed for more efficient and accurate geometric QA. While a large number of techniques and algorithms have been developed in previous studies for non-contact sensing-based geometric QA, relatively little work has been done to systematically study and review their performance. This study reviews recent research on non-contact sensing-based geometric QA of buildings and civil structures in three project phases: 1) manufacturing, 2) assembly/construction, and 3) operation/maintenance phase. For each phase, the geometric QA is further categorized based on different QA purposes, including dimensional QA, surface QA, and deflection/deformation QA. Based on collected papers, two parts of analysis, consisting of 1) the adoption of different sensors for different project phases and 2) the performance of the QA algorithms/methods, are discussed in detail. Following the literature review and in-depth discussions, research gaps and future research directions are suggested, including improvement of QA techniques in each project phase, improvement of QA techniques applicability, and improvement of photogrammetry accuracy. This technical review is expected to have not only academic value by suggesting technical research directions based on the research gaps, but also practical values that allow contractors and subcontractors to automate and improve their current geometric QA practice.

A Qualitative Data Analysis for Supplier Quality-Management Practices for Engineer-Procure-Construct Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supplier quality management (SQM); Rework; Construction supply chain; Supplier quality (SQ) process map; Qualitative data analysis; Grounded theory; Contracting		The process of assuring the procured and fabricated materials for an engineer-procure-construct (EPC) project are within their quality requirements is challenging because nearly every EPC construction project is complex and distinctive from previous projects in terms of its size, supply chain, and materials usage. In particular, EPC projects include contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers who collaboratively perform the engineering design for the project, procure the required materials and equipment, and then construct. Many (or most) construction organizations, representing owners and contractors, place high importance on documenting and tracking the quality performance of their suppliers as part of their sup plier quality management (SQM) to ensure that procured and fabricated materials are within the quality specifications. However, these organizations still face problems with their SQM, evidenced by the large number of rework tasks and replacement efforts for the supplied materials in the EPC projects. This highlights the importance of investigating the current supplier quality practices to explore effective practices to deliver products with the expected quality and zero rework. In this paper, six structured interviews were conducted with contractors, and 92 SQM documents including procedures and reports from 21 owners and contractors in the EPC industry were analyzed to identify the current practices used by these organizations with regard to SQM, and the most effective practices that construction engineering managers could borrow to improve the existing SQM in the EPC projects. The contribution of this research can be used by stakeholders in the construction industry to improve SQM within their organizations. Researchers can also benefit from this research to better understand SQM practices within the construction industry. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Modeling relational transaction and relationship quality among team members in public projects in Hong Kong	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Relationship quality; Relational contracts; Public projects; Prediction; Hong Kong	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; PLS-SEM; EMBEDDEDNESS; NETWORKS; CONTRACT; ORGANIZATIONS; SELECTION; SUBCONTRACTOR	Prior studies have found that relational contracting (RC) practices are helpful in nurturing good relationships among project team members. These empirical studies, however, did not differentiate by project type (i.e., public or private projects). In reality, the situation faced in public projects would be different from that of private projects since for example, some public sector participants may be indifferent to, concerned about or indeed opposed to, building close relationships with private sector counterparts. In the context of public construction projects, this study aims to develop models to explain the association between relationship quality and the extent to which RC practices are adopted. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey in Hong Kong, China. Using Multiple Linear Regression and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), models for predicting the relationship quality among project team members were developed. The mathematical equations were validated by a case study. The models show that the relationship quality among project team members can be predicted by the extent to which these RC practices are implemented: (i) adoption of flexible strategies; (ii) readiness to compromise on unclear issues; (iii) willingness to commit on a long-term basis; (iv) attitude towards teamwork; (v) trust among team members; (vi) sharing of project information; (vii) understanding among team members; and (viii) alignment of the objectives of different parties. The models are recommended to public clients, consultants and contractors that aim to achieve good relationships in public projects. 0 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ling, Florence Y.

However, construction markets in developing countries are perceived to be more vulnerable to the challenges associated with the pandemic. As such, the goal of this paper is to capture the impact of COVID-19 on construction projects in developing countries by considering the case of the Iraqi construction sector. A multistep research methodology was adopted by the authors, including (1) literature analysis and semistructured interviews with 40 industry experts to identify a comprehensive list of construction themes and factors affected by the pandemic; (2) survey data collection from 388 industry professionals to quantify the significance and influence of each identified factor; (3) Cronbach's alpha test to check the reliability of the survey; (4) fuzzy inference system to assess the impact of the pandemic on each construction theme and factor; and (5) Mann-Whitney U-test to examine the perceived impact by the public and private sectors. Results show that the pandemic has impacted a total of 16 construction factors grouped under four construction themes, including contractual implications, construction financial market, and supply chain operations, as well as safety and risk management, where the latter is the most impacted theme. The factors impacted the most by the pandemic are safety management measures, interpretation of the contract language, building materials prices, risk management practices, construction materials, construction labor, and construction subcontractors. Also, the findings of the fuzzy model show significant difference in the captured impact of the pandemic between the public and private sectors. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a foothold foundation for researchers and decision makers to enhance investigating the effect of the pandemic with its deep uncertainties in relation to developing countries.

To bridge the knowledge gap about how firm size affects innovation in construction, the purpose of this paper is to explore firm-level innovation through an empirical investigation and compare innovation in construction firms of different sizes in terms of drivers and strategies. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a combination of a literature review, a group of qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire survey. In this research, the questionnaire survey is the main instrument to collect empirical data. Main contractors, subcontractors and specialist contractors as well as suppliers of labor, material and equipment are used in this research to represent construction firms of different sizes. On the other hand, client organizations, design firms and management consultants are not included in this research. Findings This research provides clear evidence for the embrace of innovation in construction. Many forces can drive construction firms to innovate and many strategies can be applied to construction innovation. Innovation drivers can be either internal or external. On the other hand, innovation strategies fall into four categories: technology, resource, marketing and management. For innovation drivers and strategies, both commonalities and differences can be found among construction firms of different sizes. Originality/value The finding of commonalities describes the general trend of innovation development in construction. It also encourages all construction firms to innovate regardless of firm size. On the other hand, the finding of differences enables construction firms of different sizes to realize what forces better drive their innovation and what strategies are more appropriate for their innovation. A thorough understanding of innovation drivers and strategies offers an important framework for construction organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice.

J	Zaman, U				Zaman, Umer			Examining the effect of xenophobia on "transnational" mega construction project (MCP) success Moderating role of transformational leadership and high-performance work (HPW) practices	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transformational leadership; Project success; High-performance work practices; Xenophobia	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE; MEDIATING ROLE; CONFLICT; IMPACT; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; ATTITUDES; STRATEGY; BELT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to argue that modern-day xenophobia has emerged as one of the high-risk factors for transnational mega construction projects (MCP's). While research in transnational MCP's remains surprisingly under-explored, this study aimed to examine how transformational leadership (TFL) and HPW practices can still achieve MCP success despite the rise of xenophobia in the global construction industry. Design/methodology/approach This study examined survey-based sample evidence from 220 respondents including project team members (operational, quality and technical), project stakeholders (e.g. regulatory authority, subcontractors, functional managers, etc.) and project clients/sponsors. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed to test the theoretical hypotheses and to highlight significance of a holistic and novel framework of MCP success. Findings This study's core finding unveiled a significantly negative effect of xenophobia on MCP success (ss=-0.389, t=5.574, p<0.000). Interestingly, PLS-SEM results also showed a significantly negative effect of TFL on MCP success (ss=-0.172, t=2.323, p<0.018), whereas HPW practices demonstrated a significantly positive effect on MCP success (ss=0.633, t=9.558, p<0.000). In addition, xenophobia and MCP success relationship were positively moderated by TFL (ss=0.214, t=2.364, p<0.018) and HPW practices (ss=0.295, t=3.119, p<0.002), respectively. Originality/value This study is first to provide an empirically grounded model of MCP success that collectively examines the role of xenophobia, TFL and HPW practices. This research has developed practical references for transnational construction companies in strategic planning and management of MCP's.

Assessment of the built status of MEP works in construction projects is however typically limited to subcontractor claims augmented and contrasted with periodic manual inspection. A more detailed manual inspection is costly and not considered worthwhile on most projects. Within a Scan-versus-BIM object recognition framework, three-dimensional laser scanning and project 3D/4D BIM models jointly offer the opportunity for a frequent, detailed, and semantically rich assessment of as-built status of construction projects at a cost that continues to decline. This potential has already been demonstrated for tracking structural works, but remains to be assessed in regard to other work sections, in particular MEP works. This paper explores that opportunity. A Scan-versus-BIM processing system is described with some enhancements over previous works. It is then tested with a representative and challenging case study of the construction of a utility corridor in a university engineering building. The results indicate that the proposed system is significantly challenged when tracking MEP systems constructed using traditional on-site fabrication, due to changes or adjustments made on-site that lead to actual component layouts varying in comparison to designed layouts. This performance could be revisited in cases where off-site prefabrication and preassembly is implemented. The results nonetheless lead the authors to propose a novel data processing system (conceptually described in this paper) integrating Scan-versus-BIM and Scan-to-BIM approaches. This system should provide superior performance over existing systems, enabling automated and robust quality control (including the estimation of the emerging performance metric percent built as designed) and delivery of true as-built BIM models to facility owners and managers.

J	Maraqa, MJ; Sacks, R; Spatari, S				Maraqa, Musab Jamal; Sacks, Rafael; Spatari, Sabrina			Quantitative assessment of the impacts of BIM and lean on process and operations flow in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantitative assessment; Construction flow index (CFI); Workflow; Location-based management system (LBMS); Building information modeling (BIM); Virtual design and construction (VDC); Lean construction	QUALITY; INDEX; MODEL	Purpose The study aims to test, measure and quantify the impacts of lean construction and BIM implementation on flow in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach Detailed control data from a set of 18 high-rise residential construction projects executed between years 2011 and 2020 were analyzed using the construction flow index (CFI), a measure of workflow quality. Seven comparable projects with a diverse range of LPS, BIM, VDC and 5S implementation were selected to compare the impacts of these innovations on flow. Findings Implementing BIM in the big room and applying the last planner system and other lean construction techniques increased the CFI from 4.31 to 8.12 (on a 10-point scale). Avoiding trades crossing one another's paths between tasks was the most significant aspect of improved flow. Moreover, the benefits of implementing lean practices with BIM or VDC were found to be measurably greater than when these approaches were implemented separately. Research limitations/implications The primary limitation of the study is that the degree of confidence in the results is limited by the nature of the case study approach. Although 18 is a respectable number of case study projects, it cannot offer the degree of confidence that a broader, representative sample of projects could. Similarly, the case studies are all drawn from the same construction context (residential apartments) and the same geographic region, which necessarily limits confidence concerning the degree to which the findings can be generalized. Originality/value The research is the first of its kind to quantitatively assess the impacts of BIM and lean construction on flow. Use of the CFI to quantify flow quality also highlights the potential value of CFI in providing project managers and planners a clear view of the smoothness or irregularity of flow and of differences between subcontractors' production rates.

J	Daniel, EI; Pasquire, C; Dickens, G; Ballard, HG				Daniel, Emmanuel Itodo; Pasquire, Christine; Dickens, Graham; Ballard, Herman Glenn			The relationship between the last planner (R) system and collaborative planning practice in UK construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						UK; Construction planning; Collaborative planning; Construction sector; Last planner system; Production planning and management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how the newly emerging UK practice of "collaborative planning" (CP) for construction project delivery aligns with the advocated principles of the global last planner system (LPS) of production planning and control. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed, qualitative, exploratory approach was adopted for the study. This entailed qualitative data through three techniques, namely: semi-structured interviews, documents analysis, and structured observation. In total, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted over a 12 month period with lean construction consultants, clients, main contractors, and subcontractors drawn from the building, highways and infrastructure and rail sector. In all, 15 projects were visited where practices were observed. Findings - The study reveals that the current practice of CP in the UK partially aligns with the LPS principles. Where practitioners have heard of the LPS they believe it to be the same practice as CP. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to 30 interviews, observation of 15 projects and document analysis. The aim of the study is not to generalise the findings, however, since the study examined top construction companies and practitioners in the UK and the findings were consistent across the sample, some conclusions could be made. The study is also limited to examining the construction phase only, future studies should incorporate the design phase. Practical implications - A clear identification of the elements of current practice compared to the components of the LPS provides a contribution to the future practice of project production planning and management in the construction industry. Social implications - The study highlights a continuing resistance to collaboration within the industry. This resistance is subtly embedded within implemented practices even though they are based on collaborative working for their success. Originality/value - This is among the first studies in the UK that comprehensively examines and reports the application of LPS/CP practice in construction across the major construction sectors. Future studies could build on the findings from this work to develop an approach/methodology to improve the current practice.

J	Nielsen, KR				Nielsen, KR			Risk management: Lessons from six continents	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Globally, the need to construct new pipelines is increasing dramatically, both on shore and off shore. So too are the risks that are faced in attempting to meet project and stakeholder goals. Not meeting such goals has even greater consequences as a result. Project execution from potential identification of its need through execution and in-service use to decommissioning requires project management processes and tools at all stages of this timeline. Today, global project management standards are being developed, Promulgated, taught, and applied. The reason is obvious. Project management is an essential function that is the single greatest means of assuring that a project is successful in meeting all objectives from cost to functionality. It also is the single greatest means of assuring that a party with a role in the project execution (developer, owner-employer, engineer-constructor, contractor-subcontractor, vendor, operator-User, etc.) achieves its commercial, professional, and related goals. Project management is the most widely found cause for failure to meet project objectives and goals. Within today's project management bodies of knowledge, risk management techniques are evolving as a key tool to maximize achievement of goals, yet application of risk management in pipeline projects is not focused on a broad spectrum of the risks being experienced throughout the project. Ultimately, risk management application provides the ability to identify risks, determine characteristics of risk emergence, allow measurement through control systems, and apply enhanced project management methods for improved achievement of project and stakeholder goals throughout the life of a pipeline project. Risk management is essential to recognize and develop input to meet the different needs for the project and respective stakeholders' Success throughout the seasons of a pipeline project's life-a project's spring season (from the identification of a possible need that may become a project to its financing/funding), a project's summer season (project execution), a project's fall season (project use), and a project's winter season (sustainable recycling). This paper develops the types of risks for eight categories of risk factors being experienced, tools being used, application options and successes, and the contexts needed for Success. The basis for these approaches is the global project management experience of the writer over the last three decades, on six continents (on-shore and off-shore), including oil and gas, water, and wastewater.

J	Loosemore, M; Higgon, D; Osborne, J				Loosemore, Martin; Higgon, David; Osborne, Joanne			Managing new social procurement imperatives in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration; Intermediary; Social value; Social procurement; Social innovation	SECTOR; ENTERPRISES	Purpose This paper responds to the need for more construction project management research in the emerging field of social procurement. It contributes by exploring the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and project-based intermediation in meeting new social procurement imperatives. Design/methodology/approach A thematic exploratory case study analysis is presented of seventy-three interviews undertaken with stakeholders involved in a unique project-based intermediary developed by a major Australian construction company to leverage the power of cross-sector collaboration in response to social procurement imperatives on its projects, based on semi-structured interviews with 33 disadvantaged job seekers, 40 organisational stakeholders (employment agencies; not-for-profits, Indigenous, disability and refugee support organisations; training organisations; subcontractors; government agencies and departments; community organisations) and observational and documentary data over the duration of a unique project-based intermediary called a Connectivity Centre, developed by a major Australian contractor to deliver on its emerging social procurement requirements. Findings The results show that cross-sector collaboration within the construction industry can produce highlight numerous cognitive, behavioural, health, situational and affective social impacts for the project community and shared-value benefits for the range of organisations involved. However, it is found that cross-sector collaboration through project-based intermediation in a construction context is challenging due to the fragmented and dynamic nature of construction project teams and the communities they have to engage with. Encouraging people and organisations to collaborate who operate in industries and organisations with different and sometimes competing institutional logics and objectives (even if they are linked by common values) requires a set of knowledge, competencies and relationships not recognised in current global project management competency frameworks. Originality/value This research contributes new insights to the emerging but embryonic body of research into construction social procurement by demonstrating the value of emerging theories of social procurement, social value, cross-sector collaboration and intermediation in enhancing our currently limited understanding of the complex challenges involved in responding to new social procurement requirements in the construction industry. It explores and documents the potential value of project-based intermediaries in developing and managing the new cross-sector relationships, roles, relational competencies and practices, which are required to effectively respond to and measure the impact of emerging social procurement policies in the construction industry. These findings have a potentially significant social impact by providing new insights for policymakers and the construction industry, to optimise the industry's response to emerging social procurement policies.

J	Mahalingam, A; Kashyap, R; Mahajan, C				Mahalingam, Ashwin; Kashyap, Rahul; Mahajan, Charudatta			An evaluation of the applicability of 4D CAD on construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						4D CAD; Commercial projects; Infrastructure projects; Benefits; Visualization; Constructability; Project progress review		4D CAD models that integrate physical 3D elements with time, have been used to visualize construction processes in several projects worldwide. 4D models have been used and have been shown to have benefits over processes that span the entire lifecycle of a project such as collaboration with stakeholders, making design decisions, assessing project constructability, identifying spatial conflicts in construction and so on. Despite these benefits, several organizational and project-specific barriers have hindered the widespread adoption of 4D CAD. In order to reconcile the theoretical benefits of 4D models with the practical difficulties faced in implementation, there is an urgent need to explore the implementation of 4D models on construction sites as well as the perceptions of intended users/beneficiaries towards this implementation. This paper aims to address this need and contribute to our understanding of how 4D models must be introduced, positioned and implemented on construction sites, so as to maximize both their acceptability and their usefulness. We describe two 4D models of infrastructure projects and two 4D models of commercial projects that have been built and implemented. Through a process of structured and unstructured interviewing the paper gauges the response of project participants across various organizational levels on each of these projects as to the usefulness of 4D in project planning and control. Through qualitative and statistical analysis of the data we establish that 4D CAD is likely to be most beneficial in the project shaping or planning stage and in the construction stage. In the project shaping stage, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in communicating construction plans and processes to clients, while during the construction phase, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in comparing the constructability of work methods visually in order to detect conflicts or clashes, and as a visual tool for contractors, clients, subcontractors and vendors to review and plan project progress. Further, upper management and site workers are more likely to use and derive benefits from the visualization of processes using 4D given their lack of site related knowledge or skills, while construction professionals who are more construction-savvy are more likely to appreciate and benefit from the analytical and planning aids that 4D simulations provide during the construction phase. However, it is likely that despite these benefits 4D CAD models might not diffuse through the construction industry unless 4D modelling and analysis is integrated into existing project planning approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on future 4D software development that seeks to bring about such integration and leverages the benefits of 4D CAD to bring about improved operational efficiencies on construction sites.
