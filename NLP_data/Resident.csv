The study evaluated inadequacies in environmental attributes, as perceived by staff and residents, in four MBH facilities in the United States. The Psychiatric Staff Environmental Design tool and the Psychiatric Patient Environmental Design tool were used to capture perceptions and facility assessments. We examined the importance of various environmental attributes, the differences between the importance and how effectively these attributes were achieved, and the differences between psychiatric staff and resident responses. The most important qualities for residents were a well-maintained environment and suicide resistance. For staff, the most important qualities were staff safety and security and suicide resistance. Rated across all facilities, staff reported significant differences between importance and effectiveness of environmental attributes (p < .0001) whereas residents did not report differences. Significant differences were found between staff and patient ratings of existing facilities (p = .004), with staff reporting more inadequacies than residents. Findings suggest a strong need for more supportive physical MBH environments, particularly from the perspective of staff. Though residents reported fewer inadequacies, more evidence-based design guidelines for MBH environments are needed.

South Africa has made housing a cornerstone of its social development policies, but there is significant dissatisfaction expressed by the residents of the housing schemes built to date. To address this, a small survey was undertaken to identify what established (existing) residents of low-cost housing in South Africa regard as important or of value. These established residents' views vary from other studies due to the ability to identify medium and long-term needs and problems. The survey identified nine concepts that can be used to evaluate housing scheme design using conjoint analysis or stated choice methods to quantify residents' values. Future quantitative research is suggested into the measurement of the requirements of residents. Development of econometric models of the already investigated urban form is advocated, along with the potential for 'densification' strategies to address some of the issues raised by residents.

It is based on a questionnaire survey that was applied to 42 residents and seven top managers. The results highlight real expectations of high-income residents. Residents were not satisfied with the 'sauna', 'sports areas', and 'fitness centre' despite the fact that these were among the least important expectations. However, residents were satisfied with the 'security of the complex', 'architectural design', and 'quality of the end-products'. If some expectations (i.e. 'areas for common use', 'playing areas for children', and 'quality of the end-products') achieve better technical standards in the next projects, demand for luxury residences will likely be improved. Consequently, 25 expectations and corresponding findings constitute a preliminary framework for an expectations agenda for such projects for builders who wish to improve marketing practices.

Anxiety, as an intuitive feeling toward uncertainties, generally exists among residents who are confronted with redevelopment, and this feeling has gradually attracted scholars' attention. However, relatively few studies have focused on the multidimensional view of this concept and its influencing factors. Drawing upon a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 13 pilot areas in China, this study refines and verifies five prominent dimensions of anxiety, namely, housing conditions, monetary compensation, public services, life adaptation, and public participation level, through factor analysis and one-samplet-test. The finding contributes to achieving a complete understanding of anxiety, and the scales developed for measuring these dimensions lay the foundation for further empirical studies on anxiety. The individual and collective effects of age, job, and region variables on anxiety dimensions are demonstrated via independent-samplet-test and analysis of variance, which clarifies the formation process of anxiety and highlights the importance of these contextual variables. Tailored strategies for policymaking and engineering management, including establishing reasonable compensation standards, providing equal public services, and delivering high-quality housing, are proposed to relieve residents' anxiety. These strategies are expected to consider further the sensitive group, such as the elderly, farmers, and casual workers.

With limited land usage and being aware of sustainability, the refurbishment market has faced increasing needs worldwide. During the long life cycle period of housing, most residents are undoubtedly faced with refurbishment requirements. However, it is not easy to make assessment and refurbishment related decisions due to the lack of knowledge and experience. This study presents Genetic algorithm-based on-line decision support system (DSS) to hell) residents easily conduct the housing condition assessment and offers optimal refurbishment actions considering the trade-off between cost and quality. Two refurbishment models are developed to explore the relationship among the life cycle cost, restoration cost and improved quality. The result reveals the proposed DSS solves the problems arising from asymmetric information and conflicting interests between residents and contractors, as well as improves traditional housing condition assessment to be more effective and efficient.

As such, utilities should leverage these dynamic perceptions for a variety of reasons, including identifying strategic times to increase operational revenues through rate changes or billing structure, implementing capital projects or management approaches, or integrating new policies. This study focuses on assessing the temporal variations of stated willingness to pay for improved water and wastewater service of residents in 21 shrinking US cities. This classification of cities was selected due to the fiscal constraints placed on utilities because of the reduced number of customers from that which the original system was designed to serve. Furthermore, a consequence of this decline, a high proportion of low-income residents are paying high per-capita costs. Enabling this study are survey data collected in 2013 and 2016. Random-parameter Tobit regression models are used to identify geographic and sociodemographic factors influencing this stated willingness to pay. A likelihood ratio test confirmed a statistically significant shift between the surveys in the residents' stated willingness to pay. Model results reveal that between the timeframes of the deployed surveys, the influences of geographic (e.g., Michigan, Ohio) and sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, income) changed as well. Utilities may benefit from using the identified parameters to develop strategies (e.g., outreach programs, targeted education, media advertisements, inclusion in planning) to target specific groups. Similarly, using the geographic parameters may also present an opportunity to increase operational revenue due to higher willingness to pay by residents. In general, this study highlights that public perceptions should be periodically investigated to continually identify times of greater public support for various utility efforts under way.

Environmental influences on indoor walking behaviours of assisted living residents	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						active design; active living; assisted living; design for ageing; health; indoor environmental quality; indoor walking; older people; physical activity	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; OLDER-ADULTS	Regular walking behaviours can improve older people's physical, psychological and social health. This project examined the relationships between assisted living facilities' design features and residents' indoor walking behaviours through surveys and field evaluations. Surveys were conducted in 18 assisted living facilities in the US state of Texas. Researchers gathered information from 343 residents about their walking behaviours, participation in other activities, health and demographic status, and perceptions of the environment. Field evaluations were conducted to collect objective physical environment measures. Facility information was provided by the administrators. Multivariate hierarchical regression analysis showed significant influences of physical environments on indoor walking behaviours. Indoor recreational walking was related negatively to the number of stories of the building and positively to the perception of looped corridors. Different types of utilitarian walking, such as walk to other activities', walk to front entry' and walk to mailbox' were influenced by specific design features. The number of utilitarian walking types was marginally influenced by the number of stories of the building. These findings will help inform the design of activity-friendly assisted living facilities and the creation of health promotion programmes for frail older people.

This development influences everyday practices related to comfort in everyday life in dwellings. Therefore, an empirical analysis of interviews with residents in three types of Danish detached houses, related to the building age, is used to understand how changes in technologies influence residents' practices and notions of comfort. Detached houses are the most widespread type of housing in Denmark, constituting 44% of the housing stock. The analysis focuses on differences in heating systems between the housing types and shows how changes in technologies and material structures shape the practices of heating and airing. A shift in technology from radiators to underfloor heating was found to make a clear difference in both how houses are heated and thermal comfort is perceived. It is found that changes in material structures of houses consequently change residents' perceptions of comfort and the related everyday practices. A more nuanced set of notions of comfort is developed in relation to different practices, and specifically the relation between airing and heating practices, as well as the context of seasons and the outdoors.

Evolutionary Stable Strategy for Postdisaster Insurance: Game Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Game theory; Evolutionary stable strategy; Insurance; Disaster management	MORAL HAZARD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; REINSURANCE; LOSSES; SYSTEM	Mitigation of the financial impacts associated with natural disasters is becoming an urgent objective at both the national and international levels, as the rate and magnitude of natural disasters are continuing to increase. Using an evolutionary game theory approach, this paper aims to find an equilibrium profile of postdisaster insurance plans purchased by resident families and sold by insurance companies, as well as ex-postdisaster relief implemented by a government agency. This dynamic integrated assessment minimizes the total losses for the three aforementioned associated stakeholders, thus maximizing welfare within natural disaster host community systems. To this end, the authors determined a plausible set of actions and utility functions for the associated stakeholders. Also, they created a hypothetical sample of 1,000 resident families accounting for heterogeneous income levels, three insurance companies offering three unique insurance plans per company-each with different premium and coverage-and two different types of government compensation plans for postdisaster damage mitigation. The proposed model was implemented on the NetBeans IDE 7.4 platform using the Java programming language for a hypothetical case study. The results indicate that (1) resident families tend to prefer insurance plans with the lowest premium value and coverage; (2) insurance plans with the most comprehensive coverage experienced the least demand; and (3) the evolutionary stable strategy is an oscillating line of chosen plans and insurers as a result of the stochastic and dynamics nature of the factors associated with disaster management. Currently, the authors are working to develop the model further to better account for simultaneous actions by all stakeholders (not only resident families), population growth, changes in financial and income standards, integrating input from available natural hazard prediction software systems (e.g., HAZUS-MH), and continuous data. Ultimately, this evolutionary game theory model will be tested on post-Hurricane Katrina data representing real-life physical damage in Hancock County, Mississippi.

In case of co-ownership of a building (e.g. apartment building), the residents of a home-owner association have to come to a collective agreement when deciding upon the implementation of sustainable energy measures of the dwellings. Stated choice modelling is a well-known technique to measure individuals' preferences of attributes of choice alternatives. This study introduces an extension of the technique to estimate preferences of residents that takes into account group influences and group dynamics in joint decision-making. The findings of an application based on a national sample of 167 home-owner associations members indicate that owner association members show cooperative behaviour. They are willing to make concessions to their own preferences in order to reach a group decision. When preferences of members differ on outcomes that are considered to be very important, however, the willingness to adapt may be limited. We conclude therefore that compromise alternatives have a higher probability of acceptance than high-gain high-cost alternatives, given the group decision context.

Thermal sensation responses in hot, humid climates: effects of humidity	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptive behaviour; comfort; humidity; indoor environment; occupant perception; satisfaction	COMFORT	Experimental data from five previous comfort studies are used to derive formulas for the thermal sensation of sedentary and near-sedentary residents, and to examine the effect of one variable, humidity, on the perceived levels of comfort. Studies in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia (two studies) investigated indoor comfort, and a further study in Japan investigated outdoor comfort. Thermal sensations of human subjects were recorded under different conditions of temperature, air speed and humidity. In the outdoor study in Japan, solar radiation and surrounding surfaces temperature were also measured. All these studies found that the effect of humidity, expressed as the humidity ratio (gr/kg) on the thermal sensations of sedentary and near-sedentary resident persons tested, was very small to negligible, suggesting an insensitivity of the (acclimatized) subjects to the humidity level within the range encountered in the countries where the studies were conducted.

J	Karatas, A; El-Rayes, K				Karatas, Aslihan; El-Rayes, Khaled			Optimal Trade-Offs between Social Quality of Life and Life-Cycle Cost in Housing Units	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable development; Social factors; Life cycles; Optimization; Housing; Algorithms	RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; THERMAL COMFORT; HONG-KONG; OPTIMIZATION; ENVELOPE; DESIGN; HOMES	The social quality of life (SQOL) for single-family housing residents can be improved by enhancing their thermal comfort, indoor lighting quality, indoor air quality, and locating the housing unit in high-quality and safe neighborhoods. Accomplishing these SQOL improvements often leads to an increase in the life-cycle cost (LCC) of the housing unit. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization model that is capable of generating optimal trade-offs between the two conflicting objectives of maximizing the SQOL for single-family housing residents and minimizing the LCC of single-family housing units. The model is designed to maximize the SQOL for housing residents by improving their thermal comfort, indoor lighting quality, indoor air quality, and neighborhood quality. The model is also designed to minimize the LCC of housing units by minimizing the initial housing unit cost as well as its annual energy, utility, and maintenance costs. The model is developed in three main stages that focus on (1)identifying relevant criteria and metrics to measure the performance of these two optimization objectives; (2)modeling all decision variables, objective functions, and constraints; and (3)implementing a multiobjective genetic algorithm model to evaluate its performance. An application example of a housing unit is analyzed to illustrate the use of the developed model and demonstrate its capabilities in identifying optimal configurations of single-family housing design and construction decisions.

Accordingly, this study developed an automated noise exposure assessment model to enhance the health of construction workers. Therefore, a model was developed to predict the noise level in real time, considering the equipment and work types at construction sites, and to automatically assess the noise exposure of the workers in the short and long terms. A case study conducted showed that conventional regulation standards should be strengthened to have an impact on the health of construction workers. The developed model can help construction companies manage construction noise and protect construction workers from excessive noise by providing scientific evidence of noise exposure to policymakers committed to guaranteeing the health of workers.

The importance of enabling these residents to enjoy a good quality of life is recognized. Results from two research projects show that the physical environment can affect a person's quality of life, but it is one of a number of interrelated factors. Design in Caring Environments (DICE) and INDEPENDENT, both funded by the EPSRC EQUAL programme, use different methods to examine the impact of design on quality of life. The tools and methods developed are discussed, as are the implications of the findings for policy and practice. The Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (SCEAM) is a method for recording the characteristics and use of a care home building. The effects of the building on well-being can be unpicked by a multilevel analysis of building data against measures of quality of life. Used in a study of care homes in Sheffield, UK, it gave some significant results: in homes where the safety of residents had high priority, the scope for pleasurable activities tended to be low; activity appeared to have a beneficial impact on well-being; people in larger homes tended to have a poorer quality of life; staff satisfaction and retention increased with the amount of training and tended to be high in more personalized settings; and most homes under-used the facilities available. INDEPENDENT developed technologies to enhance well-being based on a `wish list' of favourite activities derived from consultations with users. The policy and practice implications of these findings are discussed.

Few studies have used geographic information systems coupled with infrastructure vulnerability models to explore how spatial accessibility to goods and services shifts after a hurricane. Models that explore spatial accessibility to health services are particularly lacking. This study provides a framework to examine how the disruption of transportation networks during and after a hurricane can impact a resident's ability to access health services over time. Two different bridge-closure conditions-inundation and structural failure-along with roadway inundation are used to quantify posthurricane accessibility at short- and long-term temporal scales. Inundation may close a bridge for hours or days, but a structural failure may close a route for weeks or months. Both forms of closure are incorporated using probabilistic vulnerability models coupled with GIS-based models to assess spatial accessibility in the aftermath of a coastal hazard. Harris County, an area in southeastern Texas prone to coastal hazards, is used as a case study. The results indicate changes in the accessibility scores of specific areas depending on the temporal scale of interest and intensity of the hazard scenario. Sociodemographic indicators are also examined for the study region, revealing the populations most likely to suffer from lack of accessibility. Overall, the presented framework helps to understand how both short-term functionality loss and long-term damage affect access to critical services such as healthcare after a hazard. This information, in turn, can shape decisions about future mitigation and planning efforts, and the presented framework can be expanded to other hazard-prone areas.

Most refurbishment work, however, involves a high level of risk, uncertainty, and coordination, which are likely to cause asymmetric information between contractors and residents in a refurbishment process. Most private refurbishment contractor selections are usually based on word-of-mouth referrals that lack a systematic and objective assessment method. This Study proposes a hybrid approach combining fuzzy set theory and quality function deployment (QFD) to establish a housing refurbishment contractor selection model. With this model, residents can select an optimal refurbishment contractor according to requirements. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model. a known multiple criteria decision-making method. PROMETHEE, is applied to compare the results of contractor selections. The result reveals that the proposed hybrid fuzzy-QFD approach can be expected to be successful and has potential for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although the type of projects can relieve transportation pressure in cities and make citizen's life easier, it raises many environmental and social problems during the construction process, in particular, problems about residents' daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify key environmental and social impacts of urban subway constructions and adjust construction programs and urban transportation programs to reduce negative impacts on citizen's daily life during construction. This paper analyzes the key factors for measuring environmental and social influences of subway construction and their interrelationships by using structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Four major impact factors are identified, namely, the impact on residents' travel, transportation, environment and daily life. Then some suggestions are made accordingly. These findings can be used as references for governments, contractors and other parties to develop more rational construction programs to minimize negative impacts of subway construction in urban development.

A recognized need exists to adapt suburbs (homes, gardens and public space) physically to mitigate against further climate change and to adapt to inevitable weather patterns. A number of potential adaptation options, addressing different risks, are identified and tested using a range of methods, including modelling, and workshops with residents and professional and institutional stakeholders. The best' solutions are those that reduce the climate risk within the context of local adaptive capacity. Solutions are effective, acceptable and feasible given the type of suburb; its location; microclimate; housing type; the climate risk it faces; the socio-economic composition of its residents and their attitudes; resources; and governance conditions. It is essential to consider both the totality of the suburban environment and the combined effects of mitigation and adaptation measures. However, the biggest challenge is implementation which entails a better understanding of the problem by a range of stakeholders, a more supportive policy context, more resources, and clearer responsibilities.

Slums represent major national challenges in countries where they exist, especially developing countries. Various intervention strategies can be adopted to upgrade and/or replace slums, but are often faced with serious construction challenges, such as lack of access to sites and poor terrain conditions. Moreover, during the execution of slum upgrading projects, resident families can experience significant social and economic disruptions. The objective of this paper is present an integrated urban-construction planning framework for slum upgrading projects. This framework incorporates participatory upgrading and is designed to achieve three important objectives, including (1)maximizing the benefits of slum upgrading projects by identifying and accelerating the delivery of urgent projects; (2)providing more accurate and practical estimates of upgrading projects costs and timelines, which enables controlling and minimizing the total projects costs and durations; and (3)minimizing the social and economic disruptions for resident families during construction. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework and its core multiobjective optimization process.

The built environment is recognized as influencing health outcomes across lifespans. This narrative review takes a cross-disciplinary approach to understand the current evidence of the relationship between design, healthy ageing and QoL. Diverse methods were used to search for relevant literature, including database, and reference list search. Sixty-five papers were deemed relevant and included in this review. Seven main themes emerged through inductive thematic analysis. The extracted literature suggests there is good evidence for the role of biophilia, and indoor environmental quality; emerging evidence for technology, wayfinding, and opportunities for social interactions; but limited evidence for safety/security and adaptability/fit. One significant consideration for healthy ageing was older adults maintaining agency in their lives, including the ability to exert control over their environment in order to support healthy ageing. Design decisions have a significant impact on the health and well-being of older adults, but these decisions are often made in the absence of strong scientific evidence. This review sets out to assist decision-makers to consider design principles that support healthy ageing.

J	Zhang, ZJ; Zhang, YF; Jin, L				Zhang, Zhongjun; Zhang, Yufeng; Jin, Ling			Thermal comfort of rural residents in a hot-humid area	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptive capacity; hot-humid area; human factors; local adaptation; natural ventilation; overheating; physiology; thermal comfort; China	ENVIRONMENT; ADAPTATION; HISTORY; CLIMATE; PEOPLE; URBAN	The thermal comfort of rural residents in China is studied to improve their living conditions and safeguard agricultural development. The present study recruited 30 healthy young people (50% male and 50% female) from rural areas of the hot and humid region of China and exposed them to a wide range of temperatures (20-32 degrees C) and humidities (50% and 70%) in a climate chamber. Both the psychological and physiological responses were observed. The thermal neutral standard effective temperature (SET) was determined to be 26.8 degrees C and the 90% thermal acceptable SET range was 22.9-30.7 degrees C. Mean skin temperature and skin wetness were found to be good predictors for thermal comfort in the neutral-cool and neutral-warm conditions, respectively. When compared with the previous results from similar studies of urban participants living in naturally ventilated buildings, a significant divergence is found. Rural participants reported the same thermal sensation but felt more comfortable and acceptable under identical cool or warm conditions. Rural participants had the same neutral temperature, but a much wider acceptable temperature range. The reason for these differences between rural and urban people may be attributed to differences in local culture, expectations and environmental cognition.

Using an adaptation of the Cochrane Review protocol, the search and screen for relevant, rigorous research studies resulted in 37 research articles. The review focuses on six built environment characteristics: (1) barriers, supports and features that fit'; (2) spatial organization and layout; (3) environmental cues; (4) ambient qualities; (5) assistive technologies; and (6) gardens and outdoor spaces. Accessibility-oriented features dominated the studies and findings. Pathway and corridor design, and environmental cues that convey an instrumental function of a space also facilitated active living. Ambient features such as lighting quality and meaningful sounds and aromas were important facilitators to active living among residents with dementia. To strengthen the knowledge base of the field and its application in design and improvements of residential environments, future research should focus on: detailed measurement of built environment factors as well as active living; increasing use of digital technologies for such measurements; multidisciplinary research teams; and policy-driven research questions that arise with housing the growing population of older adults in a healthy manner.

However, the development of Chinese distributed PV systems has failed to meet expectations because of their irrational profit and cost allocations. In this study, the methodology for calculating the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for PV is thoroughly discussed to address this issue. A mixed-integer linear programming model is built to determine the optimal system operation strategy with a benefit analysis. An externality-corrected mathematical model based on Shapley value is established to allocate the cost of distributed PV systems in 15 Chinese cities between the government, utility grid and residents. Results show that (i) an inverse relationship exists between the LCOEs and solar radiation levels; (ii) the government and residents gain extra benefits from the utility grid through net metering policies, and the utility grid should be the highly subsidized participant; (iii) the percentage of cost assigned to the utility grid and government should increase with the expansion of battery bank to weaken the impact of demand response on increasing theoretical subsidies; and (iv) apart from the LCOE, the local residential electricity prices remarkably impact the subsidy calculation results.

Language as a Resource in Project Management: A Case Study and a Conceptual Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication; language; legitimacy; local communities; project stakeholder	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PUBLIC AFFAIRS; STAKEHOLDER; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRUCTION; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERSPECTIVE; LEGITIMACY; STRATEGIES; REPUTATION	This study sheds light on how project managers can use language as a resource for communicating with local communities and stakeholders alike, and protect the legitimacy of their decisions and actions. The verbal accounts produced by a senior project management team are examined in-depth. The accounts address the claims raised by residents affected by the expansion of the Heathrow airport. The context for the talk-in-interaction is one of conflicting interests: the promoter undertakes actions to mitigate the impacts of the construction works, but some residents feel frustrated that the business can grow at the expenses of their welfare. The findings reveal that managers tend to acknowledge all claims even when perceiving they lack legitimacy. The analysis of the words and phrasing in the conversational turns that form the accounts reveals three tones-caring, assertive, and apologetic-that managers use intentionally to frame linguistically the acknowledgements. The study discusses how the tones fit with the extent to which, first, managers consider that the claims are factually correct, fair, and precise as opposed to unfair, exaggerated, or opportunistic; and second, managers find technical or institutional references available for constructing the accounts. It also discusses the effects of congruence-or the lack of it-between what managers mean to say about what the project team will do, what managers actually say, how listeners interpret what was said, and what the project team actually gets done.

Micro-renewal is a relatively people-oriented model of urban transformation compared with traditional renewal modes. To improve the theoretical system of neighborhood micro-renewal from a microcosmic perspective, a comprehensive analysis of neighborhood residents' cognition is needed. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibilities and methods of applying gene theory into the study of neighborhood micro-renewal. Design/methodology/approach According to the meme theory, the research explores the genetic analysis of neighborhood micro-renewal. The cross-over studies with "gene theory" from natural science to social science are analyzed and the neighborhood micro-renewal system was constructed from the perspective of micro-participants and micro-objects. Moreover, the concept of neighborhood "micro-renewal gene" was put forward. Finally, the authors show three application scenarios of public participation with a specific neighborhood micro-renewal project. Findings The cross research on urban studies with gene theory could be divided into three scales and four research fields. The characteristics of carrying out neighborhood micro-renewal in China could be summarized as micro-participants and micro-objects. Residents' cognition could be considered as "micro-renewal gene" in refer to meme theory. The application scenarios of introducing "micro-renewal gene" into the study of neighborhood renewal are of great potentialities. Originality/value Neighborhood micro-renewal system was constructed from the perspective of micro-participants and micro-objects. Moreover, neighborhood "micro-renewal gene" was proposed and applied into the study of this system in refer to meme theory.

Design/methodology/approach Through a comprehensive literature review, we established a social-psychological model of public acceptance related to benefit perception, risk perception and public trust. We empirically validated our model by using structural equation model analysis based on a questionnaire survey in the S35 Yongjin Highway Infrastructure Project in Yunnan Province, China. Findings Benefit, trust and risk perception had a significant influence on local residents' public acceptance of highway infrastructure projects; benefit perception and trust perception had a greater influence than risk perception. Public acceptance among local male residents over the age of 35 or those with higher education levels was more likely to be determined by the relative dominance of risk and benefit perceived. Research limitations/implications This study contributes empirical evidence to the theoretical literature related to locally unwanted land use (LULU) siting and stakeholders in the field of project management from the public perspective. This study also suggests valuable practical implications to authorities, project managers and the public in decision-making and risk communication. Originality/value Although previous studies addressed factors affecting public acceptance towards potentially hazardous facilities, understanding of the implications of these social-psychological factors and their effects are still far from sufficient. This study bridges this gap by exploring the determinants of public acceptance towards highway infrastructure projects based on a selected case in China.

J	Ibrahim, A; El-Anwar, O; Marzouk, M				Ibrahim, Amir; El-Anwar, Omar; Marzouk, Mohamed			Socioeconomic impact assessment of highly dense-urban construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Socioeconomic assessment; Dense-urban construction; GIS	PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION; ROAD; SUSTAINABILITY; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; HIGHWAY; MODELS; CHOICE	Dense-urban construction is reported to affect the social and economic welfare of surrounding residents and local businesses in various ways. However, research studies and practical methodologies aimed at assessing to what extent the choice of a construction plan that reduces such effect are very limited. The objective of this paper is to present the development of an automated assessment methodology to fill this research gap. To this end, two formulations are presented; one based on multi-attributed utility functions and the other based on monetary compensations for disruptions caused by construction operations. Both formulations assess the impacts of construction plans on (1) increased travel distance; (2) residents' relocation; (3) business loss; (4) business closure; and (5) noise inconvenience. The proposed automated methodology is implemented in five sequential phases and utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Visual Basic Application (VBA). Using the proposed implementation, the two alternative formulations are applied to an infrastructure upgrading project in Cairo, Egypt that had five possible construction scenarios. While the two formulations resulted in the same preference order for the five scenarios, they exhibited different performance in terms of their (1) assessment relative values; (2) required input data and robustness; (3) ease of results interpretation; and (4) comprehensiveness and scalability. The developed framework shows promising results in terms of identifying and sorting the major root causes of the socioeconomic disruptions caused by dense urban construction. Results show that using the proposed methodology informs decision-making and planning at the early stages of a project, which in turn helps to reduce cost overruns and schedule delays.

Integrating the Social Vulnerability of Host Communities and the Objective Functions of Associated Stakeholders during Disaster Recovery Processes Using Agent-Based Modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK; GAMES	Disaster recovery requires the participation of the stakeholders to repair the impacted community. Nevertheless, disaster recovery remains understudied within the context of emergency management. Various models have been developed to address disaster recovery. However, those models neither considered the stakeholders' needs and preferences, nor the vulnerability of the host community. This paper presents a decision-making framework for disaster recovery that uses a bottom-up approach to capture the needs of the impacted residents and decreases the social vulnerability of host communities. The authors developed the following research methodology: (1) use a well-established community specific social vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate the society vulnerability; (2) model the multisector stakeholders through a root-to-grass technique that captures their objectives, strategies, and learning behaviors; (3) simulate the recovery progress of the impacted community using an agent-based simulation toolkit; and (4) interpret the results to provide the decision makers with optimal recovery strategies. The restorations efforts in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in three coastal counties in Mississippi were used as the problem domain. Accordingly, the proposed model was implemented on a multiagent-based simulation toolkit with geographic information system (GIS) abilities. This research optimized the budget for the State Disaster Recovery Coordinator and the residents' insurance plans choices. As such, this study provided better social vulnerability indices than the existing conditions currently found in the areas under investigation. Further, this research provided higher disaster recovery rates within the studied host communities. For future work, other vulnerability dimensions will be simultaneously integrated into the model to provide a more accurate depiction of sustainable disaster recovery processes.

J	Macintosh, A; Steerners, K				Macintosh, A; Steerners, K			Ventilation strategies for urban housing: lessons from a PoE case study	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Coin Street (London); heat recovery; Iroko housing; occupant behaviour; occupant control; urban housing; ventilation	ASSESSING BUILDING PERFORMANCE	Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery is still not widely used in UK housing, but with insulation and air-tightness standards becoming increasingly strict, it is likely to become more common. Operable windows are almost a given for housing and the UK climate is rarely extreme enough to restrict people's use of those windows for natural ventilation. This is a potential problem for the use of heat-recovery systems and could greatly reduce their energy efficiency. The paper takes the Iroko housing scheme at Coin Street, London, as a post-occupancy evaluation (PoE) case study to investigate the questions raised with respect to how well the occupants of the houses cope with balancing both natural ventilation and mechanical systems to achieve thermal comfort energy efficiently. First. the optimum balance of mechanical and natural ventilation is estimated and used to determine the maximum potential saving it could give when compared with natural ventilation alone. Short-term monitoring of the building in question together with the results of questionnaires showed why this theoretical balance is not achieved and that the energy consumption is likely to be worse than for natural ventilation alone. Noise, perceived control, perceived freshness and misunderstanding are all discussed as possible causes for the apparent disjunction. Misunderstanding on the part of residents was shown to be a critical determinant, so information about the heat recovery system was distributed to the residents and the paper ends by looking at what theoretical energy savings might be made as a result of this act.

Thus, predicting the colonization progress of algae can be helpful to establish appropriate schedules and methods of building maintenance. This research investigates a machine learning solution for estimating algal colonization growth on mortar surfaces that relies on an artificial neural network (ANN). A data set of 539 experimental data samples has been collected to construct the proposed approaches. The cross-validation process reveals that the ANN has achieved an outstanding prediction performance with the correlation of determination (R2)=0.91 and the root-mean square error (RMSE)=5.69.

J	Yu, JY; Ma, GX; Jiang, XY				Yu, Jingyu; Ma, Guixia; Jiang, Xiaoyan			Impact of the built environment and care services within rural nursing homes in China on quality of life for elderly residents	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Project management; Questionaire survey; International practice	LONG-TERM-CARE; INDOOR ENVIRONMENT; DESIGN; FACILITIES; COMPONENTS; EXPOSURE	Purpose - The ageing of rural Chinese populations is challenging health and social policy, driving growth in rural nursing homes. Living environment plays a role in enhancing elderly quality of life (QoL), however, the impact of the built environment and care services are under-studied. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the built environment and care services on the QoL of elderly people within rural nursing homes in China. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 242 residents of nursing home were surveyed, of which 76 percent were male and 24 percent were female. In total, 25.6 percent were aged between 60 and 69, 40.1 percent between 70 and 79, 31 percent between 80 and 89, and 3.3 percent were 90 or above. Quantitative data were analyzed through factor analysis, reliability test and multiple regression modeling. Findings - The authors identified six built environment factors (room distance, space, barrier-free design, indoor environment, fire safety, and support facilities) and three services factors (i.e. daily care services, cleaning services, and healthcare services). QoL was measured over four dimensions: QoL, physical health, psychological health, and social relationships. Elderly QoL could be accurately predicted from room distance, space, barrier-free design, indoor environment, daily care services, and cleaning services. Practical implications - Interventions in design of the built environment and the provision of care services are proposed, including dimensions of living space, heating, and provisions for qualified care providers. Originality/value - This paper provides a clear picture about elderly special requirements on their built environment and healthcare services, helping architects, engineers and facilities managers understand elderly needs and improve built environment during design and operation stages.

The use of these green building measures often improves the environmental and social performances of housing units; however they can increase their initial cost and life cycle cost This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model that is capable of optimizing housing design and construction decisions in order to generate optimal/near-optimal tradeoffs among the three sustainability objectives of maximizing the operational environmental performance of housing units, maximizing the social quality of life for their residents, and minimizing their life cycle cost The model is designed as a multi-objective genetic algorithm to provide the capability of optimizing multiple housing objectives and criteria that include minimizing carbon footprint and water usage during housing operational phase, maximizing thermal comfort, enhancing indoor air and lighting quality, improving neighborhood quality, and minimizing life cycle cost An application example is analyzed to illustrate the use of the developed model and evaluate its performance. The results of this analysis illustrate the novel capabilities of the model in generating 210 near-optimal tradeoff solutions for the analyzed housing example, where each represents an optimal/near-optimal and unique tradeoff among the aforementioned three sustainability optimization objectives of maximizing the operational environmental performance of housing units, maximizing the social quality of life for their residents, and minimizing their life cycle cost These novel capabilities of the developed model are expected to improve the design and construction of housing units and maximize their overall sustainability.

MULTICRITERIA VERBAL ANALYSIS OF TERRITORY PLANNING SYSTEM'S MODELS FROM LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						territory planning; sustainable urban development; multicriteria verbal analysis; decision-making person (DM)		The process of compiling the documents (plans) of territory planning is a complicated task, requiring much time, effort, knowledge and skills. Therefore, the factors influencing territory planning should be defined and their role in developing a general spatial concept, stating the priorities in land use, environment protection, monument preservation, the use of forests and water, as well as in the development of residential and industrial areas, infrastructure, the regulation of the employment of residents and the activities of natural and juridical persons, should be determined. The main principles of territory planning at state level in Lithuania, Poland and Germany are considered. The paper aims to analyse the models of territory planning used in Lithuania, Poland and Germany and to define key criteria influencing this process in the considered countries. The models analysed are compared using a multicriteria method of verbal analysis (UniCom-BOS).

A traditional view considers the processes in place to take the knowledge resident in a team and effectively share it with other members. Newer perspectives require conditions of shared models and understanding among the team members to effectively employ the dispersed information to develop successful systems. A model of teamwork mental models is presented to explore both perspectives so that the importance of both process and shared models is represented. A sample of system developers provides the data to test the model. Results show that team building activities can promote both aspects, yielding a greater chance for a quality team effort.

Interviews on occupant changes in Finnish single-family houses with a focus on heating arrangements and thermal comfort reveal that practice formation in and around occupant changes is a complex process of aligning elements where the house stands out as a coordinative and coordinated aggregate. As houses pass from one set of occupants to the next, they carry practices and delineate new ways of operation to the new occupants. The study demonstrates the temporal unfolding of the hidden complexity to what seems like a straightforward process of residents interacting with a new heating system and home. The findings contribute to the understanding of the domestic sphere as a space for practice formation.

This paper examines why building owners are reluctant to adopt measures to reduce earthquake losses despite advancement in seismic design methods and the enactment of intervening legislative frameworks. A case study approach revealed the socio-behavioural barriers affecting seismic retrofit implementation. Significant barriers identified included the perception of earthquake risks, a lack of trust in seismic strengthening techniques and a lack of support for pro-social mitigation behaviours from public authorities. The findings suggest that a reappraisal of the policy implementation approach used by government agencies is required, and that greater attention should be given to seismic designs recommended by professionals and approved by regulatory authorities in order to earn building owners' trust regarding the efficacy of earthquake risk-reduction measures.

The individually focused findings are structured into a set of practical design parameters driven by three overarching needs-driven design principles: manageable cognitive load, clear sequencing and appropriate level of stimulation. These needs are contextualized within a general model that suggests that action in any one area (such as the built environment) also has to take into account other key dimensions, namely any support from the caring/social environment and any pharmacological treatment. Addressing these elements holistically should maximize the opportunity to improve the quality of life of the individual. This paper, however, explicitly focuses on the built environment.

At present, however, they are inadequately documented and understood, as well as being highly variable. In this paper, we propose a use-phase memory model for residential buildings, whose aim is to store energy consumption and usage patterns. This storage can be done automatically or voluntarily. We give examples of useful information extracted from the data captured. The objective of this data analysis and synthesis is to provide building experts two specific use-cases: designing a new sustainable building, and renovating an existing one. Our model is deployed on a residential building, integrating the beneficial services for all stakeholders to demonstrate a sustainable relationship between designers, the residential building and the users.

For structural engineers, the most effective approach to control the wind-induced responses of high-rise buildings would be to control the stiffness or natural frequency of the building. This paper presents a practical design model to control the wind-induced responses of a high-rise building. In the model, the stiffness of a high-rise building is maximized to increase the natural frequency of the building by the resizing algorithm. The proposed design model is applied to control the wind-induced vibration of an actual 37-storey building during the initial stage of its structural design.

Monitoring usually provides context (e.g. differences in performing practices) for more prominent qualitative enquiry. The potential of building monitoring is investigated for studying the performance of domestic practices. A Passivhaus development is examined for its applicability. Monitoring data include temperature, humidity, CO2 and electricity sub-metering. These data provide a good basis for investigating how technologies relate to the other elements (influences) of practice in shaping everyday life. The benefits and limitations of integrating monitoring with qualitative data are considered (e.g. residents' enthusiasm for co-investigating monitoring data; monitoring data having insufficient richness without accompanying qualitative data). Monitoring and qualitative data are shown to be complementary, and capable of producing insights beyond those of non-integrated approaches. Building monitoring can be further utilized in researching practices, particularly when considering the everyday implications of technological changes.

Therefore, research on permeable pavement, with the goal of reducing runoff, has been growing in popularity. This study uses experimental and numerical approaches in the hydrologic design of a permeable-pavement system. The concepts of fluid flow are used to represent water flow in permeable media, and a numerical analysis is used to solve the differential equation. Thickness and porosity are the main variables in the simulation. Using a time-space model, the study finds that varying these factors has a significant effect on the characteristics of water discharge, which is illustrated using a cumulative hydrograph. The relationship between base layer properties and the initial flow delay is linear while that between storage capacity and water loss is nonlinear. Finally, a mathematical function is generated from simulation results that represent the water flow conditions, given various base layer properties of the permeable-pavement system, and can be used as a predictive function.

Although people's living quality improves and transportation needs increase, the environmental quality is destroyed with rapid economic and traffic growth. The concept of traffic assignment, an important procedure for transportation planning, should take all needs into consideration. Based on the viewpoints of all constituencies, this paper attempts to determine optimal flow patterns using three objectives-total travel time for road users, air pollution for nonusers (such as community residents), and travel distance for government-to formulate an effective multiobjective model for traffic assignment. By using multiobjective decision making and nonlinear programming techniques, a series of noninferior solutions is generated. By combining an eigenvector weighting method with pairwise comparison, we obtain a compromise solution for the flow pattern. An application case for the Taipei network system is also presented and discussed. The results show that if other nontraffic related factors are taken into account, the multiobjective traffic-assignment approach is more reasonable and suitable than conventional approaches.

However, the EU members that have an extensive Soviet heritage now face a great difficulty in reducing energy consumption. Since many apartment buildings are in especially poor thermal condition, and the heat supply infrastructure is morally and physically outdated, energy consumption for heating is significant. The modernization (renovation) of such old buildings is impeded not only by legal and technical factors, but also financial and social aspects in regard to the residents. Thus, this paper provides new model of investments and modernization of apartment buildings on the basis of the calculation of energy input per one degree-day of the heated floor area. The presented degree-days calculation method enables the calculation and inter-comparison of data gathered in all European Union member states without taking into account specific climate parameters of each.

However, little is known about the potential health benefits of high-quality housing in poor neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods with unexpectedly good health outcomes despite high levels of deprivation have been deemed resilient places and housing quality in these areas may be a contributor to this resilience. This study aimed to evaluate whether an indicator of neighbourhood housing quality was associated with a previously quantified resilience index (RINZ) in New Zealand. It was found that areas with high housing quality tended to have higher median income, greater proportions of partnered people and shorter-term residents, and very low proportions of Maori. A positive association was found between housing quality and resilience, after adjustment for deprivation. There was no indication of differences by heterogeneity in housing quality within the aggregate unit of analysis. These findings pose the hypothesis that improving housing quality in similarly deprived areas that have poor health outcomes could potentially boost health. To extend this understanding, further development of a more sophisticated housing quality indicator is recommended.

J	SAMUELS, AF				SAMUELS, AF			CONSTRUCTION FACILITIES AUDIT - QUALITY SYSTEM-PERFORMANCE CONTROL	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The technical practice of the construction facilities audit is identified and described. This audit is performed by independent, experienced engineers on work under construction. Elements of the work in progress are checked at the site for compliance with project requirements, and design problems are identified that impact constructability or that may impact facility performance. The primary objective of the audit is to control and enhance the construction quality-management system. Definitions from both the construction and quality sciences are reviewed for appropriateness to the construction facility audit. The functions of the facility audit are compared with a financial-audit. An example of a construction facilities audit performed on resident engineering field offices by the Arizona Department of Transportation is presented, and the general steps are discussed. It is recommended that the construction facilities audit be used by large or ongoing construction programs. Information about actual system performance as demonstrated by the construction itself provides positive system control. Knowledge about the true results of a quality-management system is particularly important when new quality programs are being implemented.

The aim of this study was to explore how public acceptance can be affected by people's emotional responses to recycled water. In study 1, the general population was divided into four groups, clustering analysis with the intensity of various emotions was conducted, and the association between emotions and acceptance was explored. In study 2, the emotions, people's acceptance, and "objects of care" of water treatment experts were compared with those of members of the general population for further study. We found that the objects of care shortened the psychological distance between individuals and recycled water, which led people to generate specific emotions to recycled water. In a broader context, the study suggested that various emotions motivate people's behavior to accept or oppose the use of recycled water.

Previous studies have proven that board composition in organizations can be related to illegal business behaviors. By analyzing board composition data from 45 publicly listed construction companies in Taiwan, this paper provides a tool for predicting corporate misconduct (CM). A support vector machine (SVM) was used to construct such a prediction model, and a logistic regression model was used as a benchmark to assess the performance of the established SVM model. The established SVM model achieved an accuracy rate of 72.22% for predicting the occurrence of CM when applied to all observations in the sample, with a rate of 90% accuracy in predicting misconduct by companies found guilty of doing so in the sample, thus performing better than the logistic regression model. The developed model yields new insights on previous research and can guide stakeholders to reduce the risk of illegal business acts occurring in the construction industry.

Despite its booming development, there is a lack of research on how to prepare PE activities. In order to explore the factors of preparing PE activities in the construction industry, four focus groups were conducted, each including different stakeholders (e.g., PE organizers, construction professionals, interest groups, and local residents). Seven critical factors for preparing PE were identified into 3 main dimensions: (1) social (e.g., governmental support and bottom-up consultation approaches); (2) project (e.g., project characteristics, PE program, and project information and publicity); and (3) stakeholder (e.g., stakeholder identification and representative sampling). Based on the results of focus groups, we propose several practical recommendations to stimulate active engagement and improve performance of PE activities, including developing PE guidelines, preparing project information with appropriate language and formatting, and establishing stakeholder identification methods.

However, as social consciousness and personal welfare demands increase, social conflicts among external stakeholders, such as local residents, local and central governments, and NGOs, have become more critical factors in enhancing project viability. In Korea, these conflicts have an impact of US $70 billion annually on social costs. To alleviate social conflicts and costs, this study aims to propose a conflict management framework based on twenty-two representative public construction projects. This study identifies and frames the various causes, impacts, and resolutions of conflicts through the case history of project viability. Through these findings, five types of conflict scenarios were derived: project termination, early mitigation, late mitigation, project enforcement, and late occurrence. Furthermore, this study suggests root causes, pathway of conflict propagation, and characteristics of each conflict scenario, which will assist project stakeholders in developing sustainable management for conflict solutions in line with each project's unique situation.

To overcome these issues, construction engineers have worked diligently to develop low-noise and low-vibration pile driving methods. One such method, involving noise-free and vibration-free pretensioned spun high-strength concrete (PHC) screw piles, is proposed in this paper. This pile driving method penetrates the ground by rotating and compressing the pile to minimize noise and vibration in addition to maximizing capacity. A noise-free and vibration-free PHC screw pile prototype, the first of its kind, was manufactured and subjected to two pilot tests to determine its production and construction requirements in addition to its performance. In pilot tests, the new noise-free and vibration-free PHC screw pile driving method was found to successfully reduce noise and vibration compared with pile driving involving conventional piles.

Construction noise is one of the most prevalent stressors to the public, especially for residents near worksites. Many academic and practical studies have been conducted to address such noise-related problems. However, conventional approaches typically focus on monitoring noise and experts' judgment; they are limited at evaluating the degree of risk caused by noise. This paper proposes a model for determining the noise-induced risk, with the severity based on the predicted noise level from a Monte Carlo simulation and the occurrence probability of the noise exceeding a certain limit. Case studies were conducted to confirm the applicability of the model. The results indicate the crucial period that needs to be carefully managed, which is more applicable to determining the noise-induced risk compared to existing approaches.

J	Singh, A; Jampel, G				Singh, Amarjit; Jampel, Gempo			Leadership Flexibility Space	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decision making; Information sharing; Consultative autocrat; Active manager		A model is proposed for evaluating leadership capability, which is observed on a grid called the leadership flexibility space. Questionnaires were prepared and responses were received from engineers of the Public Works Department (PWD) for an applied study of their organization. The model evaluates two basic parameters: (I) decision making capability and (2) information input by group during decision making. Five types of leaders are evaluated: consultative autocrats, complete autocrats, consensus managers, impoverished managers, and active managers. Results showed that 70% of resident engineers/area engineers and over 46% of project engineers could be categorized as falling in the impoverished manager's zone. These percentages might be slightly reduced if certain gray areas are granted to the zones; however, any such impact is not significant. Demographic evaluations are made for age group, number of projects handled in one's career, number of projects handled at PWD, years of experience, years with PWD, years of design experience, marital status, and family encouragement. Among other findings, it was discovered that older engineers, and those who had handled more than 20 projects at PWD, tended to fall in the impoverished manager's zone more than other engineers. Remedial measures are suggested.

To obtain valuable insights, a qualitative research study was conducted on Dutch smart city projects. Fifteen cities responded to the invitation to participate. By mutual agreement, twelve projects were selected since they met the requirements for the research. Fourteen smart city professionals completed a questionnaire and were interviewed. The acquired data were analysed by the template analysis method. The results of this study contribute to the theory of the strategic orientation of organizations and the theory of co-creation. We found that the goal orientation and motivation of individuals were critical, and therefore these aspects were included in this research. As such, we would encourage managerial practices to analyse the impact of the strategic orientation of all actors. Once the challenges in multiparty co-creation are overcome, the effectiveness of creating solutions for societal challenges will improve. This will foster and improve the liveability of cities for residents and speed progress on various societal aspects.	[Akterujjaman, S.

J	Gibberd, J				Gibberd, Jeremy			Measuring capability for sustainability: the Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST)	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						net-positive; built environment; sustainable buildings; sustainability indicators; sustainability; neighbourhood; building assessment systems; sustainability criteria		An alternative approach to conceptualizing and measuring the built environment is developed which forms the basis of a new assessment tool. The role of buildings is reframed to consider what capabilities for sustainability a building can provide to the inhabitants and local community. This capability to support sustainability is defined as the ability to improve the local quality of life (Human Development Index) whilst remaining below the environmental carrying capacity (environmental footprint). This approach has clear implications about the role of buildings in enabling residents and users to achieve these targets and outcomes. This shifts the focus of net-positive development toward configurations and characteristics of the built environment that are appropriate for a particular context. A Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST) is presented that defines and assesses these configurations and characteristics. Assessments can be conducted by measuring the extent to which required configurations and characteristics exist (i.e. 'the capability of the built environment to support sustainability'). BEST is compared with other green building rating tool approaches in order to review the methodology critically and to evaluate this as a means of improving built environment sustainability performance.

The lack of access to infrastructure systems combined with poor housing conditions has resulted in excessively high cost of electricity and heating and cooking gas for colonia residents. The efficacy of a passive solar (PS) housing system in reducing home energy consumption and expenses in colonias has been evaluated using empirical data. The system is implemented in the Tierra Madre colonia in southern New Mexico and consists of PS housing design (orientation and windows), PS water heater, straw bale exterior walls, foundation insulation, and careful construction inspection for energy efficiency. Statistical and economic analyses of two years worth of monthly electricity and liquid propane gas bills (January 2005 to February 2007) from Tierra Madre and a directly adjacent conventional colonia (Sunland Park) showed that this system can be effective in reducing home energy consumption and cost. On average, a Tierra Madre house saves 5.868 million Btus every year compared to a Sunland Park house (representing 25% reduction in home energy consumption and a saving of $194.28 per house per year). The payback period for the Tierra Madre PS system (which is estimated to cost an extra $1,730 per house) is 10.5 years.

Based on six UK case studies, the care home setting is investigated for how owners, managers and staff understand thermal needs and how their management of thermal comfort is shaped. The core function of good quality care is understood as closely related to the provision of thermal comfort. The association between old and cold' and the obligations that follow for the provision of care are deeply entrenched in activities: such as the provision of hot drinks, use of blankets and the non-stop operation of heating systems. The responsibility for the provision of thermal care' for residents is challenging and complicated by the diversity of people living (and working) together, their occupation of communal spaces, and the interactions between the means of providing thermal comfort and physical safety. The wider implications are identified for the uptake of sustainable technology, patterns of thermal-related vulnerability and, most significantly, for how the ethics, agency and relationality of thermal care provision are to be understood. Future research needs and directions are considered.

This is particularly important in cases where policies require the application of new technologies. An example of such a policy is the requirement to install apartment-level water meters with the purpose of enabling fair invoicing and the saving of water. Economic incentives are expected to fulfil the objectives. In Finland, professional housing managers provide expert services that are crucial for implementing the policy requirements on metering in buildings. In this, they become middle actors between policy, technology, residents and their practices. In this study, the role of housing managers and their relationship to the different rationales that are used to justify decisions on apartment-level water metering is explored. The study shows that, although housing managers emphasize economic aspects, they also recognize technological and equity aspects. This raises questions of how middle actors should be considered in developing policies for sustainable housing. The results suggest that progress could be made by recognizing them in policy development and by raising their awareness as true intermediaries in advancing wider sustainability goals.

J	Machline, E; Pearlmutter, D; Schwartz, M				Machline, Elise; Pearlmutter, David; Schwartz, Moshe			Parisian eco-districts: low energy and affordable housing?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						affordable housing; communities; eco-neighbourhood; gentrification; public policy; social diversity; social housing; urban politics; France		This paper examines how policies and practices for affordable housing in Paris, especially green' housing for the poor, are being subverted to retain or attract the middle class: the greentrification' of lower-class neighbourhoods. From the 1960s onward, many middle- and working-class households have left Paris due to de-industrialization and the city's high housing costs. To bring these middle classes back, the municipality initiated a policy calling for increased social diversity, using social housing as its main policy tool. In France the provision of public housing is legally mandated, and compared with international standards, the income ceilings for gaining access to it are high. Thus, municipalities may pursue urban renovation and construct social housing for the middle class to replace substandard buildings occupied by low-income populations. The Paris municipality has established green' residential eco-districts known as eco-quartiers'. In the national eco-district programme, the neighbourhoods must meet environmental performance criteria, show potential for economic development, and provide social and functional diversity. Thus, housing location and price must fit the needs of the existing residents. However, most green' subsidized housing in Paris is for the middle class. Social diversity has become a means of redistribution: more middle class and fewer poor people.

J	Eker, S; Zimmermann, N; Carnohan, S; Davies, M				Eker, Sibel; Zimmermann, Nici; Carnohan, Shane; Davies, Mike			Participatory system dynamics modelling for housing, energy and wellbeing interactions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy efficiency; housing policy; public policy; simulation modelling; stakeholder participation; system dynamics; wellbeing	UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; RESIDENTIAL SECTOR; BUILDINGS RESEARCH; EFFICIENCY SCHEME; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; DECISION-SUPPORT; CO2 EMISSIONS; UK; POLICY; CONSTRUCTION	The built environment is a key target of decarbonization policies. However, such policies often have a narrow objective and narrow focus, resulting in policy-resistance' and unintended consequences. The literature attributes these unintended consequences to a narrow financial focus, adverse incentives, and inadequate handling of knowledge, skills, communication and feedback gaps, but it provides little advice on how these complex interactions can be captured. This paper illustrates the development and application of an integrated approach to address these complex interactions with regard to housing performance, energy, communal spaces and wellbeing. In particular, it explores the dynamics created by these relationships with simulation modelling in participatory settings, and with a diverse group of stakeholders. The simulation results suggest that monitoring is key to improve the performance of the housing stock besides energy efficiency; and investments in communal spaces positively affect the adoption of energy-efficiency measures and the wellbeing of residents. The evaluation results for participatory workshops show this approach was found useful by the stakeholders for supporting more integrated decision-making about housing. In future research, this approach can be implemented for policy problems in specific contexts.

This need is more critical when guidance is needed to locate people or objects that need immediate attention. For example, an inexperienced facility worker might need to locate a building component (e.g., leaking pipe) for repair to prevent any damage to a facility or its residents. In such situations, an approach that can help the user to reach his/her destination point (i.e., a component of interest or a specific location in a facility) based on his/her current location is desired. To provide such guidance, the location of a person needs to be determined at a given point in time. This process is known as localization. The objective of this research study is to determine the technological viability of using radio frequency identification (RFID) to support localization. To assess the capability of RFID for localization, the writers conducted multiple field tests under real operating conditions within a facility at Carnegie Mellon University. Hypothesis tests and K-nearest neighborhood algorithm were used to determine the technological feasibility of RFID to support localization. The results showed that it is possible to identify the location of a user using this approach; however, some improvements in accuracy are needed.

Urban social housing resilience to excess summer heat	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						public health; heat stress; indoor air quality; thermal comfort; resilience; overheating; climate change; housing; adaptation	INDOOR OVERHEATING RISK; LONDON DOMESTIC STOCK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; UK; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; DWELLINGS; DEMAND; EUROPE	The potential levels of exposure to indoor overheating in an urban environment are assessed for vulnerable social housing residents. Particular focus is given to the synergistic effects between summertime ventilation behaviour, indoor temperature and air pollutant concentration in relation to energy retrofit and climate change. Three different types of social housing are investigated (1900s' low-rise, 1950s' mid-rise and 1960s' high-rise). The case study dwellings are located in Central London and occupied by vulnerable individuals (elderly and/or people suffering from ill-health or mobility impairment). Indoor temperature monitoring suggests that occupants are already exposed to some degree of overheating; the highest levels of overheating occur in 1960s' high-rise tower blocks. The thermal and airflow performance simulation of a mid-floor flat in the 1960s' block under the current and projected future climate indicates that improved natural ventilation strategies may reduce overheating risk to a certain extent, with night cooling and shading being slightly more effective than all-day rapid ventilation. However, their potential may be limited in future due to high external temperatures and the undesired ingress of outdoor pollutants. This highlights the need for the development of combined strategies aiming to achieve both indoor thermal comfort and air quality.

This paper examines the magnitude, causes, preparedness and remedies for addressing the risk of summertime overheating in four case study residential care and extra-care settings across the UK, spanning different building types, construction and age. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, drawing from building science and social science methods, including temperature monitoring, building surveys, and interviews with design and management teams. The findings suggest that overheating is a current and prevalent risk in the case study schemes, yet currently little awareness or preparedness exists to implement suitable and long-term adaptation strategies (e.g., external shading). There was a perception from designers to managers, that cold represents a bigger threat to older occupants' health than excessive heat. A lack of effective heat management was found across the case studies that included unwanted heat gains from the heating system, confusion in terms of responsibilities to manage indoor temperatures, and conflicts between window opening and occupant safety. Given that care settings should provide protection against risks from cold and hot weather, design, management and care practices need to become better focused towards this goal.

However, without understanding the key activities of the eco-city, its success and subsequent benefits cannot be guaranteed. The objective of this paper is to identify critical success factors (CSFs) of eco-city and analyse the inter-relationship among them. To achieve this, 19 CSFs were identified through literature review and interviews. A questionnaire-based survey is then conducted to obtain opinions from professionals. The population of this study is 372 with 108 completed and valid questionnaires received. Clear definition and targets', conflicting interests among stakeholders', residents' behaviour and awareness of environment protection and energy conservation' and management in operation stage of eco-city' were identified to be the most important factors. The five underlying CSF groupings included governance', competence and behaviour of stakeholders', knowledge and market support', plan of the city' and external environment.' The results showed the ranking of the CSFs and five underlying groupings. The findings serve not only to assist stakeholders of the eco-city to gain a better understanding of a successful development, but also serve as a useful reference for managers when adopting strategies in future for the development of eco-city projects.

Presently, there is a dearth of knowledge about how infrastructure may perform during heat waves or could contribute to social vulnerability. To understand how buildings perform in heat and potentially stress people, indoor air temperature changes when air conditioning is inaccessible are modeled for building archetypes in Los Angeles, California, and Phoenix, Arizona, when air conditioning is inaccessible is estimated. An energy simulation model is used to estimate how quickly indoor air temperature changes when building archetypes are exposed to extreme heat. Building age and geometry (which together determine the building envelope material composition) are found to be the strongest indicators of thermal envelope performance. Older neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Phoenix (often more centrally located in the metropolitan areas) are found to contain the buildings whose interiors warm the fastest, raising particular concern because these regions are also forecast to experience temperature increases. To combat infrastructure vulnerability and provide heat refuge for residents, incentives should be adopted to strategically retrofit buildings where both socially vulnerable populations reside and increasing temperatures are forecast.

This paper describes the application and evaluation of more visual energy feedback techniques (carbon mapping, thermal imaging) at different scales, alongside traditional methods (web-based energy and environmental visualization platform, home energy reports) delivered through community workshops, home visits and the internet, across six low-carbon communities in the UK. Overall, most of the feedback approaches were able to engage and raise awareness amongst the householders. Whilst carbon mapping was felt to be aimed more at community groups and local councils by providing evidence of past and future community action, displaying carbon maps at community workshops helped to show that others were also engaged in energy action. Thermal imaging was successful in engaging individual local residents through both community workshops and home visits, especially when included in the home energy reports. This stimulated discussions on future energy savings through building fabric upgrade. However, the data-driven web-based platform had limited uptake due to online log-in requirement and information overload. Such insights are useful for those involved in scaling up the deployment of energy feedback to encourage energy demand reduction.

To achieve consensus among different stakeholders, public engagement (PE) is increasingly adopted for mega development projects. However, it is really difficult to satisfy various stakeholder needs if PE is inappropriately conducted. PE has been criticized for its illogical and unsystematic processes underlying decisions. Hence, the current study aimed to explore and identify critical factors of the PE process in order to improve final performance. To achieve this aim, four focus groups were held involving different types of stakeholders (e.g.,governmental departments, construction professionals, interest groups, and local residents). PE process factors, addressed in the focus groups, fell into two main categories: logical decision-making process and team behaviors, with the latter divided into task and personal dimensions. The results of the current study were used as the first stage of a comprehensive study aimed at improving PE performance. Several practical recommendations for facilitating the PE process were also pointed out in the group discussion, such as the application of logical and systematic decision-making processes, the establishment of effective evaluation methods and frameworks for evaluation criteria, and the usage of transparent and equal discussion rules.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently.

Such deformations could threaten the lives of residents and the safety of structures. Consequently, borehole inclinometers have been used to monitor these deformations. The typically used underground inclinometers have the disadvantages of lack of durability, difficulties in measuring local inclination because of a relatively long inclinometer, loss of data due to long connecting cables, and electromagnetic interference. To overcome these disadvantages, in the present study, a wireless MEMS-based borehole inclinometer system composed of a tilt sensor module, processor module, and slave and master nodes was developed. The developed borehole inclinometer system was configured by a two tier sensor to minimize its diameter. Its field applicability was improved by minimizing the cables between the sensor and the server through the application of a long range wireless module between the computer server and master node and a short range wireless communication between the master node and sensor node. A field test was conducted to verify the applicability and data reliability of the developed wireless MEMS-based borehole inclinometer. The reliability of the proposed system has been proved by the analysis of data collected for two months at two different construction sites.

SMART-C: Developing a "Smart City" Assessment System Using Cognitive Mapping and the Choquet Integral	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Smart cities; Economics; Sustainable development; Sociology; Statistics; Business; Choquet integral (CI); cognitive mapping; smart cities; sustainability; sustainable development; multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); SMART-C		Rapid urbanization, high city population growth rates, technological development, environmental impacts, and human wellbeing in urban areas have over the years become increasingly challenging concerns. These trends are related to the complex, multiple factors to be considered when evaluating smart cities, that is, municipalities that seek to improve residents quality of life by combining new technologies and environmentally sustainable practices. The above tendencies thus add to the myriad of indicators that need to be included in smart city assessments, whose intricacy hinders related decision-making processes. Based on the principles of multiple-criteria decision analysis, this paper seeks to integrate cognitive mapping and the Choquet integral to develop an assessment system that facilitates the evaluation of smart cities, which was named SMART-C.The research includes a panel of experts on smart cities who identifies the evaluation criteria and their respective interactions. The results of a real-life application of the assessment system developed in this paper are validated both by the panel members and a representative of the Lisboa E-Nova nonprofit association of the Lisbon City Councils Environment and Energy Department. These experts confirm that the proposed evaluation system facilitates making distinctions between cities according to how fully they develop Smartness. The advantages and limitations of this assessment framework are also discussed.	[Castanho, Mariana S.] Univ Inst Lisbon, ISCTE Business Sch, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ferreira, Fernando A.

Agent-Based Model of Hosting Communities' Perceptions of Water and Wastewater Infrastructure during the German Refugee Crisis	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Displaced persons; Water infrastructure; Wastewater infrastructure; Agent-based modeling	STAKEHOLDER IMPACT ANALYSIS; PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; POPULATION-GROWTH; DISASTER; SYSTEMS; INTERDEPENDENCY; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; ATTRIBUTES; RESOURCES	In 2016, Germany received approximately 50% of the 1.2 million asylum applications in the European Union. The applicants represented a population influx of displaced people that were accommodated primarily in urban settings, creating challenges for engineers and managers who needed to meet the new water and wastewater demands of the displaced persons without disrupting services to preexisting residents. To achieve this, local authorities and engineers had to consider temporary or permanent alterations to existing water and wastewater infrastructure-changes that could provoke opposition from a hosting community, depending on their perception of the changes. In this study, a modeling framework is proposed that allows decision makers to account for hosting communities' perceptions of alternatives for providing water and wastewater infrastructure services to displaced persons. The framework uses an agent-based model that is enabled by publicly available information, a survey deployed to German communities, and interviews with stakeholders involved in the accommodation of displaced persons in Germany. Our results indicate that alternatives used by local authorities did not always align with community-supported alternatives. To minimize such misalignments, we recommend that local authorities, early on in developing infrastructure alternatives, take into account the perceptions of hosting communities. Ultimately, the proposed framework promotes the sustainable provision of water and wastewater infrastructure to displaced persons.

How Spatial and Functional Dependencies between Operations and Infrastructure Leads to Resilient Recovery	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-infrastructure; Resilience; Recovery; Geospatial; Dependency; Graph model for operational resilience; Resilience assessment platform	NETWORKS; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEMS; RESTORATION; SIMULATION; FRAMEWORK; FAILURES; RISK	A fast recovery of infrastructure functioning is important to the well-being of residents and the economy following interruption or disaster. Assessing the chances of recovery, or creating plans to enable it, is difficult due to the many interactions between components and operations. From a modeling perspective, addressing this challenging problem requires a capability for constructing representations of the dynamic interactions between elements that addresses how hazard and failure effects cascade and how recovery efforts propagate. Here, a geospatial resilience assessment platform is proposed containing a modeling approach comprising the capabilities necessary to address the challenge of urban infrastructure and operation recovery assessment and planning. It is designed to be reusable and integrate with reusable damage assessment tools such as Hazus. The approach combines a novel means to construct geospatial dependency models that can assess element-by-element recovery over time through integration with a computational recovery assessment engine called the graph model for operational resilience. A sample model and assessment that illustrates recovery time assessment of infrastructure services to the buildings of a neighborhood subject to varying infrastructure failures are provided. The case provides indications of the degree of burden on emergency management sustainment resources that may exist and how risk treatments can improve recovery times. In particular, the impact of the order of component recovery is examined in a multi-infrastructure setting.

Design/methodology/approach Indicators and factors in line with the local initial planning and design are created according to the design quality indicator framework. The important indicators and factors are screened out preliminarily with the fuzzy Delphi method and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory based analytic network process. The performances of two actual cases under similar site conditions are checked with regard to the overall residential sales rate and time on the market (TOM). Findings The result shows that the proposed model can effectively improve the sales rate, shorten the TOM and better complies with buyer design strategy demands, and thus positively correlating to economic value. Originality/value Pre-sales make possible the customized strategy of allowing future residents to participate in the housing design process. However, buyers' participation in the design process is highly limited, and developers usually determine their planning and initial residential design strategies based on experience and intuition. With the proposed approach, the initial residential design of a project can be effectively intervened, so that home users can truly participate in the design, and the residential construction service can be provided in a unique, but non-universal way.

A case study of a small development in northern Colorado used both life-cycle cost (LCC) and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) to better exemplify how this goal might be attained and also provide environmental benefits. By choosing community-scale technology (CST) for wastewater treatment application, the developer obviated the need to construct 10.46km of main sewer line needed to connect to an existing centralized wastewater treatment facility. By eliminating the need for the 10.46km main sewer line, the LCC, global warming potential from greenhouse gasses, energy use, and hazardous waste creation and disposal were reduced significantly. In the future, the use of CST in redevelopment planning for shrinking cities may have additional benefits to area residents and landowners. This work is significant to decision makers in the wastewater treatment community for two reasons. First, it provides alternatives for sewer districts to consider in the design phase of new and redevelopment projects that could impact scope, first costs, and LCC, all of which flow through to the user in a fee structure. Second, it is the first study using LCC and LCA to focus on sustainability considerations of wastewater infrastructure in shrinking cities and redevelopment applications.

Generally, a balance between these strategies often receives the support of the population insofar as that does not lead to a reduction of quality of life. In this respect, (urban) open spaces, which nowadays constitute an important element of healthy cities, are sometimes designed for optimal maintenance cost rather than quality of life. For instance, in the case of the City of Edmonton, Canada, although (approximately) 10% of the Neighborhood Structure Plan (NSP) is required to be used as parks, residents do not equally reap the benefit of this green space. In fact, the municipality encourages land developers to keep this open space in the form of large areas (usually one or two), arguing that a scattered design will increase maintenance costs. In an effort to answer this question, it is shown that even though maintenance costs of neighborhood parks increase because of a scattered design, the proximity of additional homes to open green spaces increases their values, and hence their property taxes, which cumulatively exceed the maintenance cost differential. To implement the model underlying this contribution, two methodological concepts are combined: (1) the spatial interaction index; and (2) the hedonic pricing analysis.

The current study focussed on assessing the level of thermal stress both in and outdoors towards finding measures to reduce overheating in spaces within the Savannah climatic region of Ghana through a four-stage approach. Design/methodology/approach - A four-stage approach has been used for the study; thus, a thermal comfort analysis based on physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), overheating assessment, a subjective thermal responses/evaluation of residents and a simulation effort to improve comfort. Findings - There was an indication of "moderate cold stress to slight cold stress" on the coolest day (28th December). On the warmest day (12th April), however, the indoor environment had exceedance and severity of overheating of at least 56% and 38-degree hours. The acceptable comfort range and comfort temperatures of occupants of buildings in the study area have been determined to be 25.5-33 degrees C by the thermal sensation survey. Meanwhile, the simulation showed that a 200% increase in thermal mass, exterior wall insulation and roof extension and insulation has the potential to generate a reduction of 18% in overheated hours. Originality/value - The paper unearths the flagrant disregard for thermal comfort in an attempt of "copying blindly" architecture from Southern Ghana by the affluent within the Savannah Region. Again, data provided prove that indeed human activities have worsened the plight of inhabitants through materials as well as construction methods.

Anchors of social networks, such as schools and churches, on the other hand, are perceived to be influential in housing recovery decisions. This study provides a model for indexing households' anchors of social network awareness based on publicly available data. This model uses individual-level data to develop a county-level index of anchors of social network awareness. This allows devising recovery strategies that are tailored to the needs of residents within a given county. Data were collected through an internet survey targeting New York and Louisiana, which were highly impacted by Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. The survey asked participants to draw a polygon around their perceived neighborhood area in Google Maps. Then, follow-up questions were asked to identify key anchors driving this perception. Latent class analysis (LCA) and regression revealed the existence of multiple latent classes, each corresponding to a certain demographic and socioeconomic group. Finally, a county-level index of anchors of social network awareness was developed using individual-level latent classes. This index can be used by policyholders as a decision support tool for prioritizing anchors that are deemed to be important in a given county for receiving recovery assistance, which can then lead to a more enhanced recovery.

Few of them stay around to learn from what they have done and pass on their insights to the occupants. 'Soft Landings' aims to extend the scope of service so that feedback and follow-through can become natural parts of the delivery of a project. It increases designer and constructor involvement before and after handover, and points the 'supply sided to more involvement with users and a careful assessment of building performance in use. The objective is more certainty in delivering buildings that achieve a close match between the expectations of clients and users and the predictions of the design team. A Soft Landings team (designer and builder) is resident on site during the move-in period in order to deal with emerging issues more effectively. It then monitors building use and energy performance for the first three years of occupation: identifying opportunities both for fine-tuning the building and for future projects. This process also creates a coordinated route to post-occupancy evaluation. The cost of the extra work is relatively small and can be balanced against gains from the learning process, less rework and better client references. Soft Landings does not require wide-scale revision of industry-standard documentation: a licensed Scope of Service document set can stand alongside most existing procurement processes.

J	Karamouz, M; Yaseri, K; Nazif, S				Karamouz, Mohammad; Yaseri, Korosh; Nazif, Sara			Reliability-Based Assessment of Lifecycle Cost of Urban Water Distribution Infrastructures	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Urban water infrastructure; Cost-benefit analysis; Reliability; Life span	EVOLUTIONARY MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS; BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; DESIGN	Water distribution systems, as an urban infrastructure, have an indisputable role in the productivity of a society and the quality of life of its residents. It is necessary to develop policies for evaluation of the urban infrastructure performance and determining the proper time of maintenance and rehabilitation activities to increase system productivity and expand the system's efficient performance time. In this paper, an algorithm is developed to evaluate the efficiency of urban water infrastructure performance, broken down into costs and benefits, and to determine the optimal time of water distribution network (WDN) rehabilitation using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm is examined in a real water distribution network in Iran. Considering different break scenarios, the WDN's performance within the projected performance period is simulated. The efficiency of the WDN is quantified using a reliability-based indicator, and costs and benefits of its performance are also evaluated. Based on the estimated reliability of the WDN and its calculated revenue, the actual remaining operation period of infrastructure is determined. A threshold of system revenue to costs ratio can be considered for determining the end of system life span; here 0.5 is considered. Based on the results in the case study, it can be concluded that the efficient lifetime of a WDN can be much less than its designed life span (here the efficient lifetime is 14-16 years, while the design life span is 20 years). The results of this study could be used efficiently in large water distribution networks to determine the rehabilitation time and avoiding the high costs of WDN failure.

J	Fan, C; Jiang, YC; Mostafavi, A				Fan, Chao; Jiang, Yucheng; Mostafavi, Ali			Social Sensing in Disaster City Digital Twin: Integrated Textual-Visual-Geo Framework for Situational Awareness during Built Environment Disruptions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EVENT DETECTION; MEDIA; RESILIENCE; TWITTER; INFORMATION; RISK	This paper proposed and tested an integrated textual-visual-geo framework to enhance social sensing techniques in smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Effective and efficient disaster response and recovery require reliable situational awareness regarding infrastructure disruptions and their societal impacts. Due to the rapid unfolding and evolution of events in disasters and emergencies, typical data sensing techniques (such as remote sensing and satellite images) are not sufficient to gain reliable situational awareness about disruptions that affect communities at a local scale. Social sensing enables gathering and analyzing massive user-generated data from various sources (social media, in particular) to monitor unfolding of localized events such as infrastructure disruptions and community needs. To advance social sensing methods and their integration into digital twins of cities, this study proposes an integrated framework for detecting infrastructure disruptions based on three information elements embedded in social media content: images, texts, and geo-maps. The framework consists of three main methods: a graph-based approach for detecting critical tweets, an image-ranking algorithm for selecting important images, and a kernel density estimate for estimating the geographical scales of the disruptions. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study of water release from flood control reservoirs in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The findings illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework for capturing the critical situational information and interpreting the results for situational awareness and disruption response. The proposed framework can enhance integration of social sensing elements into smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Accordingly, the proposed framework can improve the ability of community members, volunteer responders, residents, and other stakeholders in coping with built environment disruptions in disasters.

J	Meinel, G; Hecht, R; Herold, H				Meinel, Gotthard; Hecht, Robert; Herold, Hendrik			Analyzing building stock using topographic maps and GIS	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; Geographical Information System (GIS); settlement analysis; settlement structure; topographic raster maps; Germany	EXTRACTION	Building stock is an extremely cost-intensive and long-lived component of the settlement structure. Considering its importance, the information available on building stock and its development is often inadequate. Data such as the age and structure of buildings, the number of dwelling units and floors are not comprehensively available nor sufficiently processed. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents a method for the calculation of settlement structure parameters by means of a spatial disaggregation through a combination of building data obtained from topographic maps 1:25 000, block boundaries taken from authoritative digital maps, and statistical data at municipality level. The inexpensive analogue maps are available nationwide and also for earlier time slices due to defined update intervals. The maps are scanned at high resolution and geo-referenced. The building stock, which is shown interspersed with traffic, vegetation and lettering, is filtered out by means of digital image processing. Buildings are then surveyed, relations to neighbouring buildings interpreted, and the general physical structure and block boundaries classified. Density can then be calculated either for the block boundaries or a reference geometry of one's choice (e.g. regular raster cells). By combining building type with typical reference density values for floor number and building area-related dwelling and resident densities, further settlement structure parameters can be calculated. Comparing the building stock on maps representing different time slices enables the development of the built environment to be analysed. The method has been implemented as a toolbox in Geographical Information System (GIS) software ESRI ArcGIS and is intended for use as a nationwide monitoring system of settlement and open space development.

J	Kaluarachchi, Y				Kaluarachchi, Yamuna			Potential advantages in combining smart and green infrastructure over silo approaches for future cities	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						grey infrastructure; green infrastructure; smart infrastructure; smart and green combined infrastructure; smart cities; future cities	HEALTH	Cities are incorporating smart and green infrastructure components in their urban design policies, adapting existing and new infrastructure systems to integrate technological advances to mitigate extreme weather due to climate change. Research has illustrated that smart green infrastructure (SGI) provides not only climate change resilience but also many health and wellbeing benefits that improve the quality of life of citizens. With the growing demand for smart technology, a series of problems and challenges, including governance, privacy, and security, must be addressed. This paper explores the potential to transition from grey, green, or smart silos to work with nature-based solutions and smart technology to help change cities to achieve considerable environmental and socio-economic benefits. The concepts of grey, green, and smart infrastructure are presented, and the needs, benefits, and applications are investigated. Moreover, the advantages of using integrated smart, green nature-based solutions are discussed. A comprehensive literature review is undertaken with keyword searches, including journal papers, stakeholder and case study reports, and local authority action plans. The methodology adopts multimethod qualitative information review, including literature, case studies, expert interviews, and documentary analysis. Published data and information are analysed to capture the key concepts in implementing SGI systems, such as storm-water control, flood and coastal defense, urban waste management, transportation, recreation, and asset management. The paper investigates the elimination of silo approaches and the alleviation of the destructions caused by extreme weather events using these interdependent SGI systems supported by novel data-driven platforms to provide nature-based solutions to boost the health and wellbeing of the residents.

The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future.

The purpose of this study is to investigate public participation intention in the decision-making of waste incineration power (WIP) projects by examining the role of perceived corporate social responsibility (PCSR) and public knowledge (PK) based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model correlating PCSR with public participation intention was developed by using the constructs of TPB as the mediators and PK as the moderator. Drawing on structural equation modeling (SEM), the data collected from 485 local residents of the WIP projects in Jiangsu, China were analyzed to test the model. Findings Companies' CSR practice went through public attitude, subjective norm and personal norm as mediating steps towards promoting participation intention. PK positively moderated the indirect relationships between PCSR and participation intention. Moreover, attitude, subjective norm and personal norm were found to have a positive effect on participation intention. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of public participation intention and enriches the literature relating to CSR and TPB involved in infrastructure development. In order to improve public participation intention, companies should take strategic social responsibility actions and present the benefits and moral values of the activities to the public, and as well make effort to diffuse WIP-related knowledge through interactive activities with the public. Authorities should establish social and personal value systems that praise public participation and improve their expectations of participation outcomes.

Environmental Distress and Physiological Signals: Examination of the Saliency Detection Method	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Burgeoning attention has recently been paid to measuring and assessing the effects of urban built environments on pedestrians' physiological signals (e.g., gait patterns, blood volume pulse, and electrodermal activity). Previous studies have attempted to use physiological signals obtained from naturalistic ambulatory settings to assess negative environmental stimuli (e.g., the presence of broken houses, unstable sidewalks, abandoned cars, etc.), but several unanswered questions remain regarding whether physiological signals, which include various confounding factors (e.g., noise, movement artifacts, and individual variability), can capture the impact of negative environmental stimuli on pedestrians. Additionally, our own previous research proposed a saliency detection method to capture the changes in physiological signals caused by negative environmental stimuli. However, the effect of diverse physiological signal patterns on the proposed saliency detection method is still uncertain and needs further analysis (such as analysis regarding the sensitivity of initial input data for signal segmentation, the validity of aggregation across all subjects' data, etc.). In this context, this paper aims to (1) examine the direct association between pedestrians' physiological signals and an isolated negative environmental stimulus and (2) test the use of the saliency detection method to crowdsource identification of pedestrians' environmental distress by using data sets from naturalistic ambulatory settings. The experimental and statistical results, attained from physiological signals, present distinct physiological responses to negative environmental stimuli, and the saliency detection method is also effectual in capturing prominent local patterns. We envisage that the outcome of this study will provide opportunities for advancing urban built environment assessment, especially in terms of promoting neighborhood walkability, increasing feelings of comfort and satisfaction in the urban space, and augmenting residents' quality of life.

J	Liu, JK; Li, GK				Liu, Jingkuang; Li, Guokai			Comprehensive benefit evaluation on urban village micro-transformation based on extension matter-element model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Micro-transformation; matter-element model; extenics; evaluation index; comprehensive benefit	RENEWAL PROGRAM; SUSTAINABILITY; POLICY; IMPACTS; LESSONS; PROJECT; HEALTH; TOOLS	With continuous promotion and deepening of urban renewal in China, the competent department has realized that the 'large-scale demolition and reconstruction' is not a proper reconstruction mode. Therefore, the mode of 'micro-transformation' adopted in recent years has gradually played an important role in optimizing the old urban areas and the villages in city, preserving historical and cultural architecture, inheriting the context, activating the use, realizing functional replacement and improving the living environment of the people. The extension matter-element model is used in this article to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of the urban village project under 'micro-transformation' mode. Firstly, based on the extension matter-element model, 32 evaluation index systems including five subsystems of politics, economy, culture, society and ecology have been established. Secondly, taking the micro-transformation project of Donghu New Village in Guangzhou as an example, the benefit evaluation of the project is carried out. The research results show that (1) The micro-transformation project of Donghu New Village is successful, with remarkable results in terms of ecological, political and social benefits. (2) In terms of economy, the investment effectiveness is great and the payback period is short, while the cultural benefit requires a continuous tracking survey.(3) Compared with the economic, ecological, political and cultural influences, the social benefit of the micro-transformation to the renovation project is relatively large, the correlation degree of which accounts for 25%. (4) Cultural benefit is also increasingly important to meet the spiritual needs of the residents. The overall proportion is 13.7%, and the indicators after the transformation are excellent. These findings in the article provide breakthrough points for urban renewal dilemma in Guangzhou, and have practical references for China's urbanization construction in the future.

A-RESCUE 2.0: A High-Fidelity, Parallel, Agent-Based Evacuation Simulator	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							NETWORK MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Effective evacuation of residents in hurricane-affected areas is essential in reducing the overall damage and ensuring public safety. However, traffic flow patterns in evacuation contexts is far more complex than normal traffic and is usually accompanied with severe congestion due to the presence of evacuees. In such scenarios, agent-based simulation can accurately capture evacuation traffic patterns, which can be extremely useful in evacuation management. However, existing simulators are not fully capable of simultaneously handling highly detailed household behaviors as well as large-scale traffic in evacuation contexts. In this study, we develop a parallelizable, large-scale version of A-RESCUE (an agent-based regional evacuation simulator coupled with user-enriched behavior) called A-RESCUE 2.0. Detailed household evacuation behaviors are modeled using a comprehensive decision-making module. Computation loads induced by the large number of evacuation vehicles are distributed by a parallelization scheme that involves partitioning the road network into subnetworks such that traffic updates in each subnetwork are simultaneously updated in parallel. Dynamic load balancing among different subnetworks is ensured by periodically repartitioning the network using a mutilevel graph partitioning algorithm. A predictive network-weighing scheme is developed that assigns weights (reflecting computational load) to the roads of a network based on current and predicted future network traffic loadings. An on-demand routing strategy is also developed that allows effective rerouting computation based on changing traffic patterns. A-RESCUE 2.0 is capable of representing nonevacuee background traffic, as well as uncertain events on the network like road closures. In addition, real-time monitoring of traffic patterns is made possible using a visualization module that is connected to the simulator through an efficient data communication layer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the Miami-Dade County network to validate the applicability of the developed simulator on real-world networks. Findings from experimental tests confirm that the parallelization scheme is effective in improving computational performance.

J	Soibelman, L; Kim, H				Soibelman, L; Kim, H			Data preparation process for construction knowledge generation through knowledge discovery in databases	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						data processing; databases; neural networks; construction industry; data analysis		As the construction industry is adapting to new computer technologies in terms of hardware and software, computerized construction data are becoming increasingly available. The explosive growth of many business, government, and scientific databases has begun to far outpace our ability to interpret and digest the data. Such volumes of data clearly overwhelm the traditional methods of data analysis such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries. The traditional methods can create informative reports from data, but cannot analyze the contents of those reports, A significant need exists for a new generation of techniques and tools with the ability to automatically assist humans in analyzing the mountains of data for useful knowledge. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are tools that allow identification of valid, useful, and previously unknown patterns so that the construction manager may analyze the large amount of construction project data. These technologies combine techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases. This paper presents the necessary steps such as (1) identification of problems, (2) data preparation, (3) data mining, (4) data analysis, and (5) refinement process required for the implementation of KDD. In order to test the feasibility of the proposed approach, a prototype of the KDD system was developed and tested with a construction management database, RMS (Resident Management System), provided by the U. S. Corps of Engineers. In this paper, the KDD process was applied to identify the cause(s) of construction activity delays. However, its possible applications can be extended to identify cause(s) of cost overrun and quality control/assurance among other construction problems. Predictable patterns may be revealed in construction data that were previously thought to be chaotic.

GWs can be viable in every aspect of sustainability; they provide residents of buildings with a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits. Despite this, the adoption rate of GW is still in its infancy stage, and the existing literature concerning the hindrances inhibiting GW adoption is very limited. To address these gaps, the aim of this paper is to identify and prioritize the hindrances to GW adoption in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach After identifying 17 hindrances through an in-depth review of literature, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is employed to refine the hindrances based on the local context with the help of 21 qualified experts in the field. Subsequently, Fuzzy Parsimonious Analytic Hierarchy Process (FPAHP) is exploited as a recently developed technique to prioritize the identified hindrances. Findings Results reveal that the most significant hindrances to the adoption of GW are maintenance cost, high installation cost, difficulties in maintenance, sophisticated implementation and inducement to fire. Findings call for scholars to address ways to improve GW installation practices and methods in order to eradicate the hindrances and provide lessons for policymakers, assisting them in facilitating the larger-scale adoption of GW. Originality/value Considering the dearth of studies on hindrances to the adoption of GWs, this paper provides a comprehensive outlook of the issue, providing knowledge that can be used as a building block for future scholars within the field. It also provides valuable insights for stakeholders within the construction industry about the hindrances to the adoption of GWs which could direct their efforts toward better implementation of it.

J	Shah, MN; Dixit, S; Kumar, R; Jain, R; Anand, K				Shah, Mona N.; Dixit, Saurav; Kumar, Ricken; Jain, Ratika; Anand, Kunal			Causes of delays in slum reconstruction projects in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; slum rehabilitation; risk; India; relative importance and importance index	DELIVERY; MUMBAI; CITY	Slums are densely populated areas developed without proper physical planning and where the majority of people live without basic life essentials. They pose major challenges in developing countries. During the execution of slum rehabilitation projects, resident families experience significant social and economic disruptions. A scan of extant literature reveals that most of the studies on slum reconstruction, in India, are conducted in the socio-economic and design issues. These studies are focused primarily on the evolution of slums, and the social, health, economic, infrastructure, inequality, layout and design aspects of slums. Existing literature has not revealed project management aspects of slum reconstruction projects particularly the delays that occur during the construction phase of the project. For the purpose of this study, six slum rehabilitation projects have been selected, located in the urbanized western region of India. Using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and the Importance Index (IMPI) as tools to analyse the data, key factors responsible for delays have emerged. These point directly to the issue of non-application of scientific project management techniques for these projects. Furthermore, two-step cluster analysis has been used to check the most significant predictor and to validate the findings of RII and IMPI. The findings of the study concluded that the most significant factors causing delays in slum rehabilitation projects in the four-phase of project life cycle are 'source of financing' in initiation stage, 'project scope' in planning stage, 'managing working capital' in execution stage, and 'the snag list issues related to quality not being addressed' in the close-out stage. The findings of the study are important in understanding the dominant causes for delays in slum rehabilitation projects, and to a considerable extent can be globalized, especially in countries with dense populations.

To enhance the management efficiency of the highly complex MEP system, as-built building information modeling (BIM) is increasingly adopted in the world. Currently, as-built BIMs are mostly drawn manually by modelers in BIM modeling software referring to point clouds or on-site photos, which is time consuming and labor intensive. This study presents a novel fused BIM reconstruction approach for MEP scenes. The proposed approach makes the best of the rich semantic information provided by images and accurate geometry information provided by 3D LiDAR point clouds. Firstly, a state-of-the-art deep learning model focusing on semantic segmentation is fine-tuned for the MEP dataset, and then RGB images collected with depth camera are segmented with the well-trained model. Secondly, taking the segmented images and the corresponding depth images as input, a semantic-rich 3D map is generated. Thirdly, an instance-aware component extraction algorithm in LiDAR point clouds given approximate object distribution in 3D space is developed. In the component extraction algorithm, a label transfer technique is proposed to firstly determine the rough locations of targeting objects in LiDAR point clouds. Then, accurate component locations are determined for three types of components including irregular shaped components, regular shaped components, and secondary components attached to walls. Finally, the BIM model is reconstructed based on component extraction results. To validate the proposed technique, experiments were conducted in four MEP rooms in a water treatment plant in Hong Kong. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique is more accurate and more efficient with wider range of applications compared to previous BIM reconstruction methods.	[Wang, Boyu; Cheng, Jack C.

Vibration is a commonly used method to make concrete flowable and to remove the excessive entrapped air, therefore contributing to proper concrete consolidation. To introduce vibrations to freshly placed concrete, various tools such as internal vibrators are widely used in the construction industry. Producing a dense concrete without segregation with these tools requires an experienced vibrator operator. Inexperienced vibrator operators tend to over-consolidate or under-consolidate concrete. Many of these quality problems have their roots in the lack of quality control methods that can provide real-time feedback on the quality of concrete consolidation to vibrator operators. A real-time wireless sensing-based internal vibrator tip tracking system was developed and validated in this research to support intelligent concrete consolidation operations. More specifically, the research explored the use of an ultra wideband (UWB) tracking system to realize precise localization of the tip of an internal vibrator. A series of indoor and outdoor experiments are conducted to validate and model the tracking accuracy. A novel visualization program was developed to visualize operators' vibration effort in real-time. The program is capable of displaying vibration location and time in real-time. A vibrator operator can leverage such information to visualize the distribution of his vibration effort, and spot areas that may need mitigation actions. This also provides an innovative construction inspection practice to owners and resident engineers. The new concrete consolidation tool will allow contractors to proactively address concrete consolidation issues, a problem common to many concrete construction projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The development of age-friendly communities (AFCs) has been encouraged for improving health and well-being of older adults. Hence, this study aimed to deepen the understanding of AFCs in China and to investigate the integrated relationships between AFCs and the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, using a large-scale questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hefei, China, to investigate the complicated relationships between the components of AFCs and the QoL of older adults. Ultimately, 1,383 valid questionnaires were collected from senior respondents aged more than 60 years. Several statistical methods, including reliability analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), were adopted to develop an integrated model for AFC components and the QoL of older adults. Findings Six AFC components and four older adults' QoL factors were identified. The SEM results revealed integrated relationships between specific AFC components and the QoL of older adults: (1) physical QoL was affected by outdoor spaces, public transportation, housing and community and health services; (2) psychological QoL was predicted by most of the AFC components except community and health services; and (3) environmental QoL and social QoL were both influenced by outdoor spaces, communication and information and community and health services. Practical implications In order to enhance the QoL of older adults, it is suggested that outdoor spaces need to be enlarged by fully using the facilities and playgrounds of middle schools and renovating the older buildings. The locations of public transportation stations are recommended to be revised to be within a 5-minute walking distance of senior residents. Improvements to the social environment of AFCs, by increasing the coverage of medical services and creating multiple approaches to recreational activities, are encouraged. Originality/value These findings have empirical significance for urban planners and policy-makers in regard to identifying major components of AFCs and understanding the effect of those components on the QoL of older adults.

J	Strengers, Y; Maller, C				Strengers, Yolande; Maller, Cecily			Integrating health, housing and energy policies: social practices of cooling	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptive behaviour; air-conditioning; cooling practices; energy consumption; heatwave; inhabitant behaviour; peak electricity demand; public health; thermal comfort	THERMAL COMFORT	Health, housing, and energy policies to address hot weather and heatwaves are typically based on divided 'technical' and 'behavioural' strategies and tend to be developed in isolation. This approach results in conflicting outcomes both within and across public policies, potentially leaving households more vulnerable to heat. The cooling practices of Australian householders are analysed using social practice theory to highlight inherent contradictions and tensions in current policies. A range of successful adaptive strategies is identified in participants of a dynamic peak pricing electricity programme or residents of an eco-living development without air-conditioning. The findings demonstrate how householders' ability to respond to heat is shaped by the elements of cooling practices, including common understandings about air-conditioners, practical knowledge and available housing infrastructures. There is a critical need to move towards a coordinated, multi-pronged and flexible public policy response framed around the dynamic cooling practices of households. This requires policies that prioritize and support adaptive cooling infrastructures, and that recognize, support and share householders' existing adaptive capacity to respond to heat. Les politiques de la sante, du logement et de l'energie visant a faire face aux fortes chaleurs et aux canicules se fondent en regle generale sur des strategies << techniques >> et << comportementales >> eclatees et ont tendance a etre elaborees isolement. Cette approche se traduit par des resultats contradictoires aussi bien dans le cadre meme de ces politiques publiques qu'entre celles-ci, rendant ainsi les menages potentiellement plus vulnerables a la chaleur. Les pratiques de refroidissement des occupants australiens sont analysees en utilisant la theorie des pratiques sociales pour souligner les contradictions et les tensions inherentes aux politiques actuelles. Il est identifie un eventail de strategies adaptatives concluantes chez les participants qui faisaient partie d'un programme d'ecretage dynamique des pics de consommation electrique par la tarification ou bien qui vivaient dans un lotissement ecologique sans climatisation. Les resultats obtenus montrent comment la capacite des occupants a reagir a la chaleur est influencee par les elements constitutifs des pratiques de refroidissement, au nombre desquels une comprehension commune de ce que sont les climatiseurs, les connaissances pratiques et les infrastructures de logement disponibles. Il est absolument necessaire de progresser, en termes de politiques publiques, dans le sens d'une reaction souple et coordonnee, sur plusieurs fronts, s'articulant autour des pratiques de refroidissement dynamique des logements. Ceci necessite des politiques qui donnent la priorite et apportent leur soutien aux infrastructures de refroidissement adaptatives, et qui reconnaissent, appuient et partagent la capacite adaptative existante des occupants a reagir a la chaleur.

At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And, modifications and deviations of the original building structure, equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete, obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning. To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings, buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment. Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building information as it occurs in existing buildings. We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with software modules for building information acquisition, 3D reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally. For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements. From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction information is used for optimized project planning with a solution algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) at hand. In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities. Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification, onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options. Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and will further improve the systems' quality, effectiveness and accuracy. Future research and application areas are seen in the quantification and analysis of the effects of missing data, the integration of material classification and sampling sensors into the system, the system connection to Building Information Modelling (BIM) software via a respective interface and the transfer and extension to retrofit project planning.
