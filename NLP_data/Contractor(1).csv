Chandrashekhar; Kumar, Ratnesh; Singh, Surya Prakash			Understanding the role of contractor capability in risk management: a comparative case study of two similar projects	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Case study; construction project; contractor capability; contractor prequalification; risk management	SUBWAY PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; ALLOCATION; IMPACTS; MODEL; COST	In the construction industry, contractor prequalification is used for measuring contractor capability and selecting capable contractors for the successful execution of projects. Research emphasizes that contractor capability and risk management are critical for project success and have a correlation. However, observations suggest that risks are not considered during prequalification and even prequalified contractors perform poorly causing project failures. Such observations indicate a research gap for which this research explores the role of contractor capability in risk management at the project level. The analysis uses a comparative case study of risk management in two similar ongoing projects having different contractors. It reveals that the contractor capability assessed during prequalification is an attribute of an organization; while the capability required to mitigate risks and execute work is an attribute of a project. When risks materialize, the capability of a contractor may reduce and the capability required to mitigate risks in a project may increase. This will create a deficit of resources resulting in poor performance by the contractor. Therefore, criteria for prequalification must be decided considering risks scenarios for projects and contractors to screen out marginally qualified contractors and increase chances of project success.

Cash flows largely reflect a contractor's capacity to meet its financial obligations, this study assesses the credit qualities of construction contractors by using a cash flow based credit model (CFB credit model). The model uses historical continuously free cash flow to firm of construction contractors to simulate possible future cash flow paths. The credit quality scores of construction contractors are then assessed using the CFB credit model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of assessment of the credit quality of construction contractors, and recommend the clients to adopt it in prequalification of the contractors' financial abilities.

J	Zhang, LY; Qian, QZ				Zhang, Lianying; Qian, Qinzhen			How mediated power affects opportunism in owner-contractor relationships: The role of risk perceptions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Opportunism; Power; Risk perception; Construction project; Owner-contractor relationship	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; BARGAINING POWER; TRUST; EXCHANGE; COLLABORATION; COOPERATION; COMMITMENT; ASYMMETRY; ATTITUDES; DECISION	Contractor opportunism is an obstacle to close collaboration in owner contractor relationships for construction projects. But little is known about what causes it. This study examines how the mediated power of an owner influences contractor opportunism from the risk perception perspective. Using data from 156 responses to an opinion questionnaire survey, the moderating effect of solidarity on the relationship between mediated power and risk perceptions in the owner contractor relationship is explored. The data were analyzed with Partial-Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that the relational risk perceptions and the performance risk perceptions of contractors have a positive influence on their tendency to become opportunist; while the mediated power of the owner can increase the contractor's negative perceptions of relational risks but not performance risks. High solidarity helps to weaken the positive influence of mediated power on the contractor's relational risk perceptions. These findings confirm that risk perception is an important perspective to understand why contractors behave opportunistically. In addressing this situation, owners should put themselves in the contractor's shoes to perceive what kinds of risks the contractor would face, and consider the potential impact of their own behavior to the contractor.

The number of categories depends on the clustering algorithm used. This paper presents a framework for classifying contractors using five of the most common clustering algorithms and assesses their performance with appropriate validity measures. The framework was implemented on actual data for 14 contractors working in UAE using a database of 294 projects. Quantitative measures were suggested and calculated for the contractors in the database. Qualitative measures were determined using AHP. The quality of contractor's staff and equipment was deemed to be the most important measure. The results show that contractors are grouped into four categories based on the quantitative and qualitative measures identified. The Fuzzy-C means algorithm had the highest validity measures when applied to the studied data set. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to categorize contractors into different performance groups in a rational and unbiased way. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, Z; Wang, HW; Li, H				Liu, Zhi; Wang, Hongwei; Li, Heng			Model of Equipment Sharing between Contractors on Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Equipment sharing; Incentive contracting; Schedule and cost; Stackelberg game; Contractors partnering	MANAGEMENT; ALLOCATION; MECHANISM	Because of significant characteristics such as complexity and uncertainty, the construction schedules of large-scale projects are often postponed as a result of a shortage of important equipment. By sharing its own incentive reward with other contractors for acquiring extra equipment, a contractor with a lack of equipment resources can reduce time delays and even complete projects in advance. This paper focuses on analyzing onsite construction equipment sharing among contractors from different sections of the same project. First, two forms of time incentives are applied to encourage the contractors to decrease their construction duration by sharing equipment resources. Then, based on an analysis of the influence that equipment sharing has on construction duration, a Stackelberg model among the equipment-sharing contractors is developed to build the contractors' gain functions and simulate the equipment-sharing process. Finally, a numerical analysis is conducted to analyze the effect that a time incentive and construction costs have on the contractors' benefits. The results demonstrate that the incentive for a contractor needing more equipment is positively associated with the gains of both contractors, whereas the incentive for the contractor lending out equipment acts inversely. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge for understanding the process of onsite equipment sharing among contractors. By capturing the contractors' aspect of equipment sharing, this study provides a practical model to aid the client in settling resource-leveling problems rather than using traditional approaches that have been conducted from the client's perspective. This research should be beneficial for project managers to better understand how suitable incentive contracts can facilitate equipment sharing among contractors and consequently help ensure construction schedule.

This paper aims to develop a RMC assessment model for subway project contractors and to assess the current overall RMC of subway project contractors in mainland China. To achieve the objectives, a questionnaire survey was conducted and data were collected from 58 respondents. The empirical research findings showed that the overall RMC of subway project contractors can be regarded as between "low" and "medium". In addition, currently in subway projects' area, contactor's risk analysis capability is relatively more mature than other capabilities. However, contractors' risk management attitude is relatively less mature than other capabilities. Assessing the current RMC of subway project contractors can be used to identify the priority or weakest areas needed for improvement. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

However, an up-to-date systematic review of contractor selection trend is still lacking. This study aims to fill the gap by reviewing published literature from 1990 to 2019. A desktop search was conducted under the 'T/A/K (title/abstract/keyword)' in Scopus search engine where 252 papers were identified. Based on a two-phase filtering approach, which included journal relevance assessment and article relevance assessment, 137 published papers within 22 journals were used for the study. The major finding was that the questions were raised on the suitability of selection criteria for appraising contractors and it was acknowledged that, choosing appropriate contractor selection criteria are affected by other factors hence can be regarded as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem suitable for machine learning tools. A major limitation of was that, even with the 137 reviewed papers, not all contractor selection-related papers were reviewed. The outcome of the study suggests a greater involvement of practitioners in model development and stimulates future studies that delve into the development of models to aid in selecting optimal contractor selection criteria for a particular project.

Random-coefficients logistic model is used to explicitly measure the heterogeneity across contractors in terms of their (1) intrinsic bid/no-bid preferences and (2) responses to four bidding variables, i.e., number of bidders, market conditions, project type, and size. The binary bid/no-bid decisions were assumed to arise from a logistic model, but with the model parameters that varied between contractors. Data were gathered using a bidding experiment involving Hong Kong and Singapore contractors. The results show that there is significant heterogeneity across the contractors in which Hong Kong contractors can be clustered into four groups of identical (statistical) behavior in response to the four bidding variables, whereas in Singapore, there are only three groups as determined by the underlying heterogeneity distribution. This probabilistic classification of contractors has implications for contractors' competitive strategies by targeting different groups of competitors toward maximum competitiveness.

Contractor prequalification is essential in most construction projects.. and the process has been performed by many different methods in practice. In most studies of contractor selection, selection criteria are assumed to be independent of each other. However, these criteria are likely to affect each other. The main purpose of this paper is to show how the graph theory and matrix methods may be served as a decision analysis tool for contractor selection-which is more suitable to be employed in this interdependent relationship framework. This method can be used as a decision support system by project owners in order to identify an eligible contractor to be awarded the contract. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

A total of 31 clients' tender evaluation criteria were selected to develop a LR model for predicting contractor performance. The proposed model was developed based on 48 of United Kingdom public and private construction projects and validated in 20 independent cases. It was found that 75% of the cases correctly and the model statistically accurate for contractor performance prediction, where the input variables consist of nominal and interval data. The paper summarized techniques and advantages of LR analysis and discussed literature findings of contractor selection and evaluation methodologies undertaken by construction researchers and commentators from the United Kingdom and Northern America.			e9671210@yahoo.co.uk						60	65	66	0	28	ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS	RESTON	1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA	0733-9364	1943-7862		J CONSTR ENG M	J.

The current body of knowledge on contractor prequalification and selection through bidding focuses on the development of multiple-criteria models using decision makers' subjective judgments. Few studies have used existing data from past projects. This study presents a data-driven approach to evaluating contractors' production performance on past highway projects, a critical but rarely considered aspect of current evaluation systems. Using historical daily work report data, actual production rates were calculated for controlling activities in past projects. These rates were classified into three tiers of contractor production performance; four contractor-independent factors, which influence rates, location, project budget, weather, and quantity of work, were considered by applying classification techniques, distribution fitting, and Monte Carlo simulation. Performance indexes were proposed in order to enable comparisons. The proposed framework allows project owners to evaluate contractors more objectively and comprehensively by considering an additional but critical criterion in the existing evaluation process, that is, contractors' past production performance.

OPTIMAL OUTCOME SHARING WITH A CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						outcome sharing; consortium; contractors; risk attitude; utility function; contribution; construction contracts	MORAL HAZARD; PRINCIPAL; INCENTIVES	Where a consortium of contractors is involved, there exist no guidelines in the literature on what the outcome sharing arrangement should be. The paper addresses this shortfall. It derives the optimal outcome sharing arrangement for risk-neutral and risk-averse contractors within the consortium, and between the consortium and a risk-neutral owner. Practitioners were engaged in a designed exercise in order to validate the paper's propositions. The paper demonstrates that, at the optimum: the proportion of outcome sharing among contractors with the same risk-attitude should reflect the levels of their contributions; the proportion of outcome sharing among contractors with the same level of contribution should be lower for contractors with higher levels of risk aversion; a consortium of risk-neutral contractors should receive or bear any favourable or adverse project outcome respectively; and the proportion of outcome sharing to a consortium of risk-averse contractors should reduce, and the fixed component of the consortium fee should increase, when the contractors become more risk-averse or the level of the project outcome uncertainty increases. The paper proposes an original solution to the optimal sharing problem in contracts with a consortium of contractors, thereby contributing to current practices in contracts management.

The objective of this study is to improve the current practices for evaluating sub-contractors performance. Drawbacks of current evaluation process are discussed firstly. The appropriateness for adopting the Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM) for improving the drawbacks is studied. A Sub-contractor Performance Evaluation Model (SPEM) is then developed by employing the EFNIM. The effectiveness of the proposed SPEM is validated by performing case study of a real general contractor. Validation results show that the proposed method accurately measures sub-contractor's performance enhancing the current practice of evaluation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Idoro, GI				Idoro, Godwin Iroroakpo y			INFLUENCE OF QUALITY PERFORMANCE ON CLIENTS' PATRONAGE OF INDIGENOUS AND EXPATRIATE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS IN NIGERIA	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						expatriate contractors; clients' patronage; indigenous contractors and quality performance	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES	Contractors operating in Nigeria are classified as either indigenous or expatriates. The latter is often giving preference over the former in the award of contracts and stakeholders consider this practice unhealthy for growth and development. This study evaluates the influence of the quality performance of the two categories of contractors on their patronage. The objectives are to determine the level and difference in the patronage and quality performance of indigenous and expatriate contractors and the correlation between clients' assessment of the quality performance and patronage of indigenous and expatriate contractors in the Nigerian construction industry. To achieve these objectives, a field survey involving a sample of 43 clients selected from the population of organised clients in Nigeria was conducted. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The data collected were analysed to determine the ranking and test of difference in clients' patronage and clients' assessment of quality performance between the two categories of contractors using mean and t-test respectively. The correlation between patronage and quality performance was analysed using Spearman correlation test. The study established that expatriate contractors are being giving preference in the award of contracts. It also established that clients perceive the quality performance of expatriate contractors to be better than that of indigenous contractors and attributed the preference in patronage to this difference. It suggested that indigenous contractors should embark on measures that will improve their quality performance in order to stop the preference for expatriate contractors.

J	Zhang, SJ; Fu, YF; Kang, F				Zhang, Sujuan; Fu, Yafan; Kang, Fei			How to foster contractors' cooperative behavior in the Chinese construction industry: Direct and interaction effects of power and contract	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractors' cooperative behavior; Owner expert power; Owner coercive power; Contract coordination; Contract control	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; SUPPLY CHAIN; RELATIONSHIP COMMITMENT; INTERFIRM COOPERATION; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; FORMAL CONTRACTS; MEDIATING ROLES; TRUST; OPPORTUNISM; PERFORMANCE	To ensure and improve contractors' cooperative behavior is a critical issue facing project owners in the construction industry. On the Chinese construction projects, it is common for project owners to execute power to indicate their position and ensure contractors' behavior. Meanwhile, a contract plays a crucial role in reducing opportunism and fostering contractors' cooperative behavior. Based on the power and contract literature, this paper aims to explore the direct and interaction roles of owner power and contract mechanisms particularly owner expert and coercive power as well as contract control and coordination functions in improving contractors' cooperative behavior. We also adopted two dimensions of cooperative behavior, namely in-role and extra-role behavior. A questionnaire survey was employed and data were collected from employees in the Chinese construction industry. We analyzed the data and compared the results between project owners and contractors. Data analyses show that 1) project contractors and owners perceive different levels of owners' expert power, contractors' in-role and extra-role behavior; 2) from the contractors' view, owners' expert power and contract coordination have positive influences on contractors' in-role behavior; owners' coercive power, expert power, and contract coordination positively affect contractors' extra-role behavior, while contract control plays a negative role; 3) contract control and coordination do play moderating roles on the relationship between expert power and contractors' cooperative behavior. These findings are interpreted in light of the Chinese culture and suggestions are provided regarding how project owners could exercise power and contract to foster cooperation with their contractors.

The performance of construction projects will be adversely affected if the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are not properly managed. Therefore, the relationships between main contractors and subcontractors are becoming more and more important to the success of construction projects. Based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey in the Hong Kong construction industry, the relationship between main contractors and subcontractors was studied. Main contractors in the local industry can be classified into four clusters according to the nature of their relationship with subcontractors, namely, adversarial, coopetitive, collaborative, and partnering. Furthermore, the impact of these relationships on main contractor competitiveness and the critical factors affecting collaborative/partnering relationships and main contractor competitiveness were also explored. The findings of this research reveal that good relationships with subcontractors are positively and advantageously associated with main contractor competitiveness. A long-term partnering relationship, based on win-win principles, is more likely to benefit both parties in construction practice. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Competitive positioning and market selection have a significant influence on contractors' development of their international sectors. This study establishes quantitative approaches for estimating the competitive position of contractors between different periods and in different sectors. The location quotient is adopted to evaluate the agglomeration level of contractors in different construction industries. The diversified changes of contractor clusters in nine different industries from 13 countries collected from the ENR are analyzed to highlight the differences in their agglomeration levels from 2009 to 2013. A competitive position matrix model is presented for international contractors in the global market as the location quotient and competitive position matrix, as novel assessment methods are effective in quantitatively analyzing the difference in agglomeration levels between typical contractor groups and the competitive statements of international contractors. Contractors can benefit from the proposed approaches as an aid to understanding their competitive position and developing appropriate strategies in the overseas arena.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 375 valid data entries from managers representing 375 mega-projects were analyzed through path analysis. Findings Both formal and informal HGs exert positive effects on the performance of mega-projects. While formal HG positively affects contractor perfunctory behavior and contractor consummate behavior, informal HG affects contractor perfunctory behavior only. Contractor behavior mediates the relationship between formal HG and project performance. Research limitations/implications The impacts of potential moderators (e.g. institutional arrangement and complexity) on the relationship between HG and contractor behavior have not been considered in this study. Practical implications This study is useful for owners to enhance formal HG to improve contractor perfunctory and consummate behaviors, which in turn can enhance the performance of mega-projects. Originality/value This study expands the knowledge of mega-project performance management from the perspective of HG. It also contributes to the literature of contractor behavior within the context of mega-projects.

A contractor's safety performance is still not a major selection criterion, despite the existence of numerous safety prequalification methods. The negative repercussions of such apathy create a critical need for systems that enable owners to evaluate contractor safety performance and facilitate the selection of safety-conscious contractors by virtue of their good safety practices. This study presents the development of a computerized platform for evaluating contractor safety performance that is capable of analyzing contractors' safety performance data. The platform incorporates newly developed parameters that enable (1) including leading and lagging safety indicators that depict current and past contractor safety performance; (2) conducting analysis on both the organizational and project levels; and (3) satisfying the requirements of international safety standards. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by presenting a validated standard-compliant set of 10 indicators and 71 metrics that facilitate evaluating contractor safety performance and establishing their significance analytically. This should prove useful to decision makers and researchers alike and is a step forward to facilitate including contractor safety performance among major selection criteria, which can ultimately bring significant improvements to the building industry's safety.

Research in this area has focused on decision making in PDSs. However, project success depends not only on the science of choosing a PDS but also, to a large extent, on the degree of contractor adaptation to the chosen delivery system or the degree to which the contractor characteristics match the PDS. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the key contractor characteristic factors that affect project success under different PDSs by collecting data on these delivery systems from previously completed projects that adopt and track the characteristics of contractors involved in these projects. A total of 12 contractor characteristic factors that affect project success under different PDSs were obtained via a literature review. Next, according to 73 research samples from successful projects in China that adopted different PDSs selected from questionnaires, the key contractor characteristics factors that affect project success under different PDSs were explored using rough set model. The findings indicate that a contractor's coordination and communications, a contractor's experience with similar types of projects, a contractor's ability in financial management, and a contractor's design capability are the four most key factors for project success under different PDSs. This study provides theoretical support for the owner in selecting a project PDS and also provides a theoretical basis on which the owner can select qualified contractors according to the chosen PDS.

J	Xia, NN; Guo, JL; Lin, YH				Xia, Nini; Guo, Jiale; Lin, Yi-Hsin			Managing stakeholder attributes for risk mitigation: evidence from construction project contractors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Management of risks; Stakeholder management; Construction projects	FIT INDEXES; MANAGEMENT; ALLOCATION; PERFORMANCE; SALIENCE; PERCEPTIONS; RECIPROCITY; BEHAVIOR; TRUST	Purpose Previous studies have proposed that correctly managing stakeholders with certain attributes can benefit project management; however, robust theoretical elaborations and empirical investigations of this topic have been lacking. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the effects of two stakeholder attributes - contractor-perceived contractor salience and contractor project position - on the criticality of five typical contractor-related risks: risk of (1) injuries and accidents, (2) quality defects, (3) work delays, (4) cost overruns and (5) breaches of contract. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire data were collected from 118 Chinese contractor managers. Regression models were run in Mplus 7.11 to test the hypotheses. Findings The data show that higher contractor-perceived contractor salience and a more supportive contractor project position were both related to lower criticality of contractor-related risks, including risk of (1) injuries and accidents, (2) quality defects, (3) work delays, (4) cost overruns and (5) breaches of contract. Contractor salience also mediated the negative relationship between a supportive contractor project position and the criticality of contractor-related risks. Research limitations/implications The authors' research design is cross-sectional and thus cannot establish causation in the relationships among the studied variables. The single item measure of contractor project position was used for the first time in the present study; thus, its reliability and validity still await more empirical examinations. Originality/value The findings advance the understanding of the value of stakeholder management in projects by specifying that prioritizing stakeholders' claims and securing their support for the project reduce the criticality of stakeholder-related risks. By providing empirical evidence from the construction context, the findings also add to knowledge on the instrumental power of stakeholder management in enhancing project risk management performance.

As an approach to multi-criteria decision-making, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is explored to determine whether the traditional AHP (consistency ratio 0.1) and the weakly consistent AHP (consistency ratio 0.5-0.1), currently used for contractor selection, produce the same result. A case study comparing both methods reveals that the top-ranked contractor was the same while the ranking of the remaining contractors were different. Because choosing the right contractor can mean the difference between project success and failure, the consistency rule for the traditional AHP should be used for contractor selection, and not the weakly consistent AHP, especially as inconsistency increases random outcomes. This finding becomes important if the first-choice contractor opts out of a contract or is terminated by the client and a suitable second choice must be made from the original bids.

J	Ma, DY; Li, XD; Cheng, C				Ma, Dingyuan; Li, Xiaodong; Cheng, Chen			THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARD APPLICATION CAPABILITY ON CONTRACTORS' COMPETITIVENESS: CHINESE CONTRACTORS' EXPERIENCE	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						international construction standards; application capability; contractors' competitiveness; structural equation modelling; international construction market; international competitiveness	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATION QUESTIONNAIRE DLOQ; TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; LEARNING CAPABILITY; PROJECT PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; COMPETENCE; DIMENSIONS	The application capability of international construction standards (ICS) has become a necessary element for the success of contractors in the international market. However, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of the impact of ICS application capability on contractors' competitiveness. This paper aims to explore the driving paths between them. The authors divided the competitiveness indicators into market performance indicators and image performance indicators and developed a standard application capability measurement scale based on five dimensions (knowledge learning, talent guarantee, technical support, relationship management and organization guarantee). Then, a structural equation model (SEM), in which project performance was regarded as a mediator variable, was established to investigate the path and intensity of ICS application capability on contractors' competitiveness. A questionnaire was distributed to the project personnel of Chinese contractors engaged in international projects, and 174 valid questionnaires were collected. The results show that 1) relationship management and technical support have a direct driving effect on the competitiveness of contractors; 2) talent guarantees and organization guarantees affect contractors' competitiveness through project performance. This study can remind contractors of the importance of the ICS application capability and the weakness of ICS application. Additionally, it will ultimately help contractors adjust their competitiveness strategies.

Although previous studies have suggested that such improper risk allocation may harm the relationship between the owner and the contractor and thus lower project performance, few have explicitly investigated the effects of risk allocation on the contractor's cooperative behavior. This paper fills this gap by empirically exploring whether, how, and when risk allocation influences the contractor's cooperative behavior. To do this, data were collected from 284 Chinese project professionals and hierarchical regression analysis was performed. The results show that pro-owner contractual terms with regard to risk allocation negatively affect the contractor's cooperative behavior, and the contractor's fairness perception partially mediates such an effect. Moreover, risk premium weakens the effect of environmental risks allocation on the contractor's fairness perception, and term specificity strengthens the effect of the contractor's fairness perception on the contractor's cooperative behavior. Theoretically, these insights extend risk allocation studies by identifying the underlying mechanism behind the relationship of risk allocation and interfirm cooperation and thus contribute to sound contractual governance. Practically, this study's findings can help project owners design better contracts, particularly by bearing in mind that risk premium should not always be used to restore the contractor's fairness perception to elicit the contractor's cooperative behavior because it does little to help when owner risks are allocated to contractors.

Selecting the right contractor for the right job can significantly influence the overall project performance. In the selection process, construction clients have to know all financial, technical and general information about the contractors to determine the most appropriate one for the project. Within this context, clients should consider several criteria that may include quality of production, adequacy of technical staff and financial stability. In this study, a survey was carried out among 52 construction professionals working at the Public Housing Development Administration (PHDA) in Turkey. The objective of this survey is to examine the relative weights of the criteria that have been using by this owner in the construction contractor selection process. Afterwards, a web-based contractor evaluation system, WEB-CONTEST, by which the contractors can be evaluated based on a combined criterion, is proposed. The system facilitates the contractor selection process and enables the construction owner to select the most correct contractors for its relevant projects.

Marketing practices of US contractors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; FIRMS	The construction industry possesses characteristics of the production and service industries. This uniqueness requires marketing practices tailored specifically to match the construction market. A questionnaire survey of 65 U.S. contractors was conducted to determine the extent to which they are implementing a modified marketing mix theory that is compatible with the construction industry. The modified marketing mix theory recommends that contractors confront marketing from five perspectives, known as the five P's of marketing: product, price, promotion, place, and people. This study showed that the five P's of marketing are used by U.S. contractors in this decreasing order: product, price, place, promotion, and people. According to the survey results, U.S. contractors allocate about 1.5% of their annual revenue to marketing, but they may be spending more than they report. There seem to be only few differences between contractors that negotiate their contracts versus contractors who competitively bid their contracts, larger versus smaller companies, and contractors with a higher success rate in getting new contract awards versus contractors with a lower success rate.

J	Alhumaidi, HM				Alhumaidi, H. M.			Construction Contractors Ranking Method Using Multiple Decision-Makers and Multiattribute Fuzzy Weighted Average	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set; Contractor selection; Multiple-attribute decision-making; Contracting	PREQUALIFICATION; MODEL; SETS; SELECTION	The contractor selection decision is important and greatly impacts the overall success of any project; therefore, there is a need for quantitative methods to help stakeholders, including owners, make better decisions about contractor selection. Although previous studies have presented different methodologies for contractor selection, the subject of contractor selection remains attractive to many researchers. This paper enhances the construction management profession by introducing a new contractor selection method that incorporates multiple decision-makers. This paper introduces a quantitative fuzzy-set method to assist in the contractor selection process by implementing multiattribute decision-making that integrates a group of decision makers. Although the preferred attributes that contribute to contractor selection are dependent on the project, the method presented in this paper can be implemented for any attributes determined important to contractor selection in a specific case. The method introduced in the research reported in this paper is intended to help decision makers rank different contractors based on various attributes. The triangular fuzzy-set model is implemented to define the linguistic terms used to describe subjective judgment related to decision makers' experience level, attribute weight assessment, and selection attributes rating. Many uncertainties and ambiguities arise in contractor selection as this decision is a multiattribute group decision with time pressure; therefore, the fuzzy weighted-average method can be used to simulate the grouping of multiple decision-makers. The research reported in this paper models different levels of experience for decision makers involved in the evaluation process (up to 10 decision-makers) using fuzzy membership functions to express their experience level. Different decision-makers input their beliefs about the importance of a set of attributes that contribute to the decision to prequalify a given contractor using linguistic terms, which are converted into membership functions. The decision makers rate different contractors (up to five contractors) using linguistic terms, which are converted into membership functions that represent the degree to which decision makers believe a contractor meets the set of criteria important to the prequalification decision. The results of the research reported in this paper provide project stakeholders with valuable insights into the contractor selection problem. A computer program which uses the fuzzy-logic approach to modeling the multiattribute decision-making process is introduced. This program can be implemented by stakeholders to make better contractor-selection decisions. This computer program has been validated by five developers in a real case study. The results of the computer program agreed with the actual contractor selected by the developers of the project. The new contribution of this paper lies in the fact that it implements subjective judgment using fuzzy logic in the contractor selection decision and introduces multiple decision-makers into the quantitative solution introduced in the research reported in this paper.

A contractor is expected to contribute not only an exchange value in the construction stage, but also value-in-use during both the construction and operations stages. However, existing models overlook value-in-use, and thus, do not offer a complete estimation of a project's value. Thus, this study proposes a value estimation model using the service-dominant logic, which emphasizes an owner's journey throughout the project and considers both exchange value and value-in-use. The model structures and estimates construction project value according to potential events caused by the contractor. By integrating the simulation mechanism, the model compares project values among contractors. The study introduces an example project to demonstrate the utilization of the proposed model in selecting the most valuable contractor.

J	Holt, GD				Holt, GD			Classifying construction contractors - A case study using cluster analysis	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction contractors; tender evaluation; prequalification; classification; cluster analysis; selection models	SELECTION; CRITERIA	It is widely accepted in construction management literature that superlative contractor selection criteria are: contractor ability to complete a project on time, within budgeted cost and to expected quality standards. Hence, contractor evaluation and selection models with the ability to highlight these attributes (i.e. help the selection decision) should be fully exploited. To date, such models have evolved based predominantly on multi-attribute analysis, case-based reasoning, and discriminant analysis, but there is scope for investigation of alternative strategies including: fuzzy set theory; neural networks; regression techniques; and cluster analysis. This paper concentrates an the latter by applying cluster analysis to real-life contractor selection data. Results indicate that the technique will simultaneously classify large numbers of contractors while identifying the most significant discriminating criteria among them. These characteristics offer potential for rationalization of contractor evaluation, classification and selection.

J	Alarcon, LF; Mourgues, C				Alarcon, LF; Mourgues, C			Performance modeling for contractor selection	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PREQUALIFICATION	This paper proposes a contractor selection system that incorporates the contractor's performance prediction as one of the criteria for selection. This research was developed working with an owner organization that was interested in developing a framework for evaluating contractors for future work. A modeling framework, developed in previous research, was used to develop a conceptual model of a project that depicts a causal structure of the variables, risks, and interactions that affect a contractor's performance for a specific project from the owner's point of view. The conceptual model helps to identify information needed for a comprehensive evaluation; some information can be readily available from historical records, while other can be unavailable and can be replaced by estimates based on experience. Ideally, over time, the owner should collect most of the information required for future evaluations. A mathematical component of the model can generate predictions of multiple project performance outcomes for each contractor under evaluation; these predictions and a contractors' bid prices are then used for contractor evaluation purposes.

However, much of the research carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) on construction-tendering has been done from the perspective of the relationship between the contractor and client. This paper addresses that gap by identifying and examining the major barriers to effective pricing of tenders by subcontractors and the business environment of their commercial relationships with contractors. A questionnaire study involving 94 subcontractors and semistructured interviews with five of them was conducted in 2011. The primary barriers to providing better cost-certainty and quality of response in quotations to contractors relate to quality of documents, bidding time, competition, resource levels, information and communication technology, unethical behavior by the contractor, uneven collaborative relationships, input specificity, level of relationship that exists, and the time to assimilate and provide the output response. Contractors and clients should help address the barriers. For contractors, this can enhance competitiveness, profitability, and supply-chain relationships. For clients, this can lead to better project outcomes because subcontractors form a major part of the organizational structure of projects. Addressing the concerns expressed by subcontractors may also require a collaborative approach, perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation and plan of action.

Niche Width, Competitive Positioning, and Performance of International Construction Contractors (1992-2009)	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction industry; International factors; Contractors; International construction market; International contractors; Competitive positioning; Niche width; Resource partitioning	ORGANIZATIONAL MORTALITY; GLOBAL MARKET; INDUSTRY; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION; SIZE	Over the past few decades, the international construction industry has proven a dramatic development. However, the unstable international circumstance has enhanced the risks of this industry, where proper strategies are critical for the survival of international contractors. Based on organizational ecology theories, which initially stemmed from ecology and then introduced to business management and economics field, proper competitive positioning for international construction companies are investigated in this study. Niche width has been introduced as an indicator to reflect the resource utilization of international construction companies while location is defined as the contractors' distance from the market center. Using Engineering News-Record data on top 225 international contractors from 1992 to 2009, the U-shaped relationship between niche width and performance of contractor is proven in both product and geography dimensions, indicating the performance of contractors enhance with the expansion of niche width initially, and then subside. In addition, location shows significant effect on performance of international contractors. The proper location for contractors with narrow niche width is close to the geographic market center and far from the product market center; while the appropriate positions for contractors with wide niche width are opposite to those with narrow niche width. Although this research focuses mainly on top international contractors, the results may reflect the profile of the whole industry. Furthermore, the research method of this study could be replicated in other studies to enhance the understanding of the organizational competitive positioning in a complicated environment.

J	Alsugair, AM				Alsugair, AM			Framework for evaluating bids of construction contractors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Bid evaluation is one of the major challenges that face owners and consultants in both the public and private sectors in selecting the best construction contractor. Selecting the best one requires a sophisticated knowledge and experience to ensure that the contractor is technically and financially capable to accomplish the project on time, within budget, and as specified. In this paper, a framework for evaluating bids of construction contractors in Saudi Arabia is developed. The framework is developed for lump contracts using postqualification of contractors. The framework includes identifying the factors involved in bid evaluation, the impacts and weights of these factors, and the factor's score. Also, the procedure for evaluating contractors bids is discussed using an example.

J	Singh, D; Tiong, RLK				Singh, D; Tiong, RLK			A fuzzy decision framework for contractor selection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Contractor selection is the process of selecting the most appropriate contractor to deliver the project as specified so that the achievement of the best value for money is ensured. Construction clients are becoming more aware of the fact that selection of a contractor based on tender price alone is quite risky and may lead to the failure of the project in terms of time delay and poor quality standards. Evaluation of contractors based on multiple criteria is, therefore, becoming more popular. Contractor selection in a multicriteria environment is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty inherent in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgment of decision makers (DMs). This paper presents a systematic procedure based on fuzzy set theory to evaluate the capability of a contractor to deliver the project as per the owner's requirements. The notion of Shapley value is used to determine the global value or relative importance of each criterion in accomplishing the overall objective of the decision-making process. The research reported upon forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a fuzzy decision model for construction contractor selection involving investigating multiple criteria selection tendencies of construction clients, relationship among decision criteria, and construction clients' preferences of criteria in the contractor selection process. An illustration with a bid evaluation exercise is presented to demonstrate the data requirements and the application of the method in selecting the most appropriate contractor for the project under uncertainty. The proposed model is not intended to supplant the work of decision-making teams in the contractor selection process, but rather to help them make quality evaluations of the available candidate contractors. One major advantage of the proposed method is that it makes the selection process more systematic and realistic as the use of fuzzy set theory allows the DMs to express their assessment of contractors' performance on decision criteria in linguistic terms rather than as crisp values.

The multiple requirements of clients encourage contractors to consider other strategies to deliver additional benefits besides offering a low-price bid. Offering low bids will reduce contractors' profits and potentially make development less attractive. Contractors need to understand their specific resources that generate competitive advantage and accordingly develop strategies to win contracts. This paper reports the findings from a recent survey on competition strategies in the Hong Kong construction industry. Thirteen typical bidding strategies, their used frequency in bidding, and their effectiveness for winning contracts of different types and between different groups of contractors are studied. The analysis of findings is explored to provide local contractors and clients with new insights into competition strategies in bidding.

J	Chen, C; Orr, RJ				Chen, Chuan; Orr, Ryan J.			Chinese Contractors in Africa: Home Government Support, Coordination Mechanisms, and Market Entry Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Africa is a traditional overseas market for Chinese contractors. Since the launch of "going out' national strategy in the new century, and with the support and control of the government and subordinate agencies, associations and banks, and innovative approach such as Angola Mode, Chinese contractors' presence in the emerging African market continues to grow. Based on original empirical data collected through interview and questionnaire surveys, this paper analyzes the mechanisms the Chinese government has established to facilitate Chinese contractors' entry into Africa and the perspectives of Chinese contractors about the African market in terms of opportunities and threats. Regression analysis based on existing datasets indicates that despite perceived opportunities and threats, Chinese contractors' performance in Africa in terms of business revenue actually hinges upon the availability of construction capital. The study also reviews the market entry modes used by Chinese contractors, concluding that they prefer to establish a long term presence and opt to commit large resources. Overall, the paper summarizes evidence about the status and innovative approaches of Chinese contractors in penetrating the African construction market, and also characterizes the potential of the African construction market for Chinese contractors.

J	Li, YW; Nie, XT; Chen, SY				Li, Yawei; Nie, Xiangtian; Chen, Shouyu			Fuzzy approach to prequalifying construction contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						fuzzy sets; construction management; contractors; decision making	PREQUALIFICATION; CRITERIA	Construction contractor prequalification (CCPQ) is a crucial decision making process to select capable potential bidders and ensure the success of construction projects. The purpose of CCPQ is to guarantee a contractor's characteristic to meet the construction project's requirements, which has been established worldwide as a standard practice. However, existing methods, i.e., marking method, subjective judgment method, etc., for contractor prequalification have been inadequate because it is difficult for decision makers to investigate contractor's capabilities against inexact, vagueness, and qualitative criteria. The objective of this paper is to propose a fuzzy framework-based fuzzy number theory to solve construction contractor prequalification issues, which include decision criteria analysis, weights assessment, and decision model development. Finally, a case study for a tunnel construction project was used to demonstrate the feasibility of fuzzy approaches.

J	Wang, TF; Tang, WZ; Du, L; Duffield, CF; Wei, YP				Wang, Tengfei; Tang, Wenzhe; Du, Lei; Duffield, Colin F.; Wei, Yongping			Relationships among Risk Management, Partnering, and Contractor Capability in International EPC Project Delivery	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC); Risk management; Partnering; Contractor capability; International project delivery; Construction; Chinese contractors	CHINESE CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; JOINT VENTURES; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; INCENTIVES; AUSTRALIA; SUCCESS	Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC) method has become commonly adopted in international construction markets, in which contractors bear enormous risks. Previous studies suggest the need to improve contractors' risk management by partnering with project participants and enhancing their organizational capability. Nevertheless, limited research has systematically and quantitatively addressed the causal relationships among them. This study quantifies the relationships among these themes via the development and validation of a conceptual mediation model. With supporting data from Chinese contractors, this research outlines the statuses on contractors' risk management, application of partnering, and their organizational capability. Path analysis validates that partnering not only effectively facilitates risk management via promotion of contractor capability but also directly enhances risk management. Canonical correlation analyses further reveal the different degrees to which partnering critical success factors (CSFs), contractor capability indicators, and risk management processes are associated. The previously mentioned results contribute to both theory and practice by building interdisciplinary linkages among risk management, partnering, and contractor capability in international EPC project delivery. An in-depth understanding of these cause-effect relationships will allow multiorganizational dynamic risk management research to become state-of-the-art, and will aid EPC contractors in appropriately integrating both intraorganizational and interorganizational resources to manage project risks and achieve superior performance in international EPC projects.

A postal questionnaire was distributed to 100 client and contractor organizations in Australia in 1997. Forty-eight responses were analyzed for scores on 38 categories of contractor information in terms of "value to client," "contractor costs," "client costs," and "value for money." The client and contractor responses for "value to client" and "client costs" of processing were found to be homogeneous. Those for "contractor costs" and "value for money" differed significantly between the clients and the contractors. A simple linear regression analysis was used to model the responses, and an index of cost-benefit was derived for each of the categories. This was found to be superior to all of the nonlinear alternatives examined. The model was also found to have greater intuitive value than the equivalent raw "value for money" responses.

J	Singh, D; Tiong, RLK				Singh, D.; Tiong, Robert L. K.			Contractor selection criteria: Investigation of opinions of Singapore construction practitioners	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contractors; construction industry; decision making; selection; singapore		The construction industry has witnessed the failure of many contractors due to varying reasons such as financial problems, poor performance, or accidents arising from the lack of adequate safety consideration at worksites. All these incidents have led to the impression that the current system of awarding the contracts is inefficient in selecting the contractor capable of meeting the demands and challenges of present times and hence needs to be reviewed accordingly. Therefore, in an attempt to investigate the current situation of the Singapore construction industry a questionnaire survey was conducted for accruing the data required to identify the important contractor selection criteria (CSC) and to draw upon construction practitioners' opinions regarding the importance of those CSC in assessing the capabilities of the candidate contractors during the selection process. The research reported upon forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a computer-interactive multicriteria decision system for contractor selection involving identification of CSC for inclusion in the system, investigation of CSC preferences of construction practitioners, and establishment of weights for those CSC from their perceived importance determined through the questionnaire survey of Singapore construction practitioners. The study highlights that there are statistically significant differences in opinions regarding the degree of importance assigned to some CSC among public clients, private clients, and contractors. Findings from the study may act as an aid in improving the Singapore construction industry by helping construction clients identify multiple CSC apart from cost which should always be considered when assessing the capability of candidate contractors during the selection process, by assisting contractors in improving their attributes in line with clients' preferences and by facilitating Singapore construction clients and researchers to develop a contractor selection system capable of assessing multiple attributes of the candidate contractors so that the risk of the project failure due to the selection of an inappropriate contractor is minimized.

J	Ab Rani, NI; Ismail, S; Mohamed, Z; Isa, CMM				Ab Rani, Nur Izzati; Ismail, Syuhaida; Mohamed, Zainai; Mat Isa, Che Maznah			Competitiveness framework of local contractors in the Malaysian construction industry towards globalisation and liberalisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Competitiveness framework; local contractors; Malaysian construction industry; globalisation; iberalisation	STRATEGY; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; COMPANIES	In Malaysia, one of the main challenges of the Internationalisation Thrust under Construction Industry Master Plan (CITP) 2016-2020 is an increasingly competitive local market, especially with the presence of foreign players as a result of globalisation and liberalisation. Apart from specialised and highly technical projects, foreign players are also increasingly gaining various types of projects in Malaysia. The gradual increase in foreign investors' market share over the last few years indicate the need to enhance the capabilities of local players to remain competitive. Competitiveness frameworks formulated at the nation or industry level in previous studies were mainly focused on the macro level with limited studies measuring the contractor's competitiveness at the firm level. Therefore, the development of a competitiveness framework at the firm or micro-level for local contractors in the Malaysian construction industry is required. This paper aims to appraise the competitiveness of local contractors towards globalisation and liberalisation in Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to develop a competitiveness framework for local contractors towards globalisation and liberalisation. This framework consists of five variables namely, competitiveness awareness of local contractors, factors contributing to the competitiveness of local contractors, drivers of competitiveness among local contractors, challenges among local contractors in the Malaysian construction industry in competing with local and foreign contractors and competitive strategies of local contractors in competing with local and foreign contractors. The partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to develop the competitiveness framework consisting of five variables. Four variables namely, competitiveness awareness, competitiveness factors, drivers of competitiveness and competitive strategy shared a direct relationship. Meanwhile, challenges of competitiveness reported an indirect relationship with competitive strategy. This paper addresses the Internationalisation Thrust under CITP 2016-2020 to increase the competitiveness of the domestic market. The competitiveness framework developed in this paper serves as a guideline for local contractors in raising their competitive advantage amid the challenges of globalisation and liberalisation.

J	Reeves, K				Reeves, K			Construction business systems in Japan: general contractors and subcontractors	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business systems; construction business system; contracting system; contractors; subcontractors; Japan		The Japanese construction sector is characterized by the predominance of large general contractors, with multiple layers of small contractors and subcontractors working under their umbrella. Against the background of huge construction demand created by modernization (starting in 1868) and the resultant changes in the construction business (building style, materials and project scale), large general contractors and subordinate subcontractors gradually created a distinctive contracting system. The development process of the construction business based on collaboration and not free competition is discussed with particular emphasis on the unique nature of the contracting system using historical- and institutional-based analyses. One of the competitive strengths of general contractors lies with project organization at construction sites. How the subcontracting of building projects is controlled by general contractors and how subcontractors respond to their subordinate position is explored. Current strengths, inefficiencies and problems of the construction business are identified and possible systemic reforms are suggested, such as the development of competent subcontractors to revitalize the Japanese construction industry along actions for contractors, subcontractors, private- and public-sector clients.

J	Lines, BC; Kumar, GGR				Lines, Brian C.; Kumar, Gagan Gowda Ravi			Developing More Competitive Proposals: Relationship between Contractor Qualifications-Based Proposal Content and Owner Evaluation Scores	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; PROCUREMENT METHODS; SELECTION CRITERIA; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; DIFFERENTIATION; STRATEGY; SUCCESS	Construction contractors have historically been procured through price-driven methods. Yet the increased use of alternate project delivery methods, along with owner-perceived concerns over construction performance, has led many owners to introduce qualifications-based selection criteria into their procurement systems. As a result, construction contractors are tasked with preparation of qualifications-based proposal submittals ever more frequently. Contractors must therefore develop strategies to consistently differentiate their qualifications from those of their their competitors, which can lead to more favorable owner evaluation scores and ultimately improve their hit rate. This paper performed a content analysis of 71 contractor proposals containing both successful and unsuccessful bids. Regression results indicate that contractor project management proposals receive more favorable owner evaluation scores when contractor-controlled, design-related, and concealed conditions content are emphasized. Regression results show that contractor scope alternate proposals are encouraged to provide a comprehensive review of potential scope options to enhance the project and ensure the associated cost and schedule impacts are clearly defined.

J	Chen, HL				Chen, Hong Long			An empirical examination of project contractors' supply-chain cash flow performance and owners' payment patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project contractor; Supply-chain performance; Cash flows; Financial performance; Payment behavior	INTEGRATION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; MODELS	Supply-chain (SC) cash flow performance is an essential component of SC performance management. Despite the panoply of approaches to SC cash flow modeling, relatively few published studies assess the effect of SC cash flow performance on a project contractor's financial performance. Little research thus explores the behavioral patterns in the project owner contractor dyad in the context of payment-term negotiation for improving the SC cash flow performance of a project contractor. Using data from 42 Taiwanese construction project contracting corporations, this paper systematically quantifies the effects of SC cash flow performance on the financial performance of construction project contractors. Further analysis using data from 118 returned, usable surveys reveals important behavioral patterns of project owners regarding payment terms with project contractors during the contracting phase of construction projects. These behavioral patterns provide project contractors with a base for supporting implementation efforts for improving SC cash flow performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Alashwal, AM; Ann, TS				Alashwal, Ali Mohammed; Ann, Tan Su			Application of home-country joint venture (HJV) for international construction contractors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Home-country joint venture; international construction; Malaysia	STRATEGIES; ENTRY; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; PARTNERS	Home-country joint venture (HJV) is one of the strategies contractors can use to venture into the international construction market. In this method, contractors from the same country join to undertake a project in a host country. However, this method is not common among contractors compared with other methods. For instance, among many overseas construction projects executed by Malaysian contractors, less than 1% of projects were completed as HJV. The purpose of this paper is to understand why this method is not common and to determine its potential benefits. For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with experts from Malaysian international contractor companies. The findings highlight the reasons why HJV is not common and the factors that facilitate HJV application among contractors. Factors facilitate the application of HJV include develop strategy for partnering, plan for HJV and risk, select the right partner and others. These factors are categorized into three main project management processes, which are HJV planning, HJV execution and HJV monitoring and control. The findings of this paper can promote the application of joint venture among contractors for successful construction projects and sustainable business in the international market.

A survey was conducted in Hong Kong to test the relationships between contractors' network performance and successful business competitiveness based on the project networks they build. A network strategy was developed by examining the relationships between the network techniques and the network outcomes. The network techniques support contractors' network, whereas the network outcomes contribute to competitiveness attributes. The findings demonstrate that the key network techniques of supporting information exchange and organizing project communication are highly significant predictors of the business competitiveness attributes (BCA). The network technique of creating learning capacity is positively associated with contractors' bidding performance and competitive strategies. Interestingly, the techniques of sharing knowledge and promoting networking culture insignificantly contribute to a number of the BCA. The developed network strategy reveals that the key network techniques significantly support contractors' network performance and that the consequent network outcomes give rise to the BCA, which in turn stimulate contractors' business competitiveness. Several practical suggestions are offered for contractors to improve their business competitiveness through interfirm cooperation between project network members.

Turkish contractors constitute a large portion of the local economy and are important global actors in contracting business. Lean construction-based research and practice, as a production management-based approach for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the construction industry, are scarce among Turkish contractors. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire prepared to predict the lean conformance levels of Turkish contractors and discusses the results. The comparative strengths and weaknesses of Turkish contractors for a lean construction initiative are highlighted. The findings that are presented in this paper can be used as a starting point to disseminate the research and practice in lean construction among Turkish contractors in the future. A similar kind of research can be repeated to compare the lean conformance levels in different countries and to evaluate the lean construction programs at different companies after the introduction of lean construction.

Owner's Risk Allocation and Contractor's Role Behavior in a Project: A Parallel-mediation Model	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Contractor; Engineering Management; Feeling of being Trusted; Owner; Project Management; Risk Allocation; Role Behavior; Trust	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; TRUST; CITIZENSHIP; PERSPECTIVE; SUCCESS	Risk allocation decisions are of critical importance in project management. The present study proposes an explanation for how risk allocation in a contract motivates a contractor to cooperate with a project owner. Theories of risk allocation and trust were used to motivate the research. Using a survey methodology, we collected data concerning 124 construction projects in China. We found that risk allocation influenced the contractor's role behavior through the contractor's feeling of being trusted but not the contractor's trust in the owner. Feeling of being trusted partially mediated the effect of risk allocation on the contractor's in-role (i.e., contractual) behavior and fully mediated the effect on extra-role behavior. The study introduces a social and psychological view of the impacts of risk allocation to the project and engineering management literature. We contribute to theory by arguing and demonstrating the mediating effect of trust on the relationship between risk allocation and contractor behavior. From a practical standpoint, we conclude that contractual risk allocation has a significant impact on building a trusting relationship between owners and contractors and that contractors who feel trusted perform both contractually mandated actions and actions external to the contract more diligently, resulting in the likelihood of improved outcomes for both parties.

J	Bubshait, AA; AlGobali, KH				Bubshait, AA; AlGobali, KH			Contractor prequalification in Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The process of investigating and qualifying contractors is important to ensure the success of construction projects. Prequalification has been established as a standard practice by public and semipublic organizations. Its objective is to ensure that the contractor's characteristics and capabilities match the requirements of the project under consideration. Effective and objective qualification processes serve both owners and contractors. Construction is a worldwide industry. The extension of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreement in the construction industry in the near future will make it possible for contractors to bid in different parts of the world. This paper identifies criteria that are considered in prequalification practices for semipublic and private projects in Saudi Arabia. Prequalification practices of 19 large companies were studied. In addition, questionnaires were sent to 202 randomly selected companies. The results indicated that common criteria for evaluation include: contractor's experience, financial stability, past performance, quality performance, project management capabilities, contractor failure records, management staff availability, and contractor capacity. Results were compared with results obtained in the United States. Prequalification criteria are similar in both countries.

J	Ng, ST; Tang, ZW				Ng, S. Thomas; Tang, Ziwei			Labour-intensive construction sub-contractors: Their critical success factors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labour-intensive sub-contractor; Construction; Critical success factor; Factor analysis	SUBCONTRACTORS; PERFORMANCE	What contributes to the success of sub-contractors is a key concern of the construction industry as the performance of sub-contracting firms is far from satisfactory. While certain studies have been carried out to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for sub-contractors, it is unrealistic to assume that these CSFs are relevant to all types of sub-contractors. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to establish a set of CSFs for those construction sub-contractors which are labour-intensive in nature. To achieve that, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong. A set of CSFs pertinent to labour-intensive sub-contractors are first identified through descriptive statistics. The CSFs are then compared with those pertinent to equipment-intensive trade specialists. Finally, the identified CSFs are grouped into three components through a factor analysis. Through the survey, nine factors are identified as critical to the success of labour-intensive sub-contractors, and these CSFs are grouped into three components viz, the managerial performance, financial performance, and labour-intensive specific factors. The findings of this study provide a good basis for labour-intensive sub-contractors to improve their success at project and organisational levels. The identified CSFs will also provide a solid foundation for future research into the key performance indicators and benchmarks for labour-intensive sub-contractors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Previous studies highlighted strategies for international contractors to sustain business such as diversification of product and region, localization, joint ventures and entry time. However, the influence of these strategies on contractors' performance has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this paper is to identify strategies of the international Malaysian contractors and determine the influence of these strategies on their performance during different periods of economic fluctuations. The data of this study was collected from the records of 452 overseas construction projects completed between 1993 and 2016, which covered five periods of booms and recessions. Based on the regression analysis, the results showed that localization influences contractors' performance during boom periods. Joint venture with home-country contractors may have a positive impact during both boom and recession periods. Product diversification has a positive influence during one recession period. The findings of this study provide an insight for contractors to make critical decisions pertaining to their long-term survival and growth in the international market.

An assessment of risks associated with contractor's cash flow projections in South-South, Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Risk factors; contractor; cash flow; construction projects; Nigeria		Construction contracts have been widely acknowledged to be capital intensive, complicated, and risk prone. The purpose of the study is to assess risk factors affecting contractors' cash flow for construction projects and examine their influence on contractors' cash flow projections. In line with quantitative survey approach adopted for the study, 193 copies of a structured questionnaire were administered while 130 valid responses were received to give a response rate of 67.4%. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kruskal Wallis. Findings indicate that the 5 top rated risk factors affecting contractor's cash flow were 'delay in payment by client', 'delay in delivery of materials', contractor's lack of resources, exchange rate, and inflation while the 5 least rated risk factors by respondents were currency of cost data, disagreement over retention, over valuation, adjustment of prime cost sums, and force majeure. It was also discovered that 'contractor's lack of resources' had the highest severity of influence according to the view of respondents. The study concludes that cash flow projections of contractors handling construction projects in south-south Nigeria are prone to risks, most of which are significant. However, it was established that the five top risks which should be of concern to contractors are delay in payment by client, delay in delivery of materials, contractor's lack of resources, exchange rate, and inflation. The study recommends that contractors and other stakeholders could consider putting in place risk control measures to counter those risks identified in this study as likely to have high severity of influence on cash flow with a view towards bolstering project delivery.

Effective strategy enables construction firms to match their activities to the changing environment and achieve superior performance in competition. Therefore, there is a need for studying contractors' competitive strategies. This paper does that in relation to the Hong Kong construction industry. The impact of competition environment on contractor performance, and the relationship between competitive strategy and performance are examined by a questionnaire survey. The findings show that competition environment has a great impact on contractor performance, and four generic competitive strategies have been applied by contractors. Contractors can indeed be classified into four groups according to their different strategic orientations: prospectors, analyzers, defenders, and reactors. As a result, the strategies that contractors should pursue in the local construction industry can be identified with confidence. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000407.

Centralized bid evaluation for awarding of construction projects - A case of India government	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Goal programming; Contractor selection; Project management	CONTRACTOR SELECTION; MODEL; PROCUREMENT; AUCTIONS; PROPOSAL; UTILITY	Reviewing the procedures of contractor selection in government departments in various countries and in the Rural Development Department (RDD) in India, this paper brings out several weaknesses of the current contractor selection procedure. It suggests a centralized contractor evaluation process with the inclusion of three new selection attributes along bid price. The suggested attributes are: (1) time quoted to complete the project, (2) warranty period quoted, and (3) past performance score of the contractor. To solve the resulting multi-objective decision-making problem, the paper proposes a binary goal programming model. When tested with the existing contractor selection procedure for six past projects in RDD, the model yields the same results as those taken by RDD in the past, confirming the credibility of the model. When tested with the suggested procedure, the model yields much superior results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.	[Padhi, Sidhartha S.; Mohapatra, Pratap K.

J	San Cristobal, JR				Ramon San Cristobal, Jose			Contractor Selection Using Multicriteria Decision-Making Methods	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractor selection; Multicriteria methods; Construction management	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR; MODEL; CRITERIA; UTILITY	Contractors play a vital role in the overall performance of a project. Selecting the right contractor for the right project is the most crucial challenge for any construction client. Numerous and often conflicting objectives and alternatives, such as tender price, completion date, and experience, need to be considered. Recently, to assist owners in making decisions, there has been a trend away from a "lowest-price wins" principle and subjective judgement to a multicriteria selection approach in the selection of contractors for construction projects. In the autonomous region of Cantabria, in the north of Spain, increased project complexity and higher requirements have recently demanded the use of multicriteria decision-making methods for contractor selection. With this aim, two multicriteria decision methods, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and vlsekriterijumska optimizacija I kompromisno resenje (VIKOR) methods, are applied to the selection of a contractor for the road building project "La Braguia" undertaken during 2002. The results show that one of the contractors is the highest ranked by both methods. Being the highest ranked alternative by the TOPSIS method indicates that this contractor is the best in terms of the ranking index. In addition, being the highest ranked alternative by the VIKOR method indicates that it is the closest to the ideal solution. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000488.

J	Mihaly, G				Mihaly, Goeroeg			A comprehensive model for planning and controlling contractor cash-flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Earned value concept; Cash-flow planning; Cash-flow controlling; Margin forecast		Nowadays, because of the rapidly changing operational environment characteristic to organisations, there is a need for short project implementation period on the client side. At the same time, contractors should face a very competitive market situation. On the contractor side, in this way, there is a need for such a competitive contract price that could cover not only the cost of implementing the project work but those costs as well that are associated with financing the negative cash-flow balance period of the project work. Simultaneously, the contract price should cover some margin for contractors, while the amount of this margin is determined (beside the contract price and the actual cost) by the contractors' actual cash-flow balance to completion. Realising and considering this need, a comprehensive model has been developed by the author to plan and control contractor cash-flow associated with the project work. This model also enables contractors to elaborate such a bid price that satisfies the above mentioned needs while it forecasts the likely margin earned by the contractor. The copyrighted model allows planning and controlling contractor cash-flow in activity/time unit manner, and also in summarised forms, considering the entire project implementation process from the outset of the work till a specified reporting date. The term 'contractor' in this text implies all those project-based organisations that implement project work for project client organisations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

In the transaction, the economic results and the impact of justice on relational behavior should not be ignored. Our study on the perspective of contractors explores whether and how different dimensions of interorganizational justice affect relational behavior in construction projects and the moderating role of owner's asset specificity. On the basis of survey data from the construction industry, the empirical results reveal that if contractors perceive higher procedural justice or interactional justice, the contractor's relational behavior conforms to relational norms more. Furthermore, the owner's asset specificity dilutes the positive impact of interactional justice on the contractor's relational behavior. The findings contribute to strengthening the understanding of project management and interorganizational justice while guiding owners to pay more attention to the process of contract execution in practice and the appropriate investment of specific assets in projects to improve the contractor's relational behavior.

J	Plebankiewicz, E				Plebankiewicz, Edyta			CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR PREQUALIFICATION FROM POLISH CLIENTS' PERSPECTIVE	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contractor; prequalification; selection criteria; public client; private client; tendering	SELECTION CRITERIA; MODEL; STATE	A competent construction contractor is one of the indispensable conditions of a proper process and completion of a construction project. The article presents analysis results of the main criteria considered by Polish public clients in contractor competence evaluation. Research was carried out on the basis of demands stated by clients in restricted tenders announced in 2007. The author also presents research results of the methods and criteria for construction contractor selection, used by Polish private clients. To carry out the research a questionnaire was sent to 27 private clients at the turn of 2006/2007. The results of the research show that public clients in most of the restricted tenders use just one of the criteria used to qualify a candidate to the second stage of tender procedure and it is usually the contractor's experience. Generally, it is characterised by the number of realised projects similar to the ordered one. For private clients, in contractor competence evaluation, technical possibilities of a contractor are especially valued. Experience in similar investments realisation, their quality, the equipment owned, and the staff are the top qualities in the rankings. Appreciated, although to a smaller extent, is also financial reliability of a contractor. Yet, criteria connected with project management are those which are the least valued ones.

In particular, top construction firms have benefited greatly from ERM practices by establishing their own risk management philosophies and systems. The aim of this study is to explore current ERM practices of top international contractors, as ranked by the Engineering News Record (ENR), and to identify an ERM practice model adopted by top ENR international contractors. An archival research method was employed for this study, combining a coding framework and thematic analysis, using the 2013 annual reports of the top ENR international contractors. The research proposes an integrated ERM model for analysis which combines ERM process, ERM operations and an ERM control environment. In addition, the research investigates the home location, main overseas market and main industry sector as being the external driving factors of ERM practices adopted by top ENR international contractors. The study concludes that ERM practice is a proactive and continuing process for the international contractors, driven by their internal enterprise culture and risk management desires as well as other external requirements.

One of the most fundamental issues confronting contractors moving offshore is where to do business. Although international market selection is a much studied topic, the market choices made by construction firms have attracted little attention. This paper aims to identify factors that influence international market selection and to develop an international market selection model for construction firms. The market entry choices of 39 large international Chinese contractors across 87 countries were investigated through logistic regression analysis. The results indicate that international contractors prefer to enter countries with large market potential, small culture distance, and, surprisingly, high country risk and high competitive intensity. Moreover, large, experienced contractors are more willing to compete in international markets. Contrary to generally accepted belief, geographic distance is not revealed to have any significant influence on international market selections by Chinese contractors. This paper will be of interest to contractors considering international market selection as part of their global expansion strategy.

However, findings from previous studies reveal that contractors' responses to feedback are mercurial and difficult to model by using conventional approaches. This study applies catastrophe theory to model the contractors' learning behavior in response to feedback. An industry survey was conducted in Hong Kong for data collection. To test the conceptual model, Cusp fit program was employed. The results indicate that not until they perform worse than the client's anticipation, the contractors may not practice double-loop learning as a response to the project monitoring feedback. Contractors' learning from feedback may be conditional. This study demonstrates a new approach to model a dynamic characteristic of the contractors' learning behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is to analyze how the incorporation of CCCS may affect general contractors' present and future competitiveness through a case study in China. This paper analyzes the procurement of 158 building projects tendered in Beijing involving 2,071 local general contractors active in the market. The results show that (1) the contractors' CCCS scores are important for being awarded large and mega project contracts; (2) CCCS scores have a generally positive effect on future corporate financial income; and (3) contrary to expectations, the policy does not increase the CCCS of companies. Finally, the changing trend in contractors' CCCS scores is observed to be highly correlated with their initial values (the scores of higher CCCS scoring companies increase faster on average than that of other companies). The final remarks address ways to better implement CCCS schemes in the future and avoid the potential risks involved in their use. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A major barrier is that such, a CCR system must be relatively easy to access to ensure that (i) contractors' information is constantly updated (by contractors), (ii) contractors' performance is reported promptly (by project teams and occupiers), and (iii) the latest analyzed information is available to any authorized clients anytime anywhere. A centralized multiclient cooperative contractor registration (CMCCR) system is proposed using web-based technology, which provides a powerful communication medium with a high potential for satisfying the above requirements. The conceptual framework of the proposed CMCCR system is presented, and the concept is illustrated through a prototype based on information collected in Hong Kong. The initial observations indicate that web-based technology is suitable for the proposed CMCCR system, and that the development of a fully functional web-based CMCCR is both feasible and useful.

Association of Risk Attitude with Market Diversification in the Construction Business	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Market diversification; Diversification pattern; Competition in the marketplace; Organizational risk attitude; ENR top 400 contractors	SELECTION; ENTROPY; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY	In construction, many large firms are diversified, and their diversification is recognized as a corporate strategy for growth and risk management. Diversification indicates extended competition into a different market sector. It is a departure from a firm's experience base, and it can be riskier than improving performance in the currently operating market. Then, contractors' diversification and their aggregate pattern in the market, if there is any, are realized outcomes through competition among contractors over different market sectors. The competing contractors may have different risk attitudes, which are the subconscious but critical basis of their risk-taking behaviors in competition. This study investigates the association of contractors' organizational risk attitudes with their diversification on the basis of simulated competition among multiple contractors. The simulation replicates the actual diversification pattern of large U.S. construction contractors. The results provide new insight on the relationship between contractors' risk attitude and their diversification as well as their competitive success. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000045.

J	Eke, G; Elgy, J; Wedawatta, G				Eke, Gerald; Elgy, John; Wedawatta, Gayan			Establishing a Link between Contractor Selection Strategy and Project Outcomes: Simulation Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MODEL	Perceived benefits of the best-value strategy and the problems the lowest-price strategy have caused in the construction industry have led to an increase in the use of the best-value strategy for selecting contractors. Although some research has tried to establish a direct relationship between a contractor selection strategy and project outcomes, there is hardly any empirical research that tries to establish this relationship. This paper presents a quantifiable method of assessing the risk of selecting different contractor selection strategies using educational facilities projects in the United Kingdom. A Monte Carlo-simulation study was conducted to assess how the lowest-priced contractor would have fared against the best-value contractor had the former been awarded the contract instead. It was concluded that selecting the best-value contractor in educational facilities projects is not necessary in terms of cost. Furthermore, although the results are limited to educational facilities project, the method can be adapted to other sectors.

Thus this requires the contractor to have an effective risk management approach. Previous studies revealed that there was no formal risk management being used by the contractors in Malaysia. Hence, the study concentrated on the types of risk involves during construction project, the application of risk management by contractors in Malaysian construction industry and the strategy taken by them to mitigate risks. The research conducted surveys to the contractors registered with the Construction Industry Development Board, Malaysia (CIDB). The finding shows that there is a lack of standardization in the practice of risk management. Risk management has been mandated by the company and that the application has improved project performance. Besides formal approach and educating the people to conduct risk management, it is recommended that a standardized guideline of risk management is needed to improve the application of risk management among contractors in Malaysia.

J	Martin, H; Ramjarrie, K				Martin, Hector; Ramjarrie, Karrisa			Cloud Contractor Selection Model for Design-Build Open Tender	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multicriteria; Decision theory; Expert system; Uncertainty; Fuzzy set; Cloud computing	GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR; DELPHI METHOD; SUBCONTRACTOR SELECTION; MULTIPLE CRITERIA; HIERARCHY PROCESS; RANK REVERSAL; AHP; VIKOR; PREQUALIFICATION	For transparency and accountability, public sector clients typically select a contractor using lowest-price open tendering. This paper focuses on improving the selection of a design-build contractor by modeling the inherent uncertainties associated with open tendering. Although there are numerous methods for selecting a contractor, few consider, and even fewer have accounted for, random uncertainties associated with open tendering. In the absence of a structured approach that includes cognitive uncertainty modeling, the risk of choosing a subpar contractor and consequent project failure increases. Cloud theory uses a normal distribution membership function to infuse fuzzy set theory with probability theory. The application of cloud theory in a case study to order the preferred contractors improves decision-making quality and, consequently, confidence in the derived outcome where uncertainty exists. By accounting for both fuzzy and random uncertainties expressed by decision makers, this formulation for contractor selection increases the potential to achieve client performance goals. The proposed new approach reduces the risk of project failure by offering a unique understanding of how to more efficiently choose a design-build contractor. It narrows the model prediction and practice gap by providing an alternative to selecting the lowest bidder.

Therefore, project owners must be conversant with the contractor's financial capability from the bidding stage through project completion. Consequently, project owners adopt a prequalification (PQ) process to screen for poor technical and managerial capabilities during the bidding stage. Although the PQ pass rate in Korea is nearly 99%, contractor liquidity can still pose problems. In this situation, the most important construction management strategy involves monitoring the contractor's liquidity status during the project. Accordingly, this study determines the symptoms of contractor decline at the corporate and project levels. Nineteen variables (17 financial and two nonfinancial) are selected through a symptom analysis. Moreover, this study develops a liquidity evaluation model (LEM) and its reference mode based on equations obtained by performing multiple discriminate analyses. These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of project owners to evaluate contractor liquidity using financial and nonfinancial information to prepare for possible financial problems.

Although Chinese international contractors are increasingly playing a significant role in the global construction market, relatively few studies have been completed on their historical background and foray into the international arena. Apart from seeking to fill this lacuna, this paper also provides an analysis of the these 35 Chinese international contractors to evaluate their achievements using the following performance indicators: International Revenue/Total Revenue, International Business Distribution, Overseas Management Structure, Involvement in Specialized Fields, and Overall Index of Internationalization. The analysis identified the top ten Chinese international contractors who are truly global in outlook. The study also suggests that the traditional multinational enterprise theories may not explain the development of Chinese international construction firms adequately.

This study developed and tested a theoretical model to investigate how different types of contractor behavior (perfunctory, consummate, and opportunistic) affect engineering project value added (EPVA) and analyze the moderating role of contract complexity and task complexity. The multiple regression analysis approach is used to analyze data collected from a survey of 290 Chinese project professionals. The results show that three types of contractor behavior have a significant impact on EPVA, that is, contractor perfunctory and consummate behaviors have a significant positive impact, whereas opportunistic behavior has a significant negative impact. In addition, contractor consummate behavior had the strongest impact, followed by perfunctory and opportunistic behaviors. The moderation results showed that the positive impact between perfunctory behavior and EPVA is strengthened and weakened by contract and task complexity, respectively, whereas the negative impact of opportunistic behavior is weakened and strengthened, respectively. The contract and task complexity have no significant moderating impact on the relationship between contractor consummate behavior and EPVA. The findings of this study contribute to the project governance and project performance literature and provide new knowledge for academe and practice for a deeper understanding of how to realize EPVA from the perspective of contractor behavior.

J	Aagaard, A; Eskerod, P; Madsen, ES				Aagaard, Annabeth; Eskerod, Pernille; Madsen, Erik Skov			Key drivers for informal project coordination among sub-contractors A case study of the offshore wind energy sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project management; Coordination; Integration challenge; Inter-firm projects; Offshore wind energy; Sub-contractors	TRUST; INTERDEPENDENCE; UNCERTAINTY; ORGANIZATIONS; COMPLEXITY; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; SHADOW; DESIGN	Purpose - Despite good project front-end planning, projects typically need continuous coordination among the participants concerning scope of work, pace, and timing during the execution phase to be accomplished without delays. Coordination can be formal or informal. Research shows that informal coordination of residual and unforeseen interdependencies enhances time saving and facilitates better understandings. Still though, many sub-contractors choose not to coordinate informally. The purpose of this paper is to identify drivers that enhance or inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors during project execution. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative, explorative case study approach was applied, involving 15 SME sub-contractors within the offshore wind power energy sector. Findings - Six drivers which enhance informal coordination and three drivers which inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors in projects were identified. Practical implications - The findings imply that management in project-oriented organizations can enhance informal coordination across project sub-contractors in the project execution phase by facilitating trust building; by emphasizing previous collaboration successes with the sub-contractors and the possibility of future common projects; by being explicit about expectations on informal coordination; and by developing sub-contractor contracts that are not very tight in economic terms, but instead give some leeway in relation to coordination. Originality/value - The paper contributes to a gap on coordination within projects and in the specificity of the context of offshore wind energy in which the concept of informal coordination across sub-contractors is explored.

Performance measurement tools for Ghanaian contractors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contractors; performance improvement; performance; Ghana; performance measurement		This paper addresses the absence of performance measurement systems in the Ghanaian construction industry. A thorough review of literature and existing academic publications on performance measurement was undertaken. As part of the process, three performance measurement systems used in the construction industries in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Denmark were reviewed. The performance measurement system used by Danish contractors was selected and adapted for Ghanaian contractors. Two performance measurement tools are developed in this paper. The Project Scorecard (ProScor) can be used to measure project performance whilst the Contractor Scorecard (ConScor) can be used to measure organizational performance. The developed tools were validated using focus group sessions with experts drawn from the Ghanaian construction industry and later using a questionnaire-based survey of selected Ghanaian contractors. Future work will focus on developing interactive versions of the tools to enhance their use.	[Ofori-Kuragu, J. K.; Baiden, B.

J	Gambo, N; Said, I; Ismail, R				Gambo, Nuru; Said, Ilias; Ismail, Radzi			Comparing the levels of performance of small scale local government contractors in Northern Nigeria with international practice	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management effectiveness; Construction management; Performance management; Performance measures; Performance monitoring	CONSTRUCTION; DELAYS; BENCHMARKING; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; TIME	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance levels of small scale local government contractors (SSLGCs) in northern part of Nigeria with international practice. Previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. This continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like Nigeria. There is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. A questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The contractors' performance was compared by using ANOVA with post hoc. Findings - The results indicated that the SSLGCs in Nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to SSLGCs in northern part of Nigeria. Practical implications - The study provided the criteria for evaluation of SSLGCs' performance in Nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. Social implications - The study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in Nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. Originality/value - This study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry.

They facilitate useful explanations for better understanding of research findings. However, the use of theories to advance studies in sustainable construction has been given little attention. According to Agenda 21 for sustainable construction in developing countries, contractors are yet to achieve capability to establish sustainable construction due to knowledge gaps and lack of relevant frameworks. The enormity of the ramifications of contractors' inability to adapt to environmentally sustainable construction (ESC) justifies adopting a multi-theory approach for understanding the dynamics of adaptation to ESC. In this study, the usefulness of three theories in facilitating understanding of the complexities surrounding contractors' adaptation to ESC was reviewed. The three theories are: resilience theory, ecological modernization theory and institutional theory. Following the review, it was found that resilience, isomorphic drivers and technology are integral elements needed for improving contractors' capability to adapt to ESC.

In examining the tenability of the bidder homogeneity assumption, a linear mixed modeling approach is applied to two data sets obtained from Hong Kong and Singapore contractors via a bidding experiment. Two linear mixed models were developed by relating the contractors' mark-up decision to four project decision environment factors, namely, (1) market conditions; (2) number of bidders; (3) project type; and (4) project size. The results show that not only is there a significant heterogeneity between the Hong Kong and the Singapore contractors in terms of both their preferences (intercepts) and responses (slopes) to the project decision environment factors that affect their mark-up decision, but also that the individual Hong Kong and Singapore contractors have different degrees of sensitivity toward the project decision environment factors (which is reflected in the varying individual-specific intercepts and slopes). These individual-specific parameter estimates have implications for managerial action in formulating a firm's competitive strategies.

Quality-Based Contractor Rating Model for Qualification and Bidding Purposes	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								A quality contractor on every construction project would make project management simpler for Department of Transportation (DOT) project engineers and strategic planning more accurate for DOT executives. A qualification model that includes the quality of a contractor's past work would be invaluable in assuring that each project had a quality contractor. Including the quality of past work in the bidding process would further help in this goal. Implementation of such a model for both its potential uses would require business process reengineering for the DOT in two important areas: qualification of contractors and contract award procedures. The research team has produced an innovative model, called the Quality-Based Performance Rating (QBPR) system. This model receives inputs from traditional subjective sources and integrates them with totally objective data input from the results of tests of the project's materials and workmanship, then uses these inputs to produce a score for each project that is further used by the system to generate an index for each contractor reflecting that contractor's quality of work over a specified time frame.

This study ascertains the relative importance of a set of internal and external factors for the intensity of technological and non-technological innovation among construction contracting firms. Seventeen types of contractor activities, associated with three levels of service content, are identified and a characteristics-based theory of service innovation with four innovation trajectories (material, informational, methodological, contractual or relational) is applied. Data collected from a questionnaire survey of 44 of the 50 largest construction contractors in Sweden indicate that 30 contractors had carried out research and development during 2003-2005 and that 11 had made at least one innovation new to the country. The lowest level of innovation intensity was mostly linked to the methodological trajectory (28 contractors), while the material trajectory dominated innovation 'new to the country' (eight contractors). Analysing data per activity where research and development or innovation had been reported shows that collaboration with another type of contractor is associated with a higher intensity of innovation, regardless of trajectory. The level of employee education is significant for relational innovation. The consequences for policies in firms and central government are identified.

J	Chan, EHW; Au, MCY				Chan, Edwin H. W.; Au, Maria C. Y.			Relationship between organizational sizes and contractors' risk pricing behaviors for weather risk under different project values and durations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; CULTURE	A problem that always annoys building employers and their consultants when drafting building contracts is whether it is more cost efficient to retain certain risks with themselves or to transfer the same to contractors, and it has long been a difficulty to accurately estimate the cost for transferring risks to the other contract party. It is a very common market practice to remove contractors' entitlement to extension of time due to inclement weather, and in view of the significant impacts that inclement weather posed on construction progress, it would be helpful to assess the associated costs for such risk allocation exercises in order to ensure that it is a cost-effective transaction. The costs for these potential weather-caused delays are priced by contractors in their returned tenders. This risk-pricing behavior is affected by the contractor's risk perception and risk attitude. However, merely working out contractors' risk perception and risk attitude patterns is inadequate, as they may vary in accordance with different organizational sizes and project backgrounds. Therefore, further studies should be carried out on the implications of project information, such as project value and contract period, on different-sized contractors' risk behaviors. In this research, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the weather-risk-pricing behavioral patterns of various-sized contractors under different given project scenarios. The survey revealed that the impacts of project value and contract period (and, thus, the intensity of work and scale of exposure to weather risk) were significant on contractors' risk behaviors, and these impacts varied in accordance with different organizational sizes. The medium-sized contractors' pricing behaviors were rather constant under different project values and contract periods, while both small and large contractors behaved differently when the intensity of work and scale of risk exposure varied. Despite the fact that contractors of various sizes behaved differently in some given scenarios, the number of days of delaying cost allowed by them in returned tenders were generally less than the actual number of days of inclement weather affecting work.

When facing such problems, a decision maker may need to provide uncertain, incomplete, or imprecise assessments due to a lack of information, time pressure and/or shortcomings in expertise. A multiple criteria decision-making method is then needed in order to deal with such assessments as well as for the meaningful and robust aggregation. This paper addresses these issues by applying an evidential reasoning approach to a contractor prequalification problem. The advantages and disadvantages of applying evidential reasoning to contractor prequalification problems in practice are also reported.

While clients strive hard to make the best decisions in selecting the right contractor for the right job, a clear understanding of the underlying attributes associated with contractors' selection in the context of achieving, successful project outcomes is critical. In an attempt to understand these pre-emptive qualification criteria and their links to contractors' performance on a project, a hierarchical structural model is established. By employing the structural equation modelling technique, the model adapts a total of 29 technical attributes across five confirmatory factors namely, soundness of business and workforce (SBW), planning and control (PC), quality performance (QP), past performance (PP) and overall project success (OPS). Based on the survey data collected across medium size construction projects in Australia, the results of the model confirmed that technical planning and controlling expertise of contractor is key in achieving success on projects. With a clear understanding of the significance of these factors in the context of contractors' performance, these findings could potentially contribute to the development of a company's procedures or to enhance existing knowledge of contractor prequalification practices.

J	Lo, W; Yan, MR				Lo, Wei; Yan, Min-Ren			Evaluating Qualification-Based Selection System: A Simulation Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; CRITERIA	Abnormally low bids and contractors' opportunistic bidding behavior are frequently observed in the competitive bidding system. Many research findings have pointed out that price competition itself is not sufficient to guarantee the use of economical and good quality products. The qualification-based selection (QBS) system has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. However, due to lack of supporting data, most previous studies could only assess its effectiveness based on a single case experience and subjective opinions from questionnaire surveys. Few studies have analyzed contractors' pricing behavior under the QBS system and the effects of the QBS system on market competition. This paper develops a simulation model to analyze contractors' pricing behavior and dynamic competition process under the QBS system. The research results suggest that although the QBS system has potential to encourage contractors to place more emphasis on project quality, once the price is included as one of the selection criteria, abnormally low bids could still be problematic. The success of the QBS system is highly dependent on the linkage between contractors' past performance and the evaluation of contractors' qualifications. Only when contractors' past performance is carefully and constantly examined and closely reflected in the bid evaluation can the contractors' opportunistic bidding behavior be reduced and quality products be ensured.

This evaluation process includes a financial analysis and a review of work on hand and past performance, all of which have reliable structured methods for their evaluation. Additionally, a number of subjective criteria are considered that are more difficult to capture and assess objectively but which can be modeled effectively using fuzzy logic. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how fuzzy logic and expert systems can be combined to provide a structured approach to evaluating contractors for surety underwriting purposes. Fuzzy logic is used to model both the objective and subjective factors considered in contractor evaluation using linguistic terms, and expert rules are used to capture the surety experts' reasoning process. A fuzzy expert system, SuretyAssist, is presented that can be used to provide an initial evaluation of general contractors as well as periodic reviews to determine whether or not to accept them as clients for bonding. SuretyAssist was validated using 31 actual cases of contractor evaluation and found to be accurate in 81% of the cases.

Written and/or phone surveys were conducted of 43 contractors [including both Construction Industry Institute (CTI) and non-CII members], nine owners, fourteen insurance professionals, and over 1,600 construction workers, representing 36 states and 21 trades. The data presented in this paper reveal: (1) different OSHA incident rates for contractors who keep track of accidents versus those contractors who do not; (2) different EMR and RIR for small versus large contractors; and (3) a different WCCFI for union versus open shop contractors.

In the current research, the moderating effect of engineering ethics is explored in relationship between perceived fairness and contractors' reduced potential to dispute. The data are gathered from 90 contract administrators in the construction industry of Pakistan. The results depict that decision outcome fairness, procedural fairness, quality of treatment experienced, and control indicate a significantly positive effect on the contractors' reduced potential to disputes. Additionally, engineering ethics positively moderated the relationship between the quality of treatment experienced and contractors' reduced potential to disputes. These results can guide project management teams to diminish the contractors' perceptions concerning construction claims and disputes.

Once the project is over, the testing results are kept in archives in which they are rarely re-visited or utilized. Quality testing results carry much information about the contractor performance that could be useful during the contractor evalution/selection process. Previous attempts to implement the Best value (BV) used the average performance records as the expected performance, which was utilized to evaluate contractors. The objective of this research is to develop, based on random data obtained from the contractor's performance records, a methodology that provides decision makers with the level of confidence or risk associated with the contractor selection using BV model. Simulation technique is used to develop the BV model and analysis. Field performance data have been used to obtain the Percentage Defective, which indicates the contractor's performance in the BV model. The analysis of data indicates that performance follows a normal distribution. Sensitivity analysis of the BV illustrates the sigificance of the weights in the BV model, which demands special attention when selecting the parameters' weights. The developed methodology provides the decision makers with the confidence and risk associated with their selection decision.

This study examines how relational governance influences contractors' adaptability to foreign situations and whether such associations are positively moderated by international environmental complexity. Design/methodology/approach A crosssectional survey methodology was applied to collect primary data through questionnaires sent to domestic contractors in China and South Korea (hereafter Korea). Multiple regression analysis was used to test the effects of four dimensions of relational governance on contractor adaptability. Thereafter, the Chinese and Korean subsamples were tested separately through moderated regression analysis to explore differences in the influence of relational governance on adaptability. Findings The results showed that quality communication, favor exchange and establishing an emotional relationship significantly and positively affected a contractor's adaptability. However, there were significant differences between the Chinese and Korean international contractors in terms of the moderating effects of international environment complexity. Research limitations/implications East Asian engagement in international development is not limited to China and Korea alone, and the study should be replicated using large representative samples from more countries, such as Japan, to gain a fuller understanding of the influence of relational governance. Originality/value The results have great significance for the managers of international contractors in East Asian countries and contribute to the research on relational governance and contractor adaptability.

Owners typically screen contractors by using the following key criteria: financial stability, technical ability, management capability, health and safety, and reputation. This study focuses primarily on the construction contractor's financial stability during the prequalification phase and employs a dynamic threshold cash flow based structural model (DCFM) to assess the credit quality score for each construction contractor. This model differs from the existing credit model because it only requires accounting statement information; thus, it is applicable to both publicly listed and private construction contractors. Moreover, only a small portion of companies are rated in the construction industry; this model is especially useful for owners to assess the credit quality of unrated construction companies. The Standard & Poor's issuer credit rating is used as the benchmark to evaluate the model's discrimination ability to differentiate financially qualified contractors from unqualified contractors. Additionally, the validation indicator area under curve (AUC) is utilized to demonstrate whether the DCFM can identify different credit grade firms according to the model's credit quality scores. The AUC results of the first three years of this model are 0.861, 0.833, and 0.819, indicating that this model achieves excellent discriminatory ability and is useful for assessing the credit risk of construction contractors.

This paper investigates the impact of design and scope changes on the performance of VDC tasks by adopting a hybrid research methodology that depends on interviewing and survey samples of electrical contractors. Drivers of VDC cost overruns and best practices to control and recover these costs are presented. This paper provides two contributions to the body of knowledge and industry practice of the construction engineering and management community. First, the paper presents the extent and drivers of the inefficiencies and cost overruns experienced by electrical contractors in managing VDC work scopes. Second, a set of best practices is suggested to manage, plan, and control the performance of VDC tasks of electrical contractors and other specialty contractors.

J	Elazouni, AM				Elazouni, Ashraf M.			Classifying construction contractors using unsupervised-learning neural networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; SYSTEM; PREQUALIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	Contractor prequalification involves the screening of contractors by a project owner to determine their competence to complete the project on time, within budget, and to expected quality standards. The process of prequalification involves a large number of contractors, each being represented by many attributes. A neural network model was applied to aid in the prequalification process by classifying contractors into groups based on similarity in performance using the financial ratios of liquidity, activity, profitability, and leverage. Contractors are represented in this model by patterns in four-dimensional space. Patterns of similar performance tend to form clusters intercepting regions of low pattern density in between. A neuron with weights is used as a classifier to set a decision boundary between clusters. The method basically iterates the neuron weights to move the decision boundary to a place of low pattern density. Then, the statistical hypothesis testing of the mean difference of two independent samples was used to validate the classification of the parent class to the two child classes considering the four ratios separately. The method was used hierarchically to classify a group of 245 contractors into classes of small numbers. Finally, the inferred procedure of classification proves that the neural network model classified the four-dimension pattern representing contractors efficiently.

A robust contractor prequalification decision model should include the ability of handling both quantitative and qualitative data. Support vector machine (SVM) is a set of related supervised learning methods which can handle data in a high dimensional feature space for nonlinear separable problems. A new contractor prequalification decision model using SVM is proposed to assist clients to identify qualified contractors for tendering in this study. A case study was used to validate the proposed decision model and the classification ability was compared with neural networks (NNs) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that the proposed SVM model outperforms NN and PCA and the merits of using SVM to mitigate the limitations of using NN are elaborated. The proposed decision model is an ideal alternative for supporting clients to perform contractor prequalification decision making.

The adaptive learning model suggests contractor organizations would regulate the use of a bidding strategy, which is deemed optimal in response to recurring and similar bidding situations. A data set on open tendering by a select group of contractors was gathered over six years by the Hong Kong government and used to test this premise. The behaviour of the eight newly listed contractors indicates that an upward trend of bidding competitiveness in initial bidding attempts is not a generic phenomenon. The theoretical construct of bidding behaviour in the start-up phase is therefore dubious. Data lend only partial support to the existence of rapid learning during the start-up phase. However, the five more experienced contractors (indicated by the largest number of bidding attempts) show high and consistent bidding competitiveness. This provides evidence that contractors display behavioural regularity when the optimal bidding strategy has been reached. Construction organizations are, therefore, urged to treat organizational learning strategically in their attempts to maintain high competitiveness in the bidding process.

J	Guo, HL; Yu, R; Fang, YH				Guo, Hongling; Yu, Run; Fang, Yihai			Analysis of negative impacts of BIM-enabled information transparency on contractors' interests	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Information transparency; contractors' interests; Unethical practices	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; CORRUPTION; MANAGEMENT	Building Information Modeling (BIM) generates accurate information in an explicit way and allows project stakeholders to easily access information of various types, greatly promoting information transparency during the lifecycle of a facility. Information transparency brings a number of benefits but potentially influences contractors' interests by weakening their core competencies or preventing some unethical but lucrative practices from occurring. This may impede the extensive application of BIM. However, it still lacks a comprehensive research on this. This research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the negative impact of BIM-enabled information transparency on contractors' interests and further on BIM adoption by conducting an anonymous questionnaire survey. The results show that 1) the transparency of construction techniques and methods can impair contractors' interests in the long run, but relevant information is almost not disclosed by BIM so far; 2) the transparency of construction resource, cost and time has an instant and direct impact on contractors' interests, but only resource-and-cost-related unethical practices are influenced by BIM; and 3) the transparency of construction quality and safety has little impact on contractors' interests and relevant unethical practices are almost not influenced by BIM. Besides, contractors are reluctant to share information or use BIM with owners, thus further impeding BIM adoption. Based on these results, this research also presents some implications for the improvement of current working processes among stakeholders in the BIM context to protect contractors' core competencies and prevent unethical practices. These findings are expected to promote the extensive use of BIM in the construction industry.

J	Wang, MT; Chou, HY				Wang, MT; Chou, HY			Risk allocation and risk handling of highway projects in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Risks always exist in construction projects and often cause schedule delay or cost overrun. Risk management is a key issue in project management. The first step of risk management is risk identification. It includes the recognition of potential risk event conditions in the project and the clarification of risk responsibilities. We conducted multiple-case studies using a systematic analytical procedure to identify risks in highway projects in Taiwan, to recognize risk allocation by contract clauses, and to analyze the influence of risk allocation on the contractor's risk handling strategies. The results show that the owner allocates risks by stipulating specific contract clauses into five kinds of risk allocation conditions. If a risk is more controllable by the contractor, the owner has a greater tendency to allocate the risk to the contractor. Risk allocation determines which kinds of risks the contractor would take and influences the contractor's risk handling decisions. The analysis furthermore indicates that, if the probability of a certain risk event condition is uncontrollable, then with the increasing possibility of taking the risk, the contractor's tendency of risk handling changes from actively transferring the risk to passively retaining the risk. In contrast, if a risk is controllable and certainly allocated to the contractor, the contractor tends to take the initiative to reduce the impact caused by the risk event rather than retain the risk.

J	Zhao, ZY; Xu, K; Zuo, J; Tang, C				Zhao, Zhen Yu; Xu, Ke; Zuo, Jian; Tang, Chao			Developing the International Construction Contracting Market: Enterprise Niche Approach	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						International construction market; International contractors; Enterprise niche; Competition comparison	COMPETITIVENESS; PERFORMANCE	The international construction industry has gained a rapid growth during the past decades. The contracting revenue of the top 250 international contractors reached US$1430.8 billion in 2014, of which more than one third was derived from the overseas market. However, there are significant challenges associated with the international construction market. Included is over competition in some regional markets, which is detrimental to the international contractors' business. Therefore, international contractors are in urgent need of accurate understanding of the international construction market and competition situation. Based on the enterprise niche theory, indicators for niche width and niche overlap of international contractors are defined in this paper. Consequently, measurement methods were proposed to describe the diversification and utilization of international market resources, as well as the similarity of the international target market and the level of competitiveness among contractors. The statistics on contracting revenue of the top 250/225 international contractors published by Engineering News-Record (ENR) in the past five years were critically analyzed. Consequently, the niches of international contractors from 13 main countries were measured. Results show that niche widths of international contractors vary according to geography and product dimension. All these countries can be divided into four competitive groups according to the calculation of niche overlap and clustering analysis. The model proposed in this study introduces new insights into the theories of enterprise niche. Similarly, it provides a valuable reference for examining characteristics and patterns of competition within the international construction contracting market.

J	Awwad, R				Awwad, Rita			Evolutionary Simulation of Contractors' Learning and Behavior under Two Bid-Tendering Approaches	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Evolutionary simulation; Low bid method; Average bid method; Markup; Risk aversion; Profit utility; Bid prices	DECISION-MAKING; BIDDING MODELS; SELECTION; SUPPORT	Bidding and determining the optimum markup are two major decisions that a contractor has to think about thoroughly when faced with a new project. Several bidding models have been presented in the literature to help contractors make these two decisions; however, they mostly considered the perspective of one contractor bidding on a single project, obscuring the interaction and learning components among contractors and the observation of emergent bidding patterns at both individual and aggregate levels. This research uses an evolutionary approach to model construction-bidding market dynamics and study the effect of contractors' risk attitude on their markups, and on the long-term progression of bid prices under two bid-tendering approaches, namely the low and average bid methods. Simulation results showed that the most risk-tolerant contractors submit the lowest bid prices under the low-bid method and the highest prices under the average bid method. Moreover, the low-bid approach revealed long-term equilibrium in tendered prices whereas the average bid method reflected a gradual bid-price increase. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The process of selection is subjected to uncertainty and influence of criteria other than bid price. This paper presents an approach to prioritize competitive contractors at the prebidding stage for highway projects by utilizing the analytic network process (ANP) and Monte Carlo simulation. Both techniques are integrated on a single platform to build the proposed model. Initially, the main quantitative and qualitative criteria affecting the contractors' selection process are identified and studied. The effective criteria in the selection process were obtained from experts and literature. A structured questionnaire was designed and sent to experts in highway projects. The ANP was used to prioritize these criteria subsequently, and Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to develop the selection model. The applicability of the proposed model was tested using four real cases of highway projects. It was concluded that using the lowest bid price as a sole criterion for selecting the best contractors may not result in an optimum solution. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Previous studies have identified various indicators for assessing contractor competitiveness, and several assessment methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, these studies are limited because they are unable to tell which indicators are more important in different market environments. This paper identifies the key competitiveness indicators (KCIs) for assessing contractor competitiveness in the Chinese construction market. An index value is used to indicate the relative significance of various competitiveness indicators based on which KCIs are identified. The data applied in this study are from a survey of the construction industry in mainland China. The research findings provide valuable information for both existing businesses and the construction professionals who plan to compete for construction works in the Chinese market. The study provides useful references for further studies that compare the KCIs used in the Chinese construction industry and those used in other construction industries.

Most refurbishment work, however, involves a high level of risk, uncertainty, and coordination, which are likely to cause asymmetric information between contractors and residents in a refurbishment process. Most private refurbishment contractor selections are usually based on word-of-mouth referrals that lack a systematic and objective assessment method. This Study proposes a hybrid approach combining fuzzy set theory and quality function deployment (QFD) to establish a housing refurbishment contractor selection model. With this model, residents can select an optimal refurbishment contractor according to requirements. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model. a known multiple criteria decision-making method. PROMETHEE, is applied to compare the results of contractor selections. The result reveals that the proposed hybrid fuzzy-QFD approach can be expected to be successful and has potential for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Arditi, D; Yasamis, F				Arditi, D; Yasamis, F			Incentive/disincentive contracts: Perceptions of owners and contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION; INCENTIVES	Incentive/disincentive (I/D) contracting has developed from basic cost- and profit-sharing arrangements between an owner and a contractor. To motivate the contractor to put in an extra effort to realize one or more project objectives of an accelerated, costly, and complex undertaking, the owner may offer an award to the contractor. The owner may also threaten the contractor with a penalty if the objectives are not met. This paper reviews the fundamental incentive/disincentive arrangements in contracting literature. Then, results are reported of a survey conducted on a sample of Illinois DOT highway contracts that included I/D provisions. The survey investigates whether there exists an agreement or disagreement between IDOT's and the contractors' perceptions of I/D contract provisions. The findings reveal how I/D contract milestones are established, how they are executed, what kind of work practices the contractor uses to fulfill I/D targets, and how the contracting parties perceive I/D contracts' effectiveness as opposed to non-I/D contracts. Certain issues pointed out by the respondents as problematic and in need of further refinement in I/D applications are also highlighted.

This study finds that the efficiency of Hong Kong contractors is associated with their managerial capability to control business costs and financial capability to manage both short-term and long-term capital liquidity. The efficiency of Mainland China contractors is also associated with their managerial capability to control business and administrative costs but not with their financial capability to maintain capital liquidity. Theoretically, this study shows that managerial and technological abilities are two common factors that transcend different institutions and systems. Hong Kong is the freest economy in the world, whereas the economy of Mainland China is more regulated. Methodologically, data envelopment analysis is adopted to establish the efficiency scores of contractors to be analyzed by panel data regression, which controls individual contractor's return to scale. Few construction competitiveness studies have attempted this methodological process, which can be replicated for future research in other countries, at different stages of their economic development, to ensure equally useful measures for cross-country comparison and to promote the sustainable developments of their construction industries.

However, because of the competitive nature of the construction industry, this traditional arrangement can result in adversarial relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, which can jeopardize potential or ongoing collaborative construction plans. To avoid this problem, close, long-term relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, as in strategic partnerships, must be established. Unfortunately, forming and sustaining such relationships can be time-consuming and cost-intensive. Furthermore, this type of relationship does not necessarily enhance cooperation or work performance. For contractors to successfully establish effective partnerships with their subcontractors, they must select the appropriate relationship by considering the different characteristics of the subcontracted work involved. Based on transaction cost theory, the findings of this study show that transaction costs incurred by general contractors and subcontractors vary according to the type of relationship established. Therefore, for the purpose of comparing transaction costs incurred in both competitive and partnership relationships, transaction-cost-based profit models for both general contractors and subcontractors are developed, respectively, for each relationship type. As well, by applying different strategies to maximize profits in each relationship, and by simulating the parameters affecting the nature of the subcontracted work, the conditions and relationships under which general contractors' profits are optimized have been determined. Finally, based on simulation, practical guidelines for choosing the most appropriate relationship type are proposed.

J	Polat, G; Donmez, U				Polat, Gul; Donmez, Umit			MARKETING MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS OF CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES: EVIDENCE FROM TURKISH CONTRACTORS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						marketing management; construction companies; questionnaire; Turkey	FIRMS; PROJECTS	Globalization, the restructuring of the world economy, changes experienced in project financing and delivery systems, the pervasive utilization of information and communication technologies (ICT), and the intensity of the competition prevailing in the market compel contractors to rethink the competitive forces and client expectations, which in turn necessitate a well planned marketing orientation for business planning. The Turkish construction industry is not different from the global construction industry in the context of intense competitiveness as Turkish contractors do not only undertake projects in the domestic market but also in foreign markets including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Middle East, Europe, Asia, etc. They also often face intense competition from local and foreign companies such as U. S., Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, U. K., and Korean contractors. Given the intense competition, effective marketing of their services is imperative for Turkish contractors in achieving competitive advantage. This study explores the marketing management functions of Turkish construction companies and the extent to which they carry out traditional marketing practices via a questionnaire survey of 71 Turkish contractors. The survey results revealed that Turkish contractors made use of marketing management functions to some extent, yet responding contractors did not attach adequate importance to differentiating their products/services from the products/services offered by their competitors. Since achieving client satisfaction by means of product and/or service differentiation is the ultimate goal, Turkish contractors should carry out all of the traditional marketing practices in order to differentiate themselves in the market, and thereby create competitive advantage.

At the same time, enhancing the satisfaction of participants not only helps in problem solving but also improves their motivation and cooperation. However, previous research related to participant satisfaction is primarily concerned with clients and customers and relatively little attention has been paid to contractors. This paper investigates how the performance of project participants affects contractor project satisfaction in terms of the client's clarity of objectives (OC) and promptness of payments (PP), designer carefulness (DC), construction risk management (RM), the effectiveness of their contribution (EW) and mutual respect and trust (RT). With 125 valid responses from contractors in Malaysia, a contractor satisfaction model is developed based on structural equation modelling. The results demonstrate the necessity for dividing abstract satisfaction into two dimensions, comprising economic-related satisfaction (ES) and production-related satisfaction (PS), with DC, OC, PP and RM having significant effects on ES, while DC, OC, EW and RM influence PS. In addition, the model tests the indirect effects of these performance variables on ES and PS. In particular, OC indirectly affects ES and PS through mediation of RM and DC respectively. The results also provide opportunities for improving contractor satisfaction and supplementing the contractor selection criteria for clients. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Qian, QZ; Zhang, LY				Qian, Qinzhen; Zhang, Lianying			Impact of Regulatory Focus on Choice of Project-Governance Modes: Role of Tolerance of Opportunistic Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Regulatory focus; Tolerance of opportunistic behavior; Project governance; Construction project; Owner-contractor relationship	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTROL STRATEGIES; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; COOPERATION; PERSPECTIVE; MECHANISMS; DECISION; OUTCOMES; TEAMS	Trust and formal control are two typical project governance modes used to manage contractor opportunistic behavior in owner-contractor relationships for construction projects. However, the question of what affects the owner's choice of the two project governance modes remains unclear. This study applies regulatory focus theory to describe owner motivation orientation and tolerance of opportunistic behavior to represent the owner's attitude to the contractor's opportunistic behavior. In doing so, it reveals the role of owners' regulatory focus and their tolerance of contractor opportunistic behavior on their choices between trust and formal control. The questionnaire data were analyzed with partial-least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to verify the theoretical hypotheses. The results show that owners' tolerance of opportunistic behavior can affect their choices between trust and formal control. That is, the higher the tolerance level of contractor opportunistic behavior, the more likely the owner will choose trust to relieve contractor opportunistic behavior, conversely, an owner with a lower tolerance level of contractor opportunistic behavior exhibits a stronger propensity to use formal control. In addition, the promotion focus of owners can increase their tolerance levels of contractor opportunistic behavior, but their prevention focus does not have a significant effect on such a tolerance level. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by empirically confirming that owners' inherent characteristics (motivation orientations and attitudes) play a significant role in predicting their choices of different project governance modes. The findings can help owners to understand their own motivation orientations and preference concerning project governance modes as well as those of contractors so as to wisely and rationally use the governance modes under various circumstances.

Modeling the Dynamics of Heavy Equipment Management Practices and Downtime in Large Highway Contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Machine downtime is invariably perceived as one of the most critical problems faced by highway contractors. Attempts to reduce downtime often result in failure due to the dynamic behaviors between equipment management practices and downtime. This paper is thus intended to highlight the dynamics of heavy equipment management practices and downtime in large highway contractors and utilizes them as a framework in constructing a simulation model using a system dynamics approach. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with equipment managers from five different large highway contractors in Thailand. The finding reveals that, to be successful in alleviating downtime, contractors must view their practices on equipment management as an integration of multiple feedback processes, which are interrelated and interdependent with downtime. Based on various validation tests, the simulation model is deemed appropriate in representing the equipment management system as related to downtime of large highway contractors. The research is of value in facilitating better understanding on the dynamics of equipment management practices and downtime as well as their interdependency.

Different from existing contractor-default prediction models, this research uses a much larger contractor sample in empirical analyses to alleviate sample-selection biases, and employs a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve to assess the model performance. Empirical results of this study show that the proposed model outperforms traditional financial ratio models in differentiating the risk of defaulted and nondefaulted construction contractors. Additionally, the barrier option model has markedly better discriminatory power than when applied to non-construction-related industries. The results of this paper support the postulation that the barrier option model has significant advantages for the construction industry. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000465.

J	Shrestha, K; Shrestha, PP; Lidder, M				Shrestha, Kishor; Shrestha, Pramen P.; Lidder, Mylinh			Life-cycle cost comparison of chip seal and striping: in-house workers versus private contractors	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Construction; Estimating; Lifestyle costing		Purpose To maintain road systems in the USA, state departments of transportation (DOTs) generally use in-house workers or private contractors. Limited studies have calculated the cost savings of hiring private contractors; however, most of them have not calculated cost savings based on life-cycle costs (LCCs). The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the LCC of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by in-house workers are cheaper than those performed by private contractors. Design/methodology/approach The paper collected the hard cost data of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by state DOT in-house workers, as well as private contractors, from 2003 to 2016 from the Nevada DOT Maintenance and Asset Management division. Statistical tests were conducted to test the research hypothesis that the LCC of chip seal and stripping activities performed by in-house workers are significantly less than those performed by private contractors. Findings The study results showed that the cost per unit and LCC of chip seal and striping work performed by in-house workers were significantly less than those performed by private contractors in Nevada. Research limitations/implications - The study only collected data from Nevada DOT, so readers should use caution in generalizing the findings of this study. Additionally, factors affecting the cost of these maintenance activities for private contractors are significantly different compared to in-house contractors. Therefore, these differences may be some of the potential reasons for cost difference between these two methods. Practical implications - The practical implications of this study are that state DOT engineers need to plan for outsourcing chip seal and stripping maintenance activities only to private contractors that are cost effective, based on life-cycle cost. Originality/value The LCC analysis framework developed in this study will help state DOT engineers to determine cost savings by using in-house workers for road maintenance works.

To identify a new model with better prediction of business failure of the construction contractors, this study utilized long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The financial ratios of the construction contractors in the United States were collected, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Tomek links were employed to obtain a balanced data set. The proposed LSTM RNN model was evaluated by comparing its accuracy and F1-score with feedforward neural network (FNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models for the optimized parameters selected from a grid search with five-fold cross-validation. The results successfully demonstrate that the prediction performance of the proposed LSTM RNN model outperforms FNN and SVM models for both test and original data set. Therefore, the proposed LSTM RNN model is a promising alternative to assist managers, investors, auditors, and government entities in predicting business failure of construction contractors, and can also be adapted to other industry cases.

In the traditional single criterion bidding method, the markup decision has a significant impact on a contractor's business success. Contractors usually take into consideration several factors in the process of determining their markup. This study has reviewed the literature and identified a range of contractors' behaviors when making their markup decision within a competitive bidding environment. An additive markup function consisting of three components, namely competition, risk, and need for work, was developed in order to replicate markup behaviors of contractors. Then, agent-based modeling has been employed for simulating the bidding process within a market formed of a set of heterogeneous contractors with different risk attitudes and defined markup behaviors. This model was used to study the impact of considering need for work and risk allowance in markup determination on financial performance of contractors in various market scenarios. Results suggest that the optimal policy is moderation in both dimensions of risk attitude and need for work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The best-value (BV) procurement process uses other key factors as well as bid price in the evaluation and selection of the best-performing contractor for the job. Contract time, lane rental, warranty, and quality of delivered product are examples of the key factors that indicate the contractor-expected performance. Literature on best value shows a need for analyzing the past performance of the contractor in similar jobs as an indicator of his/her qualification trend. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a methodology to incorporate quality of delivered product in the BV procurement system of asphalt construction. The paper uses past quality control (QC) testing results and utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that the contractor gets full payment as an indication of qualification trend. The QC data were obtained from the Nebraska Department of Roads for a number of Superpave pavement projects. The results show the possibility of assigning a quality score for the contractor based on the past performance. This paper contributes to the current practice of best value with a new approach of employing QC as part of the selection process.

This limitation explains the reluctance of contractors to undergo interviews. Existing research (outside bid/no-bid and margin decision factor identification and subsequent decision modeling development) only begins to provide insights into key tendering stages, particularly around risk assessments and corporate review processes. Early research suggested one to three review stages. However, when considering the whole work procurement process from prospect identification to contract execution, five to seven series of reviews can be arguably applied by some contractors, wherein some reviews stepped through several layers of internal senior management. Tendering processes were presented as flowchart models that traditionally follow "hard" system (rectangular shapes and straight line arrows) steps, which suggest that a precise process also leads to precise results. However, given that contractors do not win every tender they submit, the process is less precise than that suggested in rigidly structured flowcharts. Twenty-five detailed semi-structured interviews were held with purposely selected high-profile publicly and privately owned construction companies in Australia with significantly varied turnovers. Analyses show that contractors are concerned about the negative effects of increasing corporate governance demands, with many stating that people involved are the most critical element to tendering success. A new way of presenting the ITP of contractors is assessed using a soft systems methodology (SSM) approach. SSM offers an alternative way of considering human interaction challenges within the ITP of contractors, which needs to be tested with the industry. The format graphics of SSM guidelines are presented as a way of offering contractors a different approach, which may assist individuals who are looking to re-structure their tendering activities in a more humanistic and less rigid procedural approach.

This paper considers a risk-averse owner (he) who engages a risk-neutral contractor (she) to complete a project when the contractor's overtime cost information is unknown to the owner. The owner designs a menu of incentive contracts for the contractor to choose/to negotiate with the contractor to maximize his profit. The incentive payment is determined by the saved time relative to the predetermined deadline. We provide optimal incentive contract menus under symmetric and asymmetric information settings, respectively. Moreover, by comparing the terms of optimal incentive contracts under both information settings, we find that even though the duration of a low-cost contractor will not change with the information setting. However, the owner has to pay more to induce the low-cost contractor to choose the appropriate contract under the asymmetric information setting. Meanwhile, the high-cost contractor receives less payment and completes the project later under the asymmetric information setting. In addition, we find the value of information increases with the level of risk aversion and the gap of costs, and is concave with respect to the probability of high-cost type or that of low-cost type. Finally, we use real data to verify our theoretical findings.

MANAGEMENT OF TIME AND COST CONTINGENCIES IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: A CONTRACTOR PERSPECTIVE	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contractor; contingency; opportunity; risk; Spain; threat; uncertainty	RISK; PERFORMANCE	The management of threats and opportunities plays a key-role in enhancing project performance. However, there is a gap in literature concerning how general contractors manage threats and opportunities in construction projects, in particular in the use of time and cost contingencies. This research partially addresses this gap through a case study of two large Spanish construction companies. The research presented two key factors determining how the contractors analyzed manage time and cost contingencies: project objectives and existing mistrust among the contractor's team members. The research also found that managers use time and cost contingencies not only to manage threats, but also as tools for managing opportunities, thereby providing insight into a previously undescribed form of contingency: the negative contingency. the research results enable a better understanding of the actual behavior of general contractors, which contributes to paving the way for developing enhanced methods for contingencies management.

Project Impacts of Specialty Mechanical Contractor Design Involvement in the Health Care Industry: Comparative Case Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design; build; Project delivery; Contractors; Case studies; Comparative studies; Mechanical systems; Design-build; Project delivery; Specialty contractor; Mechanical contractor; Collaboration; Contracting	DELIVERY; BUILD	Recent research efforts on project delivery have been heavily focused on using project-level indicators to predict cost and schedule outcomes. However, specialty contractors performing at the system level have an increasingly important role in the design and construction of healthcare and other high-performance facilities. From curtain wall assemblies to HVAC systems, specialty contractors possess the system knowledge and field expertise to support delivery of energy-efficient, cost-effective systems. Therefore, this research adapted the use of existing metrics from broader, project-level applications to a narrower building system, focused to contextualize the importance of system delivery. A comparative case study analysis was conducted to collect quantitative data on schedule and cost outcomes, construction safety, and building energy performance on two large healthcare facilities. By comparing a design-build and design-assist case, this paper demonstrates how increasing design involvement of mechanical contractors provides opportunities to reduce cost growth, schedule growth, and safety incidents, and improve the HVAC system performance in healthcare projects. Contextual lessons from the design-build case are discussed and suggested for application in other forms of project delivery.

Given the importance of workplace safety, awarding the contract to safer contractors can enhance project performance outcomes in terms of safety, quality, cost, and schedule. Safety maturity is one quality of a construction organization encompassing interdependent factors that can be used to evaluate expected safety performance. However, there is no formal decision-making framework available in literature that owners can use to evaluate contractor safety maturity. The present study aims to bridge this gap in safety knowledge by proposing a decision-making framework that can be used to evaluate the safety maturity of construction contractors. Development of the decision-making framework included two tasks. First, an integrative literature review to identify influential safety maturity factors and their potential indicators was performed. The result of the review revealed seven factors (safety leading indicators, safety lagging indicators, safety and supervisory personnel, system maturity and resiliency, preconstruction services, technology and innovation, and safety culture) that influence the safety maturity of construction contractors. Second, the identified factors, and their indicators, were integrated into a formal multicriteria decision-making method, referred to as Choosing by Advantages, to evaluate the safety maturity of five construction contractors on a selected case study project. The proposed framework is expected to provide practical and theoretical directions on how to evaluate contractor safety maturity using relevant evaluation factors and sound decision-making methods.

J	Oke, AE				Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel			Bonding capability of Nigerian contracting firms	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Guarantee; Bond; Contracting firm; Project stakeholder	CONSTRUCTION; IMPACT	Purpose The ability of construction contractors to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors depends on capital, experience, capacity and continuity. Using these criteria, the purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the bonding capacity of Nigerian contractors. Design/methodology/approach Factors required for bonding were examined based on a set of questions addressed to managers of contracting firms and personnel involved in issuing bonds and guarantees in commercial banks and insurance companies. The scorecard approach was employed to determine the bonding capability of the contractors. Findings Contractors' financial strength and past performance on previous projects are the two important factors considered by guarantors in granting bond to contractors. However, the condition surrounding the bond, the legal capacity of the guarantor to issue bond and the identity of the guarantor are mostly considered by contractors in approaching a potential guarantor. Using the scorecard approach, about one-third of contractors have the necessary requirements to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors. This ability of contractors is affected by years of experience of the firm but not by their location nor years of experience of their manager. Practical implications It is necessary for contracting firms to increase their capital base through merging, borrowing, etc., and also engage experienced professionals and workers in the execution of construction projects, as this will eventually improve their bonding ability. Social implications The study is limited to construction contractors registered with Ondo and Lagos State Governments and guarantors that are banks and insurance companies in Nigeria. Originality/value The paper specified various areas of concerns for Nigerian contracting firms in their bid to enhance their bonding ability. This will help them in overcoming various challenges and bottlenecks that may arise in securing bonds and guarantees from guarantors.

Contractor prequalification procedure makes it possible to admit for tendering only competent contractor. Prequalification is a multi-criteria decision problem that is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty and vagueness in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgement of the decision maker. This paper presents a systematic prequalification procedure, based on Fuzzy Set Theory, whose main differences and advantages in comparison with other models are the use of an algorithm to handle the inconsistencies in the fuzzy preference relation when pair-wise comparison judgements are used and the use of linguistic assessment or exact assessment of performance of the contractors on qualitative or quantitative criterion, respectively. Finally, a case study for the rehabilitation project of a building at Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed model and to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Critical Success Factors for Competitiveness of Contractors: China Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES; INDUSTRY; INFORMATION; ADVANTAGE; STRATEGY; FIRM	Gaining or maintaining a "contractor's" competitive advantage is not easy as it is determined by a large number of factors. Identification of critical success factors (CSFs) allows one to reduce the vast number of factors to some manageable few but vital ones. Based on the CSFs, contractors' limited resources such as money and manpower can be allocated and aligned appropriately for yielding a maximum outcome of overall competitiveness. This paper describes the CSFs identified from a survey study carried out in Mainland China. The ranking analysis of the survey results shows that 35 factors are rated as critical for determining the competitiveness of a contractor. Factor analysis reveals that the 35 CSFs identified can be grouped into eight clusters, namely, project management skills, organization structure, resources, competitive strategy, relationships, bidding, marketing, and technology. The CSFs in this study provide a vehicle for guiding a contractor in managing its resources in order to improve competitive advantage. The study also provides insights into the management of competitiveness for contractors that are operating in the particular context of the Chinese construction industry.

J	Shi, L; He, YJ; Onishi, M; Kobayashi, K				Shi, Lei; He, Yujia; Onishi, Masamitsu; Kobayashi, Kiyoshi			Double Moral Hazard and Risk-Sharing in Construction Projects	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ethics; Hazards; Contracts; Planning; Venture capital; Supply chains; Insurance; Construction projects; cost overrun risk; double moral hazard; incentive contract; risk-sharing	CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES; CONTRACTS; OPPORTUNISM; INFORMATION; MARKET; COORDINATION; MECHANISM	Construction projects are riddled with risks that should be shared by both owners and contractors alike. The principal-agent theory has proven to be an influential theoretical apparatus in designing optimal risk-sharing rules and provides contractors with proper incentives to improve project efficiencies. According to the principal-agent theory, it is optimal to let the contractor assume all of the risk if it is risk-neutral. However, this article argues that this theoretical model may lead to a biased incentive structure. To demonstrate this point, this article analyzes the necessity of risk-sharing between the owner and risk-neutral contractor in construction projects. Taking into account cases where the respective planning efforts of the owner and contractor are supposed to be unverifiable and mutually complementary in terms of cost overrun risk, we find that either double moral hazard (i.e., both parties take opportunistic strategies) or inefficient breach of contract by the contractor occurs if the contractor assumes the entire cost overrun risk. An optimal risk-sharing strategy, therefore, plays an important role in coordinating both parties to choose efficient strategies.

J	Kim, HJ; Reinschmidt, KF				Kim, Hyung-Jin; Reinschmidt, Kenneth F.			Effects of Contractors' Risk Attitude on Competition in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational risk attitude; Competitive success; Evolutionary approach; Competitive bidding; Market structure; ENR top 400 contractors	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; CORPORATE CULTURE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; RETURN PARADOX; INDUSTRY	Competitive bidding is the major mechanism of competition. Bidding is risky because the actual cost of the job is unknown. Thus, the bid should be high enough to make a profit but low enough to win the bidding. The result of competition depends on the competitor's risk-taking behaviors, which are affected by the organization's risk attitudes. A contractor's risk-taking is an essential element of the construction business. The current study explores the domain of competition at the aggregate market level. An evolutionary simulation model was developed to investigate the effects of risk attitude on a contractor's success and on the market structure. The analysis accounts for different risk-taking behaviors in competition, different performances by contractors, corresponding organizational changes, and aggregate patterns in the form of the market structure. The study finds that risk attitude is a competitive characteristic of contractors. The results provide new insight on competition in the market place, and explanations are given for a contractor's competitive success. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000284.

While comprehensive and ongoing CI applications are employed in a variety of industries to provide valuable input for broad strategic decisions, the construction industry lags behind in adopting this methodology. The use of CI for contract management is an important development in light of the realization on the part of major construction contractors that the diffuse nature of the information and lack of robust analysis create numerous uncertainties during the decision-making processes. The findings of this paper show that Cl has the potential to improve the process for assessing and selecting contractors, through supporting an unbiased and auditable decision making process. A case-study on using Cl for contractor selection on a megaproject in the industrial sector is presented along with the guidelines for the use and implementation of Cl in the construction industry as a whole.

J	Wirahadikusumah, RD; Ario, D				Wirahadikusumah, Reini D.; Ario, Dion			A readiness assessment model for Indonesian contractors in implementing sustainability principles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						contractors; readiness; model; assessment; sustainable construction		While the sustainability concept has gained recognition in Indonesia, contractors have been slowly implementing the principles in construction projects. An assessment model was developed as a tool to identify the baseline conditions of contractors' readiness, i.e. awareness, willingness, and capacity towards sustainability practices. The model involves parameters and indicators derived from green building and green contractor concepts, and sustainable construction best practices. The scoring system for these parameters and indicators was set up through discussions with experts using the Delphi method facilitated by the Ministry of Public Works. Trial surveys were conducted to refine the model. A preliminary portrayal of existing conditions in Indonesia was assessed using the proposed readiness assessment model. This limited survey indicated that while large contractors are fully aware and willing, they have been only partly implementing sustainability practices. Because the process of developing the model had involved experts and champions of the industry/stakeholders, and was also led by the government/Ministry of Public Works, the proposed assessment model should be inherently acceptable for industry-wide application.

Analyses of respondent data identified methods and trends associated with: contractor creditworthiness evaluation; suppliers' debt collection methods; and the efficiency, or otherwise, of these techniques. Trend observation highlighted a number of results, including: the minimal resources allocated to debtor evaluation; the 'questionable' methods used for establishing credit limits; and the minimal use of insurance and/or factoring for protection against bad debt. A number of questions emanate from these results concerning the efficacy of current practices and the need for future research into contractor creditworthiness evaluation. The paper reinforces that construction contractor creditworthiness evaluation and debt collection procedures have received minimal research to date and, that this situation requires addressing.

A contractor's quality assurance system is essential in preventing problems and the reoccurrence of problems. This system ensures consistent quality for the contractor's clients. An evaluation of the quality systems of 15 construction contractors in Saudi Arabia is discussed here. The evaluation was performed against the ISO 9000 standard. The contractors' quality systems vary in complexity, ranging from an informal inspection and test system to a comprehensive system. The ISO 9000 clauses most often complied with are those dealing with (1) inspection and test status; (2) inspection and testing; (3) control of nonconformance product; and (4) handling, storage, and preservation. The clauses least complied with concern (1) design control; (2) internal auditing; (3) training; and (4) statistical techniques. Documentation of a quality system is scarce for the majority of the contractors.

Investigating the causes preventing the fulfillment of construction contract requirements	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction management; Questionnaire survey; Contractor failure; Contract requirements	BUSINESS FAILURE; PROJECTS; PERSPECTIVE; TIME	Purpose Construction contractors in Palestine, as in many other developing countries, suffer from many problems. One of their main problems is their inability to meet contractual requirements, such as completing projects within time, at the agreed cost and to the desired quality. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the causes of the non-fulfillment of contractual requirements in three different types of projects: building, road and electro-mechanical projects. Design/methodology/approach Two methods were adopted to collect the data - qualitative and quantitative. In total, 65 causes were identified from the literature and qualitative semi-structured interviews with professional experts. These causes were classified into five categories: managerial, financial, contractor capabilities, regulations and laws and political. In the quantitative approach, a questionnaire was developed and then distributed to 50 professional experts: 20 building experts, 15 road experts and 15 experts in electro-mechanical projects. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess the importance, from the perspective of the subject matter experts, of the causes that had been identified. About 35 responses, which represent a combined response rate of 70%, were received. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with the mean, standard deviation and degree of importance for each of the identified causes being determined, and the SPSS software platform used to rank them. Findings The results reveal that the most important reasons why contractors did not fulfill their contractual requirements in building projects were that contracts were awarded to the contractor offering the lowest price, and the profit margin was low because of intense competition among contractors. In road projects, the most important causes were the poor estimation of the equipment required and a lack of standardized conditions in the construction sector, while in electro-mechanical projects, the most important causes were the inability of the contractor to estimate the cost of the project accurately because of unclear bid documents and a lack of contractor capital. Originality/value The results of this study will be useful to stakeholders and Palestinian contractor unions. They can be disseminated to give guidance so that contractors can avoid these problems in future construction projects and enhance their compliance with contractual requirements. Moreover, knowing about these causes may lead to the reduction of conflicts and disputes between contractual parties (owners and contractors), which in turn will be reflected in the work quality and reputation of contractors.

Managing engineering contractors in the UK petrochemicals industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Outsourcing; Governance; Maintenance; Employer Panel; Engineering contractors; Mandated collaboration	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; SUPPLY CHAIN; MANDATED COLLABORATION; GOVERNANCE; INTEGRATION; NETWORK; MARKET; POWER; OIL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate, at the industry level, the modes of governance used by multinational companies in the UK petrochemical industry to outsource maintenance activities to engineering contractors. The study focusses on a form of novel governance structure called an Employer Panel (EP). Design/methodology/approach - The study applies an inductive case study method to investigate the contractor governance mechanisms in 19 out of the 20 major petrochemical instillations located in the UK. Data included interviews, documentary and secondary evidence gathered from the cases and also industry bodies. Findings - The study uncovered three distinct types of governance mode: market, managing contractor, and EP of contractors. The latter relies on the governance process of "mandated collaboration" to coordinate. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is the focus on a particular industry, albeit an important one. The research implications include extending the empirical research into other sectors which use on-site contracted maintenance such as ship and aircraft manufacturing. Practical implications - The EP structure with its mandated collaboration process is of value to managers of contractual relationships as it gives insights into coordinative process and it may provide an alternative model for managing outsourcing relationships. Social implications - The mandated collaborative process requires clients to engage its contractors in longer term relationships, thus increasing corporate social responsibility and providing wider job security for contractor employees. Originality/value - The EPmode, as far as can be ascertained, has not been addressed in the literature before.	[Ritson, Neil Henry; Wilson, Mark M.

J	Jung, W; Han, SH; Koo, B; Jang, W				Jung, Wooyong; Han, Seung H.; Koo, Bonsang; Jang, Woosik			Which Strategies Are More Effective for International Contractors during Boom and Recession Periods?	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						International construction; Diversification; Localization; Strategic alliance; Resources allocation; Financial soundness	CONSTRUCTION FIRMS; DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; JOINT VENTURES; RISK; PROJECTS; MODEL; ENTRY; INFRASTRUCTURE; OPTIMIZATION	Given the global financial crisis and other plummeting market conditions in 2008, the international construction market moved from boom to recession. Although this recession is expected to be completed soon, many international contractors still have difficulty deciding on the strategies that are more effective during volatile market conditions. Korean contractors have already experienced one recession in recent times, instigated by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and two boom economies before and after this recession. To investigate more effective strategies used in the overseas construction market, this study evaluates 31 Korean contractors' international performance over the different periods (boom, recession, and reboom) and analyses the effects of diversification, localization, strategic alliance, resources cost allocation, and financial soundness by using 14 key variables. The results showed that regional diversification had a profound effect on overcoming the recessionary periods. Localization was also strongly positive, specifically during the reboom period. Particularly, the outperforming contractors were found to increase the level of localization and the proportion of joint ventures with third countries' contractors across the different periods. These findings are expected to assist international contractors in developing more effective strategies given fluctuating global economic conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000087.

Due the complex nature of the procurement problems such as prequalification exercises, the robust models are rarely attempted. The research reported in this paper presents an overview of potential suitability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for contractor/consultant prequalification transactions in the construction project procurements. Furthermore, the performance of SVM is compared with specific artificial neural network outcomes. The results obtained from practical datasets indicate encouraging potentials for SVM applications in the procurement problems such as prequalification and contractor selection. Hence, a SVM-based decision support framework is proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed framework differentiates among different sizes of contractors and uses a reasoning model that goes deeply into the heart of the decision making process. Hence, it helps to clarify the complex picture regarding the two sequential decisions and allows the users to follow the methodology used and the steps followed in reaching the final decisions. In order to see the degree to which SCBMD mirrors actual industry practices, it was implemented to 100 different real bidding situations. An accuracy of 86% was reached in simulating actual bid/no bid decisions of the contractors while the average difference in markup percentages proposed by the software and the contractors was found as 1.75%. Moreover, the software was evaluated for its timeliness under varying bidding conditions and found very effective especially for the cases where the contractor would like to reach decision alternatives for different possible scenarios of the same bidding situation.

In this Study, a fuzzy logic-based artificial neural network (ANN) model, called the fuzzy neural network (FNN) model, is Constructed to assist contractors in making markup decisions. With the fuzzy logic inference system integrated inside, the FNN model provides users with a clear explanation to justify the rationality of the estimated markup Output. Meanwhile, with the self-learning ability of ANN, the accuracy the estimation results is improved. From a Survey and interview with local contractors, the factors that affect markup estimation and the rules applied in the markup decision are identified. Based on the finding, both ANN and FNN models were constructed and trained in different project scenarios. The comparison of the two models shows that FNN will assist contractors with markup estimation with more accurate results and convincing user-defined linguistic rules inside.

J	Anderson, SD; Patil, SS; Sullivan, G				Anderson, SD; Patil, SS; Sullivan, G			Optimizing owner/contractor core competencies for capital programs	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper proposes a process to help managers of capital project organizations, within owner companies, select key competencies for their capital programs and, where appropriate, leverage contractor personnel and expertise. The process involves evaluation of owner and contractor competencies and determination of the best possible sourcing strategy for each competency required in the owner's capital program. The sourcing strategy is defined in terms of work relationships that clearly identify primary and secondary roles and responsibilities. The resulting work structure helps owners and contractors avoid gaps and eliminate overlaps in their work relationships. The proposed process also provides an approach to evaluate alignment of work structures between owner's corporate objectives and their capital programs. Work structure and alignment indicators consider project delivery approaches, contract types, organizational relationships, and other relevant factors such as proprietary technology. Thus, this paper provides a decision process that can help managers optimize owner and contractor competencies for capital program success.

J	Pinto, JK; Slevin, DP; English, B				Pinto, Jeffrey K.; Slevin, Dennis P.; English, Brent			Trust in projects: An empirical assessment of owner/contractor relationships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Projects; Trust; Owner/contractor relationships; Construction	COOPERATION; IMPLEMENTATION; CONSTRUCTION	A great deal of literature has pointed to the importance of trust as a facilitator of positive relationships among project stakeholders. Trust is argued to enhance a variety of intra-organizational relationships, including project team dynamics, top management support, and coordination across functional departments. Likewise, trust is argued to improve the inter-organizational relationships among principal actors in project development, such as contractors, owners, and suppliers. This paper reports on the results of an empirical study that investigated the impact of trust between project owners and contractors in a number of large construction projects in Canada. We operationalized trust along the Hartman [Hartman FT. The role of trust in project management. In: Slevin DP, Cleland DI, Pinto JK, editors. The frontiers of project management research. Newtown Square, PA: Project Management Institute; 2002, p. 225-35] dimensions as incorporating both competence and integrity and compared the perspectives of project contractors and owners. Using regression and path analysis, we analyzed the differential effects of competence and integrity trust on enhanced owner/contractor relationships and project success. Our findings indicate that trust has different meanings for contractors and owners, as its impact on satisfaction with the relationship and positive project outcomes varies depending upon which group is surveyed.

The undertaken decisions demand taking into consideration many criteria, including among others, experience and financial standing of the candidates. It is often difficult to be quantified. The objectives of the construction owner in a given project are also meaningful. All these factors cause difficulties in working out a mathematical prequalification model. In the paper a model based on fuzzy sets theory is proposed. It takes into consideration both different criteria, objectives and evaluations of numerous decision - makers. To illustrate the model operation a simple numerical example is presented.

J	Oo, BL; Tang, OS				Oo, Bee Lan; Tang, Oi Shuen			Information feedback in construction contract bidding: Perceptions of Hong Kong contractors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Bidding; construction; feedback; information; tendering		Contractors learn from their experiences in which feedback information plays a key role to enable experiential learning in recurrent bidding. However, little is known about how contractors perceive and act in response to varying levels of bidding feedback information from construction clients. Focussing on construction procurement in Hong Kong, this exploratory study examines: (i) the level of bidding information feedback from public, private and quasi-government client groups, and (ii) the sources, types, uses and adequacy of bidding feedback information from these client groups from contractors' perspective. Data was collected using online questionnaire. The results provide strong evidence that the respondents perceive bidding feedback information from the three client groups are inadequate. They have heavily relied on multiple and/or 'unofficial' sources for obtaining bidding feedback information. Nonetheless, there is suggestive evidence of different possible uses of bidding feedback information among the contractors, which could substantially affect bidding outcomes. This study provides a much-needed insight into clients' information feedback conditions and how feedback information might be used by contractors in competitive bidding. The research implication for clients is that they should take into consideration contractors' need for feedback information in their procurement design so as to enhance efficiency in their procurement practices.

Suitable platforms for enhancing an as-built schedule visually during the construction phase are necessary and important for general contractors. As the application of building information modeling (BIM) becomes more common, schedule management integrated with the BIM approach becomes essential to enhance visual construction management implementation for the general contractor during the construction phase. To enhance visualization of the updated as-built schedule for the general contractor, this study presents a novel system called the Construction BIM-assisted Schedule Management (ConBIM-SM) system for general contractors in Taiwan. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web ConBIM-SM system for the general contractor to enhance visual as-built schedule information sharing and efficiency in tracking construction as-built schedule. Finally, the ConBIM-SM system is applied to a case study of a commerce building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its effectiveness during the construction phase. The advantages of the ConBIM-SM system lie in improved project control and management efficiency for general contractors, and in providing BIM-assisted as-built schedule tracking and management, to access the most current as-built schedule information through a web browser. The case study results show that the ConBIM-SM system is an effective visual as-built schedule management platform integrated with the BIM approach for general contractors in a construction project.

Research methodology has included a review of relevant literature in construction engineering and economics, a survey of owners and contractors to identify innovative compensation mechanisms in use, and structured interviews of project teams to explore contract terms and their impact on performance. The literature review was undertaken early to provide a framework for the research and to illuminate underlying economic principles that could point to innovative contracting solutions. Based on that review, this paper presents economic theory pertaining to engineering and construction contracting, using for illustration the experiences of actual project teams. Principles for design of contractor compensation, as suggested by economic theory, are illustrated with engineering and construction contracts observed by the research team.

J	Hyari, KH; Shatarat, N; Khalafallah, A				Hyari, Khaled Hesham; Shatarat, Nasim; Khalafallah, Ahmed			Handling Risks of Quantity Variations in Unit-Price Contracts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Unit price; Measurement contracts; Contract changes; Price adjustment; Estimated quantities; Quantity overrun; Contracting	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	Unit-price contracts are awarded based on estimated quantities while payment to the contractor is based on actual quantities of work. In many cases, estimated and actual quantities never perfectly match each other for several reasons. This divergence has direct impact on the contractor's profitability and poses additional risks to owners and contractors alike. This paper presents a price adjustment model for quantity variations in measurement contracts. The model adjusts unit rates for items based on the deviation from estimated quantities in order to allow the contractor to recover his indirect costs when quantities of work underrun. At the same time, it does not allow the contractor to obtain a windfall when quantities overrun. This balances the interests of both the contractor and the owner. The model is expected (1) to reduce submitted bid prices as contractors will not need to increase their submitted prices to account for risks caused by quantity fluctuations; (2) to reduce the motive for unbalanced pricing of line items to take advantage of perceived errors in estimated quantities; (3) to reduce the disputes arising around the interpretations of changed quantity clauses in contracts; and (4) to reduce the need for renegotiating unit prices when variations exceed the allowable range in the contract.

The study adopted the qualitative research approach to meet the study objectives and aims. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to interview participants from emerging contractors with Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Grading one (1) to four (4) in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. Qualitative content analysis for the collected data by grouping the responses into themes and frequency and percentage derived for the various themes. The main findings of the study revealed that the challenges affecting emerging contractors are the lack of financial support from the commencement of projects and during project execution; the extraordinary level of competition among the pool of emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client which have impacted their business operations. The study was done on emerging construction companies that are in the Gauteng Province of South Africa only, but the results may be applicable in other provinces, even beyond South Africa. The empirical results confirmed that the challenges and risk factors which have been identified as lack of financial support from financial institutions in the initial stage of projects and during project execution; high level of competition among emerging contractors and delay in payment from government institutions and client faced by emerging contractors have an impact on their operations and sustainable growth in the construction industry.

J	Lingard, H; Wakefield, R; Walker, D				Lingard, Helen; Wakefield, Ron; Walker, Derek			The client's role in promoting work health and safety in construction projects: balancing contracts and relationships to effect change	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Health and safety; client requirements; procurement; control mechanisms; relationships	OWNERS ROLE; TRUST; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; LEADERSHIP; CAUSALITY	It is increasingly expected that public sector clients embed work health and safety (WHS) into procurement and project management practices for infrastructure/engineering construction projects. Client practices in relation to the management of WHS were examined in a longitudinal case study conducted in a public infrastructure programme of work in Australia. Control mechanisms for WHS at the client-contractor boundary were explored over a 12-month period. Interviews were held with representatives of client and contractor organisations. Formal control mechanisms were implemented. Initially, the implementation of formal controls created tension at the client-contractor interface as it was interpreted as signalling a lack of trust and client interference with contractors' processes. However, these tensions were alleviated through the development of interpersonal relationships between client and contractor personnel at a local project level. The resolution of issues at the client-contractor interface was facilitated by individuals who engaged in boundary spanning behaviours to facilitate knowledge sharing and coordination of effort on both sides. Relationship-based control mechanisms supplemented the use of formal controls and enhanced the client's ability to influence contractors' WHS practices. The study provides important new knowledge regarding the client's role in driving WHS performance in infrastructure/engineering construction projects.

Emerging markets have a significant impact on the strategic planning of contractors. based on an electronic survey covering foreign contractors, clients (foreign investors). and design institutes. the design/build procurement route in conjunction with strategic alliances has been found to enable foreign contractors to enter the Chinese marketplace, The writers present a strengths. weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to inform readers where opportunities for development might he found and to warn of threats to entry. The research also found that mutual trust. synergistic strengths and complementarities, market demand for services. flexibility for both parties, and minimum change of top managers were ranked as the top live critical success factors for strategic alliances between foreign contractors and design institutes. Finally, medium-sized, state-owned. and large-sized design institutes were ranked is the first, second and third preferences, respectively, for strategic partnering by foreign contractors.

The model uses a modified quality function deployment model to support the quality performance measurement that is involved in multiattribute and multiparticipant decision-making and the Delphi method to deal efficiently with the uncertainties in the input data. State DOTs that are in the process of selecting a pavement contractor for a project would benefit from the CQP evaluation model because the system allows a client to expeditiously assess the quality performance of potential pavement contractors in their bidding list. A test case is presented to illustrate the functioning of the model. The model contributes to improve the quality of the nation's pavements because it enhances the contract administration procedures by reengineering the current contractor assessment, prequalification, and/or selection process within the owner organizations (state departments of transportation) by accentuating total client (both the road users' and the owners') satisfaction. The model helps to improve the state DOT's pavement project bidding system. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000539. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Yet relationships between main contractors and subcontractors continue to be influenced by issues that promote vicious circles of distrust. This research investigates the trust influencing factors in main contractor subcontractor relationships on projects. Empirical data was gathered from across four case studies through semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations and document reviews, and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that the change management process, economic climate, payment practices, perceptions of future work opportunities, job performance and the project-specific context influence trustfulness and trustworthiness of the different parties. The findings also imply that stronger trust in the main contractor's supply chain can only be realised and sustained through promotion of trustworthiness-induced rather than benefit-induced trustfulness.

During the bidding process, selecting the most appropriate sub-contractors (SCs) for the relevant sub-works is highly critical for the overall project performance. In order to select the most appropriate SCs for the project and prepare the most realistic and accurate bid proposal, general contractors (GCs) have to know all financial, technical and general information about these SCs. Within this context, GCs should consider several factors in the selection process. These factors may include the quality of production, efficiency, employment of qualified members, reputation of the company, accessibility to the company, completion of the work on time etc. This paper proposes a web-based sub-contractor evaluation system called WEBSES by which the SCs can be evaluated based on a combined criterion. It enables GCs to select the most appropriate SCs for their relevant sub-works, speed up the selection process and gain time and cost savings during the bidding process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Information Asymmetry on Heavy Civil Projects: Deficiency Identification by Contractors and Owners	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CHANGE ORDERS; CONSTRUCTION; PROCUREMENT; DESIGN; STAKEHOLDERS; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; SELECTION; LESSONS; REWORK	Although a main goal of low-bid procurement is to maximize project value, the approach can actually increase project cost and duration if construction document deficiencies are not resolved early on. This study examined in which construction phase (before or after contract execution) contractors discover document deficiencies, when owners learn of and resolve document deficiencies, and how document deficiencies affect project cost and duration. Data from 159 contractors and project owners indicate that 38% of all construction document deficiencies are discovered by the low-bid contractor before the owner has executed the contract. Conversely, owners reported learning of document deficiencies only 19% of the time before contract execution and 81% of the time after contract execution. These findings suggest a delay in communication between contractors and owners, resulting in asymmetrical information-a practice that industry professionals are aware of but that is often not openly discussed. This knowledge motivated contractors to delay reporting the deficiencies until after the contract was awarded. Furthermore, road projects and constructability concerns were found to be significantly associated with increased project costs.

Hence, it is critical to pay attention to their organisational performance. Organisational culture becomes a momentous measure in analysing organisational performance. As such, this study aims to explore organisational culture of international contractors. This research was quantitative based and data was collected through a questionnaire survey. It was found that client orientation is the most dominant organisation culture elements in international contractors. In contrast, technology orientation, innovation orientation and marketing formalization playing less critical role in their organisational culture. This implies that international contractors are generally lack of competitive advantage in international trade. The results indirectly explain the importance of international joint venture and partnering especially in developing countries. Yet, they are not an ineffective way to improve organisational performance, instead, a competitive culture is critical. As such, the role of top management and cultural reformation are important to counteract the uncompetitive culture.

Identifying key factors in the evaluation of tenders for projects and services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractor selection; Evaluation criteria; Project management services; Tender evaluations	CONTRACTOR SELECTION CRITERIA; FRAMEWORK; CHOICE	Clients select contractors on the basis of the relative importance of tender evaluation criteria, such as, experience, expertise, past performance, and cost. This paper presents the results of a recent study that sought to identify a suite of representative (principal) tender evaluation and contractor selection criteria for use in future research. The study included an examination of management literature on contractor selection and tender evaluation, and an exploratory survey. For each we developed a separate master list and mapped all identified and reported criteria into one of 16 defined categories. Threshold tests were applied to identify common and unique categories and an absolute difference test to determine the principal categories of criteria used in the evaluation of tenders. The study, using a pragmatic and heuristic approach, resulted in the identification of eight principal categories suitable for our research program. The findings indicate that the preferred criteria for evaluating tenders are those which provide a measure of contractors' ability in terms of their management and technical capability, past experience and performance, reputation, and the proposed method of delivery or technical solution.

Using Best-Value Procurement to Measure the Impact of Initial Risk-Management Capability on Qualitative Construction Performance	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Best value; Project risk management; Risk maturity		Managing project risk in construction is becoming increasingly critical for ensuring that project objectives are met effectively. Perceptions and practices related to effective risk management vary among contractors, which results in different levels of risk-management capabilities. A best-value selection method enables owners to identify, during the selection process, contractors with strong risk-management capabilities. This paper presents qualitative data from 133 construction projects in which contractors were selected through a best-value process. During the selection process, contractors completed a risk-management plan (RMP) in which they identified the major risks of prospective projects and ways to manage the risks. The RMPs were then scored by a group of reviewers, and the scores for each contractor were averaged and used within the best-value selection model. In addition, after completion of each project, a close-out survey was used to gather data on several aspects of the contractors' project performance. A contractor's average RMP score and survey data were examined with Pearson's product-moment correlation and linear regression analysis. A positive correlation was found between average RMP scores and the performance metrics assessed in the survey. Contractors with high average RMP scores also had achieved high levels in the performance metrics of quality, professionalism, risk communication, and overall customer satisfaction. An additional correlation was found between average RMP scores and project award percentage. These correlations highlight the importance of establishing and developing effective project risk-management methods and selecting vendors through a best-value approach.

J	Arambula, E; Gharaibeh, N				Arambula, Edith; Gharaibeh, Nasir			Methods for Accumulating Construction and Material Quality Test Results and Their Effect on Acceptance Decisions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quality control; Statistics; Sampling; Contracts; Construction management; Construction materials; Quality control; Statistics; Sampling; Contractors; Construction materials and methods		Many state departments of transportation are currently shifting more acceptance sampling and testing responsibilities to contractors because of a shortage of personnel at highway agencies and intensive construction schedules. The practice of using contractor-performed test results for acceptance decisions is referred to here as contractor acceptance testing (CAT). Studies have shown the need for improving the power of the statistical process used to validate the contractor's test results. A potential improvement to CAT is to accumulate contractor's and agency's test results of consecutive lots to increase sample size and consequently increase the power of the statistical tests used to verify the contractor's test results. In this study, two different types of cumulative sampling methods (i.e.,continuous cumulative and chain lot) are applied to actual test results obtained from the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT), which includes contractor-performed test results and agency-performed test results from independent samples. The percent within limits (PWL) calculated according to KDOT's acceptance practices was compared to the PWL obtained by the alternative methods for more than 90 projects. The results show that a chain-lot method with three accumulated lots is a plausible way to increase the power of the F-test and t-test. The contribution of this study is a practical sampling method for state DOTs to improve their CAT practices by increasing the power of the F-test and t-test used in the verification process while staying close to current agency's practice in terms of pay factors.

Optimal Incentive Contract with Risk-Neutral Contractor	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Optimal incentive contract; Construction; Principal-agent problem; Risk neutrality; Agency theory	MORAL HAZARD; COMPENSATION	Incentive clauses within contracts, referred to as incentive contracts in this paper, based on a sharing of the project outcome are regarded as an important vehicle to align contractor interests with that of the owner. However, discussion is ongoing as to what is the optimal incentive arrangement. This paper derives an optimal incentive contract for a risk-neutral contractor; the owner may be either risk averse or risk neutral. An incentive is established based on a sharing of a project's equivalent monetary outcome (expressed relative to a benchmark or target that is desired by the owner), while aligning the contractor's interests with those of the owner. The derivation is based on solving an optimization problem. The paper shows that at the optimum and expressed relative to the target, any favorable or adverse outcome associated with both the contractor's effort and events beyond the contractor's influence should, respectively, be wholly received by or wholly borne by a risk-neutral contractor. Practitioners were interviewed to validate this result. This paper gives an original solution to the optimal sharing problem in incentive construction contracts, contributing to current practices in contracts management. The solution follows an ordered argument and is usable by practitioners. Additionally, this paper extends agency theory on risk-averse principals. This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners concerned with the design of incentive contracts. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Hosseinian, S.

J	Laryea, S				Laryea, Samuel			Nature of Tender Review Meetings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractor; Participant observation; Tender review meetings; Tendering; UK	CONTRACTORS; SYSTEM	Tender review meetings form a significant part of a contractor's tendering process. These are instances in a tender process when the members of a bid team come together to coordinate their tender preparation activities, develop their tender strategy, and quality check the output to date of a tender process. Little empirical work exists on this, particularly because of the commercially sensitive data associated with it. Here, access was negotiated into the offices of two major UK contractors, hereafter known as Gamma and Delta, and the whole tender process was shadowed for 6 and 7weeks, respectively, using participant observation, documentary analysis, and interview. This helped to examine and analyze the various review meetings that take place in the tendering process, and how they connect with the development of a contractor's tender strategy, program, and price. Out of seven tender review meetings identified, four main ones significantly impacted the final submission. These were tender launch, midtender review, tender clarification with client, and finalization review. The review meetings consumed 6-9% of the tender period108 working hours in Gamma and 180 in Delta. Although this may have contributed significantly to tendering costs, review meetings provided an essential means for joint risk management and integration of the various parts of a contractor's bid team. The findings are particularly useful for contractors because they offer a systematic examination of what actually happens in practice and the implications for tendering costs and bid formulation.

J	Ng, ST				Ng, ST			EQUAL: a case-based contractor prequalifier	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						contractor prequalification; case-based reasoning; experiential judgement	SYSTEM	Many researchers have observed that contractor prequalification relies heavily on expert judgement. Experiential judgement is required in decision situations when it would be too costly to measure a large amount of information quantitatively and it is also invaluable in providing shortcuts for complex tasks. However, the quality of heuristic knowledge depends upon the experiences of the decision-makers. The development and use of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system can help decision-makers to produce more reliable and expeditious decisions for contractor prequalification. An Expert preQUALifier - EQUAL - has been developed using the CBR approach. This paper describes the components of EQUAL and illustrates the functionality and operation of the system through a trial run with hypothetical cases. The results of testing reveal that experts were satisfied with the accuracy and overall performance of EQUAL, and CBR approach is suitable for modeling the contractor prequalification domain.

J	Lu, WX; Zhang, L; Zhang, LH				Lu, Wenxue; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Lihan			Effect of Contract Completeness on Contractors' Opportunistic Behavior and the Moderating Role of Interdependence	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract completeness; Opportunistic behavior; Interdependence; Contracting	SAFEGUARDING SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS; BARGAINING POWER; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; ANTECEDENTS; COOPERATION; MECHANISMS; ENVIRONMENT; INCENTIVES; DEPENDENCE	The characteristics of construction projects-e.g., one-off, high complexity, information asymmetry, and asset specificity-have led to a very common phenomenon of opportunism. In this paper, a questionnaire based on a sample of contractors was employed to explore the effect of contract completeness on contractors' opportunistic behavior, as well as the moderating role of interdependence. The results show that term specificity, contingency adaptability, and contractual obligatoriness all have negative effects on contractors' opportunistic behavior (both weak and strong forms), while issue inclusiveness positively influences contractors' opportunistic behavior. In addition, except for the positive moderating role of interdependence magnitude on the relationship between contingency adaptability and contractors' opportunistic behavior (weak form), the other three significant moderating effects (magnitude on issue inclusiveness and strong form, magnitude on contractual obligatoriness and strong form, asymmetry on term specificity and strong form) are all found to be negative. These findings can give insight into the many ways that contracts affect opportunism, and thus help both sides strategically react to opportunistic disturbances and minimize transaction costs.

On-site energy management challenges and opportunities: a contractor's perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction process; contractors; energy management; environmental performance indicators; non-domestic; on-site construction	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMBODIED ENERGY; CONSTRUCTION; BUILDINGS; CARBON; CERTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; FIRMS	Although numerous policies encourage CO2 and energy consumption reduction within the UK non-domestic sector, most measures are primarily focused towards reducing operational impacts, but largely overlook embodied impacts, particularly within the construction process. On-site construction refers to the energy consumed during the installation of materials up to project practical completion and represents the largest share of construction process CO2 emissions. Contractors have a pivotal role to play in reducing CO2 and energy consumption due to their significant involvement in project procurement and on-site construction. The key challenges and opportunities are investigated for delivering on-site energy management within UK non-domestic projects from a contractor's perspective. A case study is presented of a large UK principal contractor's on-site energy management practices, based on a wide geographical sample of non-domestic projects and operatives. Shortcomings are found within the contractor's current on-site energy management procedure across the three reporting levels (director, operations and project). Findings identified the lack of data authentication as a significant challenge, whereas capturing additional project variables to facilitate future benchmarking was deemed as a key opportunity for on-site energy management enhancement.

The procedure involves judging the suitability, capability and competency of the contractor on various criteria, using both anecdotal and empirical evidence. The evidence used is often imprecise and subjective, and so is the evaluation and decision making procedure. Type-1 fuzzy sets have been used in the prequalification procedure to handle uncertain information. However, type-1 fuzzy sets are unable to reflect the differences in opinion among experts involved in group decision making. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical prequalification procedure that uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets to address both linguistic imprecision and differences of opinion. A numerical example shows how the proposed procedure is carried out and the benefits that result compared to a similar procedure using type-1 fuzzy sets.

J	Awwad, R; Asgari, S; Kandil, A				Awwad, Rita; Asgari, Sadegh; Kandil, Amr			Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agent-based modeling; Competitive bidding; Simulation; Risk aversion; Optimal markup	KEY FACTORS; DECISION; CONTRACTORS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; PROJECTS; COMPLEX; MARKETS; PRICES; RISK	The competitive construction bidding process is a highly unstructured decision-making problem where contractors have to take several factors into consideration, weigh their relative importance, and consequently make bidding decisions within the constraints of bounded information, limited time, and uncertainty about the market constituents. The bidding models presented in the literature help identify the different bidding objectives a contractor would consider but fail to capture all the complexities of this mechanism and its dynamics. This paper presents an agent-based construction bidding model that allows modeling different bidding strategies of contractors, observing their interaction and learning over time, and detecting emergent market behavior and bidding patterns. This model is used to simulate a variety of bidders competing against each other under a low-bid tendering approach in order to study the effect of different bidding parameters on their optimal markup decision, long-term financial performance, and survival in the market. Specifically, this paper observes the effect of the market competition level, a contractor's risk attitude, his cost estimation and project management skills, and the project complexity on the contractor's bidding decisions and market equilibrium.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the selection of design-builders for public buildings seeking leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) certification and compare the selection practices involved with those of non-LEED-seeking DB projects through a robust content analysis of 74 DB requests for proposals (RFPs) for public DB projects. The results of the content analysis reveal that the level of LEED certification is the dominant means of conveying the sustainability requirements in RFPs for contractor selection, with the majority of RFPs (60%) including sustainability requirements as part of the contractor evaluation package. With the exception of contractors' past performance, there is no statistically significant difference in the importance weights of selection criteria between LEED-seeking and non-LEED-seeking buildings, and DB owners tend to place more emphasis on innovative technical solutions rather than the past performance of DB contractors. Additionally, the research findings also indicate that owners of LEED-seeking building projects tend to provide fewer design decisions in RFPs to solicit innovative design alternatives from potential DB contractors. This study provides DB owners with a number of practical implications for selecting appropriate design-builders for green DB projects. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Best-Value Procurement in Design-Bid-Build Construction Projects: Empirical Analysis of Selection Outcomes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Best-value procurement; Design-bid-build; Bidding cost; Qualifications-based evaluation criteria; Coefficient of variation; Kruskal-Wallis H test	COEFFICIENT; TESTS	Best-value (BV) procurement is increasingly used in conventional design-bid-build (DBB) delivery, which raises questions regarding the influence of qualifications-based evaluation criteria when selecting construction contractors. The objectives of this study are to (1)examine BV procurement outcomes that can be expected from DBB projects, (2)determine which evaluation criteria have the greatest dispersion among competing contractors, and (3)identify whether a relationship exists between cost- and qualifications-based proposal submissions. A sample of 162 public institutional BV-procured DBB projects was collected that include evaluation results of 684 contractor proposals. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used, including coefficient of variation and correlation analysis of evaluation criteria. The results show that BV-selected contractors offer substantial qualifications benefits in comparison with lowest- and average-bidder alternatives. Certain qualifications-based criteria, such as technical proposals, contractor interview scores, and safety proposals were found to have a greater dispersion among competing bidders than cost proposals. Contributions of this study to the body of knowledge include a sizable empirical data set of BV-procured DBB projects in the vertical sector and a unit of measure that considers dispersion among competing contractor proposals. In current construction industry practice, it is recommended that project owners consider BV for complex DBB projects and prioritize certain qualifications-based criteria that are well-suited for differentiating between competing contractor proposals.

The failure to perform CP can lead to large losses, delays or severe loss of project quality. Although the most reliable approach identified in the literature is currently artificial neural network (ANN), it has weaknesses that negatively affect CP. In this study, a new approach called support vector machines (SVM) has been used to forecast a contractor's deviation from a client's objectives. In order to test the model, CP for 250 virtual contractors was solved. The proposed model had a great generalization in linear, nonlinear, noisy and inductive environments. The Results showed that SVM could reliably perform even with a small amount of training data. Also when compared to ANN, SVM showed an overall better performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Evaluating Contractors for Bonding: DEA Decision Making Model for Surety Underwriters	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bonding; Surety underwriting; Decision support system; Decision making; Data envelopment analysis	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; EFFICIENCY; PREQUALIFICATION; UNITS; RISK	In several countries, it is a common practice for construction owners to require contractors to submit several types of surety bonds shifting the risk of contractors default to sureties. The process of evaluating contractors' applications for bonding is complicated and time-consuming. Surety underwriters are faced with the challenge of considering tens of objective and subjective criteria to make the bonding recommendation. These criteria include a contractor's financial strength, past performance, and other related aspects. Literature review revealed that there is little guidance to surety underwriters in this regard. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to equip surety underwriters with a decision making model for evaluating contractors' applications for bonding. The proposed model is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). The DEA is a robust nonparametric linear programming approach that is widely used for benchmarking, performance measurement, and decision making. The proposed DEA model guides surety underwriters throughout the decision making process. The model offers surety underwriters the flexibility to accommodate any number of variables in the evaluation process. The proposed model is deployed based on a database that includes 49 contractors. The validity and applicability of the proposed model are scored positively by industry practitioners in terms of methodology used, evaluation criteria, ease of use, performance results, and overall usefulness compared to existing methods.

J	Akinci, B; Fischer, M				Akinci, B; Fischer, M			Factors affecting contractors' risk of cost overburden	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Cost overruns create a significant financial risk to both contractors and owners. However, in spite of the risks involved, the history of the construction industry is full of projects that were completed with significant cost overruns. Contractors used to be able to cover their cost overburdens with their markups. However, with diminishing markups, even marginal cost overburdens can easily wipe out their profits and even lead to a financial overburden. Therefore, contractors need to identify major risk sources causing cost overburdens in advance to be proactive in managing them. This paper reviews and describes uncontrollable risk sources that affect the contractor's risk of cost overburden. Sources of these risks relate to factors affecting the cost estimate and the final cost of a project and include factors specific to the cost estimator, the project design, construction, and the project environment.

Modified price plus time bi-parameter bidding model incorporating float loss impact	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						bi-parameter bidding; tendering; price plus time; float; A + B bidding	HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION; CONTRACTOR PREQUALIFICATION; COST; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; SYSTEM; RISK	Selecting the appropriate contractor is of paramount importance, especially for public agencies. Choosing a contractor based on the lowest price may not be the best approach as it may lead to delays and/or quality problems. The price plus time bidding system allows clients to choose contractors based on the total combined bid (TCB) after converting the time parameter into a monetary value. This proved to be successful in reducing project durations. However, as contractors compete using this method, they tend to reduce their project durations drastically to be competitive without thinking about the additional risks. Reducing project duration results in reducing the float available for non-critical activities and increases the risk of project delays. A modified price plus time bidding model is proposed. In addition to cost and time, a third parameter is added to form the TCB. This parameter is called float loss cost (FLC). Clients can use this modified model to evaluate the tenders submitted by bidders by converting the float loss to a monetary value. This encourages contractors to be more schedule conscious and increases the chances of timely project completion.

The theory of planned behaviour was used to develop the theoretical framework that investigated G-7 contractors operating in Malaysian construction industry. A review of relevant literature and questionnaire was adopted in order to identify the factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes (individual factors). A total of 119 personal structured questionnaires were considered for the analysis with the response rate of 94%. In addition, a structural equation modelling approach was employed to examine the direct and the moderating relationship as drawn by the hypotheses. In addition, with quantitative research design following positivist research paradigm, the methodology was designed to focus on the research questions and the objectives. The questionnaire was designed by using closed interval measurement scale with proper care taken in designing the survey instruments. SPSS 20.0 and SmartPLS 3 for structural equation modelling were utilized in confirming the hypotheses developed for the study. The results of this study through structural equation modelling opined that government policy and individual factor have a positive and significant influence on contractor's risk attitudes.

Revealing bank lending decisions for contractors in Hong Kong	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction finance; Lending decisions; Project management; Financial resources	CREDIT; CONSTRUCTION	Banks' conservative attitude towards construction loan applications has been considered as the biggest obstacle to contractors' business development. The objective of this research is to explore and understand banks' perception on contractors' borrowing in Hong Kong through three stages. First, a framework that classified a set of criteria on loan application assessment was formulated. Second, a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the key criteria by testing the theoretical framework with a number of banks. Third, a number of bankers were interviewed to explore the reasoning behind the tested framework. The paper presents findings on how banks have processed and evaluated contractors' loan applications. Further, similar lending policies adopted by international banks in Hong Kong would also be applied internationally. Accordingly, the findings would help contractors, not only in Hong Kong but also internationally, to find ways to enhance the success of their loan applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

J	Awad, A; Fayek, AR				Awad, Adel; Fayek, Aminah Robinson			A decision support system for contractor prequalification for surety bonding	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Prequalification; Bonding; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Surety underwriting	SELECTION CRITERIA; CONSTRUCTION; MODEL	In the construction bonding business, a complex and comprehensive prequalification or assessment process is done to evaluate contractor, project, and contractual risks. Previous studies have focused mainly on contractor prequalification from the owner's or consultant's perspective. There remains a need for a model to evaluate the contractor and project-specific aspects (i.e., project team and contractual risks) from the surety bonding perspective. This paper identifies and classifies the most relevant evaluation criteria that surety underwriters and brokers consider when evaluating a specific construction project for bonding purposes. Several data collection techniques (questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, and interacting group meetings), with highly experienced surety experts, were conducted to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of the evaluation criteria. Both fuzzy logic and expert systems are combined to develop a decision support system (DSS) for use in contractor and project evaluation. An approach for fuzzy membership function estimation is presented using a traditional membership function estimation technique, integrated with data of contractor prequalification cases. Thirty-eight alternative system configurations are investigated to determine the most accurate one. The system is validated using 32 prequalification cases, and the accuracy of the system is found to be 84.0%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Acheamfour, VK; Kissi, E; Adjei-Kumi, T				Acheamfour, Victor Karikari; Kissi, Ernest; Adjei-Kumi, Theophilus			Ascertaining the impact of contractors pre-qualification criteria on project success criteria	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project success; Contractors; Criteria; Pre-qualification and relationship	MODELING PLS-SEM; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION; TOOL; ISSUES; HEALTH; PRICE	Purpose The selection of a suitable contractor for a project has a significant impact on project success. In order to avoid the selection of an incapable contractor, the capabilities of contractors must be assessed prior to tendering through pre-qualification. However, the pre-qualification process is characterized by partiality and ambiguity. In view of this, numerous models have been developed to solve the pre-qualification problems. Prior to the development of such models, it is very important to assess how the pre-qualification criteria impact project success criteria so as to aid in the selection of pre-qualification criteria while considering the project and client's objectives. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to ascertain the relationship between contractors' pre-qualification criteria and project success criteria. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized explanatory research design in testing 35 hypotheses. The views of 121 practising quantity surveyors were solicited using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling to validate the hypothesis. Findings In all, 13 of the 35 hypotheses were not supported. The findings indicated a clear relationship between contractors' pre-qualification and project success. Practical implications Therefore, it is evident that the practice of lowest evaluate bidder is not adequate for providing a satisfactory project outcome. It is, therefore, suggested that more emphasis should be placed on contractor's technical abilities, health and safety and management capabilities as they have proven to have a significant correlation with the project success. Originality/value This study provides insights to the how various pre-qualification criteria can impact the project success criteria and further contributes to the symbiotic that exist in the literature on pre-qualification and project success.

The impact of contractors' attributes on construction project success: A post construction evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; Contractor selection; Project performance	SELECTION CRITERIA	The success of construction projects is a fundamental issue for most governments, users and communities. In the literature that deals with construction project success and causes of time and cost overruns in the construction industry, there is some literature that highlights the role of the contractors in project success. While most studies rank contractors' success attribute from tendering, prequalification, and a long term historical perception perspective, this paper aims to study the impact of contractors' attributes on project success from a post construction evaluation perspective to identify what critical success factors (CSFs) that greatly impact the success of project. In an attempt to understand and investigate this impact, a questionnaire survey is used to establish construction professionals' perception of CSFs of contractors that greatly impact on the success of construction projects. Factor analysis reveals nine underlying clusters namely :(i) safety and quality; (ii) past performance; (iii) environment; (iv) management and technical aspects; (v) resource; (vi) organisation; (vii) experience; (viii) size/type of pervious projects; and (ix) finance. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models that predict the probability of project success. Factors such as turnover history, quality policy, adequacy of labour and plant resources, waste disposal, size of past projects completed, and company image are the most significant factors affecting projects success. Assuming that project success is repeatable, these findings provide clear understanding of contractors' performance and could potentially enhance existing knowledge of construction project success.

J	Leung, MY; Chan, YS; Chong, A; Sham, JFC				Leung, Mei-yung; Chan, Yee-shan; Chong, Alice; Sham, Janet Fung-Chu			Developing structural integrated stressor-stress models for clients' and contractors' cost engineers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							WORK-ENVIRONMENT; A BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATIONS; SUPPORT; BURNOUT	Estimation is not a purely scientific task. It requires cost engineers equipped with a wide knowledge of construction and a professional ability to make judgments. However, stress will deaden their use of knowledge and influence their professional judgment in estimating. In the construction industry, cost engineers can generally be divided into two main groups: clients' cost engineers in consultant firms or in a development company who serve clients; and contractors' cost engineers in construction companies working for the contractors. This study investigates the causal relationships between the stressors and stress of clients' and contractors' cost engineers. Two stressor-stress integrated models were developed for these two cost engineer groups by using the structural equation model. The findings revealed some stressors that affected both clients' and contractors' cost engineers: (1) poor environment, role conflict and work underload affect their stress positively; (2) social support and Type A behavior affect their stress negatively; and (3) work underload induces stress via the role conflict among cost engineers, their supervisors, and the organization. On the other hand, some deviations between these two groups of cost engineers also occur: (1) social support acts as a source of stressors of clients' cost engineers; (2) a private life stressor only affects the stress of contractors' cost engineers; and (3) a closed interactive looping relationship among role conflict, Type A behavior, and work underload affects contractors' cost engineers. Based on the results of this study, some recommendations are suggested to manage cost engineers' stress well.

It is assumed that construction contractors and subcontractors play a great part in adopting or neglecting an innovative technology due to different factors. We believe this reluctance attribute would be a common factor between these two groups of construction actors and it would further be an indication of sort of behavior these groups have in common. This study intends to make a major contribution to the body of knowledge by investigating BIM feasibility for SMEs. The research method consists of application of a structured online questionnaire distributed Online, out of which 70 responses from the industry were collected and analyzed. Inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing were applied to check the associations among categorical variables via Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Mann-Whitney U Test. The factors between contractors and subcontractors in terms of organizational, technological, economic, and social attributes were compared. Further, contractors were grouped in terms of BIM and software usage, firm size, and partnership by Cluster Analysis. The results show the rankings for contractors were different from the rankings for subcontractors with respect to technological feasibility and the rankings of contractors were all higher than those of subcontractors when partnership was introduced as a differentiating variable.

Research on cost performance has mostly focused on one of the involved parties, either the client or the contractor. Not many research efforts discuss the cost contingency performance of projects. This research discusses the cost performance and cost contingency of projects in the execution phase from the perspective of a client as well as a contractor. Using a case study approach, 95 projects are investigated: 44 client projects and 51 contractor projects. The results show that depending on the perspective, projects can have cost overruns or cost underruns. Comparing the total realized and estimated costs, projects experienced on average about 16% underrun from a client perspective. From a contractor perspective, projects experienced on average up to 2% overrun. The estimated cost contingency in the client's projects was on average 2.64% more than the required cost contingency. The estimated cost contingency in the contractor's projects was on average 5.41% less than the required cost contingency. These differences are explained by pessimism bias and technical reasons on the client's side. On the contractor side, optimism bias and technical and political reasons play a role, resulting in opportunistic behavior. The findings help practitioners to enhance their cost estimates by avoiding both pessimistic bias and optimism bias behavior-for example, by using historical data from earlier projects. Further investigation into the influence of market conditions on cost estimates is suggested.

Despite the increasing attention on the role of the construction industry in disaster resilience, CSR reporting on resilience issues among construction practitioners has yet to be explored. The present study adopted the concept of disaster risk management and stakeholder theory and first established a CSR-resilience evaluation framework with 20 resilience issues and 46 indicators through a modified Delphi technique. Thereafter, a sample of 295 international contractors was selected from the Engineering News-Record (ENR) list from 2014 to 2018, and a systematic content analysis approach was conducted to analyze their CSR-related reports and compare the corresponding results among regions. Results indicated that Asian and Middle Eastern contractors have the highest and lowest levels, respectively, of CSR reporting on resilience issues. Clients' and governments' concerns were given the top priority by all regions, except Chinese contractors emphasized the client's and community's concerns. Asian and Chinese contractors showed a higher emphasis on the community's and employees' concerns than those of partners and suppliers, whereas the European, US/Canadian, and Middle Eastern contractors showed otherwise. The present study contributed to filling in the gap to establish a CSR-resilience indicator system for the construction industry and provided a useful reference to comprehensively understand and measure the CSR reporting on resilience issues by the construction industry.

This has enabled the development of several private and public construction firms. However, the performance of EDCs is still a matter of concern. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to identify and prioritize risks of EDCs operating in the federal road construction projects. Forty-seven risk events were identified through an in-depth literature review. A questionnaire survey was conducted with professionals from the three main contracting parties (contractors, consultants, and the client) to prioritize the identified risk events in terms of their relative significance. The study outlined the ten most significant risk events namely, shortage of cash, inadequate planning, lack of access to foreign currency, delay in possession of site, frequent breakdown of equipment, delay in delivery of material and equipment, financial failure, inflation, delay in payments and poor commitment and coordination within the contractors' team. This study provides an insight into contractors' risks with a focus on domestic contractors engaged in the road sector. The findings of this study will be helpful to construction firms to develop an appropriate risk management system to effectively mitigate their risks.

State of Prefab Practice in the Electrical Construction Industry: Qualitative Assessment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prefabrication; Construction industry; Construction management; Construction methods; Statistics; Electrical systems; Project planning and design	PREFABRICATION; BUILDINGS	To overcome productivity challenges encountered in construction projects, electrical contractors often apply reactive measures such as overtime and shiftwork. This paper recommends that electrical contractors use prefabrication (prefab) as a proactive measure to enhance their projects' performance. Current advancements in information technology have made it feasible for contractors to adopt nonconventional construction methods and to incorporate preplanned and preassembled components within their projects. Because there is limited information available on the current state of prefab use in the electrical construction industry, qualitative data from 142 electrical contractors in the United States and Canada were collected. The qualitative data were analyzed to understand the impact of prefab use on project performance as perceived by electrical contractors. The examined data revealed that prefab use has significantly increased over the last decade and electrical contractors perceive that it offers a competitive advantage in the market. Prefab use enables contractors to reduce labor wages and expedite the construction process by performing more activities in parallel. Findings within this paper indicate that prefab can be widely used in multiple electrical activities and its implementation often results in cost and schedule savings and increased labor efficiency. In addition, it was found that prefab use usually results in project quality improvements. Finally, future trends indicate that prefab users are planning to invest more effort in improving prefab practices within their companies by developing training programs for personnel and establishing protocols for working with suppliers and vendors.

A survey of a randomly selected sample of 24 contractors, 15 architectural/engineering firms (A/E), and nine owners from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia was undertaken. The survey included 56 causes of delay, and the respondents were asked to indicate their degree of importance. The delay factors were grouped into nine major groups. The level of importance of the causes and the groups were measured and ranked by their importance index for contractors, owners and A/Es. It was found that contractors, A/Es, and owners generally agree on the ranking of the individual delay factors. It was also shown that contractors and A/Es substantially agree on the ranking of the groups of delay factors, whereas contractors and owners, and A/Es and owners do not agree. It was also shown that the financing group of delay factors was ranked the highest by all three parties and that environment was ranked the lowest.

This paper fills this gap by empirically investigating the effect of the level of owner-provided design on the design quality of contractors in DB projects. Questionnaires were collected from 243 Chinese project professionals and hierarchical regression analysis was conducted. Empirical results reveal that the level of owner-provided design negatively affects design innovation and positively affects design change. The contractor's competence strengthens the effect of owner-provided design level on design innovation. A minimum proportion of owner-provided design can improve design quality. It is also necessary to ensure the clear articulation of requirements in the request for proposal (RFP). The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the level of owner-provided design and the contractor's design quality in DB projects. These findings also give owners insight into the preparation of the RFP with regard to the optimal level of design.

State of Practice of Building Information Modeling in the Mechanical Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling; Mechanical engineering; Construction methods; Construction management		The North American construction industry has seen a decline in productivity for decades due to underlying problems such as lack of team collaboration, less initial design input, and higher building systems complexity. These problems are most visible in labor-intensive trades, such as mechanical contractors. Within the last decade, building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a potential solution to these problems. This paper highlights the state of BIM practice in the mechanical construction industry. Through an extensive survey and interview process, this research resulted in three key outcomes. The first is that 58% of mechanical contractors have less than three years of BIM experience and consider themselves as beginners in the use of BIM. Second, BIM implementation cost for these contractors is 1% to 2% of their total project cost estimate. Third, more than 70% of mechanical contractors agree that BIM reduces field conflicts and improves coordination. These factors can assist mechanical contractors allocate proper resources for BIM implementation in their projects to reduce problems.

Traditional procedures of subcontracting procurement tend to limit the opportunities for price negotiation and cooperative relationships between contractors and neglect potential issues such as engineering interface, construction risk, and waste. Based on case studies of construction projects, we propose a "lean" subcontracting procurement process (LSPP) drawing from lean construction theory. The process consists of a novel Seven-Arrangement operation plan and four types of standard operating flows. Not only does the proposed LSPP help subcontractors eliminate various types of waste in construction projects, it also establishes a common information platform and cooperative environment that help participating contractors understand the work emphasis of each operation and the whole operation in sequence. As a result, the relationships between participating contractors become cooperative, potential risks in construction projects can be discovered early, and profits are shared between contractors. Thus, this process allows contractors to obtain long-term benefits.	[Yin, Samuel Yen-Liang; Tserng, H.

Although CE can be a solution for contractors to come up with the right corporate strategy, the concept of CE is very new and there is very little guidance. This paper is aimed at clarifying the CE concept for contractors and identifying key factors for CE in order to enable the implementation. To address this, firstly theoretical concepts and previous research on CE were explored, followed by 19 interviews with top managers of contractors in Indonesia. The data was analysed using thematic analysis to identify the key factors for successful CE in Indonesian contracting business. 21key factors of CE have been identified, which are discussed under five categories: autonomy, competitive aggressiveness, innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking. All these key factors are found to be related to one another and hence have to be managed as a system for successful CE.

J	Polesie, P				Polesie, Pim			The view of freedom and standardisation among managers in Swedish construction contractor projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction projects; Construction management; Freedom; Project processes; Standardisation		It has been suggested that standardisation improves productivity. Simultaneously, construction contractor project managers are given freedom to run projects as if they were independent firms. If this is a motivating factor for the managers, firms may have to find other ways to improve productivity than to increase standardisation to be able to stimulate their most skilled managers. It could prove important to recognise their need for freedom before they start looking for alternative places of employment. The purpose of this article is to inquire how standardisation may or may not conflict with contractor project managers' sense of freedom. Interviews with 15 contractor project managers from Swedish medium-sized construction contractor enterprises indicate that standardised processes do not necessarily conflict with their sense of freedom and work motivation as long as their ability to overview the production process is preserved. Based on the findings it is argued that standardisation should be implemented and developed with respect from top managers using a bottom-up approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Using interviews with five of the top 20 UK contractors and one medium-sized contractor, this study explored how main contractors manage the H&S influence of subcontracting with a focus on their in-house measures. Some in-house measures found are: restricting the layers of subcontractors on projects; working with a regular chain of subcontractors; implementing a H&S reward scheme for subcontractors; and insisting on non-working subcontractor foremen who have direct responsibility for the safety of workers in their trade. These measures appear to be influenced by clients, industry peer groups, and the moral justification for occupational H&S, and they offer inter-organisational learning opportunities for contractors in devising measures to mitigate the H&S influence of subcontracting. These findings should also allay concerns that removing some of the legislative hurdles in connection with ongoing red tape debate will result in poorer H&S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Wu, RTH				Wong, Peter Shek Pui; Cheung, Sai On; Wu, Ray Tsuen Hoi			Learning from project monitoring feedback: A case of optimizing behavior of contractors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Learning; Project monitoring	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS; CURVE MODELS; PERFORMANCE	Monitoring is an essential part of construction project management and has typically been devised to guard against non-compliance. When contractors are subjected to regular performance feedback, instead of just taking remedial action, they may take the opportunities to enhance their operations in the light of the feedback. Thus, it has been advocated that responding to performance feedback has a learning element. This study takes on this notion and examined the performance change pattern of contractors that have been subjected to regular performance feedback. Longitudinal performance scores were fitted against five well established learning curve models using the Least Square Curve Fitting Analysis (LSCFA). It was found that the 3-parameter hyperbolic model is the 'best-fit' model in terms of effectiveness and stability. The LSCFA results also suggested that the contractors in the sample can be arranged in four clusters: Competent Learners, Incidental Learners, Indifferent Learners and Optimizers. The majority of them fall into the optimizing cluster. This suggests that these contractors may adjust their resources to maintain their performance at an acceptable level which do not deprive their future opportunities. With due caveat to the constraints and limitations of working sample, this finding is thought provoking for project managers in exercising project monitoring. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

The lag between the time when contractors spend money to accomplish work on site and the time when payments are actually made by clients, which partially compensate contractors for the accomplished work, constantly creates a finance deficit. Contractors often supplement finance deficits using external funds procured through establishing credit-line bank accounts which typically allow contractors to withdraw cash up to specified credit limits. This makes the task of project scheduling considering the constraints of specified finance very important for financial and operational planning. This scheduling concept and technique are referred to as finance-based scheduling. An enhanced heuristic is proposed to devise finance-based schedules of multiple projects within contractors' portfolios. The enhancement is achieved by replacing the exhaustive enumeration technique employed in the heuristic to specify activities' start times with a polynomial shifting algorithm. This enhancement resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of solutions explored before a feasible solution is encountered. The enhanced heuristic was validated through comparison with the integer programming technique using 240 problems of randomly generated networks of sizes that range from 30 to 240 activities. Further, it was proved that the enhanced heuristic can be easily scaled up to handle portfolios of multiple large-size projects.

J	Aliakbarlou, S; Wilkinson, S; Costello, SB				Aliakbarlou, Sadegh; Wilkinson, Suzanne; Costello, Seosamh B.			Rethinking client value within construction contracting services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Satisfaction; Perceived value; Contractors; Client values; Contracting services	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; EXPORT PERFORMANCE; PERCEIVED VALUE; VALUE CREATION; MODEL; PROJECTS; QUALITY; COMMITMENT; INDICATORS; BUSINESS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of what clients value from contractors' services. Understanding client values and the way by which clients perceive value will contribute to client-perceived value within contracting services. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to understand how clients perceive value in the construction industry. In addition, conducting expert interviews and document analysis helped in achieving the research purpose. Findings The findings show that values associated with time, cost and quality can be considered as important client values, while they are not exclusive values for assessing contractor service anymore. Construction clients are concerned about health and safety, low rate of environmental impact, guarantees, creativity, technology transfer, value for money, reliability and tangibles of their contractors' services. In addition, they value their contractors' behaviour, attitude and professionalism. Research limitations/implications The study has disseminated different client values, through classified outcomes, to make the knowledge area more available to construction service providers. This study's findings helped in understanding client values and how clients perceive value from contractors' services. With this information, contractors are able to provide better services to clients. Satisfactory delivery of the values identified in this study is believed to have the greatest impact on client-perceived value within contracting services. Developing a management strategy that recognises, prioritises and satisfactorily delivers these values is essential to ensure that highest level of client-perceived value is achieved. Originality/value The construction literature is focussed on traditional values related to time, cost and quality, while this study highlighted the role of values such as trust, commitment, communication and other non-result-ordinated values essential for achieving client satisfaction. This study's findings proposed a new practical assessment concept to value construction contractor services.

J	Sierra, F				Sierra, Francisco			COVID-19: main challenges during construction stage	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						COVID; Impact; Contractor; Construction; Assessment framework; Health and safety		Purpose This paper reviews the current literature on the major challenges faced by building contractors in the UK due to COVID-19 to create an evaluation framework. Design/methodology/approach A PRISMA scoping review systematically maps the information published and establishes the potential challenges, as a precursor to a literature review that synthesises the data available to establish an initial COVID-19 evaluation framework to build a rationale for a future series of studies. Findings The research identified these seven challenges: health and safety on-site, economic cost, possible legal exposures, manpower availability, instability of the supply chain and subcontractors, and the uncertainty related to the constant and unpredictable evolution of the pandemic. The magnitude of each challenge was also found to differ depending on the size of the contractor, the rigor of local regulations and the sector where the contractor works. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to increasing understanding on the subject and provides an initial assessment framework, based on these seven parameters, so that contractors can analyse their weaknesses and plan specific priorities so that their companies can remain competitive, minimising the impact of COVID-19 and possible future waves. Originality/value This research is timely and relevant as it produces the first academic review on how COVID-19 has affected contractors and the construction stage. This document gives a holistic view of the new scenario created by COVID-19 and creates a self-assessment system for contractors to test their resistance to COVID-19.

J	Gurgun, AP; Koc, K				Gurgun, Asli Pelin; Koc, Kerim			Contractor prequalification for green buildings-evidence from Turkey	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green building; Prequalification; Construction industry; Decision making; AHP; MCDM	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MAKING MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION; CRITERIA; AHP; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPACTS; RISKS; STATE	Purpose Competent contractors are one of the critical stakeholders to achieve targeted sustainability objectives in green building (GB) projects. Prior to contractor selection, prequalification is an important step, which requires contractors with certain capabilities in addition to traditional features. This study aims to develop a systematic and practical model for prequalification in GB projects using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach by adopting the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach The AHP model with 8 main criteria groups and 25 sub-criteria is structured based on literature review and professional opinions accompanied by a pilot study. Then, interviews with experts, who are experienced in the development and application phases of GB projects in Turkey, are arranged to collect judgements. The agreement levels between different groups of experts are analysed via Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Model applicability is tested on six hypothetical contractors for practicality. Findings The results show that i) financial capabilities, ii) legal status and iii) sustainability groups are the top three main criteria, while i) compliance with schedule requirements of the client, ii) current legal status including suits, iii) negative litigation history records, iv) contractor's compliance capacity to client's sustainability checklist for the proposed project and v) sustainability with lower life cycle cost (durability, maintenance, constructability) are the top five sub-criteria. Originality/value There is a gap in the literature analysing contractor prequalification phase in GB projects. This study attempts to fill this lack provided with a practical evaluation tool.

J	Shen, LY; Drew, D; Zhang, ZH				Shen, LY; Drew, D; Zhang, ZH			Optimal bid model for price-time biparameter construction contracts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction clients are increasingly calling for bids that require competing contractors to submit both the bid price and contract time. In such situations contractors are faced with the problem of deciding which combination of bid price and contract time to submit. An important consideration is the cost of time to the client. This varies from contract to contract and is usually expressed in terms of a unit time value such as Liquidated damages rate or, for highway contracts, a daily road user cost. The unit time value is normally set out in the contract appendix and often used by the client as a basis for determining the contractor's total combined bid. This kind of procurement method is commonly referred to as the A + B method. To illustrate the mechanism of price-time biparameter procurement, a total combined bid Iso-map is developed in this study. The contractor's price-time performance curve is then incorporated into the map to determine the contractor's optimal bid parameters: tender price and contract time. Also, based on this mechanism, a mathematical optimization bid model is developed for calculating the optimal bid parameters.

J	Picornell, M; Pellicer, E; Torres-Machi, C; Sutrisna, M				Picornell, Miguel; Pellicer, Eugenio; Torres-Machi, Cristina; Sutrisna, Monty			Implementation of Earned Value Management in Unit-Price Payment Contracts	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contractor; Control; Cost; Earned value; Production; Unit-price	SYSTEM	The earned value management (EVM) method is internationally considered a standard tool in the project management field, enabling professionals to plan and control cost and schedule in an integrated manner. However, evidence indicates that EVM is not typically implemented by contractors when the payment agreement is based on unit-prices. In this payment approach, the owner pays the quantities actually executed according to the preagreed rate established in the contract for each unit or task; the income received by the contractor from the owner (generally named production) is neither proportional to costs nor fixed a priori, as in cost-reimbursable and lump sum contracts, respectively. Therefore, contractors have to control not only cost but also production. The current formulation of EVM does not allow controlling production; an additional baseline is needed. In response, this paper presents a proposal for adapting EVM to contractors when using the unit-prices payment agreement. Using a case study to illustrate, an additional baseline to account for production and profitability, as well as new indicators, is applied to allow contractors using EVM with this payment approach; this is the contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge. The proposed EVM formulation provides information not only in terms of cost (as in the traditional EVM approach) but also in terms of production.

This is even more important to green construction projects. There is a noticeable surge in the number of green construction projects. Green construction projects require contractors that have certain capabilities in addition to the traditional capabilities. This article highlights the key criteria for selecting contractors for green construction projects. Twenty criteria were identified based on literature review. These criteria were categorized into five groups: firm characteristics, firm record, commercial and technical bid, environmental and socio-economic. A survey was then developed and sent to professionals from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The respondents evaluated the selection criteria using pair-wise comparison using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Forty-eight responses were collected. The results show that the top five criteria are the bid price, energy management, technical bid, proposed time and water management. The results show that sustainability-related criteria (environmental and socio-economic groups) are important with a combined weight of 0.386.

J	Liu, L; Han, CF; Xu, WS				Liu, Liang; Han, Chuanfeng; Xu, Weisheng			Evolutionary analysis of the collaboration networks within National Quality Award Projects of China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration network; National Quality Award Project of China (NQAPC); Contractors; Project management; Construction industry	SOCIAL NETWORK; CONSTRUCTION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; ALLIANCES; EMERGENCE	Construction organizations are increasingly cooperating in what are often referred to as "collaboration network" that enabled them to share risks, pool resources and explore opportunities to jointly participate in managing large-scale projects. In this study, we construct the so-called inter-contractors' collaboration networks by mapping the electronic database of NQAPC for an 8-year period (2003-2010). In these networks, nodes represent contractors; two contractors are connected by an edge if they have cooperated at least one project. By using a variety of network measures, i.e., giant component, degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, we aim to descriptively investigate the structural evolution of the collaborations between contractors in the construction industry of China. As network size increases, we find a structural transition in the collaboration community size, the degree follows power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff, the average path length tends to decrease, and the clustering coefficient slightly decreases. Some explanations and a series of construction insights are discussed. The results and methodologies not only would help governors understand the social mechanisms underlie processes of construction industry, but could help contractors choose competent partners by identifying network properties.

As projects continue to grow in complexity, project management continues to evolve. Contractor selection is a difficult task that owners and project managers face. Although previously researchers have worked on the subject of contractor selection, a comprehensive decision support system for contractor selection has not yet been developed. Recent reports of major delays and cost overruns in mega projects highlight the need for a model that is able to be flexible and comprehensive becomes evident. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The research focuses on obtaining insights from field experts using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Then, a model was developed in the light of the data collected. Accordingly, the model was tested on a case study. Findings - This paper presents a model for contractor selection that is wholesome in its take on the topic. The model incorporates both managerial and technical aspects of the problem. The model was tested on a case study and it was proven to be feasible in real world applications. The contractor selection decision support system serves the needs of both academics and industry managers, as an integral part of project management. Originality/value - The model presented in this paper is innovative in its take on the problems. MCDA tools have been uniquely modified in this paper to cater to the needs of the selection problem while accounting for the criteria hierarchy that incorporates aspects that are instrumental for proper evaluation of a contractor's likelihood of success.

Findings confirm differences amongst preferred solutions in these international locations. French and German contractors tend to employ similar proprietary formwork methods, whilst the UK 'stand alone' in preferring traditional timber solutions. It is found that company size has no significant impact on the formwork system selected. Nine formwork selection factors are identified, and ranked in terms of importance for each international group of contractors. Statistically, the rankings are shown to have significant correlation for each pair of countries. 'Relative costs', 'Specification (quality) of concrete' and 'Degree of repetition', are found to be the principal formwork selection criteria. Correlation analysis reveals association between many of these selection factors.

J	Lee, J; Ham, Y; Yi, JS; Son, J				Lee, JeeHee; Ham, Youngjib; Yi, June-Seong; Son, JeongWook			Effective Risk Positioning through Automated Identification of Missing Contract Conditions from the Contractor's Perspective Based on FIDIC Contract Cases	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contract conditions; Contractor-friendly clauses; Contract risk; Unstructured text data; Rule-based natural-language processing (NLP)		Defining, measuring, and dealing with contractual risks are crucial for successful construction projects because the contractual risks can lead to serious claims and disputes. In general, construction participants make a stipulation regarding their roles and responsibilities by contracting in order to prevent such claims and disputes. A common practice for preparing construction contracts is to modify the standard contract forms to reflect the interests of the given project from the owner's perspective. In this process, however, favorable clauses that may be beneficial to the contractor are often modified or even removed, causing significant potential risks to the contractor. Therefore, an in-depth review of contract terms and conditions is required to avoid future risks. This study presents a new proactive risk assessment model to identify missing contractor-friendly clauses in the owner's modified contract conditions from the contractor's point of view. A case study is used to demonstrate the proposed framework, and real-world project cases were analyzed to understand what type of contractor-friendly clauses would likely be omitted in the owner's modified contract. In this study, the developed model builds on rule-based natural-language processing (NLP) to analyze unstructured text data through preprocessing, syntactic analysis, and semantic analysis. The proposed data-driven risk assessment model is expected to reduce the extent of human errors by (1) identifying potential contractual risks that could arise disputes; and (2) supporting to develop an appropriate response strategy for the given risks.

J	Wu, CL; Wang, F; Zou, PXW; Fang, DP				Wu, Chunlin; Wang, Feng; Zou, Patrick X. W.; Fang, Dongping			How safety leadership works among owners, contractors and subcontractors in construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety leadership; Safety culture; Construction project; Owner; Contractor; Subcontractor	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; EMPOWERING LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; CORPORATE PERFORMANCE; CLIMATE; BEHAVIOR; PARTICIPATION; QUESTIONNAIRE	Leadership is a key factor impacting construction safety, but previous research merely investigated the single-level relationship between safety leadership and safety performance and ignored the leadership interaction between different project stakeholders. To fill this gap, this paper aims to examine the relationships between safety leaderships of project owners, contractors and subcontractors and discover leadership dimensions which significantly impact construction safety performance. An impacting mechanism involving owner safety leadership, contractor safety leadership and subcontractor safety leadership are hypothetically proposed and empirically tested. The results show that significant relationships exist between safety leaderships of the three key stakeholders. Project safety culture acts as a significant mediator in these relationships. In addition, among all leadership dimensions of owners and contractors, safety influence and role modeling has the widest range of influence on project safety culture and other stakeholders' safety leadership. As such, it is suggested that owners and contractors should cultivate charisma and the ability of being influential about ideals in project managers and require them to behave as role models for others. The results also show that the caring dimension of leadership is more required in the frontline environment. Supervisors need more attention and support from the contractor in their well-being and organizational identification for the project. In conclusion, this paper establishes clear leadership impacting paths from owners to site supervisors of subcontractors in construction projects, which provides insights into effective ways to implement managerial measures and publicize policies and values to construction sites.

J	Wang, JY; Yuan, HP				Wang, Jiayuan; Yuan, Hongping			Factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes in construction projects: Case study from China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk attitude; Contractor; Construction projects; Decision making; China	MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; SCALE	Risk-based decision making (RBDM) is critical in successful construction project management, in which decision makers' attitudes towards risks play an important role. Most previous studies in construction project risk management have been focusing on the factors contributing to the success of risk management, but little attention was given to factors significantly affecting decision makers' risk attitudes in construction projects. To improve RBDM, we investigate the critical factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes in construction projects in China in this research. Literatures reviews, interviews and questionnaires are used for the identification of factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes. Statistical methods of ranking analysis and factor analysis are also implemented for verification and further analysis. The results show that the most important three factors are: "consequences of decision making", "engineering experience", and "completeness of project information". Results from factor analysis on the identified critical factors reveal that they can be grouped into four categories, namely: (1) knowledge and experience; (2) contractors' character; (3) personal perception; and (4) economic environment. The significance of this research is that the findings do not only provide decision making support for contractors by deepening their understandings of the factors that affect their risk attitudes, but also serve as a useful reference for further studies under this topic.

In addition, international construction project risks are highly interdependent. The objectives of this study are to (1) explore the risk paths in the international construction projects performed by Chinese contractors, and (2) examine the risk effects on the objectives of these projects. To achieve the research objectives, a total of 60 risks were identified from literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 104 professionals from Chinese international contractors. Adopting the structural equation modeling technique, this study proposed a networking of 20 significant risk paths. Specifically, host government-related risk, contractor's lack of experience, and contractors' lack of managerial skills had significant effect on project cost, quality, and schedule objectives, respectively. Moreover, host government-related risk affected project cost performance indirectly through resource price fluctuation, and contractors' lack of managerial skills affects project schedule objective indirectly through decrease in productivity. This study contributes to the literature because it is different from most of the previous studies, which depended on separate risk categories and generic checklists but failed to explore the potential interrelationships among risks in international construction projects. Additionally, the identification of risk path scenarios enables practitioners to gain a better understanding of the sources and impact areas of risks, and to better deal with the risks, thereby contributing to the practice.

J	Alavipour, SMR; Arditi, D				Alavipour, S. M. Reza; Arditi, David			Maximizing expected contractor profit using an integrated model	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Interest; Construction; Project management; Construction projects	OPTIMIZATION; PROJECTS	Purpose Planning for increased contractor profits should start at the time the contract is signed because low profits and lack of profitability are the primary causes of contractor failure. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated profit maximization model (IPMM) that aims for maximum expected profit by using time-cost tradeoff analysis, adjusted start times of activities, minimized financing cost and minimized extension of work schedule beyond the contract duration. This kind of integrated approach was never researched in the past. Design/methodology/approach IPMM is programmed into an automated system using MATLAB 2016a. It generates an optimal work schedule that leads to maximum profit by means of time-cost tradeoff analysis considering different activity acceleration/deceleration methods and adjusting the start/finish times of activities. While doing so, IPMM minimizes the contractor's financing cost by considering combinations of different financing alternatives such as short-term loans, long-term loans and lines of credit. IPMM also considers the impact of extending the project duration on project profit. Findings IPMM is tested for different project durations, for the optimality of the solutions, differing activity start/finish times and project financing alternatives. In all cases, contractors can achieve maximum profit by using IPMM. Research limitations/implications - IPMM considers a deterministic project schedule, whereas stochastic time-cost tradeoff analysis can improve its performance. Resource allocation and resource leveling are not considered in IPMM, but can be incorporated into the model in future research. Finally, the long computational time is a challenge that needs to be overcome in future research. Practical implications - IPMM is likely to increase profits and improve the chances of contractors to survive and grow compared to their competitors. The practical value of IPMM is that any contractor can and should use IPMM since all the data required to run IPMM is available to the contractor at the time the contract is signed. The contractor who provides information about network logic, schedule data, cost data, contractual terms, and available financing alternatives and their APRs can use an automated IPMM that adjusts activity start times and durations, minimizes financing cost, eliminates or minimizes time extensions, minimizes total cost and maximizes expected profit. Originality/value - Unlike any prior study that looks into contractors' profits by considering the impact of only one or two factors at a time, this study presents an IPMM that considers all major factors that affect profits, namely, time-cost tradeoff analysis, adjusted start times of activities, minimized financing cost and minimized extension of work schedule beyond the contract duration.

System information modelling in practice: Analysis of tender documentation quality in a mining mega-project	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Errors; Omissions; Mining; Object oriented; Information redundancy; SIM	INSTRUMENTATION; ERRORS	The quality of information contained in tender documentation produced using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and provided in a hard-copy format to an electrical engineering contractor for a port expansion facility, which formed an integral part of an Iron Ore mega-project is analyzed. A System Information Model (SIM), which is an object oriented approach, was retrospectively constructed from the documentation provided to assist the contractor with their tender bid preparation. During the creation of the SIM, a total of 426 errors and omissions were found to be contained within the 77 tender 'drawing' documents supplied to the contractor by an Engineering, Construction, Procurement and Management (EPCM). Surprisingly, 70 drawings referenced in the tender documentation, and the Input/Output lists and Cause/Effect drawings were not provided. Yet, the electrical contractor was required by the EPCM organization to provide a lump sum bid and also guarantee the proposed schedule would be met; the financial risks were too high and as a result the contractor decided not to submit a bid. It is suggested that if the original tender documentation had been prepared using a SIM rather than CAD, the quality of information presented to the contractor would have enabled them to submit a competitive bid for the works. The research concludes that the economic performance and productivity of mining projects can be significantly improved by using a SIM to engineer and document electrical instrumentation and control (EIC) systems.

J	AlHammad, AM; Assaf, S				AlHammad, AM; Assaf, S			Assessment of work performance of maintenance contractors in Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In Saudi Arabia as well as in other countries, building owners often differ in their approach to evaluating the work performance of their maintenance contractors. To unify the approach for such evaluation, the intent of this paper is to assess the evaluation approaches used by a variety of building owners and then focus on the main criteria used for the evaluation. To achieve this objective, this study is divided into two phases. The first phase includes a review of literature on the main criteria that can be used to evaluate maintenance contracts, followed by interviews with building owners and maintenance contractors to modify and update the criteria obtained from this review. The result of this phase is grouped into eight major categories. Each category involves a detailed list of the criteria used for the evaluation. The main categories include providing proper planning and scheduling; procuring materials for the site; providing suggestions on cost cutting; providing safety precautions at the building site; subcontracting control; and ensuring management efficiency, equipment availability, and man-power competence. The second phase consists of developing and then distributing a questionnaire for both building owners and maintenance contractors to rank the importance of each one of the detailed criteria indicated in the first phase of the study. The results of this survey indicate the significance of the criteria that should be used to evaluate contractors. Furthermore, the study indicates that owners and maintenance contractors generally agree on the ranking of the importance of the performance criteria.

The existing research on the new ICT development is creating very sophisticated and complex systems which are not yet applicable to this part of the construction industry. With regard to general limitations as design criteria, this research uses a collaborative approach to develop a cost control system for five selected small and-medium-sized contractors. The new efficient cost control system is adopted on the earned value concept and is developed using available ICT tools which are familiar and easy-to-learn. A collaborative approach can ensure the diffusion of technology to these companies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

This is often attributed to the use of various foreign standards, which are substantially different from Chinese standards. There are limited studies that investigate the reasons why the difference in standards are creating this challenge. This study explores the reason for the difficulties by using a mixed method research with survey data collected from construction companies involving 170 experienced managers who were involved in 115 international projects. It also involved interviews with an additional 76 managers. The findings confirm that Chinese contractors perceived significant difficulties implementing international projects due to the lack of knowledge of the foreign standards. It is concluded that an enhanced understanding of foreign standards, particularly in Middle Eastern countries, will improve cost and time performances in international projects. Strategies of active learning, inter-organizational cooperation and adjustment of talent training mode are suggested for the international contractors to cope with the issue of standards implementation.

J	Kim, S; Damnjanovic, I; Gunby, M				Kim, Seok; Damnjanovic, Ivan; Gunby, Molly			Effects of Pavement Spatial Variability on Contractor's Management Strategies	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Pavement management; Highway maintenance; Risk management	MODEL; MAINTENANCE; RELIABILITY; ALGORITHM; NUMBER	Performance-based maintenance contracts are becoming an increasingly popular method of outsourcing pavement maintenance work. These contracts transfer performance-related risks to contractors with the objective of reducing the total cost of maintenance over the pavement life cycle by leveraging on the efficiencies of private sector management. In such contractual settings, transportation agencies hedge their exposure to poorly performing pavements that require frequent attention. However, this comes with a price. Contractors price in their bids a premium to account for such scenarios. This paper presents a model for contractors to determine optimal management strategies by taking into account the inherent spatial variability in pavement's structural characteristics. The model considers a tradeoff between economies of scale associated with managing longer pavement sections and the risk reduction benefits with managing relatively smaller, e.g., more homogeneous sections. The results indicate that the length of optimal management sections depends not only on the expected contract penalty costs (disincentive costs), but also the ability of the contractor to explore economies of scale. The model is illustrated using typical data available to transportation agencies.

The major question posed in this study is: what types of contractor-supplier relationships are needed to develop and produce a modular housing system successfully? An in-depth case study examines a Dutch house-building company that is developing an 'industrialized' modular housing system in collaboration with several specialized suppliers. Based on the analysis of the ten dyadic contractor-supplier relationships, it is shown that contractor-supplier relationships in modular house-building are moderated by both demand and supply aspects. The alignment between product modules and contractor-supplier relationships is found to be contingent on four drivers: the degree of variety in customer demand, the extent of the required supplier investment, the extent of dependence on supplier knowledge, and the intentions of both the supplier and the buyer in a relationship.

J	Kog, F; Yaman, H				Kog, Faikcan; Yaman, Hakan			A multi-agent systems-based contractor pre-qualification model	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision support systems; Contractor pre-qualification; Contractor selection; Criteria evaluation; Multi-agent systems; Tender management system	CONSTRUCTION CLAIMS NEGOTIATION; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; PREQUALIFICATION CRITERIA; SELECTION; PROJECTS; CLIENT	Purpose - The selection of the contractor, as a main participant of a construction project, is the most important and challenging decision process for a client. The purpose of this paper is to propose a multi-agent systems (MAS)-based contractor pre-qualification (CP) model for the construction sector in the frame of the tender management system. Design/methodology/approach - The meta-classification and analysis study of the existing literature on CP, contractor selection and criteria weighting issues, which examines the current and important CP criteria, other than price, is introduced structurally. A quantitative survey, which is carried out to estimate initial weightings of the identified criteria, is overviewed. MAS are used to model the pre-qualification process and workflows are shown in Petri nets formalism. A user-friendly prototype program is created in order to simulate the tendering process. In addition, a real case regarding the construction work in Turkey is analyzed. Findings - There is a lack of non-human-driven solutions and automation in CP and in the selection problem. The proposed model simulates the pre-qualification process and provides consistent results. Research limitations/implications - The meta-classification study consists of only peer-reviewed papers between 1992 and 2013 and the quantitative survey initiates the perspectives of the actors of Turkish construction sector. Only the traditional project delivery method is selected for the proposed model, that is other delivery methods such as design/build, project management, etc., are not considered. Open, selective limited and negotiated tendering processes are examined in the study and the direct supply is not considered in the scope. Practical implications - The implications will help to provide an objective CP and selection process and to prevent the delays, costs and other troubles, which are caused by the false selection of a contractor. Originality/value - Automation and simulation in the pre-qualification and the selection of the contractor with a non-human-driven intelligent solution ease the decision processes of clients in terms of cost, time and quality.

Whilst such efforts will be contributed continuously, it is important that the level of the environmental performance in implementing construction activities can be properly measured and communicated to the public and project participants. This paper presents a scoring method for measuring the environmental performance committed by a contractor through calculating the contractor's environmental performance score (EPS). The level of EPS serves as a simple indicator for measuring and communicating the level of a contractor's environmental performance. The procedure for calculating EPS is formulated as an information technology (IT)-supported program. The program is designed not only to calculate EPS but also to allow for assisting contractors in diagnosing the causes of possible poor environmental performance. The diagnosis should enable the project parties involved to identify and adopt proper measures to improve environmental performance during implementing construction activities. A case study is formulated from a simulated environment for demonstrating the application of the EPS system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this regard, the aim of this study is to identify the most frequent, severe, and important causes of schedule delays affecting public constructions projects in Burkina Faso to enhance the managerial capability of project managers. This research was conducted by questionnaire survey to solicit the causes of schedule delays from 140 Burkinabe experts (clients, contractors, and consultants). After analyzing their frequency, severity, and importance index using a quantitative statistical method, the top five most important delay factors were ranked as follows: financial capability of the contractor, financial difficulties of the owner, equipment availability of the contractor, slow payments for completed work, and poor subcontractor performance by the contractor. A comparison of the causes of schedule delays in 11 countries to validate the results of the study showed that financial capability of the contractor was not only the most encountered factor in delays for Burkina Faso's construction industry, but also appeared in many other Asian and African countries.

BUILT ENVIRONMENT; JOINT VENTURES; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTS; SUCCESS	Investigation of market entry strategies is critical for the success of international contractors. Establishing partnerships is among the most effective vehicles of operating in international markets. The major objective of this paper is to analyze the partnership behavior of contractors in overseas projects. In this respect, social network analysis (SNA) was used to better understand the collaborative project networks in different markets and for projects of differing sizes. A database was developed based on the collaborative international construction projects where Turkish firms and their non-Turkish partners were involved. A total of 449 projects carried out in 46 countries were used for the analysis. The findings of the study suggest that contractors adopt different strategies depending on the market and project characteristics. The majority of the companies tend to remain in the same markets; they keep working with the same partners or choose local partners; and engage with multiple partners in more complex projects. This study is expected to help contractors reflect on their internationalization decisions and devise appropriate strategies to establish project networks.

Quantitative Bid or No-Bid Decision-Support Model for Contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding behaviors; Bidding factors; Weight factors; Optimization; Importance scoring; Contracting	UP SIZE DECISIONS	The bidding behavior of contractors in the Malawi contract construction market was investigated using a selected set of 75 bidding factors in a structured questionnaire survey administered to a random representative sample of contractors where contractors were asked to indicate the importance they attach to given bidding factors when making a bid or no-bid decision. A proposed simple additive weighted scoring (SAWS) model was used to generate importance weights of bidding factors and subjective importance scoring of internal (firm-related) and external (project-related and environment-related) factors affecting the bid or no-bid decision for a given bidding situation. Conclusions of contractor bid or no-bid decision behavior from the questionnaire study were corroborated with a semistructured interview study involving senior industry players deemed more familiar with real-life bid or no bid decision problems. Medium-to-large-sized contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 50% of the importance scoring of external factors, whereas small contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 45% of the importance scoring of external factors and hence offering quantitative criteria for when to pursue a bidding opportunity (bid) or not to pursue a bidding opportunity (no bid) on a new job in the studied contract construction market. The proposed bid or no-bid decision-support model was found to be 86% effective in predicting the actual decisions in 35 real-life bid or no-bid situations in a test study of the model in the Malawian contract construction market. The primary value of this study is the development of an effective and reliable tool for quantifying bid or no-bid decisions that is functional for any studied contract construction market with the potential to facilitate contractors' establishing in-house procedures and managerial decision support systems likely to improve the quality of decision-making in the construction industry.

Activities associated with these phases demand energy and other resources, which impose a burden on the environment. Therefore, every phase must be explored to minimize the energy requirements of each building project. There is a pressing need for sustainable projects in this highly competitive market. Demand is continually growing for contractors to innovate and incorporate measures to reduce energy consumption and the associated environmental impact of their operations. This study focuses on the energy consumed during the construction phase of buildings. It proposes a framework to assist contractors in estimating and recording such energy consumption. The tool, Contractor's Energy Information System (CEIS), was developed to aid in this endeavor. The tool was applied on a three-story office project to demonstrate the concept's utility. This study demonstrates that although default data can estimate overall energy consumption, project-specific data can better quantify and map energy consumption. A data-collection mechanism and a tool-implementation mechanism were also suggested.

J	Hyari, KH				Hyari, Khaled Hesham			Owner's Countermeasures to Skewed Bidding in Construction Projects: Review of Current Practices and Proposal for New Countermeasures	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Review						Skewed bidding; Unbalanced pricing; Competitive bidding; Construction owners; Bid pricing; Construction contracts; Bidding strategies		Skewed bidding is advocated as a contractor bidding strategy to obtain higher profit at the expense of the owner or gain competitive advantage over other bidders. Many scholars presented bid-skewing models to maximize a contractor's benefits from unbalanced bids. Excessive skewing of bids has negative impacts on the owners and the integrity of the competitive bidding process. This paper presents a multitude of counterstrategies that can be utilized by owners and bidding officials in order to mitigate adverse impacts of skewed pricing on the owner. Some of the presented measures are preventive measures and intend to deter contractors from manipulating the pricing of their bids, and the rest are remedial measures that can mitigate the impacts of imbalance in bidding on the owner. The analyzed countermeasures are categorized according to the type of bid skewing sought by the strategy. Bidding officials can adopt one or combine a number of counterstrategies that suit their needs and go along with the jurisdictions governing their bidding process. It is expected that the diversity of the discussed countermeasures will provide indispensable support to bidding officials in their endeavors to protect public interests and ensure an efficient use of the public money. The presented counterstrategies should also prove to be useful to contractors because they prevent some contractors from taking unfair competitive advantage over other contractors who follow bidding instructions and bid balanced prices.

Previous studies have been conducted to build up quantitative decision models for contractor pre-qualification, among them artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been proved to be desirable in solving the pre-qualification problem with regards to their higher accuracy and efficiency for solving the non-linear problem of classification. Based on the algorithm of SVM, multiple kernel learning (MKL) method was developed and it has been proved to perform better than SVM in other areas. Hence, MKL is proposed in this research, the capability of MKL was compared with SVM through a case study. From the result, it has been proved that both SVM and MKL perform well in classification, and MKL is more preferable than SVM, with a proper parameter setting. Therefore, MKL can enhance the decision making of contractor pre-qualification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lam, K. C.; Yu, C.

Contractor's opportunistic bidding behavior and equilibrium price level in the construction market	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							IMPACT	The competitive bidding system has been to blame for abnormally low bids, which are considered as one of the main causes of poor project quality. Previous studies have regarded the pricing of bidders as an optimum decision based on contractor's cost and market competition level. However, the sell to produce characteristic of construction projects may induce contractors to offer a low bid and then make up the amount initially sacrificed from beyond-contractual reward (BCR) gained through cutting corners and claims. System dynamics was adopted in this study to develop a contractor's pricing model with consideration of the dimensions of cost, market competition, and BCR. The model was then examined by statistical analysis of data collected from 44 highway projects in Taiwan. It was found that the equilibrium market price is significantly associated with BCR, which is assumed to be determined by the strictness of the owner's construction management, including both soundness of contract and tightness in construction supervision. Research results suggest that contractors divide the market into different segments according to the owner's strictness of construction management and the equilibrium price level of each market segment varies. The price level for projects with a strict owner is remarkably higher than for those with relatively less strict owners. Improvement in the construction management system of projects is crucial to lower the possibility that contractors gain BCR and do opportunistic bidding, and to further enhance project quality.

Following validation of latent concepts by multigroup assessment of responses across the two groups (clients and contractors), using confirmatory factor analysis, this enabled robust tests of evidence of structural paths (potentially causal or mediating relationships) embedded in both groups' responses. The results confirmed, with unprecedented clarity, that performance feedback has significant, direct positive effects on construction process performance, and that performance feedback mediates (i.e., strengthens) effects of learning and collaboration on process performance.

State of Practice of Building Information Modeling in the Electrical Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information models; Computer aided design; Construction management; Contractors; Electrical equipment; Planning; Surveys; Construction industry; Building information modeling; Communication; Computer aided design; Construction management; Contractors; Electrical equipment; Planning; Surveys; Information technologies		For decades, the North American construction industry has seen a decline in productivity due to many underlying reasons. Moreover, the construction industry in general and electrical construction companies in particular struggled with coordination and productivity. Within the last decade, building information modeling (BIM) has become the means for a real solution to these problems. This paper attempts to highlight the practices and state of BIM in the electrical construction industry. Through an extensive survey and interview process, this research has provided three main conclusions. First, electrical contractors have not yet advanced their implementation of BIM, with 59% of respondents having three years or less experience with BIM. Second, in order to maintain a positive outcome for the use of BIM on a project, contractors should maintain one to three staff members as BIM specialists, adding a cost of 2% or less from the total project cost to implement BIM. Third, BIM does indeed reduce field conflicts and improve coordination. Other than quantifying the current state of practice and impact of BIM on electrical contractors and approximating its future use in this industry, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about BIM by offering the electrical contractors recommendations that will assist them in allocating the proper resources and to understand the evolving use of BIM.

J	Fang, DP; Li, MG; Fong, PSW; Shen, LY				Fang, DP; Li, MG; Fong, PSW; Shen, LY			Risks in Chinese construction market - Contractors' perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							POLITICAL RISKS; JOINT VENTURES; MANAGEMENT	With China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Chinese construction market will be increasingly open and finally become part of the international market. Because of different social and economic systems, as well as different historical and cultural backgrounds, contractors are likely to encounter different risks in different markets. Based on questionnaires and case studies, this paper adopts an importance evaluation index and makes an importance evaluation of various risks encountered by Chinese contractors when contracting for projects in Chinese markets. This paper also makes comparisons between and analyses of the research findings and related available investigation results. The Cox-Stuart trend increase test method is applied in the current research, the results indicating that the variance corresponding to the importance index value tends to increase as the risk event importance decreases. This tendency shows that those investigated tend towards unanimity in terms of higher importance risk events. This paper also examines the reliability of the questionnaires by means of Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient. The research shows that the main risk currently encountered by Chinese contractors in domestic markets includes owner's irregular behavior and government departments' interference in construction markets. China's accession to the WTO has provided greater opportunities for international contractors to enter the Chinese construction market. Therefore the research results described in this paper can provide valuable data enabling international contractors to gain a better understanding of the potential risks in the environment of the Chinese construction market.

J	Li, JR; Jiang, WP; Zuo, J				Li, Jingru; Jiang, Weiping; Zuo, Jian			The effects of trust network among project participants on project performance based on SNA approach: a case study in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social network analysis (SNA); trust; project participants; project performance; construction project	SOCIAL NETWORK; MODEL	Project participants especially project owners and contractors have important effect in promoting project success. This study investigated the relationship between project participants' trust network and project success in construction projects through social network analysis. Results indicated that a trust network among project participants (excluding the relationship between project owner and contractor) is more influential on project success than trust between the project owner and contractor. Project participants' trust network has significant impact on project cost and quality, but not on schedule, perhaps because political projects in China must be completed before prescheduled deadlines. This study highlights the importance of project participants besides project owners and contractors. Both scholars and professionals should pay attention to project participants relationship management.

The objectives are to determine the level of management efforts made by contractors oil H&S and their correlation with H&S performance. To achieve these objectives, a field Survey involving a sample of 40 contractors selected by stratified random sampling from the contractors registered with the Federation of Construction Industry of Nigeria was carried Out. For the study, 6 H&S management variables and 7 H&S performance variables were selected. The H&S management variables are in compliance with H&S regulations, provision of H&S facilities, structures for managing H&S in head and site offices, provision of PPE and H&S incentives, while the H&S performance variables are respondents' assessment of the performance of structures for managing H&S in head and site offices, accident, injury, accident per worker. injury per worker and injury per accident rates. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analysed by mean and Spearman correlation test. The results reveal that contractors' efforts on structures for managing H&S oil site are the best correlates of H&S performance, but their level is low. The levels of contractors' efforts in provision of PPE, compliance with H&S regulations are high, but these efforts are not correlates of H&S performance. The levels of contractors efforts in structures for managing H&S in head office and provision of H&S incentives are low and they have low correlation with H&S performance. The Study considers these results as indication that the management efforts made by Nigerian contractors to ensure a healthy and safe work environment are yet to have meaningful impact. It Suggests increased efforts on local H&S regulations. Structures for managing H&S in both head and site off-ices and provision of H&S incentives as measures for improving safety in the Nigerian construction industry.

Key risks in construction projects in Italy: contractors' perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Italy; Construction management; Risk management; Contractors; Risk factors; Construction projects	MANAGEMENT	Purpose - Risks play an important role in the success of construction projects. Failure in identification and assessment of risks can lead to inadequacy in the process of managing risks, which in turn can critically affect the projects' resources. A formal risk management is rarely practised in construction projects due to the lack of contractors' awareness of key risks. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the investigation of risk factors in construction projects in Italy from contractors' perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data, based on which a total of ten key risks were ascertained. The identified risks were compared with the findings of the surveys conducted in the Australian and Chinese construction industry to address the unique risks associated with construction projects in Italy. Findings - The key risks included delays in payments, client variations, design variations, inaccurate cost estimates, and tight project schedules. The comparison between those three countries specified the delays in payments and project funding problems as the most critical factors that are related to cultural influences and behaviour of clients. The findings assist contractors in the risk identification process, and can be applied to the development of a risk management framework for construction projects. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study cannot be generalised statistically for the whole of Italy as it was constrained geographically, with respondents drawn only from a self-selection sample of construction projects in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. The findings represent a snapshot of the key potential internal and external risks from the perspective of contractors. Originality/value - The results of the study specified the key risks of construction projects from the perspective of contractors which can contribute to risk management for construction projects.

We investigate how a contractor's network position affects his success in winningpublic procurement projects, measured as the average value of projects won. To accomplish this objective, we adopt a social network analysis approach. Our evidence come from an empirical analysis of the network positions of general contractors involved in public procurement projects in the construction industry in the Veneto region from 2008 to 2012. We explore through social network measures how partnering ability influences organizational success in winning public procurement projects. We identify three components of partnering ability: breadth; reach; brokerage. Only the first is crucial in determining the success of firms in public procurement practices. Managers involved in public procurement projects in the construction industry should invest in nurturing their partnering abilities by connecting to many partners to be involved in future projects.

Defining Best Value for Construction Manager/General Contractor Projects: The CMGC Learning Curve	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project delivery; Construction management; Managers; Contractors; Alternative project delivery; Construction manager; general contractor; Procurement; Best value; Transportation		Construction manager/general contractor (CMGC) project delivery is rapidly being implemented to deliver the full gamut of highway projects across the United States. One issue that must be resolved before a public transportation agency can advertise a CMGC contract is whether or not to include price in the selection scheme, and if so, how much weight the price component will carry versus all other evaluation criteria. This paper discusses the results of research into this topic based on an analysis of the experience of 26 public transportation agencies on 36 CMGC projects in 14 U.S. states. The paper finds that there is a learning curve that can be mapped as the change in price factor weight over time as an agency gains experience with CMGC, and details that finding via a case study of the Utah Department of Transportation's CMGC program. The paper concludes that non-price factors, such as the CMGC contractor's approach to the preconstruction phase, are more important than price factors and should carry a greater weight in the evaluation plan. It also finds that weight accorded to price factors decreases as an agency gains CMGC experience. Finally, it recommends that agencies that are trying CMGC for the first time focus their selection scheme on factors that will reflect on a given contractor's ability to collaborate with the owner and designer during the preconstruction phases of the project rather than on obtaining the lowest price.

In this research, the causes of contractors' claims in international EPC projects are modeled and empirically tested with industry survey, structural equation modeling and case studies from the perspective of Chinese contractors. The established model outlines the causes of contractors' claims as: external risk (sociopolitical risks, economic risks, and natural hazards), clients' organizational behavior (untimely payment, change orders, and inefficient processing), and project definition in contract (unclear scope of works, and unclear technical specification). The structural equation modelling validates that these causes have direct influences on claim respectively. Besides, clients' organizational behavior acts as a partial mediation between external risk and claim, demonstrating that external risk can also exert influence on claim through affecting clients' organizational behavior. Seven case studies further confirmed and interpreted the substantive meaning of these relationships. This study establishes interdisciplinary linkages among knowledge areas of contracting, risk management, organizational behavior, and international EPC project delivery, which has important primary contributions in both theory and practice. Understanding how the fundamental factors interactively lead to claims can help contracting parties to develop effective claim strategies, proactively mitigate project risks, and ultimately improve EPC project performance.

Empirical Framework for Making the Bid/No-Bid Decision	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bids; Decision making; Data analysis; Construction industry; Contractors; Bidding; Bid; no-bid; Decision making; Data envelopment analysis	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; UP SIZE DECISIONS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; PROJECTS; MODEL; DEA; SELECTION; SYSTEM	Deciding whether or not to bid on a particular project is regarded as one of the major challenges faced by construction contractors. This decision-making problem involves the consideration of several factors. These factors are related to project, client, consultant, competitors, and market. Although several researchers have targeted the subject of bidding in construction, few of them have tackled the bid/no-bid problem in particular. The purpose of this paper is to propose an empirical framework for making the bid/no-bid decision. The proposed framework consists of two consecutive components. Component 1 determines key bidding factors that are considered by contractors when evaluating bids. Senior managers at top contracting organizations were interviewed to identify factors that affect the bid/no-bid decision. Component 2 utilizes data envelopment analysis (DEA) to make the bid/no-bid decision. The strengths of utilizing DEA include its input-output framework, which facilitates incorporating many factors in the decision-making process. The proposed framework offers construction contractors a systematic approach for making the bid/no-bid decision. The model is practically illustrated based on 39 bids that were collected from eight contractors.

Two large Spanish general contractors were selected for an in-depth analysis. Interviews and surveys were conducted with six additional companies to explore the external validity of the findings. Managers constrain time and cost buffers through project objectives, applying heuristics to determine inventory buffers. The management of capacity buffers is entrusted to subcontractors. The contractors take advantage of scope and quality buffers to meet project objectives but rarely share these buffers with the owner, unless the owner is an internal client.

Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) is a relationship-based procurement model that allows the client, the designer, and the contractor to work collaboratively, which results in improved performance. Previous ECI research has focused on its implementation in private projects and public projects managed by the Federal and State Governments. This research investigates the implementation of ECI in Local Government projects in Sydney, Australia. Interviews revealed that the main challenges are probity, developing principle project requirements document, running ECI workshops, changing the attitudes of project participants, and the time-consuming nature of ECI process. When these challenges are overcome, Local Government projects can reap the benefits of ECI, such as collaborative work relationships, better constructability, innovation, cost certainty, improved risk management, and better value for money. It is concluded that ECI is a suitable procurement model to improve project performance in the Local Government context.

J	Wong, PSP; Whelan, B; Holdsworth, S				Wong, Peter S. P.; Whelan, Blair; Holdsworth, Sarah			Are contractors ready for greater use of prefabrication in projects? An empirical analysis on the role of unlearning and counter-knowledge	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prefabrication; organisational readiness; unlearning; counter knowledge		Despite the recognised benefits of more extensive use of prefabrication in construction projects, a widespread market transformation has yet to occur. One of the key barriers to more extensive adoption of prefabrication is the resistance to practice change within the contractors' firms. Organisational readiness (OR) has been known as the antecedent to the success of practice change. This paper reports a study that aims to examine the factors affecting contractors' OR for more extensive use of prefabrication in projects. Backed by the literature review, a conceptual framework that depicts the inter-relationships among OR, unlearning (UL) and counter knowledge (CK) was proposed and empirically tested in this study. Data were collected from a questionnaire survey conducted in Australia. The results indicated that UL is positively correlated to OR. To build confidence in and gain acceptance by the employees within the contractor firms, long-term benefits for practice change should be articulated. Furthermore, the idea of more extensive use of prefabrication is less likely to be accepted when UL does not take place while CK is present. Inclusive communication within the contractor firms is vital to minimise employees' resistance to practice change. Coercive approaches to practice change, however, may negatively affect OR.

J	Ye, KH; Shen, LY; Xia, B; Li, BH				Ye, Kunhui; Shen, Liyin; Xia, Bo; Li, Bingheng			Key attributes underpinning different markup decision between public and private projects: A China study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding; Markup decision; Decision factors; Competitiveness; China	UP SIZE DECISIONS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; CONTRACTORS; SYSTEM; COMPETITIVENESS; FRAMEWORK; SOFTWARE; SERVICES; MODEL; BIDS	In the construction industry, contractors have to improve the efficiency of markup decision-making to survive from fierce business competition. The effect of client type on markup decision has been aware in previous studies and contractors are advocated to take account of decision factors properly when they are confronted with different types of projects. Nevertheless, the rationales behind the inclusion of different factors in markup decision-making for different projects are unknown. In this study, fifty-three factors were identified after extensive literature review and interviews with professionals. The identified factors were afterwards grouped under the headings of nine attributes and compiled in a questionnaire for survey in China. Using the Hotelling's T-square test, it is found that three attributes (i.e., project characteristic, client characteristic, and macro condition) can explain the effect of client type on contractors' markup decision. The research findings provide useful insights into the cognition of bid pricing as well as the improvement of bidding efficiency. While the research works were situated in China, contractors in other countries could benefit from the research findings in a similar vein. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Jarkas, AM; Mubarak, SA; Kadri, CY				Jarkas, Abdulaziz M.; Mubarak, Saleh A.; Kadri, Charles Y.			Critical Factors Determining Bid/No Bid Decisions of Contractors in Qatar	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bidding decision; Tendering; Construction projects; Constructability; State of Qatar	MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	To bid or not to bid for construction projects is a crucial strategic decision for contractors' sustainability in the industry. The high complexity and uncertainty associated with such a decision-making process, which involves several multitudes and reflection of numerous internal and external determinants, necessitate further exploration of the prominent factors underpinning contractors' decisions. Following the announcement of awarding the "Federation Internationale de Football Association" (FIFA) 2022 World Cup hosting rights to the State of Qatar on December 2, 2010, the State is pledging to spend tens of billions of dollars on hundreds of new projects. Thus, the objective of this case study is to identify, explore, and rank the relative importance of the critical factors determining contractors' decisions to bid or not bid for local construction projects. To achieve this objective, a structured questionnaire survey comprising 43 factors that were shortlisted based on relevant previous investigations on bidding practices in the construction industry, and the input of local industry experts and professionals, was distributed to a statistically representative sample of contractors. Using the "Relative Importance Index" technique, the following critical factors are identified: (1) previous experience with the employer, (2) need for work, (3) current workload, (4) previous experience in similar projects, (5) size of project, (6) identity and reputation of the employer in the industry, (7) financial stability of the employer, (8) availability of other projects, (9) promptness of the employer in the payment process, and (10) tender documents quality level. The outcomes reported in this study can be used to provide employers, consultants, contractors, and policymakers, guidance for focusing, acting upon, and controlling the cardinal factors perceived to impact contractors' bidding behaviors in an environment on the brink of undergoing an unprecedented boom in demand for faster delivery and lower cost of constructed facilities.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that affect the decision of indigenous construction contractors to bid or not to bid in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis was conducted on data from questionnaires received from 64 engineering management employees of leading construction companies which are members of Nigeria's Federation of Construction Industry. The study identified 41 significant decision factors often considered by Nigerian indigenous contractors before the bid. Mean item scores were obtained for each of the factors. Principal component analysis was used to point out the most significant decision factors. Findings - Results revealed significant orthogonal relationships between the factors. Only 11 of the 41 factors are statistically significant to influence contractors' decision to bid or not to bid. Most of the significant items were amongst the least rated items by the participants. The post hoc decision factors include consultant's interpretation of project specifications, previous relationship between the intending bidder and client, availability of other projects at the time of bidding, technological complexity of the project under consideration and prequalification requirements. Others include the propensity for resource price fluctuation, business capacity of partners, amount of own work vs subcontracted work, required rate of return on investment and difficulty in obtaining finance. Originality/value - The practical implication of these findings are as follows: the orthogonal relationship between the decision factors implies non-linear relationship between the factors and actual decision to bid or not to bid, and that bid success is often not predictable by bid behaviour; many of the bid decision factors rated highest by indigenous contractors seldom impact the contractors' actual bid decisions; local and international players can adopt the significant decision factors elicited in this study for managing their structures for inter-organizational partnerships.

J	Liu, JY; Lin, S; Feng, YB				Liu, Junying; Lin, Sen; Feng, Yingbin			Understanding why Chinese contractors are not willing to purchase construction insurance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Risk management; Construction; Questionnaire survey	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR MODEL; EXTENDED THEORY; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; RISK-MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; INTENTION; PARTICIPATION; PROBABILITY; INFORMATION	Purpose Construction insurance has been advocated as a useful financial means to transfer risks and mitigate potential project losses. However, there is a general reluctance to purchase construction insurance in China. The purpose of this paper is to develop an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) model to understand and predict contractors' construction insurance purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire survey. The respondents comprise 130 project directors/managers and contract managers/administrators who were involved in or familiar with the construction insurance purchasing or managing. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings This study developed an extended TPB model to explain the contractors' intention formation. The results indicated that the insurance purchasing intention was mainly influenced by attitudes and subjective norm, rather than perceived behavioral control. The analyses also revealed that the added variables (risk perception and past experience) had a significant impact on the attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Originality/value This study identified the factors leading to Chinese contractors' low willingness to purchase construction insurance by extending the TPB model to the context of construction insurance purchasing. The extended TPB model may serve as a theoretical framework and basis for the Chinese contractors, insurers, and regulators to understand the root causes of contractors' low willingness to purchase construction insurance and make joint efforts to address the risks and insurance in the construction industry.

However, little research has been conducted to explore the learning nature of RM from the perspective of contractors. Based on a longitudinal case study of three construction projects, this paper aims to present a holistic analysis on the RM learning process from the experience of a small-to-medium (SM) general contractor (GC) in China to explore the underlying facts determining the effectiveness of RM practices. It was found that a variety of causes led to rework in the three projects, which highlighted the importance to enhance GC's learning capacity to effectively reduce rework. A conceptual RM learning framework (CRMLF), which consists of people, approach, process, tool and project environment, was developed based on the analysis of influential factors of successful learning within the RM domain. This paper is valuable for practitioners and academics to understand the inherent nature of RM to continuously improve the project performance.

It helps shift risk from the main contractor to the subcontractor and promotes specialization. Inadequate subcontracting management, however, may result in an adversarial relationship between main contractors and their subcontractors, uncoordinated on-site execution, and disappointing quality and schedule fulfillment. New subcontractor management methods and tools are being developed and tested as part of a collaborative research project led by the Catholic University Production Management Center with the participation of the Chilean Construction Chamber and several construction companies. The experience gained by testing prototype tools and methods on selected projects enabled us to develop an on-site evaluation method based on lean principles and partnering practices. This method allows main contractors to help subcontractors improve their performance by providing them with periodic feedback. It also supports subcontractor selection based on their previous performance, which helps foster collaborative relationships with those that consistently perform well. The results of the application of the method in two case studies are discussed.

J	Eriksson, PE				Eriksson, Per Erik			Procurement effects on coopetition in client-contractor relationships	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRUST; CONSTRUCTION; COOPERATION; COMPETITION; ALLIANCES; ARRANGEMENTS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; MATTER	Client-contractor relationships are often criticized for being competitive and adversarial, rather than cooperative. The main purpose of this paper is to examine how construction clients' procurement procedures affect the balance between cooperation and competition (i.e., coopetition) in client-contractor relationships. The empirical results, based on a survey to 87 Swedish construction clients, show that clients' procurement procedures facilitate a focus on competition. It was also found that clients' earlier experience of a certain procedure heavily affects their procurement choices, thereby preserving old behaviors. Although two-thirds of the clients wish to increase cooperation with contractors, this does not affect their procurement decisions. This study therefore concludes that the theoretical framework, based on transaction cost economics, is correct in prescribing more cooperation than is empirically observed in the construction sector. The theoretical framework can increase clients' awareness of how procurement affects cooperation and competition, thereby serving as a basis for more unbiased and systematic procurement decisions, facilitating cooperation-based coopetition.

J	Whang, SW; Flanagan, R; Kim, S; Kim, S				Whang, Seoung-Wook; Flanagan, Roger; Kim, Seungho; Kim, Sangyong			Contractor-Led Critical Design Management Factors in High-Rise Building Projects Involving Multinational Design Teams	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Critical factor; Design management; High-rise building project; Multinational design team; Organizational issues	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; ON-SITE; CONSTRUCTION; COMPETITIVENESS; ELEMENTS; SYSTEM; RISKS	High-rise building projects (HRPs) are comprised of various complex design elements. The involvement of a multinational design team increases design-related issues for contractors, which must be managed during the construction stage. Thus, contractors need to understand how appropriate design management can positively affect project performance and their profit. Identification of critical design management factors (CDMFs) can provide appropriate decision-making support for contractors, including how limited resources including money, manpower, and equipment can be allocated throughout the construction stage. This study identifies and ranks the CDMFs for HRPs designed by multinational design teams. Through a questionnaire survey in South Korea, 21 design management factors were acknowledged among 40 initial factors. Then, using factor analysis, these 21 identified CDMFs were categorized into four groups: interface management, design information, production stage, and risk contribution. Based on results, this study identifies general and regional features of design management. Because these CDMFs are chosen from the contractor's perspective, if they are used to make appropriate decisions, the overall project performance should be increased during the construction phases.

Adopting a quantitative research design and structural equation model, 100 valid returns were obtained from a questionnaire-based survey, which included five main factors: soundness of business and workforce, planning and control, quality performance, past performance, and overall project success. Results revealed that contractor's quality performance has the highest impact on project success, followed by soundness of business and workforce, planning and control capabilities, and past performance. Additionally, results showed that past performance has no influence on quality performance while soundness of business and workforce impacts planning and control strongly, which significantly impacts quality performance. Moreover, soundness of business and workforce and past performance are weakly correlated. These findings could aid clients and contractors in prioritizing the criteria of the prequalification process.

The research reported here uses an experimental design approach to quantity the importance of nine common criteria used in an actual evaluation and selection of a contractor/supplier. Unique choice sets were constructed, each comprising three tender evaluation outcomes (alternatives) described in terms of all criteria, but with varying levels. Respondents simultaneously evaluated all three alternatives within each choice set and selected the most preferred. Utility estimates for each criterion level were determined as was the overall contribution made by the individual criterion.

The goal of the effort is to better understand how much construction contractors have advanced in adopting information technologies in general and wireless communications in particular. Responses were collected from 152 U.S. and 31 Korean firms. It was found that, overall, the strongest interest among the responding contractors is in document and content management applications. Differences between Korean and U.S. contractors are discussed. The data indicate that the use of information technology by contractors is generally higher in Korea than in the United States. Both practitioners and scientists will be able to use the presented study because the data reveal the managers' perceptions of the most promising opportunities for and highest barriers to implementation of advanced communication systems in construction. With the information provided, interested readers of this journal will be able to focus their attention on pursuing specific opportunities and removing barriers to future adoptions.

The public agencies that administrate such projects manage project packages that must be integrated. All project packages may involve similar work. However, they are carried out by different contractors each with their own scheduling practices. Standardization provides a foundation for more efficient and effective schedule integration, but cannot easily be enforced without objections from contractors. This paper presents a three-stage standardization implementation framework using modularization. A set of network modules that involve normal, repetitive, cyclic, and merging activities was developed for expressway projects. Two computer systems were developed to help contractors use these modules to create schedules, and to help the owner review schedules submitted by contractors. Experiments and a survey were also carried out to validate the proposed framework, demonstrating a significant amount of time saving and errors reduced by using network modules.

Thus, evaluating financial status and predicting business failures of construction companies are crucial for owners, general contractors, investors, banks, insurance firms, and creditors. The prediction results can be used to select qualified contractors capable of accomplishing the projects. In this study, a hybrid fuzzy instance-based classifier for contractor default prediction (FICDP) is proposed. The new approach is constructed by incorporating the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor classifier (FKNC), the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), and the firefly algorithm (FA). In this hybrid paradigm, the FKNC is utilized to classify the contractors into two groups ("default" and "nondefault") based on their past financial performances. Since the "nondefault" samples dominate the historical database, the SMOTE algorithm is employed to create synthetic samples of the minority class and therefore alleviates the between-class imbalance problem. Moreover, the FA is employed to determine an appropriate set of model parameters. Experimental results have shown that the proposed FICDP can outperform other benchmark methods.

There has been no practical analytic model for objective determination of the most appropriate contractor selection method (CSM) before the tendering evaluation. Most existing models adopt the posttendering bidding data for a specific procurement project rather than those from all potential bidders who may enter the procurement market. To resolve the long-unsolved problem of the existing models, this paper proposes a pretendering contractor selection analysis model (PreCSAM) based on historical procurement data, which can determine the most appropriate of the three prevailing contractor selection methods, e.g., lowest tender (LT), best value (BV), and prequalified lowest tender (PQLT). The three-stage model validation of the proposed method revealed that the proposed PreCSAM is able to suggest a CSM with 100% correctness compared with those reported in literature; it also achieved a high precision rate (94.12%) of market range prediction for a retrospective analysis of 23 public building construction projects from 2012 to 2018 procurements by the Construction and Planning Agency of the Ministry of Interior, Taiwan. Most importantly, the proposed PreCSAM overcomes the limitations of posttendering analysis of all existing methods in determining CSM. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Deviation from base plans can be found using project control methods, continuous assessment of the schedule, determining progress percentages and earned value parameters. In such circumstances, conflicts might arise between contractor and owner as restoring project's original schedule needs added expenditures by the contractor. Moreover, continuation of the previous procedure and late completion of the project will cause the owner damage. In this research, a mathematical model using game theory has been presented. The model investigates the behaviour and strategies of the parties involved in a delayed project through bargaining. It helps owners and contractors gain deeper understanding of the given delay problem, get a fairly accurate analysis of their situation and consider possible strategies in facing with such circumstances without spending a long and inconclusive time. The points which both parties can agree rationally proposed with a numerical example. Results of the model indicate that parameters involved in the problem are effective in changing the range width of negotiation. In special cases, such as disproportionate delay penalty, these parameters even make it neutral in negotiation. Step by step analysis of the model showed which features can threaten negotiation.

Many researchers have embraced the strategy of partnering to integrate diverse project delivery activities by meeting the needs of all project participants. However, limited research has addressed the cause effect relationships among partnering, risk management, and organizational capability on how performance improvements can be generated from them on a holistic view. This study systematically investigates the causal relationships among these themes by establishing and testing a conceptual model. With the support of data collected from Chinese contractors with experience in delivering EPC projects by questionnaire, interview, and a case study, the results provide empirical evidences on contractors' partnering application degree, strength, and weakness of organizational capabilities, overall picture of risk management, and project performance level, which form a sound basis for contractors' decision making during project implementation. This study further reveals that partnering can not only directly facilitate organizational capability and risk management but also exert its influence on risk management through enhanced organizational capability, thereby improving project performance. The above insights suggest research and practical emphases on combining risk management with partnering principles to assist in both intra- and inter- organizational activities, and contractors' appropriate linking with involved stakeholders to obtain necessary resources and effectively transfer them for successfully delivering international EPC projects.

The concern of reducing the duration of these projects is one of the important issues among various aspects; thus, our aim is to fulfill the requirements by using the game theory approach. In this study, a mixed-integer programming model consisting of game theory and project scheduling is developed to reduce the duration of projects with a minimum increase in costs. In this model, two contractors in successive periods are entered into a step-by-step competition by the employer during dynamic games, considering an exchange in their limited resources. The optimum solution of the game in each stage are selected as the strategy, and the resources during the game are considered to be renewable and limited. The strategy of each contractor can be described as follows: 1) share their resources with the other contractor and 2) not share the resources with the other contractor. This model can act dynamically in all circumstances during project implementation. If a player chooses a non-optimum strategy, then this strategy can immediately update itself at the succeeding time period. The proposed model is solved using the exact Benders decomposition method, which is coded in GAMS software. The results suggest the implementation of four step-by-step games between the contractors. Then, the results of our model are compared with those of the conventional models. The projects' duration in our model is reduced by 22.2%. The nominal revenue of both contractors has also reached a significant value of 46078 units compared with the relative value of zero units in the original model. Moreover, we observed in both projects the decreases of 19.5%, 20.9%, and 19.7% in the total stagnation of resources of types 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Price Adjustment Clauses and Submitted Bid Prices for Major Asphalt Line Items in Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Price adjustment clause; Asphalt; Bid price; Regression analysis; Quantitative methods	REGRESSION	Unprecedented uncertainty in the price of asphalt cement over the last decade has been a source of major concern for state departments of transportation (state DOTs) and highway contractors. This uncertainty may lead to price speculation and inflated bid prices by highway contractors, in order to secure their financial positions against possible rising prices. One of the most common risk-sharing strategies widely used by transportation agencies is price adjustment clauses (PACs) that shift potential upside and downside risk of material prices from contractors to owners. PACs are aimed at eliminating extra risk premiums and therefore reducing contractors' submitted bid prices. However, the actual effect of offering PACs on submitted bid prices for major asphalt line items has not been empirically studied. The research objective of this paper is to examine the effect of PACs offered by state DOTs on the variations of contractors' submitted bid prices for major asphalt line items. Data on 841 transportation projects were collected and several potential explanatory variables, such as duration of the project, asphalt cement price index, number of bidders, and eligibility for the PAC program were identified. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create appropriate statistical models that can explain the variations of contractors' submitted bid prices for five major asphalt line items. The results indicate that eligibility for the PAC program was not a statistically significant variable in most of the models. Thus, no evidence was found to support the statement that offering PACs would reduce the submitted bid prices. It is expected that this work will help capital planners of transportation agencies enhance their understandings about important variables affecting submitted bid prices for highway projects.

Relative Importance of Subcontractor Selection Criteria: Evidence from Singapore	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; PERFORMANCE	Subcontractors carry out a large portion of the work done in construction projects. Thus, selecting the right subcontractor essentially contributes to the project's success. We designed a choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the relative importance of four criteria in the subcontractor selection process of main contractors from Singapore: price, technical know-how, quality, and cooperation. Although main contractors adopt a multicriteria selection process and perceive all four criteria to be important for their choice decision, the actual choice situation reveals that price is still by far the most important selection criterion, followed by quality, cooperation, and technical know-how. Main contractors are not willing to compromise on price but accept a lower performance of a known subcontractor on the remaining criteria.

J	Aibinu, AA; Ofori, G; Ling, FYY				Aibinu, Ajibade Ayodeji; Ofori, George; Ling, Florence Yean Yng			Explaining cooperative behavior in building and civil engineering projects' claims process: Interactive effects of outcome favorability and procedural fairness	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SELF-REPORTS; JUSTICE; DISPUTE; CONFLICT; MODELS	Cooperation is fundamental to successful procurement and delivery of building and civil engineering projects. This study explores the role of perceived fairness as a motivator of cooperative behavior in the process for administering project claims. The objective is to investigate how a contractor's perceptions about fairness of the procedure for administering project claims would interact with the outcome received from the claims to influence the contractor's cooperative behavior in terms of conflict intensity and potential to dispute. The data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 41 contractors' personnel regarding their experience with claims on 41 completed projects in Singapore. The data were analyzed using the structural modeling approach. The results indicate that on projects where contractors did not receive a favorable outcome from claims, there was lower intensity of conflict and lower potential to dispute when contractors perceived that the procedure for administering the claims was fair than when the procedure was perceived to be unfair. The findings suggest that, in construction, cooperative behavior is a combined function of the outcome and procedure leading to that outcome. It also suggests that enhancing cooperative behavior goes beyond formal contract provisions but rather how the contract is administered in practice. It is recommended that employers' project management team whose actions of rejecting invalid claims may be misinterpreted and disputed pay greater attention to how decisions on claims are reached. A fair procedure could cushion the effect of an unfavorable decision and thereby reduce a contractor's uncooperative attitude.

Using a set of questionnaires, data were accrued from 385 pairs of project managers and employees of contractors. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling to identify the effects of Confucian principles on project performance and the mediating role of transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The analysis revealed that all Confucian principles had positive effects on transactional and transformational leadership styles, and both had positive effects on project performance. Also, project leadership played a complete mediating role. Transactional leadership had a stronger effect on objective performance than on subjective performance, whereas transformational leadership had a stronger impact on subjective performance than on objective performance. Subjective performance had a positive influence on objective performance. This study provides a framework to help project managers better understand the effects of Chinese culture and Confucianism on project management and implementation.

J	Turner, JR; Lecoeuvre, L; Sankaran, S; Er, M				Turner, John Rodney; Lecoeuvre, Laurence; Sankaran, Shankar; Er, Michael			Marketing for the project: project marketing by the contractor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project marketing; Contractors; Project-based industries; Project contract life-cycle; Relationship; Communication; Collaboration; Trust	SERVICE; STRATEGY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the marketing practices adopted by contractors in project-based industries to win new business and maintain relationships with existing clients. Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed eight such contractors, and used activity theory as a lens to analyze the results. The authors investigated project marketing activities at four stages of the project contract life cycle, and against four enablers of collaboration. Findings The authors have identified that the service-dominant logic pervades project marketing. Through the project contract life cycle the marketing activity starts with a strategic focus, becomes tactical, then operational and returns to strategic. Project marketing involves executive managers, marketing, client or account managers and project managers. Project managers have a key responsibility for project marketing. The four enablers of collaboration, relationships, communication, going-with and trust, support each other and the entire project marketing activity. Research limitations/implications As a contribution to theory, the authors have identified the practices adopted by contractors in project-based industries to market their competencies to clients to win new work and maintain relationships with existing clients. The authors have identified practices throughout the contract life cycle, and practices to develop collaboration. The next step will be to explain these practices in terms of traditional marketing theory. Practical implications The results provide guidelines to contractors in project-based industries who wish to improve their marketing activity to achieve sustainable performance. Industry may also find it useful to train or coach their project managers to be conscious of their marketing role. Originality/value Previous work has been conceptual in nature and has speculated on the nature of the project marketing performed by contractors to win new projects, and set it against marketing done by the project. This research has empirically investigated the actual marketing practices adopted by project contracting organizations, shown how it varies through the project life cycle and shown how responsibility passes from senior management to the account team and then to project managers. It has also investigated the application of the four enablers of collaboration: relationships, communication, going-with and trust.

However, the operations used in performing the BV method often differ due to the various government procurement requirements. Consequently, some of the methods popular in the academic community are not easily incorporated in the BV method in some countries. To enhance the procurement process, this study aims to gain experience by applying the well-known analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight the decision criteria for selecting BV contractors of two construction projects in Taiwan. Through these two case studies, this work confirms that the AHP provides a significant benefit for considering the individual preferences of all decision-makers when weighting the criteria. However, this study finds two major potential obstacles, the legal requirements associated with using the AHP and the time it takes to implement the AHP. To overcome these obstacles, this work suggests guidelines to meet the legal requirements for implementing the AHP in the BV contractor selection, and proposes several strategies to shorten the AHP implementation time. The lessons learned here are relevant to those countries in which BV method must be performed in a transparent and strictly regulated environment.

The models for measuring the VIS under (s, S) and Periodic Review (PR) inventory policies are established. A method to compare the VIS is given in a two-level construction supply chain, which aims to measure the impacts of supply quantity information of materials on general contractor's service level and total inventory cost under different inventory policies. A numerical example is proposed to explore the gap of VIS between (s, S) and PR inventory policies in a rebar supply chain. The results show that general contractor's service level in (s, S) inventory is higher than PR's and total inventory cost in (s, S) inventory is lower than PR's in the case of no information sharing. In the case of information sharing, general contractor's service level in PR inventory policy is higher than (s, S) policy; however, it is implemented by the increase of total inventory cost. This research provides valuable information to help general contractor to make correct decision on inventory management in supply chain at firm-level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.

To investigate the current and ideal cultures, data were gathered among the key stakeholders by means of a survey study with 72 respondents divided over 12 companies. The respondents rated the current and desired cultures by using the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument, which belongs to the Competing Values Framework. The investigations show many similarities and differences between the stakeholder perspectives of the current and the idealized partnering project cultures. Mainly, the General Contractors desire more cooperative behaviors than the (Sub-)Contractors, and the Investors desire more pronounced flexibility than the General Contractors. All stakeholders desire a cultural change from highly competitive behaviors toward more cooperation. Changes in terms of clear procedures or more flexibility are only desired by the Designers. Defining both the current and an ideal partnering project culture enables academics and project managers to compare their actual project cultures to an ideal situation. With such an approach, academics and project managers could measure whether new tools or changes in resources affect their project cultures toward a partnering project culture.

As one of the most important factors influencing subcontractor behavioral intentions, perceived justice from previous collaborative experience affects the willingness of a subcontractor to cooperate with a general contractor in the future. In this paper, a model is built based on social exchange theory to examine the relationship between justice perception, relationship value, and subcontractor willingness to cooperate (WTC). Analysis of data from 122 subcontractors demonstrates that distributive justice and interactional justice positively affect WTC, and relationship value from the general contractor partially mediates such effects. However, procedural justice does not significantly affect WTC. The study provides a new perspective for examining the internal mechanisms between subcontractor justice perception and WTC. The findings will also help general contractors understand how their behaviors affect subcontractor WTC, thus providing practical implications for subcontracting management.

These contractors are exposed to various types of risks especially external risks. Although it is well known that organizational culture has impact on decisions, yet, the effect of organizational culture on international bidding decisions in construction to date is under-research. This paper explores the relationship between organizational culture and international bidding decisions in response to the political and economic risks of Malaysian international contractors. A culture-decision conceptual model was proposed and tested using questionnaire survey and further interpreted through interviews. Goals and strategy orientations contribute greater influence on political risk decisions. While, goal and guanxi orientations cast the greater influence on economic risk decisions followed by involvement, values and capability orientations. This study found that organizational culture casts the influence on international bidding decisions, yet, it is not the dominant cause especially in risk decisions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, BIM implementation guidelines and pilot projects are introduced. Then, some popular BIM software together with typical implementation cases are provided. BIM implementation in Japan is not always encouraged via a top-down consensus in architectural firms and general contractors, as the client and architects can reduce the project risk inherent in design and drawings by transferring these tasks to a general contractor. The paper finally discusses the problems in project management to present a strategy to develop a new version of BIM that will provide value to all of the stakeholders of a project.

J	Choi, K; Kwak, YH				Choi, Kunhee; Kwak, Young Hoon			Decision support model for incentives/disincentives time-cost tradeoff	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Infrastructure project management; Alternative contracting; Incentive/disincentive; Schedule simulation; Time-cost tradeoff; Decision-support model	HIGHWAY; REHABILITATION	Offering contractors a monetary incentive for early project completion provides agencies with an innovative means to expedite construction. To be effective, the incentive amount should exceed the contractor's additional cost (CAC) for completing the project early. Yet, estimating CAC poses a major challenge to agencies largely because of contractors' reluctance to disclose information about their profits. This study introduces a predictive, quantitative model that estimates realistic CACs by combining an existing schedule simulation technique with a regression method. An innovative, reliable tool called Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies (CA4PRS) was used for the simulation. Using CA4PRS, a set of contractors' time-cost tradeoff data was created and a linear regression analysis based on a second degree polynomial equation was performed to predict CAC growth rate by analyzing how the CAC interacts with the agency's specified schedule goal. The robustness of the proposed model was then validated through two case studies. This model can assist decision-makers in estimating better optimal incentive amounts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Can multiple contractors self-regulate their joint service delivery? A serious gaming experiment on road maintenance planning	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Performance-based contracting; network management; self-regulation; gaming and simulation; contractors	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; NETWORK MANAGEMENT; MECHANISM DESIGN; SIMULATION GAME; FRAMEWORK; PROJECTS; IMPACT	The next step in the use of innovative, dynamic and performance-based contracts for service delivery by contractors could be use of monetary incentives to stimulate self-regulation of the network. Because it is currently unclear how performance-based payments in network tenders can effectively encourage network members to coordinate their own operations, a serious game was performed that simulates road maintenance planning to study changes in decision making and the emergence of network coordination. The experiments show that monetary incentives influence decision making, but their effect may be opposite to their intended aim and can lead to a competitive network. It was, however, also found that this competitiveness is not shown in networks where members are familiar with each other. This leads to the conclusion that penalty-based incentive mechanisms probably interfere with self-regulation and that the social dimension of contractor collaboration is paramount to the success of network-based contracting of construction activities.

This study attempts to reconstruct project practitioner's perspectives regarding the essence of collaborative relationships. Applying Q-methodology, subjective opinions and reflections of 30 project practitioners from 19 owner and engineering-construction firms were systematically analyzed. The result suggests four distinct perspectives towards effective working relationships, namely a) shared team responsibility, b) execution focused team, c) joint capability and structure; and d) senior leadership pair. Across perspectives, all practitioners shared a belief that an effective owner contractor relationship should be based on affective trust, shared vision, and mutual attitudes such as open and honest communication, solution seeking instead of blaming, and senior management leadership. In contrast to prior research, long-term orientation and contractual functions were perceived to play a relatively limited role in improving owner contractor relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving lessons learned practice in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Contractors; Knowledge; Lessons learned; Roadmap	POST-PROJECT REVIEWS; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	Purpose. The aim of the research is to improve lessons learned practices within construction contractor organisations. This will result in contractors' project teams having access to the most relevant lessons at the most appropriate time, in the most appropriate format. Scope. The research was based on the responses of 41 large UK contractor organisations to a questionnaire survey, detailed interviews with nine companies and three focus groups. The respondents were senior and middle managers variously involved in business improvement, knowledge management, and technical services. Results. The questionnaire survey identified methods, tools and processes used to collect lessons learned. The interviews and the focus groups uncovered the diverging requirements of corporate vs. site-based staff. The data contributed to the development of a project learning model and a conceptual model from which a Project Learning Roadmap was derived to support business leaders to improve their project lessons learned processes. This will enable organisations to develop individual solutions tailored to stakeholders' needs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

When there are delays, contractors tend to submit delay claims seeking time and cost adjustments to their contracts. Quite often, these claims are denied upfront due to deficiencies in the delay notification process itself. The vagueness of and ambiguities in contractual provisions too protract the notification process. This study was aimed to improve the level of success of delay claims submitted by the contractors working in the Sri Lankan construction projects that are administered in accordance with FIDIC 1999. The data required for the study were collected from a total of 248 projects, using a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study reveals that the effectiveness of the delay notification process can be improved by identifying the delay events well in advance. To overcome the flaws of the delay notification process, it is also equally important for the contractors to be aware of contractual provisions.	[Perera, B. A. K. S.; Wijewickrama, M. K. C.

Contractor's decision for bid profit reduction within opportunistic bidding behavior of claims recovery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Opportunistic bidding behavior; Profit reduction; Claims recovery; Bid price competition	CONSTRUCTION CLAIMS; SYSTEM; MODEL	Contractors may decide to reduce the bid profit on basis of opportunistic bidding behavior (OBB) under potential claims recovery for performing changes in work or likely employer's mismanagement. An analytical evaluation in a decision tree framework is used to represent the expected events and the state of information for OBB decision and their possible outcomes. Quantitative evaluations are introduced to set the likely chance of a claim occurrence, to manage the claim success and to expect a negotiation offer ratio for the profit in claim negotiation. The product output of these parameters sets the conditional contractor's decision for the price reduction that may be assigned in the original bid. The presented methodology provides an applicable decision technique for use by contractors to benefit from the potential uneven events caused by employer's acts during project phases to reduce the bid profit on price based competition case which is a significant item in a typical competitive bidding.

J	Thomas, HR; Ellis, RD				Thomas, H. Randolph; Ellis, Ralph D., Jr.			Contractor prebid planning principles	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Planning is an essential function of project management. Yet, many small- and medium-sized contractors do a relatively poor job of operational planning. Better prebid plans will reduce costs, shorten schedules, and improve labor productivity. Unfortunately, the published literature offers little guidance for smaller contractors on what constitutes effective planning. Most papers describe planning as a macrolevel process for owners. Most emphasize scope definition for industrial projects. This paper describes a microlevel planning process for contractors. It consists of eight steps which are: (1) assess contract risks; (2) develop a preliminary execution plan; (3) develop site layout plans; (4) identify the sequences that are essential-to-success; (5) develop detailed operational plans; (6) develop proactive strategies to assure construction input into design; (7) revise the preliminary plan; and (8) communicate and enforce the plan. The entire process is illustrated with a case study project and is fully illustrated with figures which show how to integrate the work of multiple contractors, keep key resources (crews or equipment) fully engaged with no downtime, provide time buffers so the work of follow on crews can be efficiently done, expedite the schedule using multiple work stations and concurrent work, ways to communicate the work plan to the superintendent and foremen, and how to assess the feasibility of various work methods. The steps are easy to understand and implement. They will yield immediate positive results.

The Taiwan government frequently applies the best-value (BV) tendering method, a multi-criteria evaluation method, to procure projects. However, the selection process of the winner for a BV-based procurement project is generally subjective and thus is easily accused of corruptions. To develop a systematic method to support contractor selection, this study proposes using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to facilitate the criteria evaluations for each bidder during the short-listing stage. The evaluation results of using the DEA are a list of potential BV winners who are then suggested to enter into the final selection stage. Based on three case studies related to service procurement projects, this research finds that the DEA is suitable of assessing the relative efficiencies among bidders when the BV approach is applied. Lessons learned here should be helpful in applying the DEA to aid bid evaluations in other supplier selection problems.

However, construction companies often find it challenging to reorganize their company's organizational structure to take full advantage of these benefits of BIM adoption and implementation. This study explores contractors' transformation strategies that will enable them to successfully adopt and implement BIM for major construction projects. In-depth case studies from large contractors capture the benefits of BIM implementation, the appropriate organizational structure, the training and education program, the cost related to BIM implementation, including software and hardware investment, the relationship with other stakeholders, and the future recommendations to implement BIM for their construction projects.

PROJECT DELAY: KEY ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION FACTORS IN HONG KONG	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						building; construction; consultant; contractor; delay; electrical	PERFORMANCE	The price of construction project delays is too substantial to pay. Electrical construction is a critical activity influencing project completion, but research on its delay factors was limited. Aimed at contributing knowledge to this niche area, a study was conducted in Hong Kong. 56 delay factors, in 10 groups, were found with electrical construction. Processing the data of a survey on 64 consultants and 68 contractors revealed "insufficient labour", "late decision making of client" and "insufficient electrical contractor" as the top delay factors. Strong agreements on the importance rankings of the delay factors existed between the consultant and contractor groups, and the principal factor components were "incompetent project team members", "lack of skillful labour" and "poor on-site planning". Besides discussing the common problems underlying the delay factors, recommendations were made for avoiding the problems. An understanding of the delay factors would help construction stake-holders in taking proactive measures to prevent project delay. The approach of the study can serve as reference for similar, future research in construction management.	[Chiu, Betty W.

A questionnaire survey was conducted with engineers from contractor and consultant firms in assessing the frequency and severity of delays so that an importance index for delay factors could be computed. In general, there was no significant difference between contractors and consultants in assessing the delay factors. The top-10 list was dominated by factors related to the contractor and the project. However, two external factors, rain and flood, were the first two factors on the list, which also had a high impact on the three project objectives. The remaining factors on the list were land acquisition, award of project to lowest bidder, equipment breakdowns, poor site arrangement, management and supervision, unexpected ground condition and terrain, low quality of the contractor human resources, late progress payments, and low productivity of labor. Recommendations to manage the delay factors were presented. Significant relationships between the delay factors and the three project objectives also were observed and discussed.

This practice is termed contractor acceptance testing (CAT) in this paper. Although CAT has helped transportation agencies to deal with a shrinking workforce and intensive construction schedules, it has been controversial. This paper provides insights into the technical and conceptual pitfalls of CAT. The technical pitfalls are revealed through Monte Carlo-based computer simulations of pavement specifications that use CAT. These simulations show that the verification process, which relies on the statistical F-test and t-test, is unreliable and can lead to erroneous pay decisions. The conceptual pitfalls are revealed by demonstrating that CAT encourages a quality-control approach that focuses on defect detection and containment, rather than defect prevention. Finally, potential alternatives and improvements to CAT are provided. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000113. (c) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Yet, AHP was criticized that DMs often cannot provide strictly consistent comparisons in a pairwise weighting matrix (PWM). The present study proposes an automatic repair procedure for the inconsistent PWM. The procedure seeks a substitute PWM, which can pass the consistency test, and yet being as close as possible to the primitive PWM. The repair is performed by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, whose control parameters are tuned using the Taguchi method. The proposed procedure, by automatically adjusting the PWM with the approval of DMs, can greatly facilitate the process of contractor selection and thus expedite the entire procurement function. Two practical cases are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed procedure, in comparison with previous work. Published by Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competition rule; competitive tendering; perception; project type; China	DECISION-MAKING; BID EVALUATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; CLIENT; MODEL; LEAD; TIME	Recent years have witnessed the diversifying means of competitive bidding, where the client plays a critical role in the determination of competition rule. It is widely recognized that the competition rule should be placed on a win-win basis to ensure that both the client and contractors are well considered with respect to their interests. Nevertheless, a vast majority of biddings fail to take account of what contractors really want. Using the methods of literature review and content analysis, 34 tender evaluation factors are proposed to compose the competition rule in China. Contractors' opinions on these factors are collected by virtue of questionnaire survey. Based on the Pareto law, it is found that the competition rule encompasses eleven key factors, and the composition varies slightly between public and private sectors. The Hotelling's T test is conducted on those key factors in common. The implication is that contractors can use indifferent factors (e.g., credit rating, construction plan, completeness of bid components, timely payment to workers) to improve competitiveness, while the client may utilize different factors to diversify the competition rule. This paper probably presents an earliest effort put to examine the acceptability of competition rule in the construction context.

J	Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Hardcastle, C				Wong, Peter S. P.; Cheung, Sai On; Hardcastle, Cliff			Embodying learning effect in performance prediction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS; CURVE; MODEL; SELECTION; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEM	Predicting performance of contractors is of interest to both academics and practitioners. The physical execution of a project is critical to the overall success of the development. Having a competent contractor that can deliver is most desirable. In this aspect, a significant number of performance prediction models have been developed. Multiple regression and neural networks are typically used as the analytical tools in these prediction models. This paper reports a study that employs a learning curve approach to perform the prediction task. It is suggested that this approach can accommodate the changes in performance as experience accumulates. Thus a performance pattern is projected in addition to the project final outcome. A two-step approach suggested by Everett and Farghal was adopted for this study. First, the learning curve model that best represents a contractors' performance was explored using the least-square curve fitting analysis. Second, prediction analysis was performed by comparing the actual performance data with their respective prediction results obtained from extrapolation on the selected learning curve. The three-parameter hyperbolic model was found to provide the most reliable prediction on performance in this study.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						project management; information management; engineers; owners; contractors; employment		The age and experience profile of project engineering professionals employed by both owners and contractors has recently become a concern due to downsizing, retirements, and lack of hiring during the 1990s. Data were gathered from U.S. Census panels and from 27 owner firms and 23 contractor firms within the Construction Industry Institute to investigate the extent of this issue. In particular, the study examined changes in industry staffing levels, projected industry staffing levels, the current age and experience profile of project engineering staffs. current and projected hiring practices, and retention levels. The results of the data analyses indicate that, while substantial downsizing occurred among project engineering professionals during the early 1990s, the era of downsizing appears to be at an end. However. the high proportion of engineering professionals nearing retirement suggests that the transfer of knowledge from more to less experienced employees is an area of critical importance for both owners and contractors. Data showing demographic breakdowns using these analyses will be given, conclusions drawn, and policy implications outlined.

Based on a qualitative systems thinking approach, a model of the National System of Innovation (NSI) is structured with five main NSI actors: local contractors; suppliers; national research institutions; government; and foreign contractors. This model, established by the assumption that local contractors' key motivation for innovation is based on profit maximization, highlights two main driving forces of construction innovation within the NSI: profit incentives and the social desirability of higher construction productivity and quality. The research findings indicate that high profit levels provide a higher number of growth momentums compared to the social desirability of innovation. Additionally, although social desirability of construction innovation is associated with a number of obstacles, high profit levels do not impose any significant hindrances. Based on the research findings, it is concluded that innovation policies should be focused on sustaining higher profit levels of contractors. The social desirability of innovation can be more efficiently utilized by regular reviews of national policies as the industry develops.

This article proposes a new bidding model that incorporates sustainable construction practices. The proposedA + Smodel takes into consideration the bid price (A) and the monetary value for the use of sustainable construction practices (S). The (S) parameter is taken as a negative value to act as an incentive rather than a deterrent. Twenty sustainable construction practices were identified. A survey was conducted to measure the importance of each practice. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate the weight of each practice. The top five sustainable practices were eliminate toxics, air & dust control, project management, health & safety and quality management. The average monetary value of the selected sustainable construction practices, relative to construction cost, was 20%. The proposed model encourages contractors to implement sustainable construction practices to improve their chances in winning bids.

Because of the challenges inherent in the nature of these approaches, contractors need to be capable and experienced to successfully deliver projects. It is then necessary to prequalify contractors to reduce the inherent risk of a project. Therefore, the objective of the research project described in this paper is to provide a methodology that will help public owners prequalify and select contractors within the context of the three delivery methods mentioned above. As a result, a hybrid prequalification and selection model to screen contractors who want to submit bids on public projects using any of the three innovative contracting methods above was developed. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to make prequalification decisions when multiple criteria are used. In addition, three case studies were developed to evaluate the application of AHP to the prequalification criteria in the three innovative contracting methods. AHP was utilized as an effective prequalification decision-making tool that eliminates subjectivity and produces decisions built on consistent judgments.

J	Majid, MZA; McCaffer, R				Majid, MZA; McCaffer, R			Factors of non-excusable delays that influence contractors' performance	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	Delays are among the most common phenomena in the construction industry. During the last three decades delays have occurred in most types of projects, from simple building projects to the most complex projects such as nuclear power plants or tunneling works. Generally, delays may be caused by: the client (compensable delays); the contractors (non-excusable delays); or acts of God or a third party (excusable delays). This paper classifies the main causes of non-excusable delays according to the source of occurrence, then identifies the factors contributing to those causes. It is assumed that the client has more control over the compensable delays and can take action to prevent them. The contractor is expected to have control over the non-excusable delays and, presumably, do more to prevent them. Several studies have discussed the issues relating to these delays, but no major study has been conducted to examine the causes of non-excusable delays in great depth. Understanding the underlying factors that contribute to causes of non-excusable delays would help in identifying and overcoming the problems faced by contractors during the construction process. To assist in identifying the factors contributing to causes of non-excusable delays, the Ishikawa or fish bone diagram has been used as an analytical tool, and a ranking methodology has been devised. As a report of initial findings of the study, which is currently being undertaken at Loughborough University, U.K., this paper identifies materials-, equipment-, and labor-related delays as major causes of contractors' performance delays.

Bank overdrafts have always been the major source to finance construction projects. However, it is not uncommon that bankers set a limit on the credit allocated to an established overdraft. Bankers' interest rates and consequently contractors' financing costs are basically determined based on the allocated credit limits. Furthermore, project indirect costs are directly proportional to the project duration which is affected by the allocated credit limit. Thus, the credit limit affects project financing costs and indirect costs which in turn affect project profit. However, finance-based scheduling produces financially executable schedules at specified credit limits while maintaining the demand of time minimization. Thus, finance-based scheduling provides a tool to control the credit requirements. This control enables contractors to negotiate lower interest rates which reduce financing costs. Thus, finance-based scheduling enables contractors to reduce project indirect costs and financing costs. This paper utilizes genetic algorithm's technique to devise finance-based schedules that maximize project profit through minimizing financing costs and indirect costs.

This study aims to identify, categorize and prioritize the critical success factors for health care construction projects in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the success factors for health care construction projects. The analytical hierarchical process was then applied to prioritize the main criteria and sub-criteria of health care construction project success factors. This study consists of 10 main criteria and 36 sub-criteria relevant to health care construction projects. The respondents of this study consist of two main groups: customers and contractors. The customers were selected from one of the leading governmental hospitals in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the contractors are from a major contracting company operating within the health care industry. From each respondent group, leadership positions were selected from relevant departments, including finance, operations, marketing, engineering and supply chain management. The findings of the study show that the leading critical success factor groups are financial capability and management. Moreover, top management support, adequate funding, availability of resources and effective strategic planning were found to be top factors affecting project success. Differences in priorities were observed between customer and contractor perspectives based on the different roles of each stakeholder. To highlight, customers ranked management and financial capability as the two most important factors, respectively. However, contractor respondents indicated financial capability as most important, followed by management and strategy factors, which scored as equally important. As results shown in this study are obtained from only customers and contractors, future studies could include consultants and regulatory authorities, along with considering more success factors.

Previous studies have identified that the information concerning contractors' attributes consists of both quantitative and qualitative types, while the assessment methods used for appraising qualitative information require a predictive judgment of the experts. Aiming to improve the reliability and fairness of the prequalification decisions, a prototype decision support system based on the case-based reasoning (CBR) approach was developed by the writers. To determine whether CBR approach is appropriate for modeling the contractor prequalification domain, the decision system developed should be verified and validated. The objectives of this paper are to establish a strategy for verifying and validating a CBR system and to report the findings of verification and validation of the prototype system.

J	Shen, L; Cheung, SO				Shen, Lu; Cheung, Sai On			How forming joint ventures may affect market concentration in construction industry?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction joint ventures; market concentration; level of competition	PROCUREMENT; CONTRACTORS; COMPETITION; COLLUSION; BARRIERS; IMPACTS; ENTRY; RATES	The construction activities in Hong Kong are at unprecedented high level since the launching of an ambitious infrastructural development programme that involves the construction of ten mega projects (TMP hereafter). Since the commencement of the programme in 2008, the tenders returned for these projects have exceeded the respective project budgets significantly and far beyond the inflation factor. Major concerns have, therefore, been raised over if there is an issue of insufficient competition. Concentrated market is considered less competitive and can be futile ground for bid manipulation. This study employs the contract values of the TMP to calculate concentration measures including four-firm concentration ratios and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Furthermore, contractors are categorized into active and occasional group. The effects of forming joint ventures (JVs hereafter) on these two groups are examined. The findings are as follows. For active contractors, due to the network among them, forming JVs lowers market concentration. For occasional contractors, forming JVs increases market concentration.

J	Abdelrahman, M; Zayed, T; Elyamany, A				Abdelrahman, Magdy; Zayed, Tarek; Elyamany, Ahmed			Best-value model based on project specific characteristics	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Best-value becomes a well known procurement practice in many states in the country. The objective of this transformation from the old practice of lowest bid to best-value is to increase the value added to the project for each dollar added. This paper discusses a new concept of best-value modeling that is unique and tailored to each project. The model uses records of past projects to obtain specific evaluation criteria, from which a best-value score is determined for each contractor. Primary parameters that impact contractor selection are identified and analyzed based on which best-value model is designed. Data are collected from groups of experts in the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Two application methods are used to assess the best-value: (1) the weighted average method; and (2) the analytic hierarchy process. Although the paper is written to assist government agencies in selecting the best contractor(s), the research results shared in this paper are relevant to both academics and practitioners. The paper provides practitioners with a tool for ranking contractors based on best-value and provides academics with selection parameters, a model to evaluate this best-value, and a methodology of quantifying the qualitative effect of subjective factors.

J	Lu, SK; Hao, G				Lu, Shaokai; Hao, Gang			The influence of owner power in fostering contractor cooperation: Evidence from China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Power; Cognition-based trust; Affect-based trust; Cooperative performance	COGNITION-BASED TRUST; RELATIONSHIP COMMITMENT; DETERMINANTS; NETWORKS; IMPACT; MODEL; US	Trust and power are considered to be two necessary mechanisms for promoting cooperation among construction partners. In this paper, trust is regarded as a mediator between power and cooperative performance. A model of the relationship between trust and power is developed and tested using the results of an empirical study based on a sample of Chinese contractors. The results show that an owner's expert power can influence a contractor's cognition- and affect-based trust in the owner and that coercive power has little direct impact on the formation of trust. However, coercive power is found to moderate the relationship between expert power and cognition-based trust, in that the relationship is more positive when the level of coercive power is lower. Moreover, affect-based trust has a significantly greater positive influence on cooperative performance than cognition-based trust. These findings are interpreted in light of Chinese culture, and provide some suggestions for how owners can exercise power to foster cooperation with their contractors.

Causes of Delay in Building Construction Projects in Egypt	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Delay in construction projects is considered one of the most common problems causing a multitude of negative effects on the project and its participating parties. This paper aims to identify the main causes of delay in construction projects in Egypt from the point of view of contractors, consultants, and owners. A literature review was conducted to compile a list of delay causes that was purged based on appropriateness to Egypt in seven semistructured interviews. The resulting list of delay causes was subjected to a questionnaire survey for quantitative confirmation and identification of the most important causes of delay. The overall results indicated that the most important causes are: financing by contractor during construction, delays in contractor's payment by owner, design changes by owner or his agent during construction, partial payments during construction, and nonutilization of professional construction/contractual management. The contractor and owner were found to have opposing views, mostly blaming one another for delays, while the consultant was seen as having a more intermediate view. Results' analyses suggest that in order to significantly reduce delay a joint effort based on teamwork is required. Furthermore, causes of project delay were discussed based on the type and size of the project.	[El-Razek, M. E. Abd; Bassioni, H.

Early warning systems need to be developed to prevent or avert contractor default; additionally, this evaluation result could facilitate the selection of firms as collaboration or investment partners. Financial statements are considered one of the key basic evaluation tools for demonstrating firm strength. This investigation provides a framework for assessing the probability of construction contractor default based on financial ratios by using the Logit model. A total of 21 ratios, gathered into five financial groups, are utilized to perform univariate logit analysis and multivariate logit analysis for assessing contractor default probability. The empirical results indicate that using multivariate analysis by adding market factor to the liquidity, leverage, activity and profitability factors can increase the accuracy of default prediction more than using only four financial factors. While considering the market factor in the multivariate Logit model, clear incremental prediction performance appears in 1-year evaluation. This study thus suggests that the market factor comprises important information to increase the prediction performance of the model when applied to construction contractors, particularly in short-term evaluation.

Understanding existing business model types is a crucial part of business model innovation since business model types represent the status of current business models and hint toward business model innovation. However, the classification of business model types has rarely been addressed in the construction industry, and existing studies have conceptually classified them using subjective decisions that have limitations on their use in business model innovation. We quantified the business models of 72 international construction contractors from 2009 to 2014 using measurable variables for business model components, including international diversification, regional diversification, industry diversification, product diversification, human resources, physical resources, financial resources, project types, and geographical regions. Then the quantified business models were classified into business model types using two-step cluster analysis, and the performance differences between them were examined in terms of profitability, growth, and market competitiveness. We also examined how the classified business model types can be used in the business model innovation process. The results suggest the existence of three business model types used by international construction contractors and indicate significant performance differences among them. Our findings provide useful references for senior-level managers of international construction contractors to understand their current business model positions and find effective ways to innovate their business models.

Construction Bidding and the Winner's Curse: Game Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting	MODEL; AUCTIONS	In the construction industry, competitive bidding has long been used as a method for contractor selection. Because the true cost of construction is not known until the completion of the project, adverse selection is a major concern. Adverse selection is when the winner of the contract has underestimated the project's true cost. Thus, the winning contractor will most likely earn negative or at least below normal profits. The winner's curse is when the winning bidder submits an underestimated bid and is thus cursed by being selected to undertake the project. In the multistage bidding environment, where subcontractors are hired by a general contractor, the winner's curse may be compounded. In general, contractors suffer from the winner's curse for a variety of reasons including inaccurate estimates of project cost; new contractors entering the construction market; minimizing losses in case of recession of the construction industry; strong competition within the construction market; differential opportunity costs, which can affect the behavior of contractors; and the intention to win the project and then remedy the losses through change orders, claims, and other mechanisms. Using a game theory approach, this paper aims to analyzeand potentially reduceindustry exposure to the effects of the winner's curse in construction bidding. To this end, the authors identify the degree of the winner's curse in two common construction bidding environments; namely, single-stage bidding and multistage bidding. The objective is to compare the aforementioned two construction bidding environments and determine how learning from past bidding decisions and experiences can mitigate the winner's curse. To this end, and through defining the relationship between the construction bidding and auction theory, the authors utilized a three-step research methodology that involved (1)presenting the symmetric risk neutral Nash equilibrium (SRNNE) as an optimal bid function; (2)developing simulation models for single and multistage construction bidding processes; and (3)analyzing the results of the simulation models, which is based on an actual dataset of projects provided by the California Department of Transportation. This research demonstrated that the majority of general contractors and subcontractors suffer from the winner's curse in both single-stage and multistage bidding environments. Moreover, from a winner's curse perspective, the multistage bidding environment incurs more losses than the single-stage bidding environment. However, through learning from past experiences, the multistage bidding environment provides contractors with a better opportunity to avoid the winner's curse if compared with the single-stage bidding environment. This research should be beneficial for the profession to better understand the bidding decision-making processes. For future work, cooperative game theory can be applied with the integrated project delivery principles to help all associated parties mutually achieve their project objectives.

However, trust is also vulnerable and fragile. After trust is built, trust is not necessarily maintained throughout a project. Thus, after trust is violated, it is important to repair trust to sustain the role of trust. This study aimed at finding trust-repair strategies and their effectiveness between contractors and subcontractors in China through 19 in-depth interviews. This study found that subcontractors' trust-repair strategies included show of positive attitude, immediate action, self-justification, denial and excuses, correction and penance, and apology. Contractors' trust-repair strategies included promise, paying a part of the progress payment, and paying off the progress payment in arrears. Immediate action, correction and penance, and paying off the progress payment in arrears were effective trust-repair strategies. This study develops the theory of trust repair in the construction industry and provides information to support decision making by contractors and subcontractors to better repair and maintain trust.

The main goal of the parties involved in a project's construction is to have a successful project constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications, within the time and cost originally anticipated. The success of a project depends on a number of variables, not the least of which is how the organizations approach problems and conflicts. However, the adversarial atmosphere that infects the industry can prevent the parties from reaching their goal. This paper proposes an intervention process, a combination of partnership and mediation, to prevent and resolve dispute prior to contract close-out.

This paper presents the results of a survey instrument applied to determine the relative level of relevance of construction labor productivity drivers and opportunities. Owners, general contractors, electrical contractors, mechanical contractors, consultants, and others participated in this survey. Management skills and manpower issues were identified as the two areas with the greatest potential to affect productivity according to survey respondents. Surprisingly, external factors, which are often cited as a major cause for reduced productivity in the construction industry, were considered to be one of the least relevant productivity drivers. These results suggest that respondents consider the improvement of labor productivity within their reach and control rather than determined by external conditions.

This research aims to examine the effect of asset specificity on contractors' opportunistic behavior (strong form and weak form), including exploring and comparing the governance effectiveness of contract and trust. The empirical results from a survey of 228 Chinese owners reveal that asset specificity has positive effects on contractors' strong and weak form opportunistic behavior, and the effect on weak form opportunistic behavior is stronger. The results further show that the impact of asset specificity on opportunistic behavior (strong form and weak form) reduces as contractual complexity increases. The effect of asset specificity on weak form opportunistic behavior decreases as trust strengthens. Accordingly, the findings manifest that effectiveness of contract was more prominent when moderating the relationship between asset specificity and strong form opportunistic behavior. These findings provide a nuanced and advanced understanding of whether complex contracts or high levels of trust are the more effective choices for governing opportunistic behavior and offer managerial suggestions for the parties involved in construction projects.

Optimizing Contractor Selection for Construction Packages in Capital Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING	In capital construction projects, the contractor selection process is executed in the front-end planning phase based on the experience and judgment of the project leadership team, whose members are considered experts. A comprehensive construction value packaging system (CVPS) is presented for assisting these project leaders in improving the efficacy, efficiency, and transparency of this process. The CVPS comprises an interface-oriented approach to work decomposition and a multicriteria approach to contractor selection. Selection is supported by software for iteratively computing and interactively visualizing the Pareto front of optimal work packages. The CVPS is validated by functional demonstration and a case study of a piping installation project in an energy infrastructure facility. The initial Pareto front had more than 100,000 optimal work packages representing different trade-offs between cost, time, contractor experience, maintenance rates, and financial stability. An iterative and interactive process of query formulation and exact (not heuristic) evaluation helped the expert to focus in on solutions of interest and created a transparent and quantitative record of the decision-making process. Thus, this research contributes a new paradigm and computational tool for project decision support. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This study's purpose was to investigate the satisfaction levels of clients within contractors' services in reconstruction programs. Client satisfaction can determine the ability of a contractor to meet the client values. Opportunities can be found for improving reconstruction programs by providing awareness of how construction service providers perform in postdisaster situations. However, little time and attention have been invested in understanding the client values and satisfaction within contracting services in the rebuild environment after a disaster. The study included a literature review to identify the significance of understanding client values and satisfaction within contracting services for postdisaster reconstruction projects. Using a questionnaire survey with public and private clients, the research determined the levels of importance and performance of the client values. Satisfaction analysis, priority ranking, and importance-performance analysis were applied to identify and prioritize the critical values. The findings reveal the critical values as areas of concern for preplanning and rethinking to improve the services provided in the disaster rebuild environment.

J	Lingard, H; Oswald, D				Lingard, Helen; Oswald, David			Safety at the Front Line: Social Negotiation of Work and Safety at the Principal Contractor-Subcontractor Interface	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Principal contractor; Subcontractor; Safety; Rules; Supervisor	CONSTRUCTION; CULTURE; INTEGRATION; PROJECTS; VALIDITY; SCIENCE; CLIMATE; HEALTH; ISSUES; ADAPT	This research investigated the influence of the social context on work practices and safety at the principal contractor-subcontractor interface. Previous research has acknowledged that social interactions among supervisors and workers shape safety implementation on work sites. However, a detailed examination of the nature and impact of these social interactions has been missing. An ethnographic method was deployed in which a researcher spent approximately 100 h attending four construction sites over a 6-month period. This deep embedded research method enabled the nature and impact of social interactions to be explored. Organized safety walks and informal walk-arounds were attended, during which interactions were observed and conversations were held with project participants, including foremen, professional health and safety advisors, supervisors, and workers. Field notes and comments were subjected to thematic content analysis. Different understandings of safety were apparent, with key differences emerging in relation to the role attributed to the principal contractors' site safety rules. The social ecosystem at the four sites was also embedded within broader construction industry practices, in particular competitive tendering and price-based selection. The results reveal limitations inherent in traditional technical approaches to understanding safety in the construction site environment because these approaches tend to ignore the social and power relations at play. The results reveal that safety at the principal contractor-subcontractor interface is better understood as an emergent property of a complex ecosystem of social relationships and interactions.

Key barriers to increase construction productivity: the Singapore case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction productivity; barriers; contractors; migrant workers	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY	This study investigated the barriers to achieving high construction productivity in Singapore with the view to providing further input into policy formulation and action to enhance the industry's productivity performance. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which was sent to all the 3032 members of the Singapore Contractors Association and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Statistical t-tests and factor analysis were conducted on the 109 valid responses using the SPSS software. The findings were validated via in-depth interviews with subject matter experts. The top three barriers are "delays in providing information to contractors", "poor skills of workers" and "inadequate pre-project planning and pre-work planning". The sources of these barriers are consultants and contractors, suggesting that these stakeholders should cooperate to improve productivity. The research findings for Singapore construction industry is unique in that most of the labourers on site are migrant workers from overseas. Nonetheless, the findings may be useful to countries that employ labourers mainly from overseas such as those in the Middle East and certain parts of Europe. This study adds to knowledge by identifying the most significant barriers to productivity improvement and providing suggestions to address them. To improve productivity, all participants should change their mind-set, attitudes and behaviours. Clients should support productivity initiatives and be more proactive concerning productivity through tender evaluation criteria, setting productivity targets and paying for productivity premium. Contractors should develop corporate productivity policies, monitor productivity closely and purposefully adopt measures to increase productivity of their projects.

J	Song, HY; Zhu, FW; Klakegg, OJ; Wang, P				Song, Haoyang; Zhu, Fangwei; Klakegg, Ole Jonny; Wang, Peng			Relationship between contractual flexibility and contractor's cooperative behavior The mediating effect of justice perception	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Contractual flexibility; Cooperative behaviour; Justice perception	REDUCING OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOR; SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS; ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; INTERFIRM COOPERATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; RISK ALLOCATION; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; CLAIMS PROCESS; FAIRNESS; GOVERNANCE	Purpose - Due to the increasing risk and uncertainty of construction projects, contractual flexibility has been considered as an effective tool to cope with emergences and to promote cooperation between owners and contractors. However, in practice, owners often failed to build an efficient cooperative relationship via contracts, resulting in a lacking of appropriate justice. Furthermore, due to a lack of available empirical research, the influence of contractual flexibility on the cooperative behavior of contractors requires further investigation. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by conducting empirical research from the perspective of justice perception. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was developed and a series of hypotheses were proposed. Then, partial least squares structural equation modeling analyses were conducted on a sample of 188 respondents. Findings - The results show that contractual content and executing flexibility both have a positive influence on the cooperative behavior of a contractor, which was partially mediated by distribution, procedural, and interactional justice perceptions. Moreover, content flexibility has a significant impact on all three types of justice perception, and the execution of flexibility has more impact on interactional justice compared to other justice perceptions. Originality/value - The findings contribute to an improved understanding of how contractual flexibility affects the cooperative behavior of contractors, indicating that the owner could develop a fair exchange relationship through flexible contracting and motivation of the other party.

Not bidding deprives the contractor of the possibility of completing a given building project, yet the contractor has to consider whether, for example, he or she has the capability of carrying out a particular project. This paper presents a brief description of some chosen models aiding the bid/no bid decision that have been proposed in previous studies. Moreover, the authors designed their own model based on the fuzzy set theory. The basis of the decision model became the previous selection of factors influencing the decision. To achieve this, the authors conducted a study among contractors in 2010-2011 in Southern Poland. One hundred and fifty surveys were sent, providing 41% of answers. Based on the analysis of the surveys, according to the contractors, the top three most vital factors influencing the bid/no bid decision are (1) the type of work, (2) experience in similar projects, and (3) contractual terms. Both the evaluation of the factors and their influence on the decision to be made in a given enterprise are largely subjective and hard to unambiguously assess; therefore, the proposed model incorporates the fuzzy set theory, which is exceptionally convenient for finding solutions to the problems resulting from human subjectivity. The results are presented and commented on in this paper. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Shifting Sands and Shifting Grounds: Analysis and Implications of Shifting Dynamics in the Global Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction trends; Globalization; Market analysis	PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; PROFIT; FIRMS	The global construction industry is in a state of change. The largest construction companies are tracked annually by Engineering News Record (ENR) in the Top 225 Global Contractors list. In the late 1990s this chart was topped by Japanese firms; in the 2000s a French firm held the number-one spot for nine consecutive years. For the last three years, however, Chinese firms have held the top three largest global contractor positions on the list. This is surprising because, just 5 years earlier, none of these Chinese firms were even among the top 10 largest global contractors. To examine these shifting dynamics, the authors compiled the ENR Top 225 Global Contractor data from 1994 to 2011 into a database and analyzed the data. The data were fitted to generate a forecast of predicted changes in market leadership and industry sector shifts to understand the evolving dynamics further. The paper concludes with a discussion of the effects of these critical industry trends to help decision makers understand and react to changes in the current and near-future state of the global construction market.

Motivational Factors and Challenges of Cooperative Partnerships between Contractors in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Partnering; Contractors; Motivation; Challenges; Construction industry; Exploratory factor analysis; Regression	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; TRUST; VARIABLES; PROJECTS; DESIGN	This work focuses on motivational factors and challenges of cooperative partnering between contractors in the construction industry. The purpose is to identify the main obstacles to forming such relationships and methods for facilitating these relationships. The research methodology is exploratory in nature, which uses a questionnaire to collect the needed data from construction industry professionals worldwide. The data, collected from 134 participants, were used in various statistical analyses including relative importance index (RII), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), linear regression analysis, and correlation and comparison of means analysis. The results emphasized that having better risk management and sharing designs and technical solutions are the main motivational factors affecting the partnering decision. It was also found that the most significant challenges are in sharing technical expertise with partners and management of partners' relations. The conclusion is that multiple measures should be established by public agencies and project owners to facilitate cooperation between general contractors that will bring benefits to both parties. A precise framework is proposed for future researchers to identify and clarify mutual goals, tactical objectives, procedures, and various aspects of partners' relations.

Following upon recent research into the multiple principal-agent problem, which was applied to the minimization of communication risk in construction projects, the focus here is on communication issues between the four project parties. Recent research has shown that the relationship between the project owner and the contractor is paramount for risk minimization before the contract between them is signed. However, the relationship between project managers is dominant for risk minimization after the contract is signed. To further explore risk minimization at this stage of the project, the Delphi method was employed. A panel of highly-experienced project managers working for both project owners and contractors was asked several rounds of questions in an attempt to arrive to a consensus concerning the most important relationships between project parties in terms of risk minimization after the contract is signed. The relationship between the two project managers tops the ranking, thus focusing further research. As they are both agents, and as there is no contract between them, this offers a fresh challenge for the principal-agent theory.

J	Li, GH; Chen, C; Zhang, GM; Martek, I				Li, Guanghua; Chen, Chuan; Zhang, Guomin; Martek, Igor			Bid/no-bid decision factors for Chinese international contractors in international construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International construction; Project management; Strategic management; Questionnaire survey	ENTERPRISE RISK-MANAGEMENT; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; POLITICAL RISKS; SYSTEM; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; PROFIT	Purpose Factors affecting bid/no-bid decisions of international projects are more complex than those of domestic projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank decision factors considered by variously sized Chinese international contractors (CICs) and categorize those groups of factors important to experienced practitioners. Design/methodology/approach The analysis of factors identified by a literature review is conducted based on data derived from questionnaire results received from 119 CIC project and bidding managers. The relative importance of factors is measured by mean value and standard deviation. The discrepancy in rank and importance value perceived by variously sized CICs are explored by ranking disparity analysis, non-parametric test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. Finally, factor analysis is used to categorize the underlying groups of factors considered by CICs. Findings In sum, 41 factors are identified through the literature review as having an impact on the bid decision. Significant disparities in ranking and importance are found in several factors, which partially affect the consistency of the ranking of factors perceived between large and small-medium CICs. Ultimately, nine major factors are identified as impacting the bidding decision, with "contractor's capability" and "country risk of the host country," being the most important. Research limitations/implications The weight of a factor considered in a decision varies across contractors as a function of contractor size. Whether using models or subjective judgment in making decisions, it is beneficial to fully understand the main groups of factors influencing the decision. Vulnerability to country risk emerges as the first criterion accessed in the bid decision. Originality/value A comprehensive set of factors is established for CICs, including both general factors common to domestic projects, and international factors unique to international projects. All factors are grouped by inferential analysis from the perspective of contractors, which reveals the underlying mechanism of the bid decision-making process. While the data were collected from CICs, the methodology in exploring factors, along with implications, is determined to be applicable internationally.

However, little is known about the factors influencing trust in this setting. This study aims to begin to fill that gap by studying trust in their counterparts, as expressed by principals and contractors engaged in construction projects. The findings show that the temporal embeddedness of the relationship (past and expected future relationships) is strongly positively related to the level of trust. Moreover, this study finds that the tendering procedure used and the delivery system employed influence the level of trust of the contractor but not that of the principal. Practical implications and suggestions for further research are drawn from these results. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000495. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Existing pricing models, including cost-based probabilistic models and market-based neoclassical microeconomic theory, were developed for LB. Very few operational models exist for BV tenders due to the difficulty of measuring the price differences with respect to the variance of product or service quality. This paper proposes a price elasticity of quality (PEQ) model that provides useful tools to measure the PEQ of a product or service offered by contractors in a tendering process. Based on the proposed model, a bidding zone is suggested for the contractor in light of competitiveness and profitability. Two working examples are used to show the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Akinradewo, O; Aghimien, D; Aigbavboa, C; Onyia, M				Akinradewo, Opeoluwa; Aghimien, Douglas; Aigbavboa, Clinton; Onyia, Michael			Factors influencing the adoption of insurance as a risk treatment tool by contractors in the construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction industry; construction risk; insurance; risk treatment; risk mitigation		The major challenge surrounding construction projects are hinged on time, cost and quality, which are all susceptible to uncertainty and have financial implications. As a response to the excessive uncertainty, standard contracts for construction projects demand that contractors indemnify all works associated with a project and the people involved in it through having insurance cover. Even though the consensus that insurance as a primary means of managing risk has expanded significantly, few contractors have adopted it in developing countries. This study set out to evaluate the factors influencing insurance use as a risk response tool for contractors alongside its efficiency in the construction industry. Quantitative research method was adopted to achieve the aim of the study in which a close-ended questionnaire was developed. Respondents were chosen using a purposive sampling technique and they include Architects, Construction Managers, Project Managers, Quantity Surveyors, Engineers and Insurance professionals within Gauteng province. Retrieved data was analysed using descriptive statistics, One-Sample T-test, and exploratory factor analysis. Findings revealed that factors influencing insurance use as risk response tool by contractors can be categorised into project characteristics, financial stability influence, organisational objective influence, insurer's influence, and insured participants and legal requirement influence. It was also established that insurance is efficient in managing external risks. Based on these findings, it was concluded that project characteristics play a major role in the decision to employ insurance as a tool for managing risk. It was recommended that construction team players and stakeholders should encourage the use of the different insurance covers for construction projects.

J	Robson, A; Boyd, D; Thurairajah, N				Robson, Abigail; Boyd, David; Thurairajah, Niraj			Studying "cost as information' to account for construction improvements	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Building information modelling; contractor; cost information		Contractors throughout the construction supply chain develop and use cost information. By treating cost as information', insights are generated into how cost information is created and flows from work carried out to a client cost. A case study of a main contractor's supply chain involved semi-structured interviews, workshops and document reviews. We considered whether contractors' current costing practices used for the purpose of pricing and cost control could support decision-making about improvements through the supply chain. The results show that firms recognize that current costing practices do not provide a good representation of work carried out. Cost information that is useful in a narrative that seeks to improve site operations is either not created or hidden in layers of assumptions and lost as it does not cross the boundaries between organizations. This implies that the implementation of current practices of costing in building information modelling will not increase the effectiveness of modelling construction costs for the purpose of improvements. However, cost information that is useful in decision-making about improvements could be created. This could be achieved but requires a systemic change, where new representations of cost are tied to work processes used within more stable procurement relationships.

This paper studies early contractor involvement in design and its impact on construction schedule performance through a combined empirical case study and theoretical simulation analysis. Pipe and steel fabricators' inputs at different design stages of industrial construction projects are identified. The case study shows that these inputs lead to improved drawing quality, material supply, information flow, and consequently improved construction schedule performance. This impact on construction schedule is illustrated using actual project data and simulation techniques. Simulation models were developed to demonstrate intuitively the impact at the construction operation level and they allow people to gain management insights through simulation experiments. Better understanding of the early contractor involvement process and its benefit can improve buy-in and help industry practitioners to reach the full potential of this concept.

J	Elbarkouky, MMG; Fayek, AR				Elbarkouky, Mohamed M. G.; Fayek, Aminah Robinson			Fuzzy Preference Relations Consensus Approach to Reduce Conflicts on Shared Responsibilities in the Owner Managing Contractor Delivery System	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Owners; Fuzzy sets; Expert systems	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; OPINIONS; MODEL	This paper proposes a fuzzy preference relations consensus (FPRC) approach that helps owners and contractors reach consensus on their responsibilities and reduce conflicts in shared tasks. A fuzzy similarity consensus (FSC) model was developed to aggregate experts' opinions on roles and responsibilities in the owner managing contractor (OMC) project delivery system. The FSC model categorized 324 generic OMC tasks into three responsibility task lists: owner, contractor, and shared. In a consensus-reaching process, the FPRC approach is applied to shared tasks, where expert opinions on responsibility conflict are expressed, to achieve an aggregated responsibility decision for each task. Experts compare the three responsibility alternatives in pairs by using linguistic preferences, defined on a fuzzy preference scale, to select a preferred responsibility alternative for each of the conflicting tasks. A computed linguistic consensus degree guides the experts on their level of consensus in every round of the process. The quality of experts is defined with a fuzzy expert system-determined importance weight factor for each expert. The FPRC approach is relevant to the construction industry, as it incorporates consistency in decision making by allowing experts to measure and reach an adequate level of consensus linguistically when deciding on responsibilities. The proposed approach provides a method of reducing conflicts in the assignment of task responsibility between the owner and its contractors as early as the project initiation phase; thus, the project teams can concentrate on the work to be done rather than deal with responsibility conflicts during project execution.

A Cost of Quality Economic Analysis of a Six Sigma Program at a Government Contractor	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Six Sigma; Cost of Quality; Benefit/Cost Ratio; PAF Model	SIX-SIGMA; AGENDA	In this study, the results of a multi-project engineering economic analysis of a Six Sigma program for a contractor providing custom manufacturing and service activities for a U.S. federal government agency are presented. Examined are the project costs, project savings, benefit/cost ratio, and operational performance improvement for Six Sigma projects conducted over a seven year period. Projects in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing (administrative and service-related) applications were examined. The analysis demonstrated that Six Sigma projects are very cost effective, achieving a median benefit/cost ratio of 2.66 for the Six Sigma program for the contractor. The results also demonstrated that process improvements for Six Sigma projects in nonmanufacturing operations achieve gains comparable to improvements in manufacturing operations, and demonstrate that significant gains can he achieved through Six Sigma programs.

J	Dzeng, RJ; Wang, WC				Dzeng, RJ; Wang, WC			Automatic schedule integration for highway projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						infrastructure management; construction scheduling; schedule integration; standardization; modularization	SYSTEM; MODEL	The construction of a highway/expressway, which involves a complex combination of roads, bridges, and tunnels, is generally separated into several projects. Various contractors thus execute different projects and often apply differing scheduling practices. Since all projects involved in highway construction must be completed for the highway to be useful, the management of the various projects should preferably be integrated. To assist project controllers in schedule integration, this study proposes algorithms based on standardized codes and network modules. A computer system was also designed to help contractors use these modules for scheduling, and ultimately to let project controllers combine these schedules electronically. A questionnaire survey and industry feedback revealed the potential benefits of using the proposed algorithms for generating and integrating schedules, respectively. Contractors' computation capabilities must be improved before the proposed scheduling algorithms can be fully implemented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This case study presents an analysis of the AMC program in Florida using a survey, an interview, and content analysis. Although similar studies have been conducted in the past, the survey presented here is unique in that the opinions of contractors and lower-level state employees were solicited. The results indicated that contractors were more confident in the success of the AMC program than were the state employees in Florida and that the cost and performance data needed to be maintained for quantitative analysis. The results highlighted the need for partnering between state agencies and contractors, emphasized the need for a shared-risk model, and stressed the importance of a well-defined scope and of quantifiable performance measures. The unique work associated with this paper included the use of contractors and lower-level employees in the survey and the use of content analysis to examine the interview responses. This was the first study of its kind conducted in Florida.

The Building and Construction Authority of Singapore has revamped the contractors registration system with the hope of bringing about merger and acquisition of companies for improving the local contractors' standing in the global construction scene. To diversify into new markets in a new environment, which is very different from local environment, requires diversification vis-a-vis exporting strategy. This study examines the attitudes and views of contractors, operating in Singapore (excluding foreign contractors), on how the strategic move should be focused for diversification vis-a-vis exporting services. The aim of this study is to establish the survival skills necessary for Singapore's construction small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to venture abroad. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted and the results show that local construction SMEs who have diversified have reaped the benefits derived from diversification into new markets abroad. The main conclusions are that construction SMEs have to export their services in order to survive and they can enhance their export capabilities by forming a consortium with the help of local government.

Historical narratives as strategic resources: analysis of the Turkish international contracting sector	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Competitive strategy; narrative turn; international contracting; Turkish contractors; narrative analysis	CONSTRUCTION; COMPETITIVENESS; ORGANIZATIONS; DIRECTIONS; KNOWLEDGE	The Turkish contracting sector has an enviable reputation for operating in high-risk international markets. The sector's ability to respond to market instability could meaningfully be construed as sectoral-level capability. We aim to demonstrate how history can be mobilised in a formalised "strategy text" to create a strategic narrative on the sectoral level. The Geography of Contractors as published by the Turkish Contractors Association (TCA) ostensively portrays the strategic development of Turkish international contractors over four decades. Such quasi-historical narratives are routinely mobilised for the purposes of creating a shared memory on the sectoral level. The chosen strategy text draws from multiple narrative fragments derived from past experience to generate a strategic agenda for the future. The representation given to multiple voices reflects the pluralistic nature of strategy making praxis. The overarching strategy narrative reflects a performative intent in legitimising some practices whilst discrediting others. Narrative analysis demonstrates the way in which actors, actions and events are positioned within a plot structure, with direct implications for the enactment of future strategic practices. The findings suggest that strategic actions can only ever be identified in retrospect and that such arguments are always made with an eye on the future.

J	Chen, Q; de Soto, BG; Adey, B				Chen, Qian; de Soto, Borja Garcia; Adey, Bryan			Transshipment approach to coordinate materials for a contractor's project portfolio	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						3D models; material allocation; project portfolio management; supply chain optimization; transshipment and lateral sharing	SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; BIM; INDUSTRY; IMPROVE; MODELS	The challenges to coordinate material supply and dynamically changing demand always lead to construction interruptions or a considerable waste of materials on-site. Mainstream research has provided various advanced digital solutions to solve these problems; however, they have not addressed how to make reliable decisions with digital models to manage the demand fluctuations of construction materials. This study proposes a transshipment approach to enable the lateral sharing of perishable materials and optimize material allocation for a contractor's project portfolio. The transshipment approach includes two main steps. First, the daily material supply and demand data are collected from a continuously updated schedule and three-dimensional models as input for calculating unused material quantities. Second, an evolutionary optimization algorithm is used for optimizing the transshipment quantities with minimal cost. As proof of concept, the proposed transshipment approach is demonstrated by looking at a portfolio of seven building projects managed by the same contractor. The demonstration shows that the allocation of the unused materials helps to avoid waste and reduce costs from over-ordered materials by around 52%. As a result, this also leads to improved coordination between contractors and suppliers and better material flow in construction projects.

The complexity and the high bidding cost are open sesames for inexperienced contractors to refrain from the opportunity. On the one hand, this study builds a game-theoretic bidding model that represents the key peculiarities of the PPP competitive tender. Besides a markup decision, the contractors also take an investment decision reflecting the bid preparation efforts. On the other hand, the impact of governmental competition-enhancing policies on the theoretical bidding outcome is investigated. The bidder's competitive position and the project's risk are important determinants. While substantial investments could be expected in two-player settings, price competition is moderate. In three-player scenarios, immature players withdraw from participating in high-risk tenders. Nevertheless, the computer experiments reveal that this oligopolistic situation might be overcome by compensating the losing bidders for their research efforts. The triangulation with views from practitioners supports that this incentive creation mechanism is necessary to stir up the contractor's enthusiasm in the market.

Construction professionals from diverse locales were asked to rate a list of 53 potential factors for the objectives of schedule, budget, and quality, and additionally compare the objectives for overall project success. The set of 53 factors was enriched by eliminating 13 factors that could not prove their statistical significance for even one of schedule, budget, or quality performances for any of the three organizations. Commissioning the 40 significant factors, an analytical hierarchy process was used to determine organization-based factor rankings for overall project success. Spearman's test on rankings of the 40 significant factors for overall project performance results in a highest level of correlation between the managers and contractor personnel (r(s) = 0.54), followed by that between the managers and the designers (r(s) = 0.50), and a least correlation between the contractor personnel and the designers (r(s) = 0.19). Hence for successful project implementation, professional construction managers have an edge over the designers in supervising the contractors. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Huang, XY; Hinze, J				Huang, XY; Hinze, J			Owner's role in construction safety	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTABILITY; COSTS	Despite dramatic improvements in recent decades, the construction industry continues to be one of the industries with the poorest safety records. Recent improvements are due, in part, to the concerted efforts of owners, contractors, subcontractors, and designers. While past safety studies have investigated the roles of contractors, subcontractors, and designers, the owner's impact on construction safety has not been previously investigated. This paper will present the results of a study on the owner's role in construction safety. Data were obtained by conducting interviews on large construction projects. The relationship between project safety performance and the owner's influence was examined, with particular focus on project characteristics, the selection of safe contractors, contractual safety requirements, and the owner's participation in safety management during project execution. By identifying practices of owners that are associated with good project safety performances, guidance is provided on how owners directly impact safety performance.

The results highlight the current subcontracting practices of main contracting firms that have resulted in a long-lasting market share abroad. Toward this aim, a detailed questionnaire was administered to 96 construction companies. Turkish and host countries' subcontractors were shown to be frequently employed in international projects. However, subcontracting firms from other countries were found to not be used. Main contracting companies generally select subcontractors in the periods after the main tender or after the project's start. Although many of them often work with previously known subcontracting companies and do not take into account the lowest bid price as the primary criterion, systematic processes or models are not used to select the best subcontractor. Most importantly, main contractors not only use subcontractors but also carry out activities using their in-house resources. Hence, this study will not only be a step for further works that can be performed by potential researchers who may find interesting similarities or differences between their countries and Turkey, but also assist contractors who plan to strengthen their positions and to increase work opportunities in the international market.

J	Jung, W; Han, SH; Lee, KW				Jung, Wooyong; Han, Seung H.; Lee, Kang-Wook			Country Portfolio Solutions for Global Market Uncertainties	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Market uncertainty; Country risk; Country portfolio; Markowitz portfolio theory; Multiobjective genetic analysis; Diversification	RISK; DIVERSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; ENTERPRISES; CONTRACTORS; STRATEGY	Global market uncertainties such as unpredicted recession and recovery arise simultaneously at the country level or wider. These uncertainties weaken traditional project-based risk management to control contractors' revenue and return. To overcome this limitation, this study suggests a country portfolio model for managing these market uncertainties. This model presents the quantitative diversification strategy that optimizes country portfolio solutions through considering four critical objectives at the country level: (1) market growth rate, (2) market growth volatility, (3) market profit rate, and (4) market profit uncertainty. This study applies Markowitz portfolio theory to this country portfolio solution and uses multiobjective genetic analysis (MOGA) through examining 1,014 international projects executed by Korean contractors across 21 countries. This study suggests three useful applications: (1) analysis of the ideal country portfolio, (2) evaluation of the firm's current portfolio associated with global market conditions like boom and recession, and (3) suggestion of a more informed portfolio decision for entering new country markets. This model enables multinational contractors to better manage country portfolios during a fluctuating global construction market. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000099.

Soil penetration modeling in microtunneling projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								As the need for utility service line replacement or repairs with minimum disruption to the surface have increased, so has the demand for trenchless excavation methods, in particular, microtunneling. Microtunneling is a trenchless technique that is used to install new pipelines. Microtunneling can be applied in gravity and pressure lines, permanent ducts for cables, and crossings under rails or roads. When bidding a microtunneling project, the main concern of microtunneling contractors is predicting the underground behavior of the machine. In other words, the productivity of microtunneling is the key to profit in microtunneling projects. Contractors generally predict approximate productivity based on experience, which risks cost estimation accuracy for microtunneling projects. Contractors lack a productivity model that helps them to predict driving time. This paper is a part of a series of papers covering the productivity of microtunneling projects. This paper focuses on predicting the penetration time of the microtunneling machine.

Application of Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Construction Strategies at the Federal Level	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CRITERIA; PROPOSAL	Indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts use an overarching master contract between an owner and contractor for multiple projects over a specified time period. The practice is widespread in the federal government but its efficacy has been the subject of relatively few studies. Content analysis of 90 federal requests for proposal advertised between 2010 and 2014 reveals IDIQ contracting use for a wide range of facility types and construction services. Owners most often use best-value procurement methods, emphasize qualifications over price to initially select the IDIQ pool of contractors, and use seed projects for initial price evaluations. Findings also suggest that IDIQ contracts reflect the inherent paradoxical organizational tensions in public sector procurements. On one hand, IDIQ contracts reflect a desire for flexibility, simplified procurement processes, and finding the most qualified contractors for long-term performance. On the other hand, public owners must put control mechanisms in place to obtain a fair price, protect the public interest, and comply with regulations. The findings of this study have practical implications for public owners with large asset portfolios and for contractors interested in pursuing IDIQ contracts. The findings also provide requisite knowledge for researchers to study IDIQ performance at an aggregate level.	[Stanford, M.

J	Abdel-Galil, E; Ibrahim, AH; Alborkan, A				Abdel-Galil, Emad; Ibrahim, Ahmed H.; Alborkan, Ahmed			Assessment of transaction costs for construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Transaction costs; pre-transaction costs; post-transaction costs; construction management; construction project	ECONOMICS; ORGANIZATION	The main premise of transaction cost economics is that project cost is not only production costs but there are also additional costs resulting from transactions between parties. Transaction costs include the costs of preparing the bidding package, estimating and drawing up a contract, administering the contract, dealing with any deviations from contract conditions and any contractual problems include claims, change orders, and disputes. The main objectives of this paper are to establish the factors that affecting transaction costs in construction projects in Egypt, assessing its value in Egyptian construction projects, and to provide a mathematical model that can predict transaction costs value accurately. The study was conducted on various types of construction projects in Egypt, which formed the sample size. To collect data, a questionnaire was used that was personally administered to the respondents, using emails and conducting semi-structured interviews. The collected data were analyzed by using SPSS program, and a software package named IBM. The findings indicated that: the most important factors affecting positively (decreasing transaction cost value) on transaction cost value in construction projects in Egypt are: the financial position of the contractor, claims filed by the contractor, material substitutions by the contractor, contractor experience in similar type projects, contractor`s relationship with previous clients, contractor qualification to do the job, and procurement method. Transaction cost in the pre-contract phase of construction projects in Egypt is approximately (3-4) % of the contract value on average, and the average value for post-contract transaction cost is approximately (8-9) % of the contract value. All factors accredited as influential factors were taken into account and developed in an account model, the study devolved accounting models that can predict transaction cost value as a percentage of the project capital for construction projects in Egypt, two techniques were used, first is regression analysis with two methods (enter-stepwise), and second is the neural network, all models showed a high accuracy up to 95% in predicting transaction cost value for construction projects in Egypt.

J	Rojas, EM				Rojas, Eddy M.			Single versus multiple prime contracting	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Policies regarding public building construction affect the interests of taxpayers, construction authorities, general contractors, specialty contractors, and other stakeholders. At the state level, the debate as to the optimal form such policies should take has become an ongoing struggle among competing interests. This study presents a systematic analysis of the main issues regarding single versus multiple prime contracting with the purpose of providing objective data to illuminate the debate. A statistical analysis of project bids and final costs from a national sample of state construction projects reveals that public construction projects organized with multiple prime contracts tend to have 5% less direct costs than projects using a single prime contractor. Moreover, approximately 80% of these savings are attributable to lower bid costs for multiple prime projects. The results of this study are in agreement with theoretical bidding models and efficient risk allocation models. Theoretical bidding models suggest that, in the absence of disruptions, multiple prime projects should have lower direct costs than single prime jobs. Efficient cost allocation models suggest that when specialty contractors do not bear the risks associated with the single prime contracting method (e.g., bid shopping and payment delays) they are willing to lower their bids, and forego the premium they would normally charge in response to such risks, as seems to be the case in multiple prime jobs.

This research regards trust as a two-dimensional construct, distinguishing the control and coordination functions of contractual governance, and explores their effects on negotiation behavioral strategy; this research also examines the moderating effects of bilateral lock-in. The empirical results from a survey of 272 Chinese general contractors and subcontractors reveal that there is a positive relationship between trust, including both goodwill trust and competence trust, and interest-based negotiation behavioral strategy. However, increasing contractual control will increase the adoption of a rights-based negotiation behavioral strategy, while contractual coordination governance will reinforce the adoption of an interest-based behavioral strategy. Both Chinese general contractors and subcontractors tend to rely more on trust under higher degrees of bilateral lock-in. The research findings offer an advanced and nuanced understanding of how trust and contract affect negotiation behavioral strategy in construction subcontracting. The authors also discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings and future research for governance mechanisms in construction.

J	Chen, JH; Chen, WH				Chen, Jieh-Haur; Chen, Wei-Hsiang			CONTRACTOR COSTS OF FACTORING ACCOUNT RECEIVABLES FOR A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						factoring; accounts receivable; cost; financing; construction project	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; FINANCE	Literature reveals that approximately 66% of construction project funds are raised from financial institutions. The burden of capital costs on contractors is heavy and financial alternatives for the reduction of capital costs are always desired. The objective of this study is to derive a mathematical way of defining the contractor's costs for factoring account receivables, which is a form of commercial finance whereby a business sells its account receivables at a discount. Factoring can be thus considered as a contractor selling his/her accounts receivable to a factor, a financial institution that provides the services of financing, credit management, and collection. Nevertheless, factoring has far not been used for construction project financing. The relevant literature, empirical practices, and factoring theories from outside the construction industry are all evaluated and the features needed to derive the cost function are explored and integrated. This includes commission costs, expected debt costs, and credit monitoring costs. The case study is utilized and discussed to illustrate the use of factoring for a construction project and its related costs. Under the given assumptions that represent the most common financial conditions in Taiwan, the simulation results show that the contractor's factoring costs without recourse for the construction project make up only 0.8% of the total costs of the examined project which is relatively lower than that of most traditional financing. In addition, the application of factoring has the advantage of facilitating financial management, instantly improving cash flow, enhancement of investment efficiency, avoiding extra loan procedures, improving credit rating, and transfer of financial risk. Factoring is indeed a feasible financial tool for construction projects.

J	Gholizadeh, P; Esmaeili, B				Gholizadeh, Pouya; Esmaeili, Behzad			Cost of Occupational Incidents for Electrical Contractors: Comparison Using Robust-Factorial Analysis of Variance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TREATMENT GROUP EQUALITY; WORK-RELATED ACCIDENTS; UNINSURED COSTS; TEST STATISTICS; TRIMMED MEANS; INJURIES; CONSTRUCTION; ANOVA; TESTS; WORKPLACE	Construction accidents can negatively affect the performance of a project. Evaluating the financial consequences of these accidents is an effective method for measuring their impacts on owners, contractors, and society. While several studies have estimated the cost of injuries among different trades, demographics, event types, injury sources, and nature of injuries, most of these studies presented descriptive statistics without analyzing any inferential statistics regarding the differences between average costs. To address this limitation, this study utilized robust measures of location (trimmed mean) and scale (Winsorized variance) in a three-way factorial ANOVA design to examine the effect of variables on the cost of injuries among electrical contractors. To create a reliable accident database of electrical contractor injuries, the team aggregated 388 nonfatal accidents collected from the 2016 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) database. To determine the effectiveness of inferential statistical methods as applied to injury-cost analysis, null hypotheses were tested using three robust methods: (1) the Welch-type procedure; (2) an extension of Yuen's method; and (3) percentile bootstrapping. The results of the study confirm that robust hypothesis testing approaches can be successfully implemented on safety data even when the assumptions of conventional test statistics are violated. In terms of the electrical case study, the outcomes indicate that various event types and project end-uses can change the cost of injuries among electrical contractors. Specifically, the findings revealed that caught in/between and exposure to electricity accidents can, on average, lead to higher injury costs than fall to lower levels and struck-by objects/equipment accidents. In terms of project's end-use, construction accidents, on average, resulted in costlier injuries in nonbuilding projects than in buildings. The methodological results of this study can help contractors better quantify the risks of a construction project/task by estimating the severity of potential accidents in monetary values. Furthermore, this study contributes to the current body of safety knowledge by assessing alternative methods of hypothesis testing that do not require specific assumptions.

The enquiry meant that both clients and contractors were forced to acknowledge illegal practices of collusion and fraud. For those engaged in public-private relationships, a process followed of attempting to change collaborative practices. Three interventions in collaborative practices are recounted: (1) organizing personal networks between clients and contractors; (2) a competitive dialogue procedure; and (3) the right of withdrawal. These three interventions helped to change first order' practice, such as increasing mutual trust between client and contractor, supporting a mutual understanding of role positioning and dilemmas, and creating an understanding of the nature of the conflict but failed to change second order' practices. Two contributions to the understanding of project management are provided. New empirical data are presented on the challenges that public and private partners face in their attempt to implement new collaborative practices. It is shown how power is entangled in the emerging of new collaborative practices. The findings are based on a longitudinal ethnographic study of public-private collaboration in the Dutch construction industry in the period 2006-11.

Based on two sets of survey data collected from designers and general contractors in BIM-based construction projects in China, the results from partial least squares analysis and bootstrapping mediation test provide clear evidence that BIM-enabled capabilities of information sharing and collaborative decision-making as a whole play a significant role in determining BIM-enabled efficiency and effectiveness benefits for both designers and general contractors. The results further reveal that designers and general contractors benefit from project BIM implementation activities significantly non-equivalently, and that this non-equivalence closely relates to the different roles played by designers and general contractors in BIM-enabled interorganizational resource exchange processes. The findings validate the resource dependence theory perspective of BIM as a boundary spanning tool to manage interorganizational resource dependence in construction projects, and contribute to deepened understandings of how and why project participating organizations benefit differently from the implementation of interorganizational information technologies like BIM.

In comparison to most other industries, the construction industry is severely plagued by risk, and the success of construction projects usually depends on valuating all risks. However, conventional methods suggested by extant research on cash flow forecasting do not consider comprehensive identification of risk factors, interactions between the factors, and simultaneous occurrences of the factors. This study introduced a simple and appropriate probabilistic cash flow forecasting model using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to avoid bankruptcy of contractors by considering influence diagrams and risk factors that affect a project. Workability and reliability of the proposed approach was tested on an important building construction project in Iran as a real case study, and the results indicated that the model performed well.

Design/methodology/approach Factors were explored by a literature review and an open-ended questionnaire survey. In total, 9 hypotheses involving 12 factors were developed accordingly. Then a structured questionnaire survey was conducted, and 248 valid questionnaires were received from Chinese contractors. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings Factors that have the largest impacts on the contractual approach and the relational approach regarding obliging and compromising are favourability of evidence, time pressure and reputation, respectively. Unexpected results show that obliging behaviours are negatively correlated with procedural fairness but positively correlated with occurrence time of the dispute. Originality/value This study furnishes a nuanced picture of multiple factors' impacts on contractors' behavioural strategies of claim-related dispute resolution, and thus supplements the relevant construction dispute management literature. From the perspective of contractual governance, it is one of those exploring drivers of contract application in problem situations. It extends the body of knowledge on this topic and hopefully will encourage more research on contractual governance from the reactive perspective.

The aim of this research is to investigate the application of social interaction theory in RC in construction. A literature review was used to identify factors from social interaction theory that affects RC performance. These factors were verified by experts and practitioners to determine their relevance. Questionnaires were then distributed to measure the level of implementation of the verified factors in the Pakistani construction industry. In total, 204 data were collected and analyzed using factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that in order to have successful RC, clients and contractors must identify motivational factors, develop a collaborative culture, and establish structured interactions.

To achieve it, it is necessary to identify its driving variables and formation paths. Based on the literature review, 24 driving variables were identified and packaged into six categories. Meanwhile, the hypothetical relationships among six packages were carried out based on the resource-capability-performance paradigm. After a pilot study, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the relative importance of these driving variables. To test the reliability of the survey data and identify the most important driving variable, descriptive analysis was conducted. After that, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was carried out to verify the hypothesized paths. The descriptive analysis result indicates the top five crucial variables, i.e., technical reliability, brand impact, research and development (R&D) innovation, industrial license certificate, and technical absorption. The PLS-SEM result shows that eight of nine hypothesized paths are significant. The findings of this paper help international HSR rolling stock contractors better understand the driving variables and formation paths of competitive advantage. Furthermore, this paper will contribute to the body of knowledge on competition in the global HSR market.

J	Chen, Q; Jin, RY; Soboyejo, A				Chen, Qian; Jin, Ruoyu; Soboyejo, Alfred			Understanding a Contractor's Regional Variations in Safety Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety performance; Regional difference; Incident rate; Behavioral violation; Safety climate; Safety culture	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; CLIMATE; BEHAVIOR; MANAGEMENT; ACCIDENTS; INDUSTRY; PROGRAM; CULTURE; POLICY; INJURY	Contractors' safety performance can vary widely in the construction industry. However, it has not been well recognized that variations in safety performance could exist in the same contractor's regional offices. There is also a lack of understanding of the differences between regions and what causes these variations. This paper analyzes the safety performance of a general contractor's six major regional branches across four states after implementation of a new safety management program. The research finds apparent differences in regional incident rates (IRs) and safety violation rates (SVRs), although the shared perceptions from workers and site management personnel about how the safety program is implemented (i.e., safety climate and culture) are generally consistent companywide. This research also discloses that regional IRs, SVRs, safety climate, and culture are uncorrelated in the long term (during the 17-month study period), but have some linear relationships over a short duration (during the 4-month survey period). The correlation analysis in this study does not find a significant influence of workers' demographic characteristics and a few other potential influencing factors on regional safety performance. These findings will provide useful insights to industry practitioners who aim to achieve good, consistent safety management and performance across regions.

The main contribution of this paper is in presenting a methodology to integrate an FES with adaptation/optimization techniques and applying the data-based adaptive learning concept to increase the accuracy of an FES developed for contractor default prediction for surety bonding. In addition, this paper investigates two optimization approaches (genetic algorithms and neural network back-propagation) for adaptation of fuzzy membership function (MBF) and rules' degree of support (DoS) to determine the most suitable technique to adapt the FES. The optimized FES, called SuretyQualification, was validated using 30 hypothetical contractor default prediction cases, and the highest accuracy of the system (adapted using neural networks) was found to be 91.83%. Another contribution of this paper is the development of a software tool called SuretyQualification that provides a comprehensive and systematic evaluation process to evaluate a contractor and their risk of default on a project. The presented optimization approaches address FES context adaptation using any changing information conveyed by the input-output data and provide a methodology for continuous adaptation of the FES parameters, using practical cases to adjust the FES according to any contexts changes.

Voluntary actions to reduce the emissions from construction practices have rarely received attention from contractors because eco-construction methods tend to incur extra project costs and induce the bidders' concern to lose the bidding competitions. This study developed an incentive procurement system named Green Road Incentive Procurement (GRIP) to persuade contractors to adopt environmental-friendly construction methods. Initially, GRIP proposed six highly potential alternative construction methods of emission reduction for which bidders could choose as their preference. To ensure the acceptance and collaboration of this new GRIP, a survey study was conducted on two directly involved parties of road construction projects, contractors and public owners, which were selected as a sample group. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to evaluate an opinion by three options based on eight criteria. The results showed that both contractors and the public owners gave the highest weighted scores for the GRIP full implementation alternative. The users' readiness was an AHP criterion, which both parties were mutually concerned as the highest significance. These results confirmed that both involved parties agreed with the concept of GRIP and were pleased to cooperate with the GRIP implementation.

Six project success factors (project team commitment, contractor's competencies, risk and liability assessment, client's competencies, end-users' needs, and constraints imposed by end-users) were extracted from factor analysis of data provided by 53 participants of public-sector D&B projects through a questionnaire survey. Project team commitment, client's competencies, and contractor's competencies were found to be important to bring successful project outcome from the multiple regression findings. Contractor's competencies also contributed to project time performance. Project team members should also recognize that time and cost performance as well as quality of design and workmanship represent the key elements of overall success of D&B projects. Practitioners are advised to focus on teamwork and partnering for successful project completion. More research should be conducted to further explore the relationship between procurement method and project success factors.

J	Liu, SS; Wang, CJ				Liu, Shu-Shun; Wang, Chang-Jung			Resource-constrained construction project scheduling model for profit maximization considering cash flow	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						resource-constrained project scheduling; profit maximization; cash flow; constraint programming	OPTIMIZATION	Regarding project scheduling problems, resource-constrained issue is generally considered essential for contractors as a means. Researchers have thus devoted considerable efforts to investigating this issue over the past decade. Furthermore, since adequate cash flow management benefits cost control and assists profit acquisition for contractors, numerous techniques have recently been developed for project scheduling in situations involving cash flow. However, most of these studies simplified resource utilization, and assumed that cash out flows are directly related to activities without considering resource usage. Fundamentally, resources incur activities' costs, project cash flow, which conforms to resource utilization. It is thus regarded as a main issue in this study. This study establishes a resource-constrained project scheduling model based on constraint programming, whose solution can be found by using combinatorial optimization algorithms. The proposed model integrates the issues involving resource-constrained problems and cash flow, and maximizes net project cash flow to optimize project profit from the perspective of contractors. Model validation and two scenarios, including multi-resource, resource combination selection, and various constraints such as resource limit are performed to demonstrate the model capability and applications. Contractors thus can evaluate appropriate project schedules under associated constraints, and arrange activities and resources to maximize project profit. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Entry Mode Taxonomy for International Construction Markets	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRANSACTION-COST-ANALYSIS; JOINT VENTURES; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SERVICE FIRMS; CHOICE; ALLIANCES; PERFORMANCE; DECISION; CHINA	The global construction market is large, expanding, fragmented, regionally fluctuating, heterogynous, risky, and highly competitive. To survive and grow in this arena full of opportunities as well as pitfalls, international contractors must use the most appropriate entry modes for targeted overseas markets. The globalization process in the construction industry has seen various entry modes adopted by international contractors to meet specific internal and external business and project environments, and new innovative entry modes continue to emerge. It is, therefore, important for contractors to understand a comprehensive set of entry mode options and their respective characteristics, structure, formulation process, advantages, and disadvantages. Through analysis of 94 market entry cases, this paper identifies and defines a taxonomy of 10 basic entry modes for international construction markets, including strategic alliance, build-operate-transfer equity project, joint venture project, representative office, licensing, local agent, joint venture company, sole venture company, branch office/company, and sole venture project.

Best value (BV) procurement with well-defined selection criteria results in the successful attainment of project objectives. Therefore, in this research, we first identified the current BV criteria for elevator maintenance contractor (EMC) selection after analyzing requests for proposals (RFPs) using manual content analysis. Detailed examination of the RFPs indicated discrepancies between the actual EMC selection criteria and recommendations in the literature. Besides, the existing criteria did not address the critical factors affecting the performance of elevators, including safety performance, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, availability of service, age of elevators, and availability of spare parts. Thus, to overcome these shortcomings, significant modifications are suggested. It is expected that these recommendations will significantly improve the BV criteria and result in the enhanced future performance of elevators.

One application area for such warranties involves performance-based specifications (PBSs). In contrast to traditional approaches, PBS gives contractors the flexibility to select construction methods, materials, and even design. However, the contractors then must warrant the performance of their work for a specified period of time. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the risks associated with the warranty is a significant cost issue for any contractor to cover potential risks while still being competitive in bidding. Quantitative evaluation of the cost of risk incurred by the warranty has several difficulties. The deterioration of a highway project is a complex process, which is affected by pavement structure, material, traffic load, and weather conditions. Based on a probabilistic risk analysis of failures of performance indicators, the resulting model can estimate the warranty cost at a detailed level. The application of the model has been demonstrated via a numerical case study using long-term pavement performance data.

This study aims to explore how culture influences contractors' risk management. A case study method is selected including four projects in China, Poland and Singapore. Data are collected through interviews and archival documents. Major risks are identified and risk management in each case is discussed in the context of Hofstede's theory. A conceptual framework is proposed to reveal the link between culture and risk management. The findings show that project risks are perceived and managed differently in different national cultures. It is indicated that IDV and UAT are the foci of attention, beyond the contributions of PDI, LTO and MAS, and that contractors' knowledge of the host country's national culture influences their risk management behaviors. Having such information is of great importance to improve international contractors' risk management practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Therefore, companies require a better understanding about the interrelationships between the factors that determine competitiveness and indexes to measure it. Considering that strategic planning within the construction industry has had documented challenges, this research provides support for decision making associated with improving competitiveness. This paper first provides the critical variables that define the competitiveness of general contractors according to top managers for general contractors' companies. Then, an interrelationship model has been proposed to describe how these variables are interrelated based on well-known business models and other relationships found in the literature. The proposed model was evaluated using the partial least squares path modeling technique. The results show that leadership has, in general, the strongest impact on the competitiveness indexes, which means that whatever the goal set by the construction company, close attention should be placed on leadership. The other factors, following leadership, that mostly affect the indexes were contract management and health and safety management. The results intend to support strategic planning in construction companies by helping managers to orient the company's efforts with those factors that contribute to the specific indexes that need improvement.

It is during this period that the project team is formed; subcontractors are finalized; the orders of material and equipment are placed; and project plans are made. Despite its importance, few studies have been conducted in this field, especially for international contractors who face many complex situations in project buyout. This paper presents the study conducted for the project buyout management for the Chinese International Contractors (CICs) in developing countries, with focus on the project buyout management under different overseas management structures, and the key influencing factors. It discusses the characteristics of CICs in developing countries; investigates the project buyout management under different overseas management structures; analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each overseas management structure to project buyout, and identifies the major project buyout influencing factors. The results of this research will benefit both the industry practitioners and the academic researchers in this area.

J	Fallahnejad, MH				Fallahnejad, Mohammad Hossein			Delay causes in Iran gas pipeline projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Causes of delay; Gas transmission pipeline	CONSTRUCTION DELAYS	On the basis of Iran's strategic development plan, natural gas industry must develop the capacity of gas transmission up to 1300 million m(3) per day until 2025. For this purpose, gas pipeline length should be doubled during the next 15 years; however, experience shows a remarkable delay in nearly all gas pipeline projects. The main goal of this paper is to identify and rank the causes of delay in these kinds of projects in Iran. In this regard, 24 executed gas pipeline projects were studied and then extracted delay factors were conferred with 10 experts from several disciplines. The result was a 43-item list of factors which then was ranked by means of a questionnaire survey. The result reveals that the 10 major delay factors are: "imported materials, unrealistic project duration, client-related materials, land expropriation, change orders, contractor selection methods, payment to contractor, obtaining permits, suppliers, and contractor's cash flow".

By identifying the amount and timing of individual inflow or outflow at the end of each period, contractors can observe the cash flow at specific time points according to project progress. Since most companies handle multiple projects simultaneously, managing project finance becomes complicated and tough for contractors. Therefore, this study considers cash flow and the financial requirements of contractors working in a multiple-project environment and proposes a profit optimization model for multiproject scheduling problems using constraint programming. The current study also presents a hypothetical example involving three projects to illustrate capability of the proposed model and adopts various constraints, including credit limit (CL) and due dates, for scenario analysis. The analysis result demonstrates that setting CLs ensures smooth financial pressure by properly shifting activities, and assigning due dates for projects helps planners avoid project duration extension while maximizing overall project profit.

J	Trigunarsyah, B				Trigunarsyah, B			Constructability practices among construction contractors in Indonesia	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The concept of constructability in the United States or buildability in the United Kingdom emerged in the late 1970s, which evolved from studies into how improvement can be achieved to increase cost efficiency and quality in the construction industry. It is an approach that links the design and construction processes. The studies in the Unites States, United Kingdom, and Australia have demonstrated that improved constructability has lead to significant savings in both cost and time required for completing construction projects. However, in implementing constructability improvement, it is important to consider the uniqueness of the construction industry in a specific country. This paper presents the study performed on the construction contractors in Indonesia with regard to their current constructability practices and its impact on the project performance. The study shows that many contractors in Indonesia have been implementing part of the constructability concept in their projects. The concepts that usually applied during the construction stage as part of the overall construction plan were planning the sequence of field tasks and analyzing layout, access, and temporary facilities.

Ten performance metrics and 60 factors are identified that project team members can use to measure and manage the success levels of construction projects in four broad categories: cost, time, quality and administrative burden. A survey and correlation analysis of 65 design-bid-build projects in Singapore is used to suggest the factors that affect each performance metric significantly. Contractor characteristics are the key determinants affecting the highest number of performance metrics. The most significant variable is the contractor's past record for completing projects on budget and to an acceptable level of quality. Based on this evidence, it is recommended that clients and consultants pay closer attention to a wider array of characteristics (not just the initial price) involving contractor selection. Another key determinant is the project character with the most important variable being the percentage of repetitive elements.

J	Mochtar, K; Arditi, D				Mochtar, K; Arditi, D			Role of marketing intelligence in making pricing policy in construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The pricing strategy predominantly used in construction is cost based. But this pricing logic may lead to the underpricing or overpricing of a bid offer. In response to this problem, alternate pricing strategies are proposed in this paper that make use of market-based approaches. These models are centered on marketing intelligence functions. In this paper, marketing intelligence systems developed and used in manufacturing industries are explored, including marketing research, marketing information systems, and decision support systems. The current developments and practices of marketing intelligence in construction are reviewed. The findings of a survey that investigates the marketing intelligence and pricing strategy practices of the largest 400 U.S. contractors are presented. In conclusion, it is discovered that contractors use mostly traditional marketing intelligence;strategies. It is recommended that contractors develop computerized intelligence activities such as using resources on the Internet and developing management information systems and decision support systems. As expected, it is found that "marketing intelligence capabilities" is a significant variable associated with pricing strategy.

The two main decisions they have to make are the project selection decision and the markup selection decision. This paper proposes a new optimization model that combines these two main decisions. It also takes into account the importance of eminence and previous works as the most important non-monetary evaluation criterion used by owners for evaluating bids. These factors combined with the two decisions make this model complex and nonlinear. To solve this model, a customized Genetic Algorithm is developed. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the result of the model is compared to the results of conventional models that only consider bidding markups. The comparison shows that considering eminence can increase the expected profit of the contractor to more than 25% under some evaluation criteria mindsets of the owner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Martin, L; Benson, L				Martin, Loosemore; Benson, Lim			Relationship quality in construction projects: A subcontractor perspective of principal contractor relationships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Subcontractors; Construction; Relationship quality; Principal contractors; Supply chain management	BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; TRUST; INDUSTRY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERCEPTIONS; INTEGRATION; DEPENDENCE; BEHAVIORS; FAIRNESS	One of the defining characteristics of the construction industry is its subcontracting model of project organisation. Surprisingly, despite the criticality of the subcontractor/principal contractor relationship to successful project out-comes, research into this important relationship has been fragmented, disorganised and under-theorised. Mobil-ising theories of relationship quality to address this gap in knowledge, a survey of three hundred and thirty seven tier-one subcontractors in the Australian construction industry was undertaken to explore what factors influence relationship quality between subcontractors and principal contractors, whether these factors vary across the sup-ply chain and how they affect overall relational satisfaction. The findings give subcontractors a missing voice in this important debate and provide a more nuanced understanding of this critical project relationship from a novel theoretical perspective. They indicate that from a subcontractor perspective, subcontractor/principal contractor relationship quality is determined by six key factors: integrity respect and fairness; prompt payment; willingness to negotiate risk and price; effective communication; concern for worker health, safety and well-being; and op-portunities for early involvement in planning and design. Conceptually, when these factors are organised under the three dimensions of relationship quality theory (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), the results show that trust is by far the most important determinant of relationship quality. However, subcontractors cannot be treated as a homogeneous group and the factors that influence relationship quality and the importance of trust vary sig-nificantly between large and small subcontractors and by the amount of turnover-dependency in a relationship. Conceptually, the findings are important for refining the concept of relationship quality in a project management context and for helping construction project managers to improve often tenuous subcontractor relationships in an increasingly competitive industry where the quality of these relationships is a critical determinant of project outcomes and competitive advantage.

Although previous research efforts have analyzed factors related to subcontractor performance in regular financial conditions, there remains only sparse knowledge of how subcontractors are to survive when economic conditions become dire, as they have in recent times in the Spanish construction market. In this research, in-depth interviews with managers of relevant Spanish subcontracting companies were carried out, resulting in the identification of eight factors for subcontractor survival: project delivery method, demand, financial capital, relationship assets, managerial assets, human assets, legal framework, and geographic scope. The project delivery method used by the owner and also by the main contractor is mainly based on price. As a result, the subcontractors' bids get lower, making them unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, subcontractors do not get financial support from banks easily to cover their additional financial costs. These facts push subcontractors to get a guarantee of payment by the main contractor, and subcontracting companies may even ask for payments in advance. Subcontractors also seek long-term relationships with the contractor. These trusting relations are very often a prerequisite to qualify and bid for contracts. Subcontractors have to continuously improve, plan ahead, and adapt quickly to the new environment. Therefore, subcontractors must remain flexible and maintain a lean hierarchical organization. Doing so makes it is easier for subcontractors to compete in both their native markets as well as abroad. To this end, the most successful subcontractors have become international during the expansion phase of the economic cycle; many of them went abroad with the help of a contractor from their home country.

J	Said, H				Said, Hisham			Prefabrication Best Practices and Improvement Opportunities for Electrical Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Electrical construction; Prefabrication; Best practices; Supply chain; Industrialization; Construction materials and methods		Prefabrication is a construction operations approach that moves project work to a controlled offsite facility to be accomplished in a standardized and efficient manner. Prefabrication is increasingly becoming attractive to electrical contractors to improve their competitiveness due to reported safety, time, and cost benefits. This paper presents the findings of an industry-sponsored research study to identify current best practices of electrical construction prefabrication and future improvement opportunities that consider prefabrication dependency on supply chain collaboration and labor union relations. The study tasks are performed in three main phases. First, current state of electrical construction prefabrication is identified through a comprehensive data collection plan that included semistructured interview, site visits, case studies, and questionnaires. The second phase included suggesting a set of best practices of electrical contracting industrialization, related to prefabrication operational/design requirements, role of vendor/distributors, and role of part manufacturers. The third phase involved the identification of future improvement opportunities for electrical contractors' industrialization, which include promoting mutually-rewarding relations among workers' union locals, and increasing implementation of lean principles. The study should prove useful to electrical contractors who seek to start or improve their prefabrication operations, and to industry advocates who seek to improve its performance through better supply chain collaborations and improved union relations. The major contributions of this paper include developing a set of data-driven prefabrication best practices and improvement opportunities for electrical contractors.

Polish public procurement law, harmonized with EU guidelines on the subject, describes selection procedures in detail. Similar procedures are adopted by private sector clients as there exist no private sector specific procurement codes of practice. In the case of public procurement, the bid selection criteria have to refer to the object of procurement and not to the proprieties of a bidder. The client, in order to assure adequate quality of works (i.e. selection of a reliable and capable contractor) can, within the limits enforced by law, set conditions the bidders have to fulfill if they are to participate in a tender or negotiation procedure. The assessment based on criteria related with a bidder's technical and economic capability can be made also at the prequalification stage in restricted tendering procedures. The authors suggest the application of an extended fuzzy AHP method to the process of group decision making. This approach facilitates defining criteria weights by aggregation of decision makers' judgments. The paper presents an example that illustrates this approach to determining criteria weights for bidder assessment. The results show that the proposed fuzzy AHP method is superior to the traditional AHP in terms of improved quality of criteria prioritization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Salas, R; Hallowell, M				Salas, Rico; Hallowell, Matthew			Predictive Validity of Safety Leading Indicators: Empirical Assessment in the Oil and Gas Sector	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Predictive analytic; Oil and gas; Principal factor analysis; Risk mitigation; Safety leading indicator; Safety performance outcome; Labor and personnel issues		Improving safety performance is paramount to the success of oil and gas construction projects. Although considerable attention has been paid to developing and using new types of safety performance indicators, contractor safety has traditionally been measured and managed through lagging indicators. Alternatively, risk mitigation measures can be used to predict safety performance as leading indicators. Several research studies have been performed on safety leading indicators; however, no research has empirically validated the predictive validity of candidate indicators. To address this knowledge gap, empirical data were used to measure both potential safety leading and lagging indicators in an effort to test the hypothesis that variability in candidate safety leading indicators predicts variability in lagging indicators of safety performance. A total of 261 contractors were included in the study, with more than 60,000 data points. Using principal factor analysis, model building, and regression, factors with predictive power were identified. The predicted total recordable incident rate (TRIR) and severity rate (SR) provided strong correlation with the actual TRIR and SR, with coefficients of 0.7251 and 0.5338, respectively. The models of predictive TRIR and SR were validated and suggest a good fit when applied to new contractor safety data set. The models can be used as new safety leading indicators that provide warning signs for weakness in contractor safety performance. Consequently, clients can use the results to implement adaptive risk mitigation, reduce incidents, and continuously improve contractor safety performance. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by empirically identifying safety leading indicators, testing their efficacy, and validating the resulting models. This research set a foundation for establishing quantitative safety leading indicators in the construction industry in the future for other forms of project outcomes.

J	Shr, JF; Ran, B; Sung, CW				Shr, JF; Ran, B; Sung, CW			Method to determine minimum contract bid for A+B+I/D highway projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; TIME	More and more state highway agencies (SHAs) have begun to consider the value of time in highway construction. The "A (cost) + B (time cost) + I/D (incentive/disincentive)" bidding concept is designed to shorten the total contract time by allowing each contractor to bid the number of days in which the work can be accomplished, in addition to the traditional cost bid. I/D are not only used to provide an incentive to the contractor for earlier completion, but also to provide a disincentive for late completion of a project. Contractors are then presented with the problem of determining the best strategy of bid estimation, including construction cost, time cost, and incentive/disincentive. SHAs are also faced with the problem of placing a maximum and/or minimum on the time bid. To provide users a useful tool to estimate project time more accurately using this advanced method, this study develops a quantified model of the price-time bidding contract. The functional relationship between the construction cost and time duration is developed based on data from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The contractor's construction cost "A" is then combined with the road user cost and incentive/disincentive to determine the optimum low bid price and time. This optimum can then be used by the SHA to set limits on the range of acceptable time bids. Finally, several projects completed by the FDOT will be used to illustrate the validity of this model.

J	Li, HM; Arditi, D; Wang, ZF				Li, Huimin; Arditi, David; Wang, Zhuofu			Factors That Affect Transaction Costs in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transaction costs; Construction project; Structural equation modeling; Construction management; Transaction cost economics	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; JOINT VENTURES; FIT INDEXES; MODEL; ECONOMICS; INDUSTRY; RISK	The actual cost of a construction project is comprised of not only production costs, but also transaction costs. Transaction costs include but are not limited to the costs of preparing the bidding package, estimating, drawing up a contract, administering the contract, and dealing with any deviations from contract conditions. Transaction costs constitute an important part of the construction owner's budget. However, understanding transaction costs is difficult because of the inconsistency and ambiguity in defining transaction costs in the literature. The objective of this paper is to identify methods to minimize the transaction costs borne by the construction owner. A structural equation model is tested on data collected by means of a survey administered to construction owners. The findings indicate that the transaction costs borne by the owner can be minimized if the owner minimizes the uncertainties inherent in the transaction environment by (1) ensuring the engineering design is as complete as possible before bids are sought from contractors, (2) exploring the possibility of adopting integrated project delivery methods that would allow the owner to engage the services of a contractor early in the design phase, (3) agreeing to share some of the risks with the contractors, (4) understanding well the behavior of contractors, and (5) paying close attention to project management efficiency.

To overcome this problem, clients in the construction industry sometimes use schedule incentive/disincentive (I/D) contracting strategy. However, previous studies have shown that inadequate understanding and wrong implementation of schedule I/D provisions could result in unintended results. Moreover, the use of the I/D contracting method is in its initial stages in many countries such as India. The purpose of this paper is to identify various factors that are essential for schedule I/D success in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among experienced professionals (clients, contractors and consultants) from across the Indian construction industry. Findings Top success factors related to clients in the descending order of their importance are: realistic targets; detailed guidelines for I/D implementation; close coordination with other stakeholders; correct estimation of I/D duration and amount; and imposing disincentives after due consideration. Meanwhile, factors related to contractor organisations are: continuous monitoring and control; thorough understanding of schedule I/D targets; specific considerations in appointing senior project personnel; effective communication; and proper labour management. Originality/value This research highlights the specific roles of both clients and contractors in the success of schedule I/D projects in developing countries such as India.

A comparative study on adopting human resource practices for safety management on construction projects in the United States and Singapore	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; HR practices; Safety outcomes	ORGANIZATIONAL SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; INJURY; RISK; ACCIDENTS; CULTURE; WORKERS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; OIL	Good project management outcomes include completing projects to an acceptable level of quality, within budget and on time. As construction accidents may cause project delays, safety management plays an important role in a project's timely completion. This study aims to undertake a comparative study of HR practices adopted for safety management on construction projects in the United States (US) and Singapore and to investigate the relationship between HR practices and construction safety management outcomes (severity and frequency of accidents). The research method included exploratory interviews and industry surveys of contractors in the US and Singapore by email and post. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. Compared to Singapore contractors, the results show that US contractors' project management practices place significantly more emphasis on highlighting organizational safety values to new workers and taking working experience into account during the selection process. On the other hand, Singapore contractors place more emphasis on providing appropriate rest areas for workers. Many HR practices are significantly correlated with safety management outcomes. These include: taking age into consideration during selection process and giving feedback to workers about their unsafe behaviour. It is recommended that project managers adopt relevant HR practices that lead to more effective safety management on construction projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Li, GH; Zhang, GM; Chen, C; Martek, I				Li Guanghua; Zhang Guomin; Chen Chuan; Martek, Igor			Empirical Bid or No Bid Decision Process in International Construction Projects: Structural Equation Modeling Framework	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bid or no bid decision; International construction; Decision framework; Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM)	POLITICAL RISKS; SYSTEM; CONTRACTORS; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; MARKET	The bid or no bid decision in international construction projects requires complex multiattribute analysis. Thus far, there exists no comprehensive framework to support the decision process. The objective of this study is to construct such a framework to support international contractors. Following a comprehensive literature review, five criteria and 41 factors were identified that bear on the decision. Questionnaire surveys were used to collect experts' opinions on the importance of these factors in the decision of Chinese international contractors (CICs). The 41 factors were classified into six groups using factor analysis, with relationships among them validated through structural equation modeling (SEM). By integrating the five criteria with the six factors, a systematic framework for a no bid decision was developed. The outcome reveals that the bidding decision is a multistage decision process conducted in the following sequence: country risk vulnerability -> ability to perform -> project risk vulnerability -> profitability -> probability of winning. In validating this framework, a case study was also examined. Thus, this paper contributes to the body of knowledge on bid or no bid decision-making by offering an empirical framework that effectively links factors to criteria, and which sets out a basis on which contractors may rationally base a bid or no bid decision in the international arena.

J	Laryea, S; Hughes, W				Laryea, Samuel; Hughes, Will			Risk and Price in the Bidding Process of Contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding; Contractors; Participant observation; Risk apportionment; United Kingdom	CONSTRUCTION RISK	Formal and analytical risk models prescribe how risk should be incorporated into construction bids. However, the actual process of how contractors and their clients negotiate and agree to price is complex and not clearly articulated in the literature. With participant observation, the entire tender process was shadowed in two leading U. K. construction firms. This was compared with propositions in analytical models, and significant differences were found. A total of 670 h of work observed in both firms revealed three stages of the bidding process. Bidding activities were categorized and their extent estimated as deskwork (32%), calculations (19%), meetings (14%), documents (13%), off-days (11%), conversations (7%), correspondence (3%), and travel (1%). Risk allowances of 1-2% were priced in some bids, and three tiers of risk apportionment in bids were identified. However, priced risks may be excluded from the final bid to enhance competitiveness. Although risk apportionment affects a contractor's pricing strategy, other complex microeconomic factors also affect price. Instead of including pricing contingencies, risk was priced primarily through contractual rather than price mechanisms to reflect commercial imperatives. These findings explain why some assumptions underpinning analytical models may not be sustainable in practice and why what actually happens in practice is important for those who seek to model the pricing of construction bids.

CLSs are often used in complex multi-project contexts, such as urban development districts, where extensive coordination of actors, resources, and activities is needed. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to investigate how main contractors engage in horizontal relationships with each other when coordinating activities and resources within and across projects in a multi-project context, and to investigate what role a TPL provider assumes when engaging in relationships with main contractors in a multi-project context. The findings are based on a case study of an urban development district with a mandatory TPL-operated CLS, and we apply the industrial network approach. In this multi-project context, the main contractors engage in coopetitive relationships, coordinating activities and resources within and across projects. The TPL provider coordinates actors, resources, and activities, facilitating smoother production by managing logistics and mediating coopetitive relationships. This can be understood as a multi-project coordination role and extends the role SCM can play in construction. In that role, a TPL provider can minimise tensions between coopetitive actors across a multitude of horizontal relationships and projects.

Road infrastructure projects have a significant role in this growth in connecting different strategic locations of a country or region to each other. During different project phases, many stakeholders are involved, and each has their own expectations. Thus, for project success, creating a balance among them is very significant. This can only be achieved by ensuring integration of projects. However, according to recent studies, there are various barriers in enabling this. This study evaluates solutions to facilitate the presence of operation and maintenance (O&M) contractors in the pre-occupancy phases of infrastructure projects. To achieve this, an in-depth literature review and case study research methods are applied. Solutions from the conducted case study within the road infrastructure projects are compared with findings from the available literature. Finally a framework is provided which addresses the need to reduce barriers to the presence of O&M contractors in the design and implementation phases of infrastructure projects. Such classification helps researchers to have a better understanding of project needs for facilitating the early presence of O&M contractors within infrastructure projects. This study highlights the need for localizing solutions in different parts of the world.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified approach for JVC selection. The proposed approach integrates competitive information and collaborative information, focusing on the hesitant fuzzy variables of the bid evaluators. An optimization model is established based on the maximizing deviation (MD) principle to determine the criterion weights objectively. Then, the weights of the bid evaluators are obtained through calculating the relative closeness coefficients of each bid evaluator and the group from the JVCs to the fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS). All the potential JVCs are ranked through minimizing the deviation model based on the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach. A case study of the JVC selection process for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (a large-scale island and tunnel engineering project) was conducted to illustrate the proposed approach. The results showed that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can select the contractors with good collaborative performance. This is important for the practice, because collaborative criteria are reflected in the key criteria currently used in JVC evaluation and selection. The findings from this study can help the JVC manager to identify a JVC with good collaborative performance and control the project risk from the initial stage.

J	Ning, Y				Ning, Yan			Impact of quality performance ambiguity on contractor's opportunistic behaviors in person-to-organization projects: The mediating roles of contract design and application	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Opportunistic behaviors; Contractual governance; Performance ambiguity; Contract application	FORMAL CONTRACTS; RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; CONTROL STRATEGIES; COOPERATION; MECHANISMS; EXCHANGE; CHINA; TRANSACTIONS; ENFORCEMENT; ANTECEDENTS	Contracts are critical for managing projects. However, studies increasingly found that contracts, albeit well written, might not be thoroughly implemented. This study aims to examine the impact of quality performance ambiguity on contractor's opportunistic behaviors in person-to organization projects and to investigate the mediating role of contract design and application. A questionnaire-survey of 265 dwelling fit-out projects was undertaken in China. The results showed that quality performance ambiguity has great impacts on project development as it hinders detailed contract drafting, results in ineffective contract application and leads to opportunism. The mediation results showed that contract application rather than the written contract mediates the effect of quality performance ambiguity on contractor's opportunistic behaviors. Thus, it is recommended that project managers should pay attention to project characteristics and the gaps between the design and application of contracts in project management.

However, previous probabilistic cost estimation models are mostly devoid of loss-sharing considerations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic cost estimation model integrating risk allocation and claim. The bargaining game between the owner and the contractor is first used to determine the proportion of risk allocation in the price fluctuation and the claim amount in the engineering quantity variation. Then, these two key parameters are incorporated into a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic cost risk simulation. The proposed model is applied to an actual hydropower project, and the results show that the risk reserve fund of the proposed model only accounts for 2.66% of the budget under 80% completion probability, and the average cost risk sensitive coefficient of the proposed model has more than tripled. From the results, the cost estimation value calculated by the novel model is more competitive and accurate in bidding; in addition, to reduce additional cost expenditures, the contractor should maintain a high level of patience during negotiations. This research contributes to improving the probability of winning a contract without sacrificing the contractor's profit and to extending the current theory of probabilistic cost estimation.

Globally, construction of airports is often associated with large-scale cost and time overruns. However, studies that explicitly delineate the examination of critical factors affecting the airport construction are scant and highly unexplored. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by identifying the main factors affecting airport construction in India from clients' and contractors' perspectives using factor analysis. Based on a literature survey and expert interviews, questionnaires listing 21 attributes for clients, and 19 attributes for contractors were sent. Critical factors obtained from the analyses are as follows: a) Client-side - Pre-construction phase issues, Multi-organizational involvement issues and External issues; b) Contractor-side - Project implementation issues, Client related issues and Technical issues. The findings are intended to significantly help varied stakeholders to enhance the quality and success rate of future airport construction projects in developing countries.

The changes in the evaluation approach call for continuous improvement in tender pricing practices. Notwithstanding a large volume of existing studies, the way to price tenders properly in China's public work sector has not been explored explicitly. Using a mix of research methods, such as a literature review, interviews, and a questionnaire survey, this study found seven factors critically important for contractors to price public work contracts in China. The research findings indicate that the key factors are characterized by the attributes of public works and national socioeconomic background and facilitate contractors in determining tender prices in due ways. While this study is situated in China's public construction sector, it offers useful references for similar examinations of other construction contexts.

This study adopted the descriptive and quantitative design by using a questionnaire to investigate collect data. Seventy-two respondents from the second-grade contracting companies in Jordan participated in the study. The results showed that the conformance of the practices of these companies with the principles of lean construction was less than 65%. Also, the study showed that amongst the principles of lean, customer focus was the most applied in these companies, and showed that these companies lack the culture of providing training and empowerment to their employees and the culture of continuous improvement. This study will help to expand the knowledge about the lean construction application in Jordan, and to investigate the level of the application of this philosophy in different types of projects and different sizes of companies.

J	Said, H; El-Rayes, K				Said, Hisham; El-Rayes, Khaled			Automated multi-objective construction logistics optimization system	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated system; Material logistics; Building information models; Optimization		Construction logistics planning entails the coordination of supply and site activities by integrating their decisions and recognizing existing interdependencies to minimize the total material management cost. Despite the preliminary estimates of its benefits to the construction industry, few contractors adopted logistics management because of its demand for detailed data and decision of material supply and site operations. This paper presents the development of a new automated multi-objective construction logistics optimization system (AMCLOS) that would support the contractors in optimally planning material supply and storage. AMCLOS provides a holistic framework of automatically retrieving project spatial and temporal data from existing scheduling and BIM electronic files, seamlessly integrating relevant contractor and suppliers' data, and optimizing material supply and site decisions to minimize total logistics costs. The performance of AMCLOS was validated against a previous construction logistics planning model, which provided useful insights on material supply and storage logistics in congested and spacious sites. The developed system is envisioned to increase the implementation of logistics management practices and early integration and coordination of construction supply and site processes.

Talat			Capturing knowledge in construction projects: Knowledge platform for contractors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	Managing knowledge effectively is critical to the survival and advance of a company, especially in project-based industries such as construction. However, capturing knowledge in construction projects is a tedious task, as knowledge is usually experience based, tacit, and hard to pass on to others. In this study, a survey was carried out among eight leading Turkish construction contractors that are operating within the international construction market. The specific objectives of this survey are to find out how the tacit and explicit knowledge are captured, stored, shared, and used in forthcoming projects, as well as major drivers and barriers for knowledge management. Based on the survey, it was determined that most of these firms do not have a knowledge management strategy and a systematic way of capturing and storing tacit knowledge. A conceptual framework is proposed to formalize the knowledge-capturing process within construction companies. To demonstrate how the conceptual framework can be implemented in practice, a Web-based system, namely, Knowledge Platform for Contractors (KPfC) is presented. It is hypothesized that KPfC can be used to manage both tacit and explicit knowledge effectively in construction projects.

A questionnaire, which consists of 73 claim causes, is designed for data collection. Project-specific data with regard to the frequency and severity of 73 claim causes are collected from practitioners through conducting direct interviews and using private emails. Together with separate analyses of either frequency or severity, an integrated view of both frequency and severity is presented for 73 claim causes and various groups of claim causes are also proposed for practical applications. In addition, a combined dimension, called as concerning scale, is developed using principal component analysis and, then, a benchmark level for claim management is established. This study could help practitioners to know which claim causes are severe in frequency and/or impact. Hence, practitioners could establish proper strategies to manage claim-related problems of construction projects, in which they are directly involved. Furthermore, this study could provide construction project parties, especially foreign organizations, with a better understanding of claim panorama in the Vietnamese construction market.

Towards understanding the contractor's response to carbon reduction policies in the construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Carbon reduction; Strategy adoption; Organisational culture; Construction contractors	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; EMISSIONS; PERFORMANCE; ARCHITECTS; ENERGY; IMPACT	Policies like the carbon tax and tightened building regulations have been advocated as the effective drivers of carbon reduction strategy adoption. Few however, have acknowledged that project environment strategy adoption is a matter of organisational culture (OC). This paper reports a study that aims to examine the effect of some key drivers on the contractors' adoption of carbon reduction strategies in OC perspective. A conceptual model which depicts the hypothesised relationship among OC, carbon reduction drivers and strategy adoption is presented. The model is tested with data collected by a survey conducted in New South Wales, Australia. To test the conceptual model, Pearson correlation analysis and multiple moderated regression (MMR) analysis were employed. The results suggest that the respondents may not adjust their attitudes in carbon reduction strategy adoption for the sake of avoiding 'penalty'. The findings may be thought provoking for those who believe that levies on carbon emissions would lead to a behavioural drift. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

As such, this paper develops a simulation framework to determine the bid decision that would result in the optimal outcomes in the long run. To this end, the authors used a research methodology based on an algorithmic game theory approach. First, data was collected for 982 US public construction projects. Second, a framework was formulated to represent the bidding decision-making process. Third, a comparison between three learning algorithms was performed, including the multiplicative weights, the exponential weights, and the Roth-Erev. Fourth, two bidding strategies were simulated: the first strategy aims to win more projects while the second strategy aims to reduce the cases the contractor might fall prey to negative profits (known as the winner's curse). The outcomes of this study demonstrated that integrating learning into construction bidding decision-making process (1) gives contractors competitive advantage over their competitors by either doubling their chance of winning more projects or reducing losses in the long run, and (2) benefits owners by ending-up paying less for their projects in the long run. Ultimately, this study adds to the body of knowledge by equipping contractors with a practical bidding framework that can be used in their bidding decision-making process to overcome the inherent complexities and uncertainties in the competitive construction bidding environment.

J	Horman, MJ; Orosz, MP; Riley, DR				Horman, MJ; Orosz, MP; Riley, DR			Sequence planning for electrical construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE	The sequences in which work is completed bear significantly on the performance of electrical contractors in building construction projects. When project work sequences are poorly planned or poorly executed, electrician constructors often must contend with compressed schedules, trade stacking, and out-of-sequence work to ensure timely completion of a project. This paper analytically evaluates the importance of sequence planning to efficient electrical work. It describes changes that were made to crew-level planning procedures for an electrical contractor and the impact these had on crew performance. The analysis shows that sequence planning at both the project level and the crew level are important to the performance of electrical crews. Most notably, a strong correlation (0.73) was detected between crew planning performance one week and crew productivity performance in the following week. Results of the study are provided. Principles of sound sequences and guidelines for sequence planning are also captured from the analysis. These sequence guidelines are designed to avoid, where possible, the often adverse project conditions in which electrical contractors find themselves and to handle those conditions most effectively when they cannot be avoided.

J	Kumaraswamy, MM; Matthews, JD				Kumaraswamy, MM; Matthews, JD			Improved subcontractor selection employing partnering principles	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Despite the increasing extent of subcontracting in construction, the importance of subcontractor selection is frequently underestimated. While the subcontracting element needs more attention in contractor selection itself, subcontractor selection techniques themselves need considerable improvements. This paper examines how such techniques can beneficially draw from improved multicriteria contractor selection methodologies in general, and specifically from recent developments in client-contractor partnering. It is shown how partnering may be profitably extended further into the supply chain, i.e., into subcontractor selection. A European case study illustrates the development of a subcontractor selection process that incorporated partnering principles. Despite the longer and costlier selection process, it was found that subcontractor pricing levels were reduced by about 10% to account for anticipated efficiencies arising from the proposed partnering. Markedly better time and cost control was achieved on the pilot project. The relationships between all project participants were also found to have improved considerably. Such observations confirm the value (1) of expanding the partnering "envelope" to encompass subcontractors in general; and more specifically, (2) of assessing the potential for such extended partnering as an integral part of the subcontractor selection process.

How to choose the right incentive intensity is a critical decision in construction procurement. In this regard, the principal-agent theory has been highly influential in theory and practice alike. However, this research argues that this theoretical model may lead to a biased decision. To demonstrate this point, this research draws on its modeling technique to analyze a standard pain-gain sharing arrangement in construction contracts, finding that taking no account of contract breakup hazards will result in underuse of incentives. When the outturn cost also depends on the contractor's effort, high-powered incentives can better tap into the contractor's efficiency improvement potential. The additional profit resulting from efficiency savings can serve as a buffer for downside cost shocks with the effect of reducing the likelihood of contract breakup. This benefit will make it desirable to use incentives more intensively than what is suggested by the principal-agent theory.

The decision to bid is a complex activity that requires the consideration of several factors. These factors can be related to capability, time requirement and cost implication. The purpose of this study was to assess the factors related to time and cost performance with a view to examine their effect on bidding decisions. Data was obtained through the use of structured questionnaires from construction professionals in both consulting and contracting firms. The collected data was analysed through percentile and mean ranking. The study revealed the reputation of the client as the most prominent factor related to time performance that affects bidding decisions, while location and condition of the site were identified as the most significant factor related to cost performance that affects bidding decisions. Thus, it is recommended that contractors when taking bidding decisions should place priority on the reputation of the client, the location, and the condition of the site.

Price and nonprice criteria for contractor selection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							UTILITY-THEORY; MULTIDIMENSIONAL AUCTIONS; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; GOVERNMENT; MODEL	Although the public sector has a long tradition of using the lowest bid as the award criterion for contracts, reliance on nonprice criteria is increasing. The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain how public owners use multiple criteria for the award of construction contracts. It is likely that nonprice criteria support the alignment of owner and contractor interests, and that bidder behavior should be affected by the likelihood of repeated contracts, and by the transparency of owners' evaluation procedures. Data from 386 bidding documents reflecting practice in Swedish municipalities in 2003 are analyzed. A typical pattern is a 70% price weight combined with three nonprice criteria. Price formulas, translating bid prices into scale values, were found to be based on the lowest bid, bid spread, or average bid. Nonprice criteria were evaluated on either relative or absolute merits. Owners should be aware of the incentives that their selection practices create and view this in a policy perspective, whereas contractors should be ready to assess the short and long term values of nonprice features.

Supplier-contractor coordination approach to managing demand fluctuations of ready-mix concrete	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Perishable materials; Ready-mix concrete; Construction supply chain; Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES); Coordination; Integration; BIM	BIM; SCHEDULE; MODELS	Although advancements have been made in the management of projects due to the digitalization and automation technologies, the efficient use of digital data is still lacking for the coordination of the supply chain. This paper presents an approach that allows data-driven and schedule-oriented supply chain coordination in the face of demand fluctuations. The approach consists of two main steps that contractors should take: 1) monitor the demand fluctuations based on a 4D model that captures the as-built status and updated look-ahead schedules, 2) make decisions to modify original orders to accommodate the demand fluctuations where orders are determined by a heuristic evolutionary algorithm. As a proof of concept, the coordination approach is demonstrated using an example project featuring a five-day in-situ construction of concrete walls. Results from this example show that using the approach improves the responsiveness of concrete planning and ordering. As a result, this leads to improved collaboration between suppliers and contractors in construction projects.

Study of Factors Influencing the Efficient Management and Downtime Consequences of Highway Construction Equipment in Thailand	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL	Downtime resulting from machine breakdown invariably has a considerable impact on the performance of construction projects and companies as a whole, especially to contractors with heavy investment in equipment. Attempts to investigate the causes and consequences of downtime are rarely found. The aim of this paper is to characterize and quantify factors that influence downtime consequences (consequential problems resulting from downtime) of highway construction equipment based on the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on equipment management practices and downtime consequences among highway contractors in Thailand. The SEM model proposed is of value for both researchers and practitioners to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships among acquisition condition, operational practice, maintenance quality, disposal practice, and downtime consequence of heavy equipment. The model also helps contractors to manage equipment more efficiently by concentrating on several practices that can convey the greatest benefit in minimizing downtime consequences at each particular stage of a machine's life cycle, rather than considering all practices simultaneously where the benefits gained are perhaps not proportional to the effort.

J	Hyari, KH				Hyari, Khaled Hesham			Handling Unbalanced Bidding in Construction Projects: Prevention Rather Than Detection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive bidding; Balanced bid; Unit price contract; Unbalanced bidding; Bidding practices; Contractor behavior; Contracting		Unbalanced bidding is a common practice associated with both unit price and lump sum contracts. This practice is not usually in the owner's best interests and is used in different forms by contractors for various reasons. Bid evaluation practices try to identify unbalanced bids and may reject the lowest bid if it is perceived to be unbalanced. Previous research on this topic focused on either helping contractors unbalance their bids or detecting imbalance in bids in order to reject them. This paper proposes a model based on a prevention, rather than detection, approach to handling unbalanced bidding. The proposed model balances all the bids submitted for a project and thereby neutralizes the impact of manipulating bid prices to obtain undeserved payments from owners. This approach protects the interests of the owners while maintaining the essence of competitive bidding by awarding the project to the bidder who submitted the lowest bid in a fair competitive process. Two examples, representing the bidding results of two projects, are analyzed to demonstrate the capability of the model in handling various forms of unbalanced bidding. Use of the model by owners will help protect them from the negative consequences of unbalanced bidding. It is also expected that, as owners begin to use the developed model, contractors will be less motivated to practice unbalanced bidding since it will not be possible to attain the desired objective by manipulating bid prices.

J	Zhao, ZY; Guo, XL; Chang, RD				Zhao, Zhen-Yu; Guo, Xiao-Ling; Chang, Rui-Dong			Market Concentration and Competitive Intensity of the International Engineering Contracting Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International engineering contracting; Competitiveness; Market concentration; Competitive intensity	CHINESE CONTRACTORS; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; FUTURE; FIRMS	Since the 21st century, the international engineering contracting industry has been developing rapidly. A growing number of contractors have entered the international market to engage in various business fields, leading to changing market structures and competition. As a result, international contractors face increasing difficulty in the selection of business areas and international markets to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. This paper aims to evaluate the market concentration and competition intensity of the international engineering contracting market based on the theory of organizational ecology. Using data about the top 50 enterprises that remained on a top 250/225 international construction contractor list from 2004 to 2016, this study proposes and calculates the market concentration index (MCI) and the competitive intensity (CI) of the international engineering contracting industry. Specifically, the MCI for the selected 50 enterprises overall and the 1,250 firm pairs formed by the 50 firms were calculated respectively to assess the concentration levels of the various firms. To assess the competitive intensity of the different business areas, the CI of nine business areas, including general buildings, manufacturing, power, water supply, sewer and waste, petroleum, transportation, hazardous wastes, and telecommunications, were calculated. Subsequently, to predict how the CI of the nine business areas change in the future, various time series models were employed and the potential development trend of the nine areas was obtained. This study provides a reference to understand the market competition of the international engineering contracting industry.

Existing studies have embraced a partnering strategy to integrate stakeholders' diverse expertise and need for better solutions to design. This study has quantitatively investigated the cause-effect relationships among partnering, design management, and project outcomes by developing and testing a conceptual model. With the support of data collected from Chinese construction companies as EPC contractors, this study reveals that contractors' design management should focus on four factors: planning and executing, resolving disputes, optimizing design, and promoting techniques . Path analysis confirms that partnering can not only significantly facilitate design management, thereby improving project outcomes, but also directly promote project performances and create long-term strategic benefits. Canonical correlation analysis further quantifies the different extents to which two groups of partnering critical success factors (CSFs) interact with four design management factors, together with their effects on five indicators of project outcomes. This research has important primary contributions to the body of knowledge by establishing interdisciplinary linkages among knowledge areas of partnering, design management and international project delivery, demonstrating the multiorganizational dynamics in delivering international EPC projects on a holistic view. Understanding the in-depth underlying causes to improve design management will be crucial for EPC contractors to optimally integrate all stakeholders' resources into designs by considering project lifecycle processes.

Design/methodology/approach - This research identified and refined 14 influencing factors through literature review and academic expert discussions. Questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data about the influencing factors and project cost performance. Then those factors were reduced to four components by factor analysis. Logistic regression analysis is used to investigate the relationship between four principal components and project cost performance. Findings - The results indicate that the significant influencing factors of project cost performance of DBB projects and DB projects are different. For DBB projects, owner abilities, such as owner team ability, owner experience, and owner finance, are important influencing factors causing cost overruns, while for DB projects cost performance is more sensitive to the contractor abilities, namely, contractor team ability, contractor finance, contractor experience, etc. Research limitations/implications - The results of the paper are mainly derived by quantitative research method based on the survey of 144 samples, so the results may need validation by qualitative studies. Further research could apply case study or interview to validate the findings in this research. In addition, project type and location are not considered as control variables due to the limited number of samples, future research could be conducted to investigate their relationship with project performance. Practical implications - The findings of this research not only help practitioners have a better understanding of the factors influencing project cost performance, but also provide some guidelines for practitioners to pay attention to different factors to better control the cost performance within different delivery systems. Originality/value - Owner ability and contractor ability are found to be of different importance in influencing cost performance of DBB and DB projects. This research extends previous research on cost management by considering different significant factors in influencing project cost performance within DBB and DB projects.

Determination of attractive projects and markets where the competitive advantage of a company is high requires extensive environmental scanning, forecasting, and learning from the experience of competitors in international markets. In this paper, a neuronet model has been developed as a decision support tool that can classify international projects with respect to attractiveness and competitiveness based on the experiences of Turkish contractors in overseas markets. The model can be used to guide decision makers on which type of data should be collected during international business development and further help them to prepare priority lists during strategic planning. Information derived from the model demonstrates that the most important factors that increase attractiveness of an international project are availability of funds, market volume, economic prosperity, contract type, and country risk rating. Similarly, level of competition, attitude of host government, existence of strict quality requirements, country risk rating, and cultural/religious similarities are the most important factors that affect competitiveness of Turkish contractors in international markets.

J	Gunduz, M; Al-Ajji, I				Gunduz, Murat; Al-Ajji, Ibrahim			Employment of CHAID and CRT decision tree algorithms to develop bid/no-bid decision-making models for contractors	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Decision tree; Project sustainability; CHAID; CRT; Construction industry; Project success factors; Construction project management; Risk management; Project planning	CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK	Purpose Bid/no-bid decision is a significant and strategic decision, which must be finalized at an early stage of the bidding process. Such decision-making may have significant impact on the performance of the contractors. Using Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) and Classification and Regression (CRT) decision tree algorithms, this paper aims to develop bid/no-bid models for design-bid-build projects for contractors. Design/methodology/approach The models in this study have been developed using CHAID and CRT algorithms. Thirty-four bid/no-bid key factors were collected via extensive research. The bid/no-bid factors were listed based on their importance index as a result of a questionnaire distributed among the construction professionals. These factors were divided into five main risk categories - owner, project, bidding situation, contract and contractor - which were taken as inputs for the models. Split-sample validation was applied for testing and measuring the accuracy of the CHAID and CRT models. Moreover, Spearman's rank correlation and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were employed to identify the statistical features of the received 169 responses. Findings The key bid/no-bid factors in construction industry were categorized in five related groups and ranked based on the relative importance index. It was found that the top 6 ranked bid/no-bid factors were (1) current workload, (2) need for work, (3) previous experience with employer; (4) timely payment by the employer; (5) availability of other projects for bidding (6) reputation of employer in the industry. Matrix comparison between all bid/no-bid groups was performed using Spearman's correlation to measure the relationship between each of the two paired groups. It was concluded that all the relationships were positive. Originality/value Existing bidding models require many inputs and advanced understanding of mathematics and software to run the model. Contractors tend to use easy, fast and available support methods. Excluding a great number of the bid/no-bid factors may affect the final decision. This paper proposes a bid/no-bid decision tree models for contractors of different sizes. It is the first study in the literature, to the best of authors' knowledge, to study bid/no-bid decision with the proposed decision tree algorithm. The proposed models in this study overcome the shortfalls of most previous models such as avoiding the complexity and difficulties of applying the concept. The proposed model will provide the contractors with a bid/no-bid decision based on the input for the defined bid factor groups. The proposed models display the soft spots and hot spots between the independent and dependent variables, which leads to a better decision. The proposed models display the result effectively in visual terms, easy to understand and easy to apply. The proposed models are a form of multiple effect (or variable) analysis which allows the companies to explain, describe, predict or classify an outcome.

Construction projects faces delays, cost overrun and quality defects due to avoidance of risk factors by contractors, clients and consultants. So the present study aims to investigate the risk factors that influence project objectives namely cost, quality and time of building construction projects in Pakistan from perspective of contractors, clients, and consultants. Risk factors were selected from literature survey and were finalized after consultation with construction experts. A questionnaire survey was prepared and various construction professionals were approached for feedback. Based on feedback of 164 experts, collected data was analysed statistically and were ranked based on relative importance index. As per the survey results, inadequate project management is the most critical factor effecting time performance of construction projects, rework due to error effect cost performance, and poor supervision effect quality of construction projects. Additionally, the study will help in planning and monitoring stages of the projects and shall improve the performance of construction industry of Pakistan.

J	Hassan, TM; McCaffer, R				Hassan, TM; McCaffer, R			Vision of the large scale engineering construction industry in Europe	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						large scale engineering; virtual enterprise; construction; information and communication technology; business processes		In recent years, the Large Scale Engineering (LSE) construction industry in Europe has seen profound change reflecting on the emerging political, economic, social and technological developments. Increasing competitive pressure globally, clients' demand for lower costs and better quality, coupled with new developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) and deregulation and privatisation of utilities, have all come together to force players in the LSE sector to review their traditional ways of undertaking business. This paper reports on findings from a project funded by the European Commission entitled European Large Scale Engineering Wide Integration Support Effort (eLSEwise) and presents business and ICT trends in the European LSE construction industry. The business relationship between Clients and contractors is changing with contractors role extending from delivering facilities to delivering complete business to clients. This led to a subsequent change in clients' and contractors requirements of the LSE ICT environment with more emphasis on information sharing and management. The paper also presents the vision developed by eLSEwise for future execution of LSE projects in a "virtual enterprise" environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

In other industries many previous studies employ support vector machine (SVM) or other Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods for corporate default prediction using the sample-matching method, which produces sample selection biases. In order to avoid the sample selection biases, this paper used all available firm-years samples during the sample period. Yet this brings a new challenge: the number of non-defaulted samples greatly exceeds the defaulted samples, which is referred to as between-class imbalance. Although the SVM algorithm is a powerful learning process, it cannot always be applied to data with extreme distribution characteristics. This paper proposes an enforced support vector machine-based model (ESVM model) for the default prediction in the construction industry, using all available firm-years data in our sample period to solve the between-class imbalance. The traditional logistic regression model is provided as a benchmark to evaluate the forecasting ability of the ESVM model. All financial variables related to the prediction of contractor default risk as well as 7 variables selected by the Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA) stepwise method are put in the models for comparison. The empirical results of this paper show that the ESVM model always outperforms the logistic regression model, and is more convenient to use because it is relatively independent of the selection of variables. Thus, we recommend the proposed ESVM model as an alternative to the traditionally used logistic model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tsai, L.

Hence, the review process requires the scheduler to be experienced both in field operations and in computer scheduling software. However, the dilemma faced by contractors is that many senior project managers are experienced in the field but not in computers, whereas many young engineers are skilled in computers but not in field operations. This work proposes a generalized framework to represent schedule knowledge, and a computer-based system that analyzes a project schedule and offers corrective advice on potential errors by integrating case-based and rule-based reasoning.

Subcontractor Evaluation and Management Framework for Strategic Partnering	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; CONSTRUCTION	Recently, main contractors have shifted their attitudes about subcontract procurement to more strategic and long-term partnering philosophies. The objective of this study was to present a framework for subcontractor evaluation and management to help main contractors develop more strategic and productive relationships with their subcontract partners. As the strategic performance feedback model, the balanced scorecard concept was adopted with modification. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the framework with subcontracting strategy, performance indexes, weighting, evaluation of subcontractor performance data, and feedback methods. The research results obtained can be useful as a guideline of subcontractor management for long-term partnering and also to enhance overall productivity within the construction supply chain.

J	Sparkling, AE; Dogra, P				Sparkling, Anthony E.; Dogra, Priyansh			Supervisors' Reliance on Tacit Knowledge and Barriers to Knowledge Sharing in the Electrical Contracting Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PLATFORM	The shortage of skills together with the knowledge loss due to employee retirements is compelling trade contractors to capture the know-how from retirees to prepare the future workforce. Compared to explicit knowledge, the tacit dimension is relatively unexplored in the construction industry. To capture tacit knowledge, it should be first identified in practice. This research posits an instrument to gauge the reliance of field supervisors on tacit knowledge and identifies barriers to knowledge sharing through case studies involving electrical contractors. Findings reveal that there is a significant relationship between the individual's experience and reliance on tacit knowledge, especially field supervisors with 20 years of work experience or more. It is also identified that field staff and management have contrasting opinions regarding the ranking of barriers to knowledge sharing. Management prioritized lack of formal processes as the key barrier to knowledge sharing at the site level, whereas for the field team it is the lack of socialization and encouragement. The proposed study will aid trade contractors to strengthen the existing knowledge-harnessing strategies by categorizing the supervisory knowledge into tacit and explicit, simultaneously identifying barriers to its sharing.

J	Hanna, A; Boodai, F; El Asmar, M				Hanna, Awad; Boodai, Fawaz; El Asmar, Mounir			State of Practice of Building Information Modeling in Mechanical and Electrical Construction Industries	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information models; Construction management; Mechanical construction; Electrical construction; Construction methods; Project planning and design		The North American construction industry has seen a decline in productivity for decades due to various reasons, including a lack of collaboration and the increase in the complexity of systems. These problems are most visible in labor-intensive trades, such as mechanical and electrical construction. Within the last decade, building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a potential solution to these problems. This paper attempts to highlight the state of practice of BIM in the mechanical and electrical industries. By analyzing responses from an extensive survey and interview process, this paper reaches three key conclusions, namely, (1)59% of mechanical and electrical contractors that use BIM have 3years or less of BIM experience; (2)contractors should use one to three BIM staff members and add 1-2% of total project-cost estimates to account for BIM implementation; and (3)more than 70% of mechanical and electrical contractors that have used BIM agree that BIM reduces field conflicts and improves coordination. These findings can help mechanical and electrical construction firms understand the evolving use of BIM and allocate resources appropriately.

However, it remains unclear how parties properly interact with each other to create greater value in their cooperative relationships. Based on the paradox theory, this study applied the construct of behavior tension to describe the tension between cooperative and competitive forms of behavior, a pair of two contradictory forces coexisting in owner-contractor partnerships. This study then explored the impact of behavior tension on value creation. Using data from 161 responses, the interactive effect of dependence asymmetry and behavior tension on value creation is examined. The data were analyzed using hierarchical regression. The results show an inverse U-shaped relationship between behavior tension and value creation in owner-contractor partnerships, implying that a balance between cooperation and competition, more than either behavior alone, is helpful in creating value. Meanwhile, dependence asymmetry weakens this inverse U-shaped relationship. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in project and engineering management by adding greater variance to partners' behavior (i.e., not just cooperation or competition), and by potentially enriching our understanding of how to rearrange interactive behavior among partners in facilitating value creation. Our findings reveal that, to create greater value for each other, engineering managers should change their cognition regarding cooperation and competition, and try to take advantage of the merits of these two opposing forces.

J	Cui, QB; Johnson, PW; Sharma, D; Bayraktar, ME				Cui, Qingbin; Johnson, Philip W.; Sharma, Deepak; Bayraktar, Mehmet Emre			Determinants of Industry Acceptance for Highway Warranty Contracts: Alabama Case Study	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							PERSPECTIVE; PROJECTS	There is an increasing demand from state DOTs to explore alternative ways to provide adequate oversight on construction projects. As one of the innovative contracting techniques encouraged by the Federal Highway Administration, warranties in highway construction hold contractors accountable for potential maintenance for a given period of time after project completion. The warranty practices in many states indicate that such provisions would benefit the state DOTs by improving quality, reducing life-cycle costs and project duration, and encouraging contractor innovation. However, the successful implementation of warranty contracting needs widespread industry acceptance and collaboration. This paper presents the findings of a recent research on the industry acceptance of warranty contracting in the state of Alabama. The paper identifies several major concerns and the needs of the construction industry with respect to the subject matter. More importantly, the paper reports a learning process in using warranties in highway construction. Results shows that factors like leniency in specifications, tort liability, and contractors' past experience on warranty jobs help achieve a significance level of industry acceptance. The findings presented in this paper would help those state highway agencies that have limited experience in integrating warranties effectively into their contracts.

J	Chen, P; Qiang, MS; Wang, JN				Chen, Ping; Qiang, Maoshan; Wang, Jia Ning			Project Management in the Chinese Construction Industry: Six-Case Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Originating from the West, project management was introduced into China after the country's economic reforms in the 1980's and has since spread quickly throughout the whole country, particularly in the construction industry. However, despite the wide adoption of project management practices by construction organizations and the growing recognition of the importance of project management as an enabler of organizational success, empirical studies on project management in the context of the Chinese construction industry have been inadequate. This paper presents the results of an empirical study of six Chinese construction organizations in order to come to a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of project management practices in the Chinese construction industry. The findings revealed: (1) a good appreciation of the role of projects and project management and satisfaction with current project management practices; (2) 11 key aspects of project management implementation; (3) 12 resultant value and benefits; and (4) five aspects of the main challenges facing the organizations. Meanwhile, variations in project management practices and the resultant organizational value were identified, first between the three owner- and the three contractor-case study organizations, then between the two construction contractor organizations and the one design contractor organization.

In return for the investments made into the energy-saving measures, the energy service contractors would share with the building owners the energy cost saving. Although the contractual arrangement is meant to create a win-win situation, disappointments could arise due to mismatches between the expected and actual outcomes. From a micro-economics viewpoint, the key factors contributing to the failure of a building energy performance contract are reviewed. To solve the commonly encountered problems in building energy performance contracting, it is proposed the conventional performance contract is replaced with a partnership formed jointly by the building owner and the energy service contractor, with the latter assuming the role of the performance contractor. This would unite the goals of the two parties and cultivate genuine cooperation between them. The key features for this new contractual arrangement are described along with how this arrangement could resolve typical energy performance contracting problems.

J	Smith, HF				Smith, HF			Bucking the trend: Cost-plus services in lump-sum turnkey market	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Engineering, procurement, construction, and startup of cogeneration plants in the United States has evolved into a set pattern of lump-sum turnkey performance by engineering contractors and major equipment vendors. This method of designing, constructing, and starting up cogeneration plants has been driven by the requirements of project financing and long-term, nonrecourse funding. Design and construction of plants in Canada, though, has tended to be performed on a cost-plus basis, despite pressures from its southern neighbor. This paper reviews the results from the cost-plus contracting of three of Canada's first cogeneration plants. It also examines the contracting strategy used by the nonregulated division of a major Canadian electrical utility to acquire engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) and startup (SU) services for two subsequent cogeneration plants-one in Ontario and one in Quebec-both on a reimbursable-cost basis. It explains why this owner felt the ''cost-plus'' approach was most cost effective (despite considerable ''lump sum'' pressure); discusses the controls that were implemented during the bidding and contractor interviewing stages to harness potential ''cost-plus'' engineering mentalities; and reveals some of the results from contractor proposals and interviews.

A three-step process provides the basis for Measuring the potential benefits of increased best practice use. First, a practice use index is derived to model the way in which best practices are utilized oil actual projects, The index combines data from eight best practices to create a single measure of practice utilization. Second, a project performance index, combining cost, in schedule metrics, is derived as an indicator of overall project performance. Third, the practice use index is correlated with cost, schedule. and overall project performance metrics. Both owners and contractors benefit from increased practice use. Potential cost savings for owners range from $1.7 to $3.4 million, depending on industry group and project size. Potential cost savings for contractors are higher, averaging $7.2 million for the typical $88 million heavy industrial project. Benefits from schedule reductions ire most apparent for owners. On large building projects, schedule reductions for owners average 27 weeks. Finally, improvements in overall project performance oil the order of 30% are observed for both owners and contractors.

J	Doloi, H				Doloi, Hemanta			Cost Overruns and Failure in Project Management: Understanding the Roles of Key Stakeholders in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cost overrun; Cost estimation; Cost performance; Project management	CLIENTS; DESIGN; BUILD	The subject of poor cost performance has been widely published in the mainstream project and construction management literature. Nevertheless, the underlying responsibilities of the key stakeholders (clients, consultants, and contractors) in managing this chronic problem in the Australian construction industry remain unclear. By performing an in-depth analysis of the roles and responsibilities of these key stakeholders, this research is intended to unfold the industrywide perception of cost performance being heavily reliant on the contractor's performance alone. Based on a thorough literature review and relevant industry inputs, 73 attributes associated with cost performance were identified for investigation. Based on the relative importance weighing technique on 48 selected attributes, planning and scheduling deficiencies have the highest impact on cost performance from clients, consultants, and contractors' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analysis on the combined responses across all three groups suggests that robust control procedures and adequate programming, along with efficient design and effective site management, are the most critical factors. These factors are primarily associated with the responsibilities of contractors and consultants for managing cost overruns in projects. However, the client's responsibility in facilitating effective management of these factors within the project environment is crucial. Multivariate regression analysis performed on eight factors' scores highlighted the influence of five significant factors (p < 5%) on managing cost overruns. The findings are expected to abridge a significant knowledge gap by shifting the priorities in cost estimation and management practices across all industry sectors.

Effective safety management not only reduces contractors' incident rates and compensation costs, it also enhances productivity and efficiency in project execution. In addition, better safety performance increases contractors' competitive advantage in the market by providing better values to their clients. This paper presents a case study of an on-site safety management program launched by a general contractor (GC). The initial findings, based on quantitative measurement of incident rates and safety violations, are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Overall, the program is effective in reducing jobsite accidents/incidents and safety violations in the GC's organization while having less effect on subcontractors' safety performance. This research also finds no linear relationship between incident rates and safety violation rates, indicating that these two measurements are uncorrelated and that both of them need to be used in evaluating jobsite safety performance and the effectiveness of a safety program.

J	Kim, DY; Han, SH; Kim, H				Kim, Du Y.; Han, Seung H.; Kim, Hyoungkwan			Discriminant analysis for predicting ranges of cost variance in international construction projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RISK-MANAGEMENT; POLITICAL RISKS; JOINT VENTURES; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION; ACCURACY; OVERSEAS; FAILURE; CURVES; PROFIT	Unanticipated market conditions as well as project-related risks can easily lead to cost overruns in international construction projects. For a contractor to be financially successful in international projects, a careful examination of the project is a prerequisite to understanding the cost variance characteristics. Based on the reasonably accurate characterization of the cost performance, the markup or contingency amount is determined to ensure both a decent level of profit and a good chance of winning the contract. This paper presents a classification model to categorize international construction projects, particularly faced by Korean contractors, into five cost-variation classes: extreme cost overrun, moderate cost overrun, neutral, moderate cost saving, and extreme cost saving. The model is able to characterize an international project for its cost performance prediction in comparison to the contractor's initial cost estimate. A linear discriminant analysis is utilized to develop the predictive classification model with the support of the bootstrap method. Tests show that the proposed model is able to help cost estimators determine a proper level of cost contingency before bidding on an international project.

J	Wu, ML; Lo, HP				Wu, Ming-Lu; Lo, Hing-Po			Optimal Strategy Modeling for Price-Time Biparameter Construction Bidding	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONTRACTS	In the price-time biparameter construction bidding system, each contractor submits a bid price and construction time to complete the project, which are then aggregated to a total combined bid (TCB) by the client, and the contractor with the lowest TCB is awarded the project. Since bid price can be set as construction cost plus an appropriate markup and construction cost usually depends on construction time, TCB can be expressed as a function of time. By minimizing such a TCB function, the optimal construction time can be obtained, from which the optimal construction cost and bid price and hence the optimal price-time bidding strategy can be sequentially decided. While examining the whole optimal bidding process, this paper focuses on three aspects to enhance the key ideas: discussing the properties of the general and the quadratic time-cost functions, deducing the optimal bidding formulas with quadratic time-cost relationship, and illustrating the procedures for estimating the quadratic time-cost function using a few experience data and the linear regression method. The in-depth examination of the price-time biparameter bidding model in the paper can suggest ideas and methodologies to construction bidding or contractor selection with more criteria.

Exploration of Team Integration in Spanish Multifamily Residential Building Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building residential; Integration; Owner; Spain; Success	PROJECT DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; SECTOR DESIGN-BUILD; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; MODEL	Project delivery team integration generally involves early involvement of general contractors and key specialty contractors in the design process. Team integration has been found to improve an owner's probability of success. However, during difficult economic times, owners can forego early team involvement and move toward low bid procurement to take advantage of competitive markets. This study explores the performance of integrated teams in the Spanish multifamily building construction market in light of the 2007 financial crisis. After conducting structured interviews of 31 residential building projects with the owner and main contractor of each one of them, this study identified eight projects for in-depth case studies. These eight case studies represented the best performing, worst performing, and atypical cases. The results show that Spanish building owners experience higher success by developing integrated teams. This integration begins with how the owner organizes the team for success (i.e.,integrated builder services, qualifications-based procurement, and prior experience) and promotes integration throughout the project process (i.e.,timeliness of communications, shared commitment to goals, and development of team chemistry).

Mark			Effects of CM/GC Project Delivery on Managing Process Risk in Transportation Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project delivery; Risk management; Construction management; Project management; Contract management; Design; build; Contracting		Teams that deliver complex transportation construction projects need tools that manage risk and allow for successful delivery. Construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) project delivery is an alternative method that furnishes public agencies with an attractive option for delivering projects in a less adversarial and more constructive manner by involving the contractor during the design phase. This paper identifies the effects of CM/GC delivery on construction process risk. Owners, contractors, and design engineers with sizable CM/GC experience on transportation-related projects were surveyed to identify differences in the perception of CM/GC processes, especially compared to design-build and design-bid-build project delivery methods. The perceived benefits and disadvantages regarding quality, schedule, cost control, and collaboration/flexibility are discussed. The benefits include strategies for robust process risk management and successful project delivery, while the disadvantages expose barriers of implementation that must be overcome. Ultimately, this research identifies differences in how project teams value CM/GC processes with regard to minimizing construction process risk, thus enabling teams to more effectively facilitate unity and strengthen the CM/GC process.

Due to unexpected contingencies, renegotiations have been common in PPP projects and significantly influenced efficiencies. In the renegotiation game, the private contractor has to decide whether to initiate a renegotiation or not, while the government has to decide whether to accept a renegotiation or not. The criteria for each to make such decisions are private, which causes information asymmetry. This study proposes a game theoretical model to study the influence of information asymmetry on the decision making of renegotiations in PPP projects. It is shown that the renegotiation decision making considering information asymmetry is a Bayesian game, and thus Bayesian Nash equilibrium is applied for solutions. This study provides the decision-making rules for renegotiations, identifies the opportunistic behaviors of players, and improves the renegotiation game through eliminating information asymmetry. The results show that (1)the private contractor can achieve the best outcome by sharing its private information with the government, (2)the government is willing to share its private information with the private contractor only if it has been informed of the private contractor's private information, and (3)the sharing of the government's private information will not increase the payoffs of either player. Different from previous studies, the proposed model in this study for the first time takes into consideration the information asymmetry in renegotiations of PPPs, thus contributing to the body of knowledge. In addition, the findings of this study help enhance the decision making of renegotiations, thereby contributing to practice.

A Qualitative Data Analysis for Supplier Quality-Management Practices for Engineer-Procure-Construct Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supplier quality management (SQM); Rework; Construction supply chain; Supplier quality (SQ) process map; Qualitative data analysis; Grounded theory; Contracting		The process of assuring the procured and fabricated materials for an engineer-procure-construct (EPC) project are within their quality requirements is challenging because nearly every EPC construction project is complex and distinctive from previous projects in terms of its size, supply chain, and materials usage. In particular, EPC projects include contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers who collaboratively perform the engineering design for the project, procure the required materials and equipment, and then construct. Many (or most) construction organizations, representing owners and contractors, place high importance on documenting and tracking the quality performance of their suppliers as part of their sup plier quality management (SQM) to ensure that procured and fabricated materials are within the quality specifications. However, these organizations still face problems with their SQM, evidenced by the large number of rework tasks and replacement efforts for the supplied materials in the EPC projects. This highlights the importance of investigating the current supplier quality practices to explore effective practices to deliver products with the expected quality and zero rework. In this paper, six structured interviews were conducted with contractors, and 92 SQM documents including procedures and reports from 21 owners and contractors in the EPC industry were analyzed to identify the current practices used by these organizations with regard to SQM, and the most effective practices that construction engineering managers could borrow to improve the existing SQM in the EPC projects. The contribution of this research can be used by stakeholders in the construction industry to improve SQM within their organizations. Researchers can also benefit from this research to better understand SQM practices within the construction industry. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Okonkwo, PN; Wium, J				Okonkwo, Patrick Nwabueze; Wium, Jan			Health and Safety Management Systems within Construction Contractor Organizations: Case Study of South Africa	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; LEADING INDICATORS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CULTURE; CLIMATE; MODEL	The study reported in this paper investigated health and safety management systems (HSMS) found within medium to large construction contractor organizations in South Africa. The aim of the study was to identify the nuances associated with the dominant health and safety management systems within these organizations and to categorize them into types. A qualitative descriptive research methodology was adopted, and data was collected through semistructured interviews involving safety managers, health and safety (H&S) advisors at employers' associations, and consulting firms. An analysis of the data revealed that the broad spectrum of health and safety management systems within contractor organizations in South Africa can be categorized into three distinct types. Defining features of the three HSMS types across three thematic areas were distilled. The position of the health and safety professional, legislative requirements, supply chain demands, and subcontracting practices of the organization are identified as factors that shape each HSMS type to varying degrees. The categorization and characterization outcomes of this study enables a subsequent objective evaluation of effectiveness and provide explanations for successes and failures of construction HSMS.

The bidding process is the main determinant of whether a contractor is commissioned to complete a construction project. Therefore, contractors must rapidly and precisely estimate construction costs and the bid award amount. This study involved optimizing artificial intelligence models to forecast bid award amounts for bridge construction projects. A genetic algorithm is used in several forecasting models, including models based on multiple regression analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and case-based reasoning (OR). Data for public bridge construction projects were collected from the Taiwan government e-procurement system. The cross-validation results show that the mathematical model for the ANNs provides more reliable simulations and has a superior fit compared with the regression methods, CBR, and the conventional approach. This study provides an optimization process for estimating project award prices that improves construction and evaluations of Al-based models as well as an auxiliary tool that contractors can use to make bidding decisions.

J	Arditi, D; Ongkasuwan, D				Arditi, David; Ongkasuwan, Dumrong		ASCE Construction Inst	Duties and Responsibilities of Construction Managers: Perceptions of Parties Involved in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper reports the findings of a study conducted by researchers at Illinois Institute of Technology under the direction and supervision of the ASCE Committee on Management Practices in Construction to investigate the expectations of the parties involved in the construction process, including designers, owners, general contractors, subcontractors, construction managers, and educators, relative to construction managers' duties. The findings suggest that while there is some consensus among parties to a construction project relative to CM duties particularly in the construction phase, there is also some disagreement, most of which appear to be between contractors and designers. Most disagreements are related to CM duties performed in the bidding and postconstruction phases of projects.

Radio frequency identification involves the use of tags, or transponders, that collect data and manage it in a portable, changeable database; communicate routing instructions and other control requirements to equipment; and can withstand harsh environments. A construction industry-RFID supplier workshop was held to disseminate information about this technology and to generate suitable application ideas for the industry. With the information gathered during the workshop, one application idea was selected and pilot tests conducted to learn more about R-FID and its applicability to the material procurement process on a construction site. The pilot tests showed that RFID tags reduced the time required to download data into a company's material tracking system and could "flag" an item so an entry was not repeated. When scanning the tags, sun glare was not a problem as compared to using bar code labels. Although further analysis is necessary, RFID did show promise of being a beneficial technology as it relates to the materials receiving process. A flowchart is provided to assist contractors and owners in selecting the appropriate RFID system.

J	Rachid, Z; Toufik, B; Mohammed, B				Rachid, Zemra; Toufik, Boudouh; Mohammed, Baheddi			Causes of schedule delays in construction projects in Algeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction projects; Algeria; risk management; delay causes; relative importance index		The construction industry is a major sector in the economy of developing countries. During the last two decades in Algeria, many large-scale construction projects have been launched to develop the basic infrastructure facilities of the country. However, most of these projects experience extensive delays. The objective of this paper is to identify the causes of delay in the Algerian construction industry and assess their importance according to the main project stakeholders, which are the owner, the contractor and the consultant. Data were collected through a questionnaire and direct interviews of a sample of construction experts including 16 owners, 16 contractors and 20 consultants. Fifty-nine causes of delay were identified in this research. The results indicate that the five most important causes are slow change orders, unrealistic contract duration, slow variation orders in extra quantities, delays in payment of performed work and ineffective planning and scheduling by contractors. The study revealed that owner-related causes are the most important sources of delay. The findings of this research can be used to guide the improvements of the construction industry in Algeria.

Permanent versus Mobile Entry Decisions in International Construction Markets: Influence of Home Country- and Firm-Related Factors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						International business; Marketing strategy; International construction; Market entry; Market entry mode	TRANSACTION-COST-ANALYSIS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; JOINT VENTURES; MODE CHOICE; OWNERSHIP; ALLIANCES; INTERNALIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	When entering a selected foreign market, the contractor must decide between permanent entry mode and mobile entry mode. By following theories and previous studies in international business, hypotheses were developed regarding the influences of several firm-and home country-related factors upon the selection between the two generic entry modes. These factors include home market attractiveness, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, firm size, and multinational experience. A binary logistic regression analysis was then performed, with results supporting most of the hypotheses. With other conditions held constant, contractors do not tend to determine entry mode under the influence of their long-term orientation but are more likely to use permanent entry than mobile entry when home market size is insignificant and uncertainty avoidance, firm size, or multinational experience is significant. The interaction effects of entry restriction by other factors were also explored. The findings can aid contractors when selecting or evaluating their entry modes for overseas construction markets.

J	Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Ho, PKM				Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Ho, PKM			Contractor as trust initiator in construction partnering - Prisoner's dilemma perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Partnering has been advocated for use in construction as a project-delivery approach to curb dispute and enable a cooperative contracting environment. Successful construction partnering is perceived to derive benefits to both developers and contractors. In view of significant implications to successful project delivery, there has been a surge of research and studies on construction partnering. These studies typically focus on the partnering process as well as the identification of critical success factors. Among the various success factors that underpin partnering success, establishing trust among partners is considered the most important. Moreover, skeptics have been swift to point out that establishing trust in construction is daunting. A better understanding of the role of trust and its manifestation in partnering efforts is therefore of both academic and practical value. In this study, motivating trust in construction partnering is described within the classic framework of "the prisoner's dilemma," which suggests the trust cycle can be kick-started if construction partners put cooperation before competition and self-interest. This paper reports a study that is designed to suggest a suitable candidate for the trust initiator. As such, the critical trust factors for two groups of construction partners in Hong Kong-developers/consultants and contractors-are first identified. It is found that "performance" and "permeability" of partners are the two most critical trust factors. "Performance" describes the partner's competence and problem-solving ability as perceived by their counterpart. "Permeability" reflects the partner's openness in sharing information. The result of a multiple-regression analysis further suggests that the contractor is in a position to initiate trust through competent performance and maintaining effective communication with the client. In this manner, the trust cycle can expand with reciprocal trustworthiness from the client.

Design/methodology/approach This study used a project management maturity approach to develop a measurement model of PCS success. The key elements in this model have been identified using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method to analyze data from a case study involving contractor companies in Saudi's petroleum and chemical industry. Findings The results identified six critical elements for PCS success: (1) Change Management, (2) Earned Value, (3) Baselined Plan, (4) Resource Loaded, (5) Progress Method and (6) Governance Program. In addition, Project Forecasting and Corrective Action Verification were identified as the main areas where clients and contractors need to focus for the effective deployment of a PCS. Practical implications The results of this study were used to create a PCS Maturity Model (PCSMM) and a PCS Success Index (PCSSI). The value of this index can help project managers to identify the maturity level of their PCS and improvement areas that lead to enhanced project performance. Originality/value This research presents an alternative maturity model for PCS assessment that provides a practical tool to identify areas for improving the critical elements of PCS success. The study draws a clear distinction between overall project success and the success of the PCS.

J	Shahsavand, P; Marefat, A; Parchamijalal, M				Shahsavand, Parvaneh; Marefat, Akbar; Parchamijalal, Majid			Causes of delays in construction industry and comparative delay analysis techniques with SCL protocol	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Project management; Methodology	PROJECTS; VARIANCE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reveal the main causes of delays in the projects are from the client (relative importance index (RII) = 0.716), labor and equipment (RII = 0.701) and contractor (RII = 0.698). Hence determining the contractual responsibility of delay is the most likely source of dispute in construction projects and many techniques have been used in the courts to demonstrate the criticalities of a delay event on the project schedule. Therefore, authors try to investigate all process-based techniques of delay claims and evaluated and conformed them with principles by Society of Construction Law (SCL) protocol and Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACEI) in order to choose the best techniques based on the specific circumstances of each project. Design/methodology/approach - This section is divided into two distinct parts: refers to the methods used to assess the perceptions of clients, consultants, and contractors on the relative importance of causes of delay in construction industry; and refers to advantages and disadvantages of various techniques used to analyze delays and their conform with SCL protocol. A questionnaire was developed to assess the perceptions of clients, consultants, and contractors on the relative importance of causes of delay in Iranian construction industry. The respondents were asked to indicate their response category on 78 well-recognized construction delay factors identified by authors. Findings - In total, 78 causes of delay were identified through research. The identified causes are combined into seven groups. The field survey included 58 contractors, 55 consultants, and 62 client. Data collected were analyzed by RII and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The authors identified main causes of delay and ten most important causes, according to Table AII, from the perspective of three major groups of participants (clients, consultants and contractors). The ranking of categories of causes of delay, according to Table I, were: client-related causes (RII = 0.716); labor and equipment category causes (RII = 0.701); contractor-related causes (RII = 0.698); material-related causes (RII = 0.690); design-related causes (RII = 0.666); external causes (RII = 0.662); and consultant-related causes (RII = 0.662). But according to the discussions and given that determining the contractual responsibility of delay is the most likely source of dispute in construction industry and many techniques have been used in the courts to demonstrate the criticalities of a delay event on the project schedule. Originality/value - All process-based techniques of delay analysis have been present in this paper and categorized in 11 groups. In order to understand the advantages and disadvantages of them by clients, contractor and consultant, a thorough review conducted to reveal the nature of techniques. In the next step, given that selecting the most appropriate technique based on constraints and specific conditions of each project is one of the most important steps to carry out a successful delay analysis. The authors conformed, all process-based techniques of delay analysis, by SCL protocol and AACEI principles. Finally, the result of this match was brought in order to choose the best technique based on the specific circumstances of each project.

J	Hanna, AS; Camlic, R; Peterson, PA; Lee, MJ				Hanna, AS; Camlic, R; Peterson, PA; Lee, MJ			Cumulative effect of project changes for electrical and mechanical construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LABOR EFFICIENCY; CHANGE ORDERS; IMPACT	Change is inevitable on construction projects, primarily because of the uniqueness of each project and the limited resources of time and money that can be spent on planning, executing, and delivering the project. Change clauses, which authorize the owner to alter work performed by the contractor, are included in most construction contracts and provide a mechanism for equitable adjustment to the contract price and duration. Even so, owners and contractors do not always agree on the adjusted contract price or the time it will take to incorporate the change. What is needed is a method to quantify the impact that the adjustments required by the change will have on the changed and unchanged work. Owners and our legal system recognize that contractors have a right to an adjustment in contract price for owner changes, including the cost associated with materials, labor, lost profit, and increased overhead due to changes. However, the actions of a contractor can impact a project just as easily as those of an owner. A more complex issue is that of determining the cumulative impact that single or multiple change orders may have over the life of a project. This paper presents a method to quantify the cumulative impact on labor productivity for mechanical and electrical construction resulting from changes in the project. Statistical hypothesis testing and correlation analysis were made to identify factors that affect productivity loss resulting from change orders. A multiple regression model was developed to estimate the cumulative impact of change orders. The model includes six significant factors, namely: Percent change, change order processing time, overmanning, percentage of time the project manager spent on the project, percentage of the changes initiated by the owner, and whether the contractor tracks productivity or not. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the model to study the impact of one factor on the productivity loss (%delta). The model can be used proactively to determine the impacts that management decisions will have on the overall project productivity. They may also be used at the conclusion of the project as a dispute resolution tool. It should be noted that every project is unique, so these tools need to be applied with caution.

The results are a good resource in managing the relationship between trust and control in the construction industry in China, and formulating a good working relationship with contractors. Design/methodology/approach - Using a set of questionnaire, data were collected from project managers of the clients, who are responsible for the overall project management and have face-to-face interaction with the contractors. The data were analyzed by structural equation modeling to identify the effects of initial trust on control for the contractors. Findings - Trust is examined in the construction industry in China through calculative and relational trust. Their effects are examined on three modes of inter-organizational control: outcome control, behavior control and social control. The results show that the calculative trust has strong effects on outcome-based and behavior control, while the relational trust, on social control. Research limitations/implications - First, the conclusion of this research is based on the construction industry in China. It may not be suitable for other industries or other countries. Second, there may be other factors that influence the relationship between trust and control, such as the characteristics of the client and organizational culture, which are not taken into consideration in this research. Practical implications - The effects of initial trust on control have been testified in the study. For the client, it is wise to take suitable control measures to face with the contractors with the consideration of initial trust. The contractors would apply the rule in the relationship between initial trust and control, and set up good relationship with the client. Originality/value - This research has certain originality and value in theory and practice. First, this research analyzes the relationship between trust and control in a dynamical way, which has innovative significance to some extent. Second, research on inter-organization supplies a new perspective about project control. Finally, this research would offer a perspective to improve the present situation of the construction industry in China. If the clients use the trust and control measures appropriately, the harmonious relation can be achieved and projects performance can be improved.

Empirical Assessment of Internationalization Strategies for Small and Medium Construction Companies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internationalization; Small and medium construction companies; Entry mode; Evolutionary paths; Foreign experience; Cultural effects	JOINT VENTURES; ENTRY MODE; FOREIGN ENTRY; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; TRANSACTION; SURVIVAL; CULTURE; CHOICE; COST	In the wake of increased globalization, more small and medium construction companies (SMCCs) are expanding into the global market. However, the international construction industry is different from the domestic with respect to resource, regulations, culture, entry strategies, and risk levels among other factors. This paper explores various ways and modes of internationalization for SMCCs under 13 key hypotheses that are relevant to the issues of internationalization from the perspective of SMCCs. To verify these hypotheses, this study used actual data from 560 cases of SMCCs' overseas projects performed between 1990 and 2007. It was found that SMCCs' entry scheme as prime contractors was more rewarding than in the case of subcontractors. Moreover, SMCCs are likely to evolve from subcontractors engaged with home-country contractors to subcontractors engaged with foreign contractors. Also, cultural distance is positively related to performance, but the effects of cultural properties are not as strong compared to the international manufacturing industry. The results are expected to help SMCCs build internationalization strategies by determining promising entry modes, proposing possible evolutionary paths to enter overseas projects, and assessing cultural effects in reference to SMCCs' successful performance.

J	Seneviratne, K; Michael, GV				Seneviratne, Krisanthi; Michael, Gladstan Vimal			Disputes in time bar provisions for contractors' claims in standard form of contracts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Claims; disputes; FIDIC; time bar provisions; UAE		The time bar clause facilitates informing the Engineer (Contract Administrator) in a timely manner of the occurrence of events that may result in delayed completion and/or incur additional costs. Such notices allow parties to mitigate any potential impacts in terms of time and/or cost. Nevertheless, the time bar clause forfeits a contractor's claim, if the notice of claim is not submitted within the stipulated time in the contract, giving rise to numerous disputes. The purpose of this study is to identify the disputes surrounding the time bar clause in the FIDIC 1999 Red Book, which is an internationally used Standard Form of Contract (SFoC) for building and engineering works designed by the employer. After identifying the sources of disputes and modifications to the standard provisions via a comprehensive literature review, the researchers conducted an online questionnaire survey with 61 construction contract professionals (employers, contract consultants and contractors) and semi-structured interviews with four contract specialists to determine the level of agreement with the identified sources of disputes and modifications to standard provisions. Sources of disputes and modifications were ranked based on the Relative Agreement Index (RAI) from the survey. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed to identify agreement/disagreement and the reasons for the agreement/disagreement.

J	van der Meer, J; Hartmann, A; van der Horst, A; Dewulf, G				van der Meer, Jeroen; Hartmann, Andreas; van der Horst, Aad; Dewulf, Geert			Multi-criteria decision analysis and quality of design decisions in infrastructure tenders: a contractor's perspective	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Decision quality; trade-off; decision-making; infrastructure tender; multi-criteria decision analysis	MAKING METHODS; METHODOLOGY; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; JUDGMENT; SYSTEM	Design decision-making in infrastructure tenders is a challenging task for contractors due to limited time and resources. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) promises to support contractors in dealing with this challenge. However, the ability of MCDA to ensure decision quality in the specific context of infrastructure tenders has gained little attention. By undertaking a longitudinal case study on early design decisions in a tender for a design-build project in the Netherlands the relationship between MCDA and decision quality is investigated. The case results show that in the early tender phase the decision making very much relies on the experience and knowledge of engineers. If MCDA is inappropriately used in such a context it can create impressions of soundly underpinned evaluations of design options while neglecting uncertainties and leading to low-quality decision. Although MCDA defines the "what" is required for structuring the decision problem, it does not support decision-makers in the "how" to do it. The explicit consideration of decision quality elements in MCDA can support the "how" and can create awareness for decision makers concerning importance, scope and uncertainty of criteria.

A review of the literature identifies major problems in relation to the fairness and equality of the risk allocation process. However, most existing studies have been conducted from the client's perspective rather than that of contractors or consultants and do not focus specifically on risk misallocation. This paper aims at determining the factors involved by a questionnaire survey of the perceptions of contractors and consultants of the main issues in relation to medium to large commercial construction projects in South East Queensland, Australia. The findings are generally consistent with existing research results in that approximately half the respondents feel that their contractual risk allocation is unfair. In addition, there is a lack of use of formal risk management methods, and the arbitrary passing down of risks from the client has increased in recent years. A better understanding is provided of the issues contributing to unequal risk allocation, decision-making and management that will help promote fairness and equality between the contractual parties in the current process of risk management.

J	Jagtap, M; Kamble, S				Jagtap, Milind; Kamble, Sachin			An empirical assessment of relational contracting model for supply chain of construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Performance; Commitment; Integration; Competency; Construction supply chain	POWER REGIMES; TRUST; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; PROCUREMENT; IMPACT; RISK; COMMITMENT; MECHANISMS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how the client-contractor relationship affects the project performance in light the theory of relational contracting. The empirical study evaluates the effect of project trust (PT) mediating through the dyadic factors and procurement-specific factors (PSFs) on the project performance. Design/methodology/approach Research design is carried out in three phases. The first phase of review of literature has identified the key constructs of the study and the conceptual model is formulated. Subsequently, the constructs of the study are validated through expert opinion and pilot study. In the third phase, the questionnaire of the study is administered on 320 samples in various cities of India. The exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis is carried out on the two different sample sizes. The structural equation model is finally tested with satisfactory fit. Findings PT not only improves the dyad factors in construction supply chain (CSC), but also influences the project performance. However, project risk and relationship commitment are not associated with enhancing project performance directly. PSFs and dyad factors are the two mediators in transforming PT into relationship commitment and project performance. Client-led supply chain initiatives and contractor-led supply chain initiatives differ in the CSC. Research limitations/implications The present research has employed behavioral data to understand the effect of project procurement on project performance. Nevertheless, future studies should use objective data to support the constructs of the study. This study outlines the common and socially rooted relational governance of the project. This study is useful to the clients, contractors and policy makers in understanding the interplay of various control mechanisms to ease the procurement of large and complex construction projects. Future studies should focus on separating client-led control mechanisms and contractor-led control mechanisms of the relational contracting and its effect on project performance. Originality/value The research study contributes in formalizing the governance structure of supply chain in dealing with the complex construction projects. The study has contributed in understanding the client-led initiatives and contractor-led supply initiatives of establishing the supply chain of construction projects. It has demonstrated the mediating role of dyadic factors and PSFs in improving the project performance.

Design/methodology/approach Four explanatory factors were identified for the implementation of CSP in international projects based on literature review. A questionnaire survey was then conducted among Chinese organizations that have been involved in international projects. In total, 121 valid responses were received from the questionnaire survey and were modeled using logistic regression to examine the impact of each factor on the observed event of interest. Findings The factors related to the effectiveness of implementing CSP, including "attitudes toward safety management measures (ASMM)," "operational mechanism for safety regulations (OM)," "safety knowledge management system (SKMS)" and "systematic safety training scheme (STS)," were selected. The results revealed that OM and SKMS were significant predictors (p < 0.05) of the odds of implementation satisfaction of CSP, but ASMM and STS were not. The probability of satisfactory CSP implementation increased as the value of SKMS increased, whereas the probability of unsatisfactory implementation improved as the value of OM increased. Research limitations/implications The questionnaire was distributed to respondents in international contractors headquartered in China. Other types of international organizations can be covered in future research. Furthermore, other factors, such as the local construction environment, should be considered in future studies. Practical implications The results provide new insights on CSP implementation overseas. Effective implementation of CSP contributes to the improvement of the safety performance of contractors. The practical significance of interpreting the influence factors is that the contractors can implement more efficient and targeted approaches and tools in the execution of their CSP. The impact of OM reminds safety managers of the synchronization of CSP as well as its implementation environment and characteristics. The effect of ASMM encourages contractors to adopt Web-based and digital knowledge management systems to improve the implementation efficiency of CSP. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in the selection of factors and their impacts on CSP implementation in international projects. This study has also extended knowledge on normative safety in international projects based on quantitative modeling.

Rank ordering, correlations and exploratory factor analysis of the data confirm that cost is of primary consideration for UK contractors, However, quality is assuming an increasingly important role in the decision making process. A 'Quality Factor Group' is discussed as being the most significant underlying factor having a fundamental impact on the construction method chosen. This, based on the achievements of Japanese and American construction firms, could result in reduced costs and higher productivity in the future.

Market Structure and Organizational Performance of Construction Organizations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction market structure; Organizational performance; Market diversification; ENR top 400 contractors; ENR top 500 design firms	SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY; ENTROPY MEASURE; POWER LAWS; FIRMS; SELECTION; EVOLUTION; PROFITABILITY; GROWTH	The structure of a market can be described by how the market is composed of firms of different sizes and how these firms are diversified into different subsectors. In construction, few empirical studies exist on organizational performance at the industry level considering market structure. This paper presents a study investigating the market structure of the construction industry and the organizational performance of large contractors and design firms, focusing on size, growth rate, business stability, and market diversification. The study performs an empirical analysis using publicly available U.S. construction industry data. Four hypotheses were tested to determine relationships among strategic management issues and organizational performance. The study identifies particular patterns and similarities and differences in market structure between contractors and design firms and provides a new finding on market diversification-the existence of certain thresholds at which a firm's diversification level significantly changes as the firm grows. An analysis on organizational performance concludes that firm growth is independent of firm size, whereas market diversification contributes to a firm's business stability but not significantly to firm growth.

However, international construction projects in Central Asia present significant political risks. A total of 20 political risk factors were identified through a critical literature review and consolidated by pilot studies with 10 international project managers. Appraisals of these 20 factors from relevant professionals were collected using questionnaires, 127 of which were collected. Next, a political risk assessment model consisting of six components was established by confirmatory factor analysis. Based on data from various secondary sources, the political risk index (PRI) of five Central Asian countries was assessed, and their risk grades were measured using Ward's method. The results indicate obvious opportunities and political risks in the Central Asian market. Choosing appropriate strategies enables international contractors to seize these opportunities and mitigate these risks. Because few studies have investigated political risk in Central Asia, this study is a useful reference for managing the political risks for international contractors when expanding into this emerging market.

It is important to both the contractor and the contracting agency to examine the amount of pay that the contractor call expect to receive for a given level Of construction quality. Previous studies have shown that computer simulations call provide a better, more detailed examination of the pay schedule than is possible by simply determining the expected pay. In particular, the simulation process can provide an indication of the variability of pay at various quality levels and can identify the factors most responsible for pay adjustments. Stochastic simulation models are very useful in estimating and analyzing payment risk in highway pavement construction. However, such models are constrained by their computational requirements, and it is often necessary to Couple them with simpler models to speed LIP the process of decision-making, This paper investigates the use of Neural Networks (NN) to build surrogate models for a pavement construction payment-risk prediction model. The results show that although the average error associated with the NN predictions are acceptable; in some particular cases the errors may be unacceptably high.

However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms through which multilevel (i.e., organizational, group, and individual) factors collectively influence GSC as promoted by general contractors in construction. A model is proposed to examine the interactions and causal relationships between four multilevel factors-organizational-level safety climate (OSC), coworker support (CS), supervisory safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), individual psychological capital (PsyCap)-and GSC. A two-wave online survey was conducted within a large contractor company in the US over 2 years. A total of 280 employees completed both surveys. The structural equation modeling analysis technique was adopted to test the hypotheses. The results show that OSC, CS, and supervisory SSTL significantly contribute to GSC. In addition, supervisory SSTL and CS positively affect individual PsyCap, and PsyCap positively moderates the relationship between supervisory SSTL and GSC. The study suggests that construction contractors should consider implementing leadership and PsyCap interventions to cultivate a positive GSC that potentially can lead to improved safety performance.

Consideration of the Environmental Cost in Construction Contracting for Public Works: A+C and A+B+C Bidding Methods	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction emissions; Green contracting; Bidding method; Sustainable construction	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; LCA	Growing concerns about sustainable development have brought about an urgent need to develop global efforts to mitigate environmental impact. Although construction projects and their related activities consume much energy and generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) and other diesel emissions, the efforts to mitigate these emissions remain at an early stage. To address this issue, this paper explores opportunities to consider contractors' green capabilities during the bid evaluation phase. Based on reviews of the success story of the A + B bidding method, this paper suggests a modified bidding system in which contractors bid on the cost (part A) and environmental cost (part C) or on the cost (part A), time (part B), and environmental cost (part C) for public projects. An application of the proposed bidding methods is described using a bid for a highway reconstruction project. This case study reveals the potential impact of environmental cost criteria on the selection of a winning bid. The result of this case study indicates that the proposed bidding methods can offer bidding incentives to create sustainability initiatives for public works contractors.

They stem from risks that have unfortunately been realized in a project and how they will be pursued is up to company strategy, operational particularities and managers' skills and experience. Claims, in general, have an adverse effect on a project's supply chain by compromising actors' relationships, project implementation and project outcomes. It is imperative that all contractors follow a well-designed claims management strategy that is guided by well-defined and accurately documented operational processes outlined in detail. Process models related to claims management are scarcely found in the literature. These models are evaluated and a new process reference model, that attempts to improve the claims management process and rectify the identified shortcomings of existing models, such as a lack of transactions between the contractor and other supply chain actors, is proposed. In doing so, a number of process models are created. The objective of this paper is to prescribe the claims management process as an integral process to the supply chain of a construction project in an effort to raise awareness of this relationship and provide a holistic view to claims management through a supply chain management lens.

This study conducted a survey with state DOT maintenance engineers, and asked them to rate the factors and benefits. This study identified which factors were more important to state DOTs when assigning maintenance work to in-house staff or to private contractors. Statistical test results showed that the top two ranked factors influencing the selection of in-house (MBC and PBC) were availability of DOT staff and DOT staff have specific skills for jobs. Regarding the levels of satisfaction with benefits, on average, the respondents were significantly more satisfied with using in-house resources than with MBC or PBC methods. The study also determined the levels of satisfaction with quality of work that state DOTs and private contractors had with these methods. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Little research work has been carried out that applies multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods for the choice of contract type in the construction industry. This paper contributes to this area in research by presenting a comparative analysis of the application of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation method and the multi attribute utility theory to the problem of choosing appropriate contract types for two pilot projects in Greece with varying characteristics and AA's needs. For each project, nine selection criteria (SC) were weighted by two experts using the analytical hierarchy process, the revised Simos' method and goal programming. Based on the results, a decision support system for the choice of contract type for highway construction contractors in Greece is proposed which utilizes the experience of professionals from AAs in Greece and abroad and applies the above-mentioned MCDM methods.

Consequently, the objective of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the performance of local construction projects; and to elicit perceptions of their relative importance. A comprehensive literature review was deployed to generate a set of factors believed to affect project performance. A total of 120 questionnaires were distributed to 3 key groups of project participants; namely owners, consultants and contractors. The survey findings indicate that all 3 groups agree that the most important factors affecting project performance are: delays because of borders/roads closure leading to materials shortage; unavailability of resources; low level of project leadership skills; escalation of material prices; unavailability of highly experienced and qualified personnel; and poor quality of available equipment and raw materials. Based on these findings, the paper recommends that: 1) project owners must work collaboratively with contractors and facilitate regular payments in order to overcome delays, disputes and claims; 2) project participants should actively have their input in the process of decision-making; and 3) continuous coordination and relationship between project participants are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance.

W.; Shen, Li-yin			Measuring the Networking Performance for Contractors in Practicing Construction Management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Interfirm network; Performance measures; Contractors; Construction management practices		The construction industry is recognized as being project-based and is fragmented in nature. Problems such as poor communication, mistrust, lack of cohesion, and adversarial relationships among project stakeholders are often found in construction projects. Previous studies have explored the formation of successful interfirm networks in construction and investigated how to solve the aforementioned problems by means of a networking approach. It is therefore important to gain a clearer understanding of whether such a built network is effective and can contribute to construction management. Investigation of parameters for measuring the performance of interfirm networks has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners in industry and business fields. However, seldom has similar research been conducted in the field of construction management. This paper presents key parameters for measuring networking performance within the construction context. Five parameters are applied in the formation of the measurement model, including information exchange between project members, project communication system, knowledge-sharing for collaboration, corporate culture for promoting networking, and learning capability in intra- and inter-organizational settings. The empirical results of this study enable contractors to realize what items determine the performance of interfirm networks, and what aspects of construction management practices should be emphasized to improve the networking performance effectively.

J	Park, HK; Han, SH; Russell, JS				Park, HK; Han, SH; Russell, JS			Cash flow forecasting model for general contractors using moving weights of cost categories	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This research introduces the development of a project-level cash flow forecasting model from a general contractor's viewpoint. While most previous models have been proposed to assist contractors in forecasting cash flow in the early stage of pretendering or the planning phase, this paper aims to provide a tool that can be applicable during the construction phase based on the planned earned value and the actual incurred cost on a jobsite level. The critical key to cash flow forecasting at this level lies in how to build a realistic cash-out model. Toward the end, this paper adopts moving weights of cost categories in a budget that are variable depending on the progress of construction works. In addition, it addresses time lags in accordance with the contractual payment conditions and credit times given by suppliers or vendors. As for the cash-in model, net planned monthly earned values are simply transferred to the cash-in forecast with a consideration of billing time and retention money. Validation of the proposed model involves applying realistic data from four ongoing projects. Based on the results of comparative analyses, the writers conclude that the proposed model is more accurate and reliable, yet simpler to field engineers who are generally not familiar with certain intricate financial knowledge.

To date, researchers have modeled these interactions in the context of stand-alone projects. While much has been learned, questions arise concerning the validity of these models, because projects are not islands-they are affected by the markets in which general contractors compete for subcontractor resources. LeapconX is a marketwide simulation that can model an unlimited number of construction projects, subcontractors, and residential building projects in any given market region. It enables testing of production system innovations, revealing the impacts not only on companies implementing the innovations, but also on companies that do not. The system was validated through simulation using data for the Newark, New Jersey metropolitan area. Three production control innovations were tested at three levels of market penetration. Comparison of the results with those of single-project simulations for the same innovations confirms that market dynamics moderate outcomes. LeapconX enables both construction management researchers and practitioners to predict the likely outcomes of a wide variety of procedural and technological innovations, with little cost and no risk to actual projects.

J	Tomczak, M; Jaskowski, P				Tomczak, Michal; Jaskowski, Piotr			New Approach to Improve General Contractor Crew's Work Continuity in Repetitive Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LINE-OF-BALANCE; SCHEDULING METHOD; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; CHALLENGES	A significant number of construction projects involve repetitive processes. Planning them occurs to be a complex task. Network methods traditionally applied to construction scheduling prove inefficient in the case of repetitive construction projects (RCPs) due to the increased number of relationships among processes, locations (units), and resources. Frequently, the aim of scheduling RCPs is making the full use of the resources' capacity, thereby ensuring continuity of the crews' work. To achieve this, the planner typically allows discontinuity of some secondary processes to shift resources to the key processes, allowing optional modes of process delivery and introducing soft precedence relations between processes. This paper presents a new way of increasing the continuity of work of a general contractor's crews in RCPs by employing subcontractors' crews. A deterministic mathematical model of the mixed-integer linear problem of a repetitive (nonlinear) project was formulated to find a schedule that minimizes the downtime of the general contractor's crews under constraints of a maximum acceptable total project duration and a maximum acceptable cost of the works commissioned to subcontractors; the model accounts for the limited availability of crews. Application of the model is illustrated by an example. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Specifying clear sustainability requirements to potential contractors is of great importance to project success. This research investigates the current state-of-the-practice for the definition of sustainability requirements within the public sectors of the U.S. construction market using a robust content analysis of 49 DB requests for proposals (RFPs). The results reveal that owners predominantly communicate their desired level of sustainability through the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) certification system. The sustainability requirement has become an important dimension for the best-value evaluation of DB contractors with specific importance weightings of up to 25%. Additionally, owners of larger projects and who provide less design information in their RFPs generally allocate significantly higher importance weightings to sustainability requirements. The primary knowledge contribution of this study to the construction industry is the reveal of current trends in DB procurement for green projects. The findings also provide owners, architects, engineers, and constructors with an effective means of communicating sustainability objectives in solicitation documents.

Hence, the bidding price decision is a strategic subject for contractors of construction projects. This paper develops a stochastic programming model for determining the optimum bidding price in construction projects. Some model parameters, such as the number of competitors and the project's cost, are estimated by analyzing historical data. Then, a mathematical model for the bidding price decision that maximizes the expected profit is proposed. To reduce the risk of suffering from a large loss, a maximum acceptable risk constraint is employed. To evaluate the model's performance, some numerical problems are examined. Moreover, sensitivity analysis of the key parameters and a robustness evaluation of the model against uncertain parameters are conducted. To evaluate the model's effectiveness in real-world situations, a case study is analyzed using the proposed approach. The numerical results indicate that the proposed approach reduces the cost estimation errors and increases the average expected profit, which validates the applicability of the model. This research contributes to the community of contractors of construction projects by providing a new approach for determining the optimum bidding price that is in greater accordance with real-world constraints.

This study aims to investigate the factors affecting adoption of ICJVs for underground rail construction projects, to identify the critical risks faced by parties that perform the projects under ICJVs, and to examine the obstacles to appropriate risk allocation among the parties under ICJVs. To achieve these objectives, an in-depth literature review was carried out and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 33 contractor firms as well. The survey results reported "sharing of project risks" as the top attractive factor of ICJVs and "differences in culture and working style" as the top negative factor. In addition, both foreign and local contractors considered "partners disagree over some conditions in contract" the most critical risk to the parties involving projects under ICJVs. While risk allocation was perceived to be very important for ICJVs, "unclear division of responsibilities and risks" and "differences in culture and working styles" could be the most significant obstacles against effective risk allocation among the parties. The findings from this study will help improve the implementation of ICJVs and provide valuable information for organizations who intend to participate in ICJVs in Singapore.

The system identifies the optimal trade-off between a construction owner's satisfaction and a contractor's satisfaction. It is important to reconcile the project participants' conflicting interests because the construction owner aims to maximize the quality of construction while the contractor aims to minimize the cost of construction. MOGA is used to optimize resource allocation when owner satisfaction and contractor satisfaction are pursued at the same time under a limited budget. Multi-objective optimization is integrated with simulation to effectively deal with the uncertainties of the QFD input and the variability of the QFD output. This study is of value to practitioners because SQCO allows for the establishment of a quality plan that satisfies all of the multi project participants. The study is also of relevance to researchers in that it allows researchers to expeditiously identify an optimal design alternative of construction methods and operations. A test case implemented with a curtain-wall unit verifies the usability and validity of the system in practice.

J	Chung, TH; Abraham, DM; Gokhale, SB				Chung, TH; Abraham, DM; Gokhale, SB			Decision support system for microtunneling applications	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Microtunneling is a trenchless technology method used for installing new pipelines. The inherent advantages of this method over open-cut trenching have led to its increasing use since its first introduction into North America in the early 1980s. With this technology, surface disruption can be minimized, especially in urban areas, and high accuracy of installation (usually less than 2 cm over 100 m) can be achieved in both line and grade. But microtunneling machines are very expensive and few contractors have extensive experience with this technology. Microtunneling can also be risky when unexpected obstacles or soil changes occur. Careful constructability analysis is needed, and an appropriate microtunneling method should be selected in order to achieve successful completion of microtunneling projects. A computerized decision support system (DSS) for microtunneling was developed to support decision making for contractors who want to bid on microtunneling projects. This paper discusses the decision-making process for microtunneling and the development of the DSS. When the user enters basic information about the potential project such as drive length, installation depth, pipe diameter, and soil condition, the DSS evaluates whether microtunneling will be economically feasible and suggests appropriate types of microtunneling methods. The user can then select microtunneling machines, types of pipes, and types of shaft construction methods. This DSS is most beneficial when used at the preplanning stage by utility contractors.

This study uses a probabilistic analysis of four hypothetical projects in the UK schools sector under the 2014 policy regime, combined with qualitative interviews with practitioners, to explore the conditions for a viable project. It finds that the proposed approach has the potential to allow more detailed exploration of project structures and scope for creating greater understanding of likely returns and the factors affecting them. Evidence is found that the use of deterministic risk screening techniques such as simple payback results in viable opportunities being overlooked. The risk profiles for clients and contractors (energy service companies - ESCOs) are not symmetrical and they will each find different projects more attractive. The results suggest that greater consideration needs to be given to the precise risk allocation between client and contractor to ensure that likely returns are properly understood. This study demonstrates a method for exploring project characteristics that can be used to understand their impacts on the financial returns for clients and contractors.

Such a relationship is investigated based on three key components: six antecedents of trust as independent variables (reputation, competence, integrity, communication, reciprocity, and contract), two types of trust as mediating variables (calculative and relative trust), and project success as a dependent variable. The results differentiate and compare the perceptions of trust for both owners and contractors in terms of their priority for antecedents of trust, the influential mechanism that connects trust with project success, and the numerical relationship between calculative trust and relational trust. For both parties, relational trust generates a higher impact on project success than calculative trust, but contractors perceived the relationship between relational trust and calculative trust as being linear while owners believed such a relationship is a quadratic function. This research provides new evidence to support the development of trust theory in the construction industry, and it can also help construction practitioners and policymakers to better understand the development and management of trust in the construction industry.

For traditional reasons, the Ghanaian construction industry has a challenge of cultural shift in the adoption of contemporary procurement systems. This research sought to investigate factors influencing the continuous use of Design Bid Build (DBB) and the main procurement path influencing factors. Using quantitative methods, findings from the field study indicated that familiarity with the DBB has been the driver for the continuous use of DBB. It was established that the main challenges of DBB were high cost and schedule overruns and high variations. On the other hand, the main procurement influencing factors were identified as early start and completion, firm prices before committing to precede, reduction in cost and schedule overruns. It was evident from the study that the Ghanaian construction industry is not ready for cultural shift in procurement strategies, and may continue to embrace the DBB. It is recommended that contractor selection for projects should not necessarily be based on bulk volume of works but the unit of work. This would enhance the early selection of a contractor, whose early involvement would bring to bear buildability, increased contractor's responsibility and reduce project risk.

Using Contractor Bid Amounts to Estimate the Impact of Night Construction on Cost for Transportation Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Highway; Night; Nighttime; Construction; Productivity; Illumination; Lighting	PRODUCTIVITY; SAFETY	Many studies have documented the merits and problems of nighttime work for highway construction. Most of these studies have examined the safety of the construction site for workers or the traveling public. Illumination standards, sign requirements, and crash rate data have been studied to determine whether crash rates increase during nighttime hours, and the reasons for these crashes. Few studies have addressed either the effects on cost or productivity that nighttime construction has on a project. This study used hard bid unit prices to focus on the effect that performing certain construction activities at night has on cost and productivity. Specifically, the study assumes that a contractor's bid amount reflects expected relative project productivity and answers the question, What impact, if any, does night work have on construction productivity and therefore bid price? This is the first paper to answer both questions as related. Among the results was the fact that for the most part, the owner would have saved millions of dollars by allowing the contractor the option of working at night or during the day, though some items were bid lowest if the contract allowed for night work only.

However, reconstruction and repair efforts are typically faced by budget constraints that require careful selection among competing contractors. This paper presents an innovative formulation to optimize this complex planning problem in order to maximize the rate of transportation network recovery while minimizing the associated reconstruction costs. This study first contributes to the body of knowledge by offering an effective and efficient means of identifying the optimal schedules for reconstruction projects and the optimal contractor assignments. This is achieved by solving the problem using a new mixed-integer linear programming model. However, there are four main formulation challenges to represent this problem using linear equations because of the need to use logical operators. As such, the second contribution of this study is in offering innovative solutions to overcome these formulation challenges, which are generalizable to other construction scheduling and planning problems. This paper is companion to another paper that describes a holistic optimization and traffic assessment methodology for post-disaster reconstruction planning for damaged transportation networks.

J	Fountain, J; Langar, S				Fountain, James; Langar, Sandeep			Building Information Modeling (BIM) outsourcing among general contractors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM outsourcing; BIM implementation; Survey; BIM impacts		Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process used by Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) stakeholders which simulates a construction project in a multi-dimensional digital model and provides multitudes of project benefits from project inception to its occupancy. However, a variety of barriers impede a holistic BIM implementation. Due to these barriers, some general contractors outsource the creation and use of BIM models to specialized Information Technology (IT) firms. Since limited literature currently exists for BIM outsourcing, this study aims to identify BIM outsourcing patterns among the general contractors across the US and the perceived impacts it has on construction projects. Analysis of two-hundred and fifty-two complete responses from general contracting firms determines that 45% of responding companies have outsourced BIM, this signifies that outsourcing has become an important facet of BIM implementation. Data was also collected on company demographics, BIM outsourcing locations, strategic reasons for outsourcing, and various other aspects related to BIM outsourcing. The results indicate that respondents perceive BIM outsourcing as less efficient than in-house BIM implementation. However, continued use of outsourcing for BIM functions also displays the adaptability of the industry in meeting challenges and embracing new technology through alternative methods, despite the potential risks.

However, uncertain and limited supplier information as well as complex correlations among various factors affects supplier behaviors, making learning a supplier's negotiation strategy and deciding the appropriate offer price difficult for contractors. Therefore, a multistrategy Bayesian fuzzy-game model (MBFGM) that can be applied in forecasting a supplier's negotiation strategy was developed in this study. A validation analysis revealed that incorporating limited objective data and previous knowledge from experts into the Bayesian learning process can facilitate effectively determining causal relationships in a network as well as improving the accuracy of a learned model. By using the proposed model, contractors can effectively foresee the relationship between its alternative offer prices (OPs) and a supplier's future bidding strategies. An experiment in which construction practitioners participated revealed that contractors can benefit by applying the forecasting ability of the model to increase the success rate and profit, reduce the time spent in unnecessary negotiation, and improve negotiation efficiency in the construction material procurement process.

Design-construction interface problems in large building construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						design; construction; interface management; contractors; consultants; design-construction	COORDINATION; SUBCONTRACTORS; ISSUES	Interface management is one of the major keys for a successful construction project. During the project, many interface problems may arise, and their severities may vary and affect the overall project performance. This research was conducted to identify the causes of design-construction interface problems in large building construction projects in Palestine. To achieve the research objectives, a comprehensive literature review, pilot study and questionnaire survey were carried out to collect information on these causes. Responses from 34 consultants and 30 contractors were analysed. The results revealed that the top 10 extreme significant causes are unstable client requirements', lack of proper coordination between various disciplines of the design team', awarding the contract to the lowest price regardless of the quality of services', lack of skilled and experienced human resources in the design firms', lack of skilled human resources at the construction site', delaying of dues payments', lack of specialized quality-control team', lack of professional construction management', delaying the approval of completed tasks' and vague and deficient drawings and specifications'. Spearman's rho coefficient was 0.64, which indicates that the overall level of correlation between Palestinian consultants and contractors in the context of this research can be identified as moderate.

J	de Valence, G				de Valence, Gerard			Reframing construction within the built environment sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Construction; Novel method; Novel model		Purpose Official statistics on the output of the construction industry capture on-site activities of contractors and sub-contractors; however, the role of the industry linking suppliers of materials, machinery, products, services and other inputs is also widely recognised. These two views have been called broad and narrow, with the narrow industry defined as on-site work and the broad industry as the supply chain of materials, products and assemblies, and professional services. An argument is made for using the term built environment sector (BES) for the broad industry definition of construction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Construction industry statistics capture the on-site activities of contractors and sub-contractors. This paper reviews research that adds to construction output the contributions of suppliers of materials, machinery and equipment, products and components, professional services and other inputs required to deliver the buildings and structures that make up the built environment. Findings The same term, construction, has been used in a number of ways in different definitional studies of the narrow and broad industry. The term that best encompasses the large number and range of participants in the creation and maintenance of the built environment, from suppliers to end users, is the BES. Research limitations/implications Construction economics makes an important contribution to researching the macroeconomic role of the BES. There is also a special role for construction economics in researching both the boundaries of the BES and the data available on the industries that contribute to the BES. Practical implications Measuring the BES would improve the understanding of its macroeconomic role and significance. Social implications Measuring the BES would contribute to city policies and urban planning. Originality/value The paper proposes a new approach to defining and measuring the industries that contribute to the production, maintenance and management of the built environment. It introduces a new name for the combination of those industries.

Comprehensive information, expanded knowledge, considerable expertise, and continuous improvement are needed to obtain accurate cost estimation. The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical factors that affect accuracy of cost estimation and evaluate the degree to which these factors are important from contractors' and consultants' viewpoints. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were adopted in collecting and analyzing the data, and testing the hypotheses. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire was prepared and then was modified according to the results of face-to-face open-ended interviews conducted with 11 project managers. The final version of the questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 265 respondents. For analyzing the collected data Kendall's and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted. Findings - The analysis revealed that there is a strong agreement between contractors and consultants in the ranking of the factors related to consultant, contractor, design parameters, and information. A slightly weak agreement between contractors and consultants was noted regarding the factors related to market conditions (external factors) and factors related to project characteristics. Furthermore, the results show that the top ten factors affecting the accuracy of cost estimate are clear and detail drawings and specification, pricing experience of construction projects, perception of estimation importance, equipment (cost/availability/performance), project complexity, clear scope definition, accuracy and reliability of cost information, site constraints (access, storage, services), material availability, financial capabilities of the client, and availability of database of bids on similar project (historical data). Originality/value - Offers an original view of the concept of accuracy of cost estimates as it relates to the efficiency of the project relying on both literature review and empirical evidence.

J	Jang, YJ; Jeong, I; Cho, YK				Jang, Youjin; Jeong, Inbae; Cho, Yong K.			Business Failure Prediction of Construction Contractors Using a LSTM RNN with Accounting, Construction Market, and Macroeconomic Variables	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Business failure; Construction contractors; Prediction model; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Recurrent neural network (RNN); Construction market variables; Macroeconomic variables	DEFAULT; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	In the construction industry, predicting business failure and providing early warnings are critical challenges in the prevention of business failure chain reactions. Most relevant studies have developed models that predicted the probability of business failure within 1 year using financial ratios. Although a few studies have attempted to use nonfinancial information, they did not provide empirical evidence that this addition can improve the prediction performance of a model. To address these problems, this study proposed a model that used not only accounting variables but also construction market and macroeconomic variables to predict failure probability from 1 to 3 years. We examined the effects of combinations of these variables on the business failure prediction performance of construction contractors in the United States and compared the effects of combinations of these variables between three models that predict business failure within 1, 2, and 3 years. This study developed a prediction model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a deep-learning algorithm. The results showed that the prediction model using both the construction market and macroeconomic variables had approximately 2%, 3%, and 4% higher prediction performance compared with that using only accounting variables when predicting within 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. This means that the business failure prediction model had superior prediction performance from a long-term perspective when the construction market and macroeconomic variables were used in addition to accounting variables. The results of this study are expected to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of input variable selection on the prediction performance for each prediction period and useful references for improving performance of predicting business failure of construction contractors.

One of the major risks that leads to disputes in such international projects is poor contract administration. Research has been focused toward the cultural risks and ex-post dispute resolution in international construction, missing the important ex-ante dispute avoidance aspect. This paper addresses this knowledge gap with a special focus on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which is the largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa. The paper does so by providing in-depthyet practicalcontract administration guidelines for U.S. contractors working in public works projects in KSA. The focus was put on KSA because of its economic strength and because KSA's associated contractual risks are uniquely relevant to those of other countries. To this end, the authors conducted comparative analysis between the Saudi Public Works Contract (PWC) and the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) with respect to change orders, extension of time, liquidated damages, differing site conditions, and dispute resolution. Through exhibiting the important contractual and legal considerations that are unique to KSA, the outcomes of this research include: (1)a comparative checklist showing the similarities and differences between the two governmental approaches; and (2)a matrix of relative opportunities and risks of the PWC and FAR. Such an approach of analyzing the Saudi contracting environment from a U.S.-based context has not been undertaken before. As such, the study is beneficial to the U.S. contractor as it facilitates the understanding of the contractual premises in KSA and the associated risks and opportunities.

Owing to vast uncertainties and complexities, international construction entry decisions are intricate. Although conventional Probability-Impact (P-I) risk models are useful, the firm's capabilities are missing in early assessments for project selection decision. Hence, this study aims to develop a capability-based risk assessment (CapRA) calculator for international contractors venturing overseas. The international construction firm's capabilities are explored using resource-based views, dynamic capabilities, and Porter's generic value chain theories to conceptualize an integrated framework for risk assessment. Additionally, a questionnaire was sent to international construction firms operating outside their home countries to appraise their firm's capabilities and international construction project risk significance values. Then, a partial least squares approach was used to analyze the data. The findings are used to develop a novel CapRA model, which is then formulated into modified P-I risk model equations and computerized into a CapRA calculator to simplify the application. In essence, this study contributes to both knowledge and practice by developing and testing a model to improve the accuracy and facilitate project selection decisions for international construction firms.

In the construction industry, government agencies and private sector clients typically adopt competitive bidding to determine contract awards. Contractors also apply the same approach to bidding decisions. There are many variables that affect contractor decisions regarding whether to bid and the markup scale, which complicate the bidding decision process. This study proposes a Multi-Criteria Prospect Model for Bidding Decision (BD-MCPM) to assist contractors to make decisions on bid/no bid and markup scale. Key factors of influence that impact bidding decisions were identified first. Second, Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) was employed to assess factor weights and determine bid/no bid. Finally, if a decision to bid is given, then the Multi-Criteria Prospect Model (MCPM), which links Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPR) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), is deployed to determine the markup scale that best conforms to primary decision maker (PDM) preferences. The applicability of this model was demonstrated in a real case study.

Prior research has identified relationship history as a potentially vital contingency factor in organizational control, but there is a lack of research on how relationship history affects how different control systems function in project-based contexts. In the Swedish infrastructure market, increased demand has resulted in a need for increased supply capacity. This has spurred new entrants that have no relationship history with the major client, the Swedish Transport Administration. The purpose is therefore to compare how the client's control systems function in construction projects with familiar (known to the client) and unfamiliar (new to the client) contractors. The case study involves 32 interviews conducted in six infrastructure projects, three with unfamiliar contractors. Findings show that relationship history heavily influences how the control systems function, especially bureaucratic and clan control. The new contractors are unaccustomed with the client's extensive use of bureaucratic control and perceive it as less suitable in design-build contracts. Furthermore, the lack of relationship history reduces the opportunity to use clan control from the beginning of a project, due to unfamiliarity with both the client and the control system.

It developed models to predict the level of quality of interpersonal relations between the stakeholders at the completion of public projects. Design/methodology/approach - Using a set of questionnaire, data were collected from randomly selected construction industry practitioners who have had experience in public projects in Singapore. The data were analysed to identify association between the use of RC practices and quality of interpersonal relations between stakeholders. In-depth interviews with experts were conducted. Findings - It was found that when certain RC practices were adopted to a larger extent, public projects also have significantly higher quality of interpersonal relations between clients, contractors and consultants. Three mathematical models were developed to predict the relationship quality between stakeholders at the end of the public project. Research limitations/implications - The limitations include the subjective nature of the Likert scale that was used in answering the questionnaire survey and the limited number of interviews. The effect of existing good relations among stakeholders was not taken into account. Practical implications - Suitable RC practices for adoption by public clients, contractors and consultants in public projects are recommended. These include developing deeper mutual trust and understanding, sharing project information, and having real gain-share/pain-share among contracting parties. Originality/value - RC practices that are significantly associated with relationships among contracting parties in public projects in Singapore are uncovered. Contracting parties may use the recommendations to help enhance their relationships with one another in a public project.	[Ling, Florence Y.

J	Ahankoob, A; Manley, K; Abbasnejad, B				Ahankoob, Alireza; Manley, Karen; Abbasnejad, Behzad			The role of contractors' building information modelling (BIM) experience in realising the potential values of BIM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						BIM; contractors; BIM potential benefits; BIM experience; information and communication technology (ICT)	SUPPORT; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; ACQUISITION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS	There has been recently a growing attention towards the potential benefits of building information modelling (BIM) in construction business processes from both academia and industry practitioners. While prior research has emphasised that there is a link between the proficiency of construction companies to use BIM and the realisation of BIM benefits, little evidence exists to capture this relationship. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which prior BIM experiences influence the perception of industry experts on potential BIM benefits. The influence of years of BIM experience on the discernment of BIM potential benefits was examined through a survey of Australian building contractors. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that BIM experience was a significant factor in the realisation of potential BIM benefits. The results suggest that an increase in years of BIM experience foster a better understanding of BIM benefits, which consequently can lead to a more inspiring movement towards the adoption of BIM by construction organisations. The main contribution of this article is to increase awareness towards the adoption and implementation of BIM by making a link between BIM proficiency and an increased perception of BIM potential benefits in construction organisations.

Owners should provide an appropriate level of design in DB RFPs to adequately describe their requirements without compromising the prospects for innovation. This paper examines and compares the different levels of owner-provided design in DB RFPs by the content analysis of 84 requests for RFPs for public DB projects advertised between 2000 and 2010 with an aggregate contract value of over $5.4 billion. A statistical analysis was also conducted to explore the relationship between the proportion of owner-provided design and other project information, including project type, advertisement time, project size, contractor selection method, procurement process, and contract type. The results show that the majority (64.8%) of the RFPs provides less than 10% of the owner-provided design. The owner-provided design proportion has a significant association with project type, project size, contractor selection method, and contract type. In addition, owners are generally providing less design in recent years than previously. The research findings also provide owners with perspectives to determine the appropriate level of owner-provided design in DB RFPs. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000522.

SQFD integrates stochastic simulation modeling and analysis techniques into traditional QFD to deal efficiently with the uncertainties in the input data, to support the quality performance measurement that is involved in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and to predict the variability in the output. D/B construction owners who are in the process of selecting a D/B firm for a project would benefit from SQFD, because the system allows an owner to expeditiously assess the quality performance of potential D/B firms in their bidding list. An example in D/B contractor evaluation is presented to illustrate the functioning of the system. This quantitative method is a significant contribution to the field of quality performance measurement, because (1) SQFD is totally automated, (2) SQFD's reliability is higher than conventional QFD, and (3) SQFD efficiently deals with uncertainties in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and therefore generates more accurate results. The system helps to improve the D/B project bidding system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Value chain management in Sri Lankan construction industry: contractor's perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction industry; contractor organisations; value chain management (VCM); value chain (VC); value chain analysis (VCA); value-adding activity (VAA)	IMPORTANCE-PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; SUPPLY CHAIN; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK	Poor levels of efficiency are a prevalent concern for construction industries worldwide. Herein, Value Chain Management (VCM) is a concept that can help minimise organisational inefficiencies through in-depth insights into a firm's operations. Aim of this study was to investigate the potential for construction contractor organisations to enhance the value addition to the client while improving efficiency through VCM principles. Mixed research approach was used. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey and expert interviews. Altogether, 50 (Value-adding activities) VAAs relevant for Sri Lankan construction organisations were identified, which were categorised under four groups of primary VAAs and six groups of secondary VAAs. The VAAs were further mapped into Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) Matrix based on their cost and the value addition resulting in 12 VAAs in quadrant I (concentrate here), 18 VAAs in quadrant II (keep up the good work) 12 VAAs in quadrant III (low priority), and 8 VAAs in quadrant IV (possible overkill). Reasons for lack of VC Analysis (VCA) were also identified and suggestions for improvement proposed. This research makes a significant contribution to enhancing the construction industry efficiency by providing guidance for decision-makers on the areas to concentrate on when it comes to implementing improvements.

J	Pena-Mora, F; Tanaka, S				Pena-Mora, F; Tanaka, S			Information technology planning framework for Japanese general contractors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Japan; contractors; information management		Developments in information technology (IT) continue to have a significant impact on the architectural/engineering/, construction (A/E/C) industry. However, the issue of whether A/E/C organizations are receiving adequate returns from their IT investments remains an important managerial concern. Recently, Pena-Mora, Vadhavkar, Perkins, and Weber introduced a strategic IT planning framework for construction projects that includes four steps: environmental scan, internal scrutiny, IT diffusion analysis, and IT investment modeling. It analyzes the external and internal IT conditions of a project/firm, identifies the diffusion phase of IT in the project/firm, and finally evaluates the effects of IT investments on the project/firm. Although this framework was originally intended to plan future IT investments, we assume that the framework can also be used to evaluate ongoing or past IT investments in projects/firms. Following this idea, this paper presents an application of the Pena-Mora et al. framework to an ongoing IT project in Kajima Corporation, one of the largest Japanese general contractors. Kajima is currently developing an IT system called LINCS (Linkage of Information for a New Construction System). This synthetic information network system has been designed to share building data among design and construction stages and streamline design/build activities. By using the framework proposed in this paper, we analyzed how LINCS is justified in terms of its strategic and operational value for Kajima and its construction projects.

Traditionally, design institutes have operated as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and for them, China's accession to the WTO in 2001 presents both a threat as well as an opportunity. Given the market conditions in China, most of the design institutes are restructuring their organizations to cope with the increasing competition. Through a pilot investigation, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the Chinese design institutes are identified. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes development strategies for the sustainable growth of Chinese design institutes and suggests approaches for collaboration with foreign contractors and consultants. A case study is presented to demonstrate the practical application of these strategies.

To help project managers understand the fundamental difference in culture and the way projects are managed, it is useful and critical to reveal and compare the causes of delay and construction management practices in China and the US. The research is aimed at identifying and comparing the most prevalent reasons for task-level delay between the two countries, as perceived by various levels of management, and understanding how the culture and tradition influence management practice and performance. A questionnaire survey for public projects contracted to civilian construction companies was administered to contractors, 150 usable responses from China were collected, and the results were compared to the results from a similar survey in the US. The contributions are quantitatively examining the essential constituents causing task delay, discovering the root causes and key differences in construction management culture between the two countries, and developing strategies to help contractors minimize possible task delay when working in different culture and environments. The findings will help construction managers learn the essential differences in culture and their impact on the ways of project operation so that they can take proactive actions to interact with project managers from different counties to minimize delays.

Contract managers (CMs) employed at contractor firms were interviewed regarding their role, the selection of the structural frame and how they perceived different options. The results show that CMs largely influence the selection of the structural frame in multifamily buildings, which are guided by the established concrete-based sociotechnical regime. The regime is maintained through cognitive rules regarding structural frame options and the alignment of skills of construction professionals. Because of their influence and their investments in the skills of construction workers, CMs make important contributions to maintain the regime and the concrete path dependency. Furthermore, the regime varies in strength in different locations. Some locations carry a strong norm to cast concrete frames on site. This makes it more difficult to deviate from the established practice. In other locations, wood-promoting initiatives have changed the cognitive rules associated with the regime. Nonetheless, the sociotechnical regime makes the selection of concrete structural frames beneficial. This prevents wood-framed multifamily buildings from entering common usage, even though such buildings can contribute to mitigating climate change.

J	Ashuri, B; Lu, JA				Ashuri, Baabak; Lu, Jian			Time Series Analysis of ENR Construction Cost Index	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction costs; Time series analysis; Autoregressive models; Autoregressive moving-average models; Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Seasonal ARIMA		Every month, Engineering News-Record (ENR) publishes the construction cost index (CCI), which is a weighted aggregate index of the 20-city average prices of construction activities. Although CCI increases over the long term, it is subject to considerable short-term variations, which make it problematic for cost estimators to prepare accurate bids for contractors or engineering estimates for owner organizations. The ability to predict construction cost trends can result in more-accurate bids and avoid under- or overestimation. This paper summarizes and compares the applicability and predictability of various univariate time series approach for in-sample and out-of-sample forecastings of CCI. It is shown that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average model is the most-accurate time series approach for in-sample forecasting of CCI, while the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model is the most-accurate time series approach for out-of-sample forecasting of CCI. It is also shown that several time series models provide more-accurate out-of-sample forecasts than the ENR's subject matter experts' CCI forecast. Cost estimators can benefit from CCI forecasting by incorporating predicted price variations in their estimates and preparing more-accurate bids for contractors and budgets for owners. Owners and contractors can use CCI forecasting in reducing construction costs by better-timed project execution.

J	Menches, CL; Hanna, AS				Menches, Cindy L.; Hanna, Awad S.			Conceptual planning process for electrical construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The competitive nature of the construction industry has motivated many specialty contractors to search for ways to improve efficiency by increasing their quality and decreasing their costs in order to strengthen their market share. As a result, contractors are turning to "better planning" as a method for improving their efficiency and, consequently, increasing their profitability. In fact, a consensus exists in the construction industry that more formalized preconstruction planning is necessary to remain successful in an increasingly competitive industry. This paper presents a model electrical preconstruction planning process that was crafted from outstanding processes used on several successful electrical projects. Furthermore, a method to evaluate the effectiveness of planning, by comparing actual planning to the model process, is briefly introduced. From this assessment, "effective planning" was correlated to project outcome, and evidence is provided that better planning is, indeed, related to successful performance.

The drawbacks with these methods are inconsistency, dissatisfaction, and delayed decision process. This study proposes to use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based preference aggregation method (commonly used by the business community) to combine the individual inputs into a group decision in conjunction with a constrained particle swarm optimization technique to generate consistent results in minimal time without altering individual decision-maker inputs. The proposed approach was evaluated by computing group decision weights for selection of a contractor out of six contractors with the help of nine decision-makers based on eight criteria using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results indicated that the proposed method was able to identify the most suitable contractor in minimal time without human intervention. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Silungwe, CKT; Khatleli, N				Tembo Silungwe, Chipozya Kosta; Khatleli, Nthatisi			An analysis of the allocation of pertinent risks in the Zambian building sector using Pareto analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building projects; pareto analysis; zambia; pertinent risks	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTORS; PROJECTS; SUCCESS	In most instances, the construction client allocates risk by selecting the methods for procurement, payment and the contract form. Nevertheless, how favourably the contractor views the risk allocation has a bearing on the project outcome. This research identifies the pertinent risks in the Zambian context and establishes how they are allocated in terms of types of contract clauses used and response mechanisms employed. A mixed-sequential approach was followed, comprising 15 semi-structured interviews, 198 questionnaire-survey respondents and document analysis (eight projects using various standard forms of contract). The respondents comprised of clients, consultants and contractors involved on medium- to- large-scale building projects. Findings show the pertinent risks in the industry were due to shortcomings of the design team and clients' shirking. Using a Pareto analysis, a pervasive propensity was found for passive risk acceptance and wanton risk transfer by the client. Modifications were found, aimed at negating the clients' responsibility for risk. The originality of this research lies in its methodological approach and its focus on how risks are allocated. Findings can help practitioners to better allocate risk and promote the achievement of desired project outcomes through careful selection and utilization of mechanisms, allocation of risk and use of contract clauses.

This case has been considered as a MCDM problem. This problem has been assumed as a discrete zero-sum two-person matrix game with grey numbers. Among the four alternatives available for contractor and employer in the proposed case study, termination is the last alternative that decision makers choose. Based on different risk values, authors determined the optimal solution for both parties.

J	Ho, PHK				Ho, Paul H. K.			Analysis of Competitive Environments, Business Strategies, and Performance in Hong Kong's Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Competitive environments; Business strategies and performance	GENERIC STRATEGIES; DIFFERENTIATION; APPLICABILITY	Nearly all construction works are traditionally awarded through a competitive tendering process. A contractor's competitive strategy thus determines its success or failure in different competitive environments. This study aims to explore the contingency relationships between the competitive environments, business strategies adopted and contractors' subsequent performance in the construction industry. The study was based on Porter's competitive-force framework to analyse competitive environments in the construction industry, together with the modified version of Porter's generic strategies of cost leadership and differentiation. The performance measure was based on the profit margin on turnover. Five hypotheses were developed and tested by comparing the resultant performances of two generic strategies with five competitive forces. Questionnaires were used to collect data to test the five hypotheses. Significant interactions were found between three industrial competitive forces (the threat of new entrants, the intensity of rivalry among competitors, and the bargaining power of clients) and two business strategies (the low-cost strategy and the differentiation strategy). The main effects were found to be significant for the remaining two competitive forces (the threat of a substitute and the bargaining power of subcontractors and suppliers). In general, these results confirm the proposition made by this study that contingency relationships exist among three industrial competitive forces, low-cost and differentiation strategies, and contractors' performance.

Subcontractors who directly handle a major portion of all construction activities have a highlighted role in the building industry, so suitable subcontractor selection has a direct effect on the productivity of construction operations. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive model for subcontractor selection based on the fuzzy preference selection index. The improvement of the proposed model lies in the fact that it has found a way to eliminate the weighting criteria phase in selecting the optimal subcontractor where weighting attributes is a challenging task. The consistency test is presented for investigating the accuracy of model results with the previous scientific work.

J	Lee, EB; Ibbs, CW				Lee, EB; Ibbs, CW			Computer simulation model: Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Most state highways in the United States were built during the 1960s and 1970s with an infrastructure investment of more than $1 trillion. They now exceed their 20 year design lives and are seriously deteriorated. The consequences are high maintenance and road user costs because of degraded road surfaces and construction work zone delays. Efficient planning of highway rehabilitation closures is critical. This paper presents a simulation model, Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies (CA4PRS), which estimates the maximum amount of highway rehabilitation/reconstruction during various closure timeframes. The model balances project constraints Such as scheduling interfaces, pavement materials and design, contractor logistics and resources, and traffic operations. It has been successfully used on several urban freeway rehabilitation projects with high traffic volume, including projects on I-10 and I-710. The CA4PRS helps agencies and contractors plan highway rehabilitation strategies by taking into account long-life pavement performance, construction productivity. traffic delay, and total cost.

J	Drew, DS; Skitmore, M				Drew, DS; Skitmore, M			Testing Vickery's revenue equivalence theory in construction auctions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction work is often allocated to contractors via first price sealed bid auctions (FPA). American Nobel Prize winner and economist William Vickery, however, suggested that second price auctions (SPA) (i.e., the lowest bidder wins the contract at the second lowest price) may be more beneficial due to the revenue equivalence theory (RET). This implies that, upon certain conditions being met, clients can, in the long run, expect to pay approximately the same to contractors irrespective of whether contracts are awarded according to an FPA or SPA. At the same time, it is expected to be easier to bid in an SPA. In the absence of real world data, the likely effects of using SPA for construction were examined experimentally. This involved experienced respondents bidding on over 60 identical FPA and SPA. Contrary to expectations, the bids for the SPA were significantly higher, indicating that RET is unlikely to occur in practice in construction bidding.

Multiobjective Evolutionary Finance-Based Scheduling: Entire Projects' Portfolio	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction project; Financing; Financial planning; Multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CONSTRUCTION; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION	A strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) is proposed and was modified by incorporating logic-preserving crossover and mutation operators and employed to devise a set of optimum finance-based schedules of multiple projects being implemented simultaneously by a construction contractor. The problem involves the minimization of the conflicting objectives of financing costs, duration of the group of projects, and the required credit. The modified SPEA was employed to obtain the Pareto-optimal fronts for the two-objective combinations as well as the three objectives. In addition, a fuzzy-based technique was used to help the contractors select the best compromise solution over the Pareto-optimal solutions. The proposed approach has been developed and implemented on projects with different sizes. The results obtained by the modified SPEA, fuzzy-based approach demonstrated its potential and effectiveness in finance-based scheduling of multiple projects.

By examining the Japanese contractors working in Egypt and comparing their managing systems to the local ones, a comparative analysis of the two contractors working in the Egyptian field is presented in this paper to illustrate how TQM can be implemented effectively in the Egyptian construction industry. Bearing in mind the location bound nature of the production process, the competitive bidding, which emphasizes cost and the absence of the quality culture of the clients, subcontractors and site operatives are some of the constraining factors for implementing the quality policy. Based on the research findings, the paper presents some features of the Japanese construction industry that could be implemented in the Egyptian field in addition to a new model for TQM implementation that appropriates the Egyptian construction industry.

However, there is limited research on analytical methods of categorizing and prioritizing a high number of suppliers for effective allocation of scarce development resources. This research aims to develop an objective model to categorize a general contractor's suppliers. To do so, we use three concepts from different research backgrounds - recency, frequency and monetary value (RFM); data envelopment analysis (DEA); and the customer pyramid - and add the number of projects (P) shared with each supplier as a context-related variable to build a novel RFMP model. The model categorizes suppliers into four levels of the supplier pyramid, utilizing historical data on supplier-contractor transactions. To test the model in practice, we adopt a case study of an international construction company in Finland. The results reveal that a supplier's RFMP score reflects its contribution to the contractor's business; therefore, development investments should vary, based on a supplier's position in the supplier pyramid. This research contributes to the knowledge on supply chain management in construction by combining three approaches - RFM, DEA and the customer pyramid - into a single objective model to categorize suppliers for effective development investments.

An empirical survey of the motives and benefits of adopting guaranteed maximum price and target cost contracts in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guaranteed maximum price; Target cost contracting; Motives; Benefits; Hong Kong		In light of increasing project complexity, constraints on programme schedule and limited budget, there exists a strong call for changes in contracting procedures in construction. Both the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and Target Cost Contracting (TCC) approaches with a gain-share/pain-share arrangement have been advocated to achieve better value for money and more satisfactory project performance. This paper aims to review the prevailing practices of GMP/TCC in general, and explore the motives and benefits of implementing the GMP/TCC scheme in comparison with the traditional fixed-price lump-sum contract in particular. The research study is based on a comprehensive literature review and an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey for evaluating the relative importance of motives and benefits associated with GMP/TCC in Hong Kong. The survey data collected from 45 valid completed questionnaires were analysed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and one-way ANOVA test. The perceived benefits were measured and ranked from the perspectives of the client, contractor and consultant for cross-comparison. The survey findings indicated that the three most common motives of clients behind their decision of adopting GMP/TCC include: (1) to generate an incentive for contractor to achieve cost saving; (2) to develop better working relationship within the project team; and (3) to tap in contractor's expertise in design and innovation. The top three perceived benefits of applying GMP/TCC were found to be: (1) early settlement of final project account; (2) improved partners' working relationship under a partnering arrangement; and (3) capability of integrating contractor's expertise in building designs and innovations prior to construction. The research results are particularly essential in assisting key project stakeholders to realise the potential benefits derived from the use of GMP/TCC contracts and in generating more useful insights into alternative integrated contracting strategies for the construction industry, so as to drive for excellence in overall project performance.

We have focused on the type of design intent that is related to architectural design. We express design intent in terms of function, user requirements, performance, and physical properties of a design description. This paper shows how design intent can guide the contractor's material selection and substitution when faced with a proprietary brand-name-or-equal specification. In such cases, the designer requires the contractor to use a specified material brand or any other material that is ''equal.'' However, the conditions of ''equal'' are usually not explicit. Five algorithms structured in pseudocode terms are provided for such equality interpretation. The paper concludes that a better understanding of design-process knowledge can strengthen the communication between design and construction.

In this research, a risk based fuzzy TOPSIS framework is set up to evaluate and prioritize bidding opportunities. This may help contractors to assign their limited resources to near optimal selected projects. The risks inherent in the nature of every tender, makes systematic risk analysis a prerequisite for any construction company. Proposed framework considers key determining risk factors such as corporate considerations, tender environment, contractual issues, and project specific risks. The methodology implementation has been facilitated by developing a graphical user interface that accepts linguistic terms expressed by main decision groups.

However, the huge international market also gives rise to fierce international competition. This study aims to explore the formation paths of international competitive advantages (ICAs) for HSR contractors. Through a comprehensive literature review, this paper firstly identified the 10 categories of 21 factors at the three covering levels (industry, firm, and project levels) that affect the ICAs of HSR contractors. The factors, categories, hypothetical paths model, and the preliminary questionnaire were refined and verified by the pilot study. Then the proposed paths model was verified through the methods of the partial least squares structural equation modeling and postsurvey interviews. The result validated the 10 significant ICAs paths (named the locomotive model), which could be further classified into two groups: the economic performance-oriented paths and the international reputation oriented paths. Moreover, the result showed the fundamental roles of the industrial triangle engine to the ICAs. This paper contributes to the competitive advantage theory in the field of international HSRs by proposing a verified locomotive model, which is important for the HSR practitioners to recognize in forming paths of ICAs and further developing their competitive strategic plans.

Our work aims to explore how firm-specific capabilities (project management, project administration and innovation) and the geography of its business network shape the success of contractors in winning PPTs, measured as the average value of projects won by the firms. We propose an empirical study of contractors involved in public procurement projects in the construction industry in three Italian regions from 2008 to 2012 employing a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. This methodology allows analysing how different combinations of causal conditions contribute to an outcome. Our research highlights that there are three successful strategies for firms attempting to obtain high-value PPT projects: (1) invest in high-level project management capabilities, engage in business networks with distant clients and intensify innovation capacity; (2) invest in high-level project administration capabilities, engage in business networks with local clients and suppliers (within 100km), report a large number of certifications and show a high innovation capacity; and (3) invest in growth strategies to increase the size of the company.

Contractors' Claims Insurance: A Risk Retention Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SELF-INSURANCE; MORAL HAZARD; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; MANAGEMENT; OPTIONS; MARKETS; PROJECTS; PROTECT; DESIGN	The negative effects of claims and disputes have serious negative impacts on contracting parties, their projects, the construction industry as a whole, and consequently on the nation's economy. This paper explores a method for mitigating the negative effects associated with contractors' claims and disputes using a risk retention approach. This method can help contractors in getting early relief from the financial and economic burdens of construction claims. To meet the goals and objectives of this study, the writers have: (1) investigated the feasibility of pricing insurance premiums using the options pricing theory; (2) explored the applicability of modeling the options pricing theory using Monte Carlo simulation; (3) set up the principles required for optimal design of a risk retention group for construction claims; and (4) tested the possible impact of the newly developed risk retention group using historic data of 10,193 construction projects spanning over 12 different California districts. Pursuant to this study, it was verified that construction claims satisfy the required principles for insurance. Also, based on the used testing framework, the developed risk retention group for construction claims has been proved a success from the insured and insurer sides. It is the writers' hope that this study will lay the basis for a leading risk management technique that could be extended over the nation for the benefit of relieving the negative consequences associated with lengthy claims and disputes resolution in the construction industry.

Much of the research oil improvement of performance of the construction industry has mainly focused Oil contractors and the supply chain. The performance of a client is important because any decision made will affect project Success. Failure oil the part. of the client might lead to stress factors causing significant problems ill Successive stages of the project. This research is an investigation into the roles of the client to find Out whether clients ill the building industry in Uganda are playing their part. Due to the non-specific nature of clients, a guided questionnaire survey was carried out among architects who normally work with different types of clients. The majority of the building clients in Uganda are individuals followed by limited liability companies. It was found out that delay by clients in paying the contractors is a major factor affecting the performance of contractors. Almost all clients do not Support training of the workers in its different forms. Construction works start before the designs are completed and the majority of the variations is due to incomplete briefs and designs. Many clients or their representatives do not attend meetings as regularly as Would have been necessary. This study reveals information that will help clients in their future projects for ensuring successful building project implementation.

There is currently a lack of benchmarking standards for construction. The Houston Business Roundtable has assembled a group of owners and contractors to solicit ideas and compile initial benchmark data for use by the construction industry. The present paper gives a basic introduction to the process of benchmarking and outlines the steps taken by the Roundtable to date. Data collection has been a learning experience for both participating owners and contractors and the project team due to the lack of benchmarking experience and standardization in the industry. The findings to date indicate that within the construction industry, there is a tendency to overestimate total costs by 8% (on average) and underestimate schedule by 8% (on average), while change orders average + 11%. Activities to date represent an important first step toward industry-wide benchmarking standards.

Critical Role of the Learning Transfer Climate in Fostering Innovation in Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Innovation; Learning transfer climate	TRANSFER SYSTEM INVENTORY; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PUBLIC-SECTOR; ENVIRONMENT; VALIDATION; STRATEGY; MODEL	Because learning is a key antecedent to innovative activities, more attention needs to be paid to the climate, within the organization or project settings, that supports learning. The objectives of this paper are (1)to empirically examine the influences of the learning transfer climate on innovation and (2)to investigate how the between-group variability in the learning transfer climates of clients, contractors, and consultants affects innovation. The learning transfer climates are assessed in terms of the task-support and motivational elements adopted from the well-tested questionnaire of the Learning Transfer System Inventory. Based on the 147 survey returns collected from construction participants, factor analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis are conducted (the latter two using the total sample and the subsamples of client developers, contractors, and consultants). It is found from the total sample that openness to change (task-support element), performance-outcome expectations, and performance self-efficacy (motivational elements) are significant predictors of innovation. Whereas a successful construction project requires the interaction of multiple waves of innovation, contributed by various construction participants throughout the project, it is important to acknowledge the heterogeneity of these participants in considering the innovation process. The results also indicate that, with regard to their innovations, the different groups are influenced by different learning transfer climate factors: clients are affected by openness to change and performance self-efficacy; contractors are affected by openness to change; and consultants are affected by performance-outcome expectations. Analysis of these findings leads to a conceptual model of learning transfer climate and interactions between the clients, contractors, and consultants. From the theoretical perspective, the findings of this study lay ground for an interorganizational framework for further innovation-learning transfer studies. From the managerial perspective, this study provides empirical confirmation of the importance of measuring the learning transfer climate in construction organizations and of developing strategies for facilitating an innovation-conducive climate that fits each particular organization.

J	Marinelli, M; Antoniou, F				Marinelli, Marina; Antoniou, Fani			Improving public works' value for money: a new procurement strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						European Union; Public procurement; Procurement process; Major infrastructure projects; Value in construction	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT; COST; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; PROJECTS; RISK; TIME	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a new procurement strategy with the aim to achieve higher value for money (VFM) in public works delivery. Its main innovation lies in the possibility of optional submission of cost-efficient design variants by any interested contractor within the context of an open procedure. The final scope of works incorporates the variants approved, and all contractors are invited to submit a bid for the revised scope and budget. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a piece of applied research presenting the development of a new, cost-effective procurement strategy for public works, geared at the European Union (EU) legal framework. The strategy's feature compilation has been based on comprehensive literature review while numerical data from a real world project were used to demonstrate its financial advantages. Findings The proposed strategy enables the delivery of the best value project at the lowest cost possible. This is achieved through ensuring high competition among competent contractors, improving the cost efficiency of technical solutions, discouraging future scope changes and establishing objectivity, fairness and transparency in the process of contract award. Originality/value The proposed strategy marks a new approach in procurement which enables the delivery of best VFM in public works. Therefore, it makes a valuable contribution towards the achievement of the overarching EU target for efficient public spending.

The current practice for compaction quality control primarily relies on the monitoring of rolling parameters such as rolling passes, speed and vibration of rollers, and lift thickness. Soil samples are randomly collected to evaluate the compactness. This practice is subject to two main limitations. First, the compaction monitoring and measurement are not always comprehensive since limited samples are manually collected. Second, compaction information cannot be disseminated to owners, supervisors, contractors, and operators in timely fashion. In this study, intelligent compaction (IC) technology is leveraged to monitor and control highway compaction quality. Anew measure of compaction quality, compaction power per unit volume (E), is created and used with other IC measurement values such as compaction meter value (CMV) to achieve more reliable monitoring and assessment. Field experiments were conducted. The results demonstrated that the integration of CMV and E in the regression model leads to a higher coefficient of determination than that of using only CMV or E. A real-time monitoring system is developed, which not only evaluates the compaction quality of the entire area, but also synchronizes the compaction information among owners, supervisors, contractors, and operators in real-time. As such, this system cultivates an integrated "operator-contractor-supervisor-owner" quality control mechanism, which can improve the current highway compaction practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a mixed methodology approach, focus group discussions with financier stakeholders in the UK's PFI/PPP industry were used to identify 23 criteria relevant for evaluating completion risk in funding applications. These criteria were put in a questionnaire survey to wider audiences of financiers of PFI/PPP projects in the UK. A series of statistical tests were performed, including reliability analysis, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, descriptive statistics, principal rank agreement factor (PRAF), and regression analysis. After identifying 21 reliable criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk, the general agreement of three major financier stakeholders (senior lenders, equity financiers, and infrastructure financiers) on all criteria were examined through the Kruskal-Wallis test and PRAF. A regression model, constructed and validated with input from another team of expert financiers, revealed five key criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk in PPP megaprojects. These include (1) a construction contractor with years of experience of successful completion of megaprojects, (2) the construction contractor's financial strength, (3) the existence of tried-and-tested technology for the construction of project, (4) the availability of an independent technical consultant (ITC), and (5) the existence of a fixed-price turnkey (FPTK) construction contract.

J	Said, H				Said, Hisham			Modeling and Likelihood Prediction of Prefabrication Feasibility for Electrical Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction materials and method		Electrical contracting firms have consistently pursued industrializing their business through the implementation of prefabrication, lean production, and supply chain integration. Despite the pioneering prefabrication efforts of electrical contractors, there is still no clear understanding of the determinants of electrical prefabrication feasibility in terms of supply chain collaboration and surrounding industry requirements. Accordingly, this paper presents the development of prediction models of prefabrication feasibility for electrical contractors. The research tasks of this study were performed in three main phases. The first phase included various data collection tasks, including conducting semistructured interviews, providing an online questionnaire, and obtaining relevant local economic data of the respondents' metropolitan areas. The second phase involved the utilization of the collected questionnaire responses and economic data to develop logistic regression models that relate the prefabrication feasibility to its statistically significant determinants. The third phase involved validating the developed models by assessing their prediction accuracy and performing extensive sensitivity analysis of their determinants. The findings of this study should prove useful to electrical contractors who need to obtain data-driven assessment of prefabrication feasibility considering their business attributes and surrounding industry parameters. This study presents the two main contributions to the study field of construction prefabrication. First, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on four industry-related determinants: regional economic growth, industry competition, labor cost rate, and worker union resistance. Second, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on two main internal firm-related determinants: building information modeling capability and supply coordination with vendors.

This research formalizes a reengineered workflow process for successful flash tracking, known as cPEpC (little c stands for committed and collaborative engagement of downstream stakeholders at the onset of the project, big P stands for procurement of strategic and long lead items, E stands for engineering, little p stands for procurement of balanced items, and big C stands for construction). The cPEpC model is centered around the notion of the importance of building a fully integrated team by engaging key specialty contractors and vendors early on during the conceptual and detailed scoping phases. cPEpC formalizes the committed involvement of both contractors and specialty contractors as well as facilities operators and managers early in the project. In essence, it enables a construction-driven and operation and maintenance (O&M)-driven design philosophy or method of directing the design development process by injecting into it, at the outset, substantial knowledge and experience about means and methods of construction and considerations for O&M. cPEpC requires a heightened degree of concurrency among procurement, design, and construction, while maintaining safety, quality, and the risk tolerance that is needed to manage the volatility inherent in flash track projects. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by formalizing the cPEpC workflow process and by providing empirical evidence of its implementation in a first-to-market flash track project in the food and consumer products industry.

However, little is known of the factors that may determine the flow of international infrastructure investment to those countries. This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap, first by identifying the determinants of international infrastructure investment, and then by developing a structural equation model to reveal their underlying interrelationships. The structural equation model is applied to country-level data regarding international infrastructure investment with Chinese contractors in 141 countries worldwide over the 9-year period from 2009 to 2017. The results show that three determinants, namely infrastructure quality, labor supply, and investment interdependency, have a positive relationship with a country's international infrastructure investment inflow. However, another determinant, institutional environment, has a significantly negative impact, which suggests that when making foreign infrastructure investment, Chinese contractors enter countries with a comparatively poor institutional environment with substantial political risks. The results also highlight how much a robust infrastructure development plan can help developing countries avoid the poor-infrastructure trap, a situation in which poor infrastructure quality discourages international infrastructure investment. These research findings may assist international infrastructure investment firms to make informed decisions with regard to financing and managing projects and help policymakers who focus on attracting foreign investment in infrastructure.

J	Somboonpisan, J; Limsawasd, C				Somboonpisan, Jakkawarn; Limsawasd, Charinee			Environmental Weight for Bid Evaluation to Promote Sustainability in Highway Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable construction procurement; Green bidding; Environmental weight; Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions	ROAD CONSTRUCTION; EMISSIONS	An effective green bidding mechanism is pressingly needed to drive sustainability awareness in construction projects. Never-theless, several challenges have prevented the success of green bidding implementation in current practice, including difficulty in establishing a powerful bidding preference that has the capability to effectively encourage every construction-oriented party toward sustainability. This paper developed a novel, sustainable bidding model to identify a potential environmental weight for evaluating the environmental impacts using the amount of CO2 emission generated from construction equipment fleet operations. A highway construction project case study in Thailand was used to evaluate the performance and capabilities of the developed model in specifying possible environmental weights toward sustainable bidding. The model facilitated the quantification of different construction equipment mixes and their impact on the environment, based on the cost per kilogram of CO2 equivalent for inclusion in the bidding award preference. The model was validated to investigate the green bidding preference awarded to a contractor. The validation results confirmed the benefit of including the environmental weight in the bidder evaluation to provide better opportunities for contractors pursuing sustainability in hid winning under an impartial and more practicable environment. The developed model contributes to (1) promoting greater practicality in the existing confined green bidding mechanism by incorporating an effective sustainability weight for green performance evaluation of construction bidders and (2) reducing the substantial environmental impacts of construction equipment by offering incentives in the primitive bidding approach to create sustainable initiatives for public works contractors.

The grievance of these disputes, whether it is the number of conflicts or the expense involved in these conflicts, is under discussion. This article examines the reasons for these conflicts in a comprehensive and inclusive manner. Twenty-five respondents with expertise and understanding of most conflicts in the Norwegian construction industry were interviewed. Results from a questionnaire sent to 1799 contractors have also been included in this study. Sixteen reasons for disputes were identified out of which four comprised the root causes. Tender specification and contract understanding came in first followed by "final settlement-payment related", corroborating previous findings. The third and fourth root causes of conflicts were "low priced contracts" and "changes in projects" respectively. Our findings point to design deficiencies and defective contract plans as significant causes of conflicts, confirming the view of construction experts. The third root cause of conflicts might explicate some aspects of the first and second major causes of disputes. It is also important to mention that though this is the general view, one can also see how every group involved in this study interpret major causes of conflicts. Our findings also point to "communication between clients and contractor", "carried out quantities" and "client restriction to time extension" as among the chief causes of conflicts, confirming the view of construction experts. Client understanding of contractors' anxiety and quest for sound contracting process are aspects that Norwegian clients are currently engaging in, for the sake of conflict reduction and prevention in future construction projects.

Model for predicting the performance of project managers at the construction phase of mass house building projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONTEXTUAL PERFORMANCE; TASK-PERFORMANCE; RATINGS	The need to match project managers' (PMs) performance measures onto projects of both unique and similar characteristics has long since been acknowledged by researchers. The need for these measures to reflect the various phases of the project life cycle has also been contended in the recent past. Here, a competency-based multidimensional conceptual model is proposed for mass house building projects (MHBPs). The model reflects both performance behaviors and outcome in predicting the PMs' performances at the conceptual, planning, design, tender, construction, and operational phases of the project life cycle. Adopting a positivist approach, data elicited for the construction phase is analyzed using multiple regression techniques (stepwise selection). Out of a broad range of behavioral metrics identified as the independent variables, the findings suggest the best predictors of PMs' performances in MHBPs at the construction phase are: job knowledge in site layout techniques for repetitive construction works; dedication in helping works contractors achieve works schedule; job knowledge of appropriate technology transfer for repetitive construction works; effective time management practices on house units; ability to provide effective solution to conflicts, simultaneously maintaining good relationships; ease with which works contractors are able to approach the PM and volunteering to help works contractors solve personal problems. ANOVA, multicollineriality, Durbin-Watson, and residual analysis, confirm the goodness of fit. Validation of the model also reflected reasonably high predictive accuracy suggesting the findings could be generalized. These results indicate that the model can be a reliable tool for predicting the performance of PMs in MHBPs.	[Ahadzie, D. K.; Proverbs, D. G.; Olomolaiye, P.

J	Dikmen, I; Birgonul, MT				Dikmen, I; Birgonul, MT			Strategic perspective of Turkish construction companies	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Whether extensively planned or not, all companies have a strategic perspective which is analogous to the personality of an individual. However, a clear strategic perspective is a must to achieve strategic integration that further leads to competitive advantage. In order to define a strategic perspective, four determinants should be put together: objectives, strategies; competencies; and competitive rules. There are two way linkages among objectives, strategies, and competencies that are affected from competitive forces acting on the market and these interrelations change with respect to company characteristics like size, age, major client, etc. The objective of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of a strategic perspective and present results of a questionnaire carried out to explore the strategic perspectives of Turkish contractors. Objectives, strategies, and competencies of Turkish contractors are analyzed together with competitive rules prevailing in the Turkish construction industry. The determinants of strategic perspective can further be used as a guide for setting a strategic agenda for construction companies with different characteristics and operating in different submarkets.

RETRACTED: Development of automated change order impact detection and quantification system (Retracted article. See vol. 19, pg. 518, 2010)	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review; Retracted Publication						Change orders; Productivity impact; Detection and quantification system		When change orders occur. adjustments in contract price and duration are usually agreed upon through negotiation or stipulated by contract terms and conditions. There are many pricing methods for change orders impact on productivity loss available, but negotiations using these methods do not always result in a contractor and client agreement. The most difficult issue to agree upon is how to quantify the cumulative impact of change orders on overall construction project. Cumulative impact claims imply that the disruption caused by a single change can have a ripple effect on the entire project, beyond the change itself. In order to recover cumulative impact damages, by law, the contractor is required to prove three basic components: liability, causation, and resultant injury (quantum). Of these elements, causation and resultant injury are the most difficult to prove. There has been some research performed to quantify the cumulative impact of change orders on labor productivity. CII and the University of Wisconsin have performed the most recent and extensive study related to this issue. This study used previous CII-Hanna research models to develop an automated system for the detection and quantification of change order impacts. In addition. a project demonstration is included to allow easy understanding for new system users. The developed system provides a simple guide for stakeholders to expedite the resolution of change order related disputes between contractors and owners by providing causation and resultant injury(quantum) analysis on troubled projects.

Drawing on multiple data sources including individual interviews, group interviews, construction documentation, and an expert panel involved in the initiative, the writers identify 26 potential design changes on the project and assess the importance of timing, trade contractor involvement, and the type of design change in determining whether a proposed design change was ultimately integrated into the final construction plans. The writers further consider whether adopted design changes would have occurred in the absence of the safety-in-design initiative and whether the accepted design changes ultimately impacted construction site safety on the project. This analysis of a full-scale safety-in-design initiative provides important insights into how injury prevention efforts in the construction industry can begin upstream by involving designers, engineers, and trade contractors in preconstruction processes.

J	Jaafari, A				Jaafari, A			Twinning time and cost in incentive-based contracts	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The work presented in this paper focuses on contractual management of projects using a unique risk-management-driven strategy in which the twin variables of time and cost play a fundamental role. To illustrate the conceptual basis of this technique, an example project is presented first. Through the application of the writer's methodology to this project it has been shown how an incentive scheme could be set as the main contractual strategy with significant potential savings in both time and cost. The mean and 90% characteristic value for construction duration and cost, respectively, are estimated by the owner first using the writer's probabilistic forecasting method. These are used to specify an incentive scheme within which the two primary risk variables of time and cost ate managed jointly by the owner and the contractor. Contractual issue's such as owner's tender strategy, contractor's risk assessment, scope variation, and rise and fall adjustment have also been considered briefly.

AECO stakeholders, including owners, general contractors, and designers, do not have a benchmark system for them to understand their own performance and know how to improve themselves. A cloud-based BIM performance benchmarking application, BIM Cloud Score (BIMCS), has been proposed to collect BIM performance data from BIM users nationwide in order to allow them to compare their BIM performance with the results collected from their industry peers. This research aims to develop and validate an initial list of metrics that are suitable for the proposed BIM benchmarking application. A survey was conducted in the AECO industry and included BIM authors (architects) and users (contractors) to validate the proposed initial list of metrics. The responses from the survey were used for initializing the metric weights for the benchmarking system. In addition, an analysis of the differences in perception among different groups of respondents showed that out of 26 variables used, the perceived importance of 6 variables was statistically different between BIM authors and BIM users. This result indicates that the surveyed architects and contractors were in agreement with the importance level for most of the variables proposed including model usefulness, model economy, and model productivity. Future adjustments of the metric weights might be needed in the implementation based on the different intended purposes for the BIM models.	[Liu, Rui; Issa, Raja R.

Despite its importance, little research has been conducted to investigate the challenges that contractors and subcontractors face in measuring productivity accurately at the trade level. As a result, this study aims to identify critical challenges in the measurement of trade-level productivity and to explore plausible solutions for these challenges in order to improve productivity assessment in the industry. On the basis of an extensive literature review and a survey and interviews with industry experts, a total of 17 critical challenges and 24 plausible solutions were identified and analyzed statistically. The findings from this study will help to shed light on the difficulties that contractors and subcontractors encounter during trade-level productivity measurement, and will identify solutions that can be used effectively to deal with these challenges.

In other cases, rebar suppliers accept hard copies of blueprints and return CAD files featuring different design layers and elements. Under this arrangement, communication between project participants is fragmented and depends solely on the direct input of the participants in a specific task. This paper proposes a business-to-business (13213) e-Work system to improve the approval process for rebar estimation data. This system is composed of extensible markup language-based databases that support essential tasks of the approval process such as design and revision of structural drawings, bidding, shop drawing preparation, revision, and correction, and rebar delivery. The performance of the proposed system is compared with existing industry practices based on data obtained from structural designers, contractors, and rebar suppliers.

The choice of entry mode is crucial for companies when going abroad. The objectives of this study are to (1)establish a systematic classification of the entry modes used in the international engineering field, and (2)identify and analyze the factors that influence the entry-mode choices of Chinese international construction companies (ICCs). Based on a literature review and a survey of 264 cases, a two-dimensional (2D) taxonomy model of the entry modes was established, and six factors significantly impact the choice of entry mode for Chinese ICCs were identified. The findings may help Chinese ICCs learn more about the choices available to them, the factors that influence these choices, and the way these factors influence their choices when venturing abroad.

When there is a concurrent delay by multiple subcontractors, or between the GC and other subcontractor(s), there has not been a uniform approach as to how the liquidated damages are apportioned. Previous research seems to ignore this issue. This paper first reviews some relevant court cases. Using a warehouse project as a case study, it then examines different practices that the GC could take in apportioning damages of concurrent delays to both himself/herself as well as to the responsible subcontractors. Results are very inconsistent between and within the apportionment practices. This supports an alternative hypothesis that apportionment is an important issue. Practitioners should specify which apportionment practice will be used and under what circumstances it will be applied in their subcontracts. Researchers may develop a more consistent and reliable approach for this type of apportionment.

A detailed statistical analysis of 297 projects in the Construction Industry Institute database is used to produce baseline measures of performance and D/IT use. The relationship between these measures is used to assess the economic value of using the technologies. A set of projects that excelled. in the use of WIT and that scored high on performance measures is then examined. These exemplary projects provide a basis for further in-depth analyses through on-site interviews with key project representatives. The results of this study establish that projects benefit from WIT use. Both owners and contractors can expect construction cost savings of approximately 4% by increasing the use of D/IT. For owners there is clear evidence of schedule compression as well. Although the statistical analyses do not support schedule compression benefits for contractors, findings from the on-site interviews provide anecdotal support.

The model was used to identify and compare the level of safety perceived by Taiwanese construction managers including safety managers, contractor managers, public works managers, design and audit managers, owner audit and control managers, and others. Analysis reveals that safety managers have the highest perception of safety while owner audit and control managers have the lowest. Surprisingly, public works managers and design and audit managers have lower levels of perceived safety than do contractor managers. Apparently, reinforcing the perception of safety between these two types of construction personnel is important to reducing construction accidents in Taiwan.

However, there is a long way to go before organizational learning is fully implemented to gain competitive advantage, attain a state of readiness for change and build a capacity to respond and identify future business possibilities. This paper outlines the importance and the principles that underlie organizational learning, and presents a framework for measuring organizational learning as one of the strategies for improving construction business processes. The framework identifies ten dimensions for learning and eight factors that promote organizational generative learning. It provides a methodology for assessing whether organizational learning practices and the factors that induce organizational generative learning are in place and current best practice that characterizes learning organizations. The paper also outlines how a construction contractor can self/third-party audit its organizational learning, which could then act as a catalyst for implementing an organizational learning culture.

In reviewing the documentation of this research, Very few articles were located that dealt with heavy/highway construction in general, and even fewer were found that dealt with bridges in particular. In addition, very little was found in the literature dealing with the effect that the quality of workforce management has on construction productivity. This paper describes the results of four case studies of highway bridge construction performed by established contractors with little bridge building experience, in which workforce management had a significant negative effect on labor productivity. The contractors' lack of experience in bridge construction seemed to be the cause of several problems that plagued each of the four projects. The baseline productivity of each project was calculated, and the loss of labor efficiency was estimated to be 80, 75, 32, and 70%, respectively. The schedule slippage on the four case study projects was estimated to be between 127 and 329%.

These projects enhance public convenience, and are complex and uncertain, involving multiple governmental organizations. The critical success factors (CSFs) of these projects have been identified and prioritized from a main contractors' perspective, to enable project managers to prioritize their efforts and concerns. This study sheds light on CSFs in subway construction projects and contributes to the project delivery success literature with an overarching focus on the contractors' perspectives. Our investigation revealed that, for subway construction projects in Iran, goal setting through clear and realistic project goals, project management competency, competent project team, good cultural fit, top management support and adequate funding throughout the project are the top-ranking CSFs. An extensive body of literature is reviewed, and 140 potential success factors are identified. Then, a focus group has been conducted in which the potential CSFs reduced to 39 success factors. The priorities and ranking of the success factors were evaluated according to the views of 63 project managers of subway projects. The correlation coefficients analysis was used to analyze the results, and it revealed that 23 success factors such as goal setting, top management support and PM competency were perceived to be critical by the respondents. No other research has, until now, found the critical factors leading to success in subway construction industry in Iran. The results have been verified against other research done in other countries.

To effectively reuse these assets, knowledge extraction becomes a significant research area. This paper was designed to explore an approach to conduct knowledge extraction by establishing project risk ontology. Specifically, the study proposed the ontology-based risk management (ORM) framework to enhance the RM performance by improving the RM workflow and knowledge reuse. The ORM framework facilitated the identification, analysis, and response of project risks. This study validated the ORM framework through a case demonstration. Through the implementation and application, the results demonstrated that the ORM framework was able to apply to the RM workflow for contractors, and more importantly, it greatly increased the effectiveness of project RM.

Reza; Arditi, David			Impact of contractor's optimized financing cost on project bid price	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bid price; Financing alternatives; Project financing cost; Cash flow forecast; Work schedules; Lines of credit; Loans	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	The financing cost depends on the incoming and outgoing cash flow throughout the project, and can differ greatly from project to project. This study proposes a model that calculates the expected financing cost based on the cash flow forecast. This approach is more realistic than assuming an approximate percentage of the total cost. The proposed model calculates the bid price using an optimized financing cost that is obtained by selecting an optimum combination of available financing alternatives offered by different lenders. The proposed model minimizes financing cost, reduces the bid price, enhances the competitiveness of the bidder, increases the contractor's negotiating power with a lender by providing an optimum financing schedule, and eliminates the risk of financing surprises during construction. This study investigates the impact of different financing considerations on bid price in three cases to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA.

Safety professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of training practices in safety training sessions were sought in a survey administered to the top 400 contractors in the U.S. The study shows that contractors are sensitive to organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues. Whenever they encounter language problems, they use visual aids, and provide translators and safety guidelines written in workers' own language. Very few statistically significant differences are observed when the findings are analyzed from the point of view of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The contribution of this study is that it conveys the views of safety personnel about how safety learning can be achieved, sustained and improved by addressing organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues in training sessions. It provides project managers with best practices in safety training sessions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Factors leading to construction projects' failure in Jordon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Jordanian construction industry; project failure; construction projects; Drewin's Open Conversion System	COST OVERRUNS; DELAY FACTORS; MANAGEMENT	The construction industry is contemplated as one of the most essential and supportive pillars of the business environment in Jordan. Notwithstanding, the construction industry continues to struggle to achieve higher levels of success. An increasing number of projects in the construction industry have failed. However, research on the causes of failure is scarce. Thus, this study aims to identify the main factors and causes for construction projects' failure in Jordan. To fulfil the study objectives, 50 factors were recognized through a literature review and were categorized referring to Drewin's Open Conversion System; the most widely identified factors were assessed using complied data in a survey of construction industry contractors, consultant engineers and clients, and senior experts' interviews in the sector. The results show that major factors leading to construction projects' failure are related to the internal hierarchy of the system, especially that of the contractor.

In order to obtain the variables and their importance rankings, we firstly developed a thirteen-variable framework of the hidden transaction costs through a literature review and semi-structured interviews. Then we conducted a questionnaire survey to collect the importance of each variable. Based on the results, it is possible to group these variables into five factors reputation, cooperation and trust, emotion, time, and execution of judgments by factor analysis. Lack of future cooperation and contractors' reputation damage are the two most important variables, while for owners, project delay is the most severe hidden transaction cost. The findings provide construction practitioners with a deep understanding of the potential hidden loss. Therefore, they will resolve disputes more rationally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

It explains why the benefits, in terms of time and cost, are not always quantifiable, even though teamwork benefits and close collaboration are apparent. It illustrates, through a number of case studies, the benefits that closer collaboration between clients and key contractors can engender and argues that such benefits will, in the long term, bring about real time and cost savings. The paper briefly describes the types of contract strategies available for this type of work and how these strategies developed over a period of time. The paper provides conclusions regarding the most appropriate contract strategy for the procurement of project work on the site and recommendations regarding actions that need to be taken by the client to ensure optimum efficiency in the future.

Including them all in the evaluation may be beneficial, yet in practice it may generate many complications. A solution is provided by one of the multicriteria analysis methods. The article describes the criteria employed in the evaluation of building material suppliers. One multicriteria analysis method, namely the analytic hierarchical process (AHP), is argued to be a useful alternative. An example of its application involving its basic and the more sophisticated variant, the fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (FAHP) with extent analysis method, is presented. As the results reveal, real decisive problems require methods resembling human reasoning, which is often characterized by uncertainty and subjectivity of evaluation. The real problem presented in the paper proves that the FAHP method may have a practical application. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To make the right decisions on equipment repair, rebuilding, disposal, or equipment fleet optimization to maximize the return of investment, the contractors need to predict the residual value of heavy construction equipment to an acceptable level of accuracy. Current practice of using rule-of-thumb or statistical regression methods cannot satisfactorily capture the dynamic relationship between the residual value of a piece of heavy equipment and its influencing factors, and such rules or models are difficult to integrate into a decision support system. This paper introduces a data mining based approach for estimating the residual value of heavy construction equipment using a predictive data mining model, and its potential benefits on the decision making of construction equipment management. Compared to the current practice of assessing equipment residual values, the proposed approach demonstrates advantages of ease of use, better interpretability, and adequate accuracy.

J	Lu, SK; Yan, H				Lu, Shaokai; Yan, Hong			A comparative study of the measurements of perceived risk among contractors in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perceived risk; Measurement; Risk management; Contractor	PROSPECT-THEORY; PERCEPTIONS; DECISION	Due to the unique character of construction projects, perceived risk is widely used to quantify risks in the construction industry. This study investigates the two main types of measurement of perceived risk used in construction projects: direct measurement and expected utility-based measurement. Project managers from contract firms in China assess 15 independent risks using three different strategies: direct measurement, risk probability and potential impact. The last two are combined to create the expected utility-based measurement. The results show that the risk ranking order obtained from the direct measurement strategy is significantly different from that obtained from the expected utility-based measurement. Moreover, the former measurement is in general a better predictive indicator of relative managerial input than the latter. Based on these conclusions, some suggestions are presented for better risk management and cooperation in the construction industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Quantifying schedule risk in construction projects using Bayesian belief networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bayesian belief networks; Construction projects; Risk management; Scheduling; Delays; Vietnam	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; OWNER; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; OVERTIME; SYSTEM; DELAY	Delays on construction projects cause financial losses for project stakeholders in developing countries. This paper describes how Bayesian belief network (BBN) is applied to quantify the probability of construction project delays in a developing country. Sixteen factors were identified through a questionnaire survey of 166 professionals. Eighteen cause-effect relationships among these factors were obtained through expert interview survey to develop a belief network model. The validity of the proposed model is tested using two realistic case studies. The findings of the study revealed that financial difficulties of owners and contractors, contractor's inadequate experience, and shortage of materials are the main causes of delay on construction projects in Vietnam. The results encourage practitioners to benefit from the BBNs. This approach is general and, as such, it may be applied to other construction projects with minor modi. cations.

The marketing function has come in for particular criticism. This inadequate attention to marketing is also manifested in the paucity of reported research and helpful general literature on the subject. This paper reports on research carried out to address this problem. After a thorough literature review, a questionnaire survey of construction firms was undertaken to investigate their current marketing strategies and practices. The survey results indicate that firms are increasingly realizing the importance of marketing, with contractors being ahead of professional firms in the planning and implementation of marketing activities. It is however noted that marketing is being conducted in an ad hoc manner. Only one out of three firms surveyed employ marketing professionals or make use of services of external marketing consultants. There is a need for better understanding of what marketing really is and ways of improving its planning and implementation by both professionals firms and contractors.

System Dynamics Model of Contractual Relationships between Owner and Contractor in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RELATIONSHIP-QUALITY; DISPUTE NEGOTIATION; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; CLAIMS	This paper presents a model for a comprehensive and integrated way to manage owner-contractor (O/C) relationships in the construction stage using various contract management functions. A dynamic hypothesis was developed through interviews with field experts. Subsequently, a general simulation model of O/C relationships was formulated using system dynamics modeling. The model was quantitatively and qualitatively validated using a real construction project. The model can replicate the general behavior during the evolution of O/C relationships. Several individual policies and their different combinations were explored through extensive simulation to analyze their effects on the dynamics of O/C relationships. In general, policy combinations produced better results than individual policies. A critical policy comparison proved that the combined effect of preconstruction stage policies was more influential on relationships in the construction stage than the combined effect of construction stage policies. The best result was found when both policy combinations were implemented simultaneously. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Nasir, Muhammad Kamran; Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

Long-Term Entropy and Profitability Change of United States Public Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								A firm's business composition and the sales volume of each business segment are subject to change depending, to a considerable extent, on the firm's business strategy. These changes were first weighted and represented as a single index, referred to by scholars in strategic management and industrial organization research fields as "firm entropy," then the impact of firm entropy on firms' profitability was assessed over 12 years. The performance differences between contractor and noncontractor firms, as well as focused and diversified firms, were compared through a longitudinal data analysis technique within a hierarchical linear modeling framework. Two hypotheses were formulated based on firm diversification theories and previous research findings. These hypotheses were tested according to the modeling outcomes, and implications are presented. The research findings indicate that the entropy changed constantly for both contractor and noncontractor firms. In addition, the level of firms' long-term profitability supports the argument that the construction industry is highly competitive and mature.

J	Andalib, R; Hoseini, A; Gatmiri, B				Andalib, Reza; Hoseini, Abdollah; Gatmiri, Behrouz			A stochastic model of cash flow forecasting considering delays in owners' payments	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Delay; interim payments; construction finance; intertemporal correlation; uncertainty	PROFITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY; PROJECTS; IMPACT	Delays in progress payments have always been one of the most aggravating difficulties, threatening the desired profit margin and should be considered based on the owners' financial records at the bidding stage. However, previous models have often ignored the probabilistic nature of cash inflow. The conducted research endeavours to develop a new stochastic simulation-based framework for forecasting the cash flow of the construction projects considering the owners' payment history in previous projects and intertemporal correlation between successive progress payments. This process involves introducing the Budget Realization Index, with probabilistic nature, whose underlying distribution is determined based on the owners' behaviour. The model was applied to four real projects in Iran. The financing costs inflicted on the contractors stood in the range of the simulation results in the uncertainty level of 50-80%. Therefore, the proposed systematic framework would appropriately perform for forecasting contractors' financial status through the project.

J	Hegazy, T; Zhang, KH				Hegazy, T; Zhang, KH			Daily windows delay analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						computer applications; construction management; information management; delay time; contractors; claims		Critical path method delay analysis techniques are widely applied in the construction industry, with the windows method being regarded as technologically advantageous. The approach looks at different schedule snapshots (windows) throughout the project and analyzes the contractor versus owner responsibility for delaying the critical paths. Accordingly, decisions regarding time and/or cost compensation could be made. While the technique is beneficial, it is computationally intensive and produces different results with different window sizes. Commercial software provide little support in this regard and the analysis is usually done manually. In this paper, a modified windows approach is introduced with computerized daily analysis of delays so that accurate and repeatable results are produced. The new approach is coupled with a new representation of progress information and is readily usable by professionals and researchers to evaluate project delays. Details of the daily analysis are introduced along with two case studies that demonstrate its advantages over the traditional windows approach. A downloadable version is made available for experimental use by researchers and professionals.

Since the China Environmental Protection Bureau recently enacted to implement the environmental supervision system in construction project supervision, contractors have to pay greater attention to adopt and implement EM in construction. In this regard, this paper presents an integrative methodology (E+) for dynamic EIA in construction, which integrates various EM approaches with a general EMS process throughout all construction stages in a construction project. The E+ is expected to effectively and efficiently assist contractors to enhance their environmental performances in China. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given the growing complexity of projects and the increased number of failed and abandoned projects, the necessity to implement constructability in projects has become more tangible. Although the effects of lack of quantitative definition of constructability role in the traditional construction approaches are evident and have led to lack of coordination in performance of construction projects, so far no comprehensive quantitative approach has been considered to analyze the obstacles to constructability implementation. This study aims to identify and categorize the obstacles to facilitating the presence of contractors in the early stages of planning and design to implement constructability. In this study a comprehensive list of obstacles to constructability implementation is developed as a questionnaire. This questionnaire was presented to the experts, active in the field of construction. Finally, its results were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis method. Totally, 63 obstacles were questioned, then they were categorized by some of the experts of this industry into five categories of macro factors, including contractual, environmental, managerial, technical, and organizational. The significance of this study is due to this fact that identifying and categorizing the key obstacles to constructability implementation provides a useful reference for managers and owners of the construction industry to identify and develop solutions to resolve them. Identifying the obstacles to the presence of contractors in the planning and design stage and having a quantitative view toward this issue affects project implementability. In this regard, one can present more effective solutions to facilitate the presence of contractors in the early stages of design and also improves the effectiveness of constructability.

Because of the complexity in linking the cause of the productivity loss to the change order, the relationship is not well understood. The contractor must prove with a credible calculation that the productivity loss was a result of the change order issued by the owner to be able to receive compensation. Compared to all available productivity loss quantification methods, the measured mile approach is considered the most acceptable and popular in litigation. This study is a discourse on the understanding, use, and potential application of system dynamics within quantifying change orders' impact on labor productivity. The model boundary, including Endogenous and Exogenous variables, are identified. After determining the parameters used in modeling, the CLD is constructed to understand the system structure better. A system dynamics model is developed using Vensim software, verified, validated, and utilized to quantitatively measure the influence of the change in the project scope on labor productivity. To examine the applicability of the proposed model, it has been implemented to a real highway construction case study, and the impacts of various variables on labor productivity loss have been studied using the data for two completed highway construction projects from FDOT. The study can be applied to construction projects that faced change orders, and as a result of these changes, the contractor's performance was affected. The proposed model can be used to determine the primary sources that result in labor productivity loss on a specific type of task.

ESTABLISHING A COORDINATION SYSTEM FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ORGANIZATIONS BY SIMULATING HUMAN BODY CIRCULATORY SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coordination system; circulatory system; coordination needs and supply; construction projects	MEDIA RICHNESS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Construction projects are highly fragmented with many participants and activities involved during construction, so coordination is complicated and critical for project organizations. The physiological functions of the human body such as the circulatory system are natural and effective. This study established a coordination system for construction projects by simulating the circulatory system to improve work effectiveness. The contractor has to coordinate the owner and suppliers, that is, like the heart does to the brain and various organs. A procedure was also developed and illustrated through a case study to use the system practically. The contractor engineer acting as a receptor evaluates coordination needs derived from project uncertainty and equivocality and collect time spent on coordination with various parties. Coordination time or amount is adjusted when coordination supply does not meet needs. This procedure can be applied on construction project organizations to plan and execute coordination work.

To enhance the chances of success, contractors submitting claims must closely follow the steps stipulated in the contract conditions, provide a breakdown of alleged additional costs and time, and present sufficient documentation. On the other hand, project owners need to follow an overall comprehensive step-by-step procedure for tracking and managing the claims submitted by contractors. The paper presents a claims-management process that could be used by all parties involved in construction. The process identifies the major information-gathering and decision-making milestones as well as the notice and substantiation compliance checkpoints, which are critical to the development of defense arguments as claims are addressed. It further emphasizes the use of tools such as simulation, scheduling, productivity, and economic analysis and other modeling techniques in judging the level of justification and reasonableness of submitted claims.

J	Tran, DQ; Brihac, A; Nguyen, LD; Kwak, YH				Tran, Dai Q.; Brihac, Alex; Nguyen, Long D.; Kwak, Young Hoon			Project Cost Implications of Competitive Guaranteed Maximum Price Contracts	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; DELIVERY; UTILITY; SYSTEM; CHINA; MODEL	Alternative project delivery methods such as design-build (D-B) and construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) or construction-manager at risk (CMR) are typically used in conjunction with best-value or qualification-based procurement and guaranteed maximum price (GMP) or other payment provisions. Recently, a new hybrid contracting strategy called "competitive GMP," in which an alternative delivery method combines with low-bid procurement and "open book" GMP payment provisions, has been used in the construction industry. The objective of this paper is to advance the understanding of the impact of the competitive GMP contracting strategy on project costs. The exploratory structured interviews were conducted to identify the perception of the owners and contractors on selecting a contracting strategy. Three empirical case studies were then performed to examine the cost implications on the competitive GMP contracts. The first two case study projects were delivered using the competitiveGMP, and the third case study project was delivered using the conventional GMP. Each case study was analyzed using a proposed framework that captures the competitive behavior of contractors by evaluating cost and discounts related to direct work, contingency, and construction change orders throughout the project development process. The results showed that the competitive GMP projects generated cost advantages to the owner through various discounts provided during the procurement but did not always attain such saving advantages during the construction. This study contributes to a body of knowledge by examining a new approach to delivering construction projects. The findings from this study also provide guidance for owners and practitioners to better understand the cost implications of competitiveGMP projects throughout the project life.

These organizations need to exchange information to enhance their teamwork. Understanding the information received from other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information from several sources including a building information model (BIM) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction material cost data provided by material suppliers. Currently, it is not easy to integrate the information necessary for cost estimating over the Internet. This paper discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses Semantic Web technology. Semantic Web technology provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this paper relies on BIM, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data expressed in a web ontology language. The approach presented in this paper makes the various sources of estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints or Semantic Web Services. We present an estimating application that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this paper is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, what gets measured gets done. The real scope of quality improvement in construction projects is the difficulty and-maybe-lack of quality measurement methods. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors influencing the quality performance of highway projects in Egypt. Furthermore, this paper also contributes to develop models to measure the quality level of these projects. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is conducted to compile a list of factors influencing the quality of highway projects. The resulting list of factors is subjected to a questionnaire survey which was sent to owners, consultants and contractors of highway projects in Egypt. Furthermore, linear regression analysis and statistical fuzzy approaches are adopted for modeling process. Findings - The survey results show that availability of experienced staff in the owner's and contractor's teams during the project execution, asphalt quality and type used in the construction process, pavement is not designed according to the regional conditions, and contractor's labors and equipment capability are among the most important factors influencing quality performance. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is to develop models to measure the quality of highway projects in Egypt. The first model is based on the linear regression analysis, while the second one is based on a statistical fuzzy approach which is a hybrid approach from the fuzzy logic and regression analysis. Validation of the models reveals that the linear regression and the statistical fuzzy models can accurately assess expected quality of any future highway projects at confidence levels 68.97 and 87.44 percent, respectively.

J	Chan, DWM; Chan, APC; Lam, PTI; Wong, JMW				Chan, Daniel W. M.; Chan, Albert P. C.; Lam, Patrick T. I.; Wong, James M. W.			Empirical Study of the Risks and Difficulties in Implementing Guaranteed Maximum Price and Target Cost Contracts in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guaranteed maximum price; Target cost contracting; Pitfalls; Risks; Difficulties; Hong Kong.		Over the past few decades, both the guaranteed maximum price (GMP) and target cost contracting (TCC) arrangements have been regarded as alternative integrated procurement strategies for clients to mitigate risks, minimize claims, integrate the diverse interests of a complex construction project, and offer incentives to provide value-added services. However, the adoption of GMP/TCC contracts may also generate significant risks and difficulties that merit considerable attention. This paper aims to provide a concise review of the potential pitfalls of the GMP/TCC scheme in general and identifies the key risk factors and potential difficulties associated with GMP/TCC in comparison with other procurement strategies in construction in particular via an empirical survey of clients, contractors, and consultants in Hong Kong. The survey data gleaned from 45 valid replies were analyzed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, and Spearman's rank correlation test. The survey results indicated that "involvement of inexperienced or claim-conscious contractors in a project procured by a GMP/TCC contract" was considered to be the most significant risk factor; while "design development must keep pace with main contractor's program for tendering the domestic subcontractors' works packages" as the major difficulty in implementing GMP/TCC projects. The research findings derived from this study are particularly essential in assisting the contracting parties to mitigate the detriments brought about by potential risks or difficulties when embarking on GMP/TCC contracts. It has also generated valuable insights into developing effective recommendations for alleviating the barriers to GMP/TCC success for future construction projects.	[Chan, Daniel W.

J	van Manen, M; Scholtenhuis, LO; Voordijk, H				van Manen, Mechiel; Scholtenhuis, Leon Olde; Voordijk, Hans			Empirically validating five propositions regarding 3D visualizations for subsurface utility projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Underground construction; Three-dimensional (3D) visualization; Subsurface utilities; Computer-aided design	CONSTRUCTION; CAD; SIMULATION; DESIGN; MODELS	Purpose This study aims to empirically validate five propositions about the benefits of three-dimensional (3D) visualizations for the management of subsurface utility projects. Specifically, the authors validate whether benefits from 3D in the literature of building construction project management also apply to subsurface utility projects and map them using a taxonomy of project complexity levels. Design/methodology/approach A multiple case study of three utility construction projects was carried out during which the first author was involved in the daily work practices at a utility contractor. 3D visualizations of existing project models were developed, and design and construction meetings were conducted. Practitioners' interactions with and reflections on these 3D visualizations were noted. Observational data from the three project types were matched with the five propositions to determine where benefits of 3D visualizations manifested themselves. Findings Practitioners found that 3D visualizations had most merit in crowded urban environments when constructing rigid pipelines. All propositions were validated and evaluated as beneficial in subsurface utility projects of complexity level C3. It is shown that in urban projects with rigid pipelines (project with the highest complexity level), 3D visualization prevents misunderstanding or misinterpretations and increases efficiency of coordination. It is recommended to implement 3D visualization approaches in such complex projects Originality/value There is only limited evidence on the value 3D visualizations in managing utility projects. This study contributes rich empirical evidence on this value based on a six-month observation period at a subsurface contractor. Their merit was assessed by associating 3D approaches with project complexity levels, which may help utility contractors in strategically implementing 3D applications.

Recession Effects in United States Public Sector Construction Contracting: Focus on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Economic recession; Bidding; Competition; American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009; Cost savings		The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was enacted to support the economy in response to the 2008-2009 global recession. The injection of construction funds into the public sector put pressure on public agencies to award contracts as quickly as possible in an effort to immediately stimulate the economy and help reconstruct the deteriorating infrastructure. This enabled contractors to move from private sector work into the public sector to stay afloat financially. As a result, an increase in competition for public project awards was observed combined with projects being awarded at a fast rate. The main objective of this paper is to investigate evidence of the level of contractor competition and the degree to which public agencies are expediting the award process during the bidding phase on ARRA construction projects. Both positive and negative impacts caused by this dynamic are examined. To achieve this objective, the research looked into the bidding phase of ARRA construction projects from a public agency standpoint. A survey was therefore administered to three federal contracting agencies in order to evaluate bidding timelines, levels of competition, cost savings, and contractor performance. Statistical methods were then used to analyze the data and draw conclusions about the characteristics of ARRA construction projects. The paper also provides recommendations on alternative bidding strategies to public agencies for the potential reduction of negative impacts associated with the expedited and competitive awarding situation caused by the recession.

J	Franz, B; Leicht, R; Molenaar, K; Messner, J				Franz, Bryan; Leicht, Robert; Molenaar, Keith; Messner, John			Impact of Team Integration and Group Cohesion on Project Delivery Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting; Integrated project delivery (IPD); Structural equation modeling (SEM); Collaboration	CONSTRUCTION; COHESIVENESS; DESIGN	The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is often criticized for its fragmented approach to project delivery. Traditional procurement and contracting intentionally serves to isolate designers from contractors to provide checks and balances, but limits opportunities for collaboration. This research presents a structural modeling approach to studying the role of integration in the performance of building construction projects. A sample data set of 204 completed projects was collected to compare cost, schedule, and quality performance under different delivery methods. Integration of project teams was proposed and tested in the form of two latent constructs-team integration and group cohesion-that mediate the link between delivery methods and performance. More integrated teams interacted with more participants from all levels of the building construction process, from designers to specialty trade contractors. These interactions included design charrettes, joint goal setting, and multidisciplinary building information modeling (BIM) uses. The selected project delivery method had a significant effect on team integration. Delivery methods that involved the builder and specialty trade contractors before schematic design achieved higher levels of integration and were more equipped to control project schedule growth. Cohesive teams were characterized by better chemistry, goal commitment, and timeliness of communication. Project delivery methods that included cost transparency with open-book contracts and qualification-based selection of the builder resulted in more cohesive teams and a lower average project cost growth. Additionally, the owner's perception of their turnover experience and building system quality was rated higher for cohesive teams. Understanding how delivery decisions influence the integration and development of their project teams will make building owners more aware of how those decisions ultimately affect the project's performance.

J	Konno, Y				Konno, Yukiko			Analysing Japanese contractor activity on the basis of panel data	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Small to medium-sized enterprises; Default; Construction management; Empirical study; Exit; Panel binary logit	FINANCIAL RATIOS; FAILURE; PREDICTION; RISK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing defaults and exits from public works by prime contractors of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Japanese construction industry. By analysing the data for several years as panel data, this study determines the extent of influence of changes in company characteristics on the defaults and exits. Design/methodology/approach - Using construction company evaluation (Keiei Jikou Sinsa or Keisin) data and by employing the panel binary logit random effect model, this study empirically analyses the construction industry. Findings - This study shows that defaulting and exiting companies have different characteristics. The result shows financial performance indicators, non-financial performance indicators and Keisin scores to significantly affect defaults and exits. In particular, this study finds non- financial performance indicators, such as whether a firm draws insurance, to significantly affect its likelihood to default or exit and the influence varies on the basis of insurance type. Originality/value - The feature of this study is that its analysis focuses not only on defaulting companies but also on exiting companies, defined as those that stop operating as prime contractors for public works but otherwise stay in business. In contrast to existing research, this study distinguishes between defaults and exits and analyses the factors that influence a firm following one of these two outcomes. Moreover, although Keisin data are usually used to determine whether companies qualify to enter bids for public works, they can be applied for an attribution analysis of corporate defaults and exits.

J	Yu, WD; Wang, KW				Yu, Wen-der; Wang, Kwo-Wuu			Best Value or Lowest Bid? A Quantitative Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contractor selection; Procurement; Best value; Quantitative model	CONSTRUCTION	In contrast to traditional price-dominated lowest bid (LB) procurements, best value (BV) procurements select contractors most advantageous to the clients, taking into consideration not only prices but also other factors. Decisions on whether LB or BV approach should be adopted are difficult ones. There is yet to be any objective model developed to back up such decisions. This paper proposes an index named price elasticity of performance (PEP) that may serve as a quantitative measure to reach an objective decision. The theoretical model construction of PEP is also described. Two measures in the individual and market levels of PEP are defined. A design/build construction project is selected as a working example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Potential applications and limitations of the proposed method are also addressed. It is concluded that the proposed PEP method has the potential to resolve the dilemma of pursuing efficiency and avoiding violation of regulations in traditional procurements.

This development will lead to a more rigorous participation from overseas construction professionals in the Chinese construction market. Nevertheless, this participation can only be effective or successful when there is a proper understanding about the construction procurement practice in China. The Chinese construction practice has its own characteristics, such as governmental regulations, professional qualification systems, and procurement systems. These characteristics present a different practice in awarding construction contracts from that in the West. This paper investigates the characteristics of construction business environment in China and identifies the key parameters used in assessing contractors' competitiveness for awarding construction contracts in the market. The parameters are useful tools for assisting contractors in identifying their strength and weakness, thus reengineering actions can be adopted for improving competitiveness. A case study is used to demonstrate how these multiple parameters are used in the process of awarding contracts in the local market.

Assessing usefulness of 4D BIM tools in risk mitigation strategies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						4D Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools; Procurement phase; Risk mitigation strategies; Effectiveness	CONSTRUCTION; CAD; MODELS	With an increasing demand for mitigating the impact of infrastructure projects on their surrounding environment, contractors are demanded to incorporate risk mitigation strategies in their bids for public projects. There is, however, little knowledge available on how 4D BIM tools can best be used during the procurement phase to support the development of more effective risk mitigation strategies. An in-depth qualitative case-study was conducted to understand how the use of 4D BIM tools could support the process of risk mitigation. The case study was the procurement phase of a billion-euro canal lock expansion project in The Netherlands, where each of the competing contractors made use of 4D BIM tools to mitigate planning risks. The findings show how the use of 4D BIM tools could greatly support the development of highly effective risk mitigation strategies. This study extends 4D BIM literature by presenting empirical evidence on the use of 4D BIM tools during the procurement phase of a complex infrastructure project.	[Sloot, R. N. F.; Voordijk, J.

The success of the bid is therefore heavily dependent on the accuracy of that estimate, meaning that sufficient resources should be allocated to the estimation process. This paper develops a novel optimization model for simultaneously determining the bid markup and the resources that should be allocated to cost estimation. We begin by deriving optimality conditions for this simultaneous optimization model and illustrating them with numerical examples, for which purpose only we assume a single competitor and uniformly distributed estimation errors. To analyze a more realistic situation, we then examine computational solutions to our model. Through these two approaches, we investigate the effects of the bid markup decision and resource allocation on the contractor's expected profit, and we highlight the significance in competitive bidding of the markup and allocation.

This places a firm in a competitive position. Recent development points to the need for implementing capital budgeting in construction organizations due to the capital-intensive nature of construction business. The aim here is to investigate the trends in the practice of capital budget evaluation among construction contractors operating in Hong Kong over a 20-year period. A longitudinal survey approach is used; four cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 1994 and 2014. The findings indicate that formal financial evaluation' is the most common technique used for capital budget evaluation. In addition, the practice of capital budget evaluation is more pronounced in the large-sized firms. A comparative analysis of the results of the four surveys reveals that there are variations in the degree and frequency of use of capital budget evaluation techniques over the study period. Further research is needed to understand the challenges associated with the use of sophisticated capital budget evaluation techniques in the construction industry of Hong Kong.

J	Liu, L; Borman, M; Gao, J				Liu, Li; Borman, Mark; Gao, Jun			Delivering complex engineering projects: Reexamining organizational control theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational control; Output control; Input control; Behavior control; Clan control; Control mode interaction; Project performance	INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN	The delivery performance of complex engineering projects, such as infrastructure projects, is poor and shows no sign of significant improvement. Most of these projects have been delivered by a contractor organization for a client usually a public or statutory agency. To ensure expected outcomes, the client typically employs "control instruments", such as specifying outputs, directing behaviors, selecting contractors and building relationships, to influence, or control, delivery by the contractors. The dominant literature informing the choice of control instruments is derived from organizational control theory, which primarily focuses on the exercise of control within a single organization and assumes that different types of control function independently. The persistent poor delivery performance of infrastructure projects suggests a need to revisit the recommendations of organizational control theory. While a number of papers have identified the potential of combining control instruments and the need to take into account the influence of operating in a client contractor context the mechanics and influence of specific interactions remain little understood. A case study of the delivery of the Open Pool Australian Lightwater reactor (OPAL) Nuclear Research Reactor Project in Australia, documents how the various controls employed interacted and jointly impacted on the delivery outcome. The findings start the process of further developing control theory and offer a number of practical suggestions for combining control types for practitioners. There are two main contributions to theory by this study. First, it adds support to the view that the factors influencing the principal's choice of control modes are more complex than depicted by the control theory framework. Second, it enriches the emerging balance of control literature (Cardinal et al. 2004), suggesting that it is not only the number of control modes that determines performance but also the interactions between them. Thus not only is the appropriate choice of control modes based on more than task programmability and outcome measurability, it appears that interactions between control modes also play an important role. In the case studied a combination of input, output and clan control was seen as forming an effective combination. It was also assessed to be important to avoid behavior control due to the interaction effect between behavior control and output control when employing such a grouping. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, to many people, the value of information systems to their business is vague and elusive. Existing studies on the value of information systems are not specifically focused on small to medium size specialty contractors such as electrical contractors. In addition, with an intention to demonstrate the value of information systems to the improvement of operations or business of all relevant companies, those studies typically do not look into the impact of information systems on the competitive advantage of individual companies. This paper argues that such a generalization of the value of information systems, although valuable to both practitioners and researchers, may have overlooked the fact that the value of information systems needs to be reflected through improved competitive advantage of a company and the competitive advantage is company specific. Thus, the examination of different effects of information systems on individual companies can generate useful insight into the value of information systems because such a strategy leads to a better understanding of the relationships between information systems and the competitive advantage of individual companies. With such a perspective, this study applies a case study strategy to study five small to medium size electrical construction companies based on the resource-based view theory. The case studies show that the observed electrical construction companies are well equipped in terms of physical information infrastructure in relation to their business objectives regardless of company size. However, their capabilities of strategically integrating information systems with their business plans and with their external business partners are general lacking, compared with their physical information system infrastructure. This is partly because many electrical contractors do not fully understand that there are many different forms of information systems that have different impacts on gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. This paper then conjectures that the existing imbalanced application of information systems may not lead to the improved competitive advantage of electrical construction companies, which in turn prevent many contractors from clearly seeing the value of the information systems. Thus, the paper further points out that a plan for the systematical implementation of information systems in a company is very important. However, the successful development of such a plan depends on a better understanding of electrical contactors on the concepts of information system capabilities, competitive advantage, and their relationships.

Although subcontracting is a usual phenomenon in the construction industry, insufficient attention to the subcontractor selection strategy may pose some major threats to a project. Having in mind the significance of such risks, the optimization of subcontractor selection is essential for the success of the project. The importance of risk management in selecting subcontractors and the direct relation between risks and returns in most projects are two main motives for using the concept of portfolio in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to propose a model to allocate the best portion of project's task to some subcontractors in order to reach the optimized portfolio of subcontractors and main contractor. This is a new approach in the subcontractor management; therefore, after presenting the model, an illustrative example will be presented for better understanding.

Experiences of other companies should constitute an important part of organizational memory so that a construction company may have the chance to learn from the experiences of others and modify its behavior in the light of acquired knowledge. Within this study, a case-based reasoning (CBR) decision support tool is constructed to demonstrate how experiences of competitors in international markets may be used by contractors, to support international market selection decisions. 215 cases from the Turkish construction industry have been used to build the model, namely CBR-INT. The reliability of CBR-INT in predicting potential profitability of international projects and the level of competitiveness of Turkish contractors is around 90%. Moreover, CBR-INT has proven to be an effective tool for practitioners due to its high explanation capability and ease of use. Using the conceptual framework of CBR-INT, different CBR models can also be constructed for other countries.

Significant factors influencing the bid mark-up decision of infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Competitive bidding; contractor; infrastructure projects; bid mark-up; Sri Lanka	CONSTRUCTION; CONTRACTORS	Tender estimates play a vital role in achieving bid successes. A bid price which has an optimum mark-up is governed by many factors. The research aims to identify the significant factors influencing the bid mark-up decision of infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. Using a literature review, semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey, the study identifies nine significant factors influencing the mark-up decision of infrastructure projects. The identified significant factors are 'estimated direct cost', 'competitiveness of other bids', 'type of work', 'project duration', 'the ability to predict pre-tender estimate', 'project location', 'reliability of the company estimate', 'number of bidders' and 'need for work', respectively. The study also reveals potential relationships between the identified significant factors and bid mark-up based on case studies. Amongst, 'reliability of the company estimate', 'number of bidders' and 'type of work' have shown positive relationships with mark-up. The contents should be of interest to bidders and researchers in construction.	[Perera, B. A. K. S.; Wijewickrama, M. K. C. S.] Univ Moratuwa, Dept Bldg Econ, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka; [Ranaweera, W. R.

It is believed that a pipeline of projects could succeed in triggering contractors' enthusiasm and increasing competition. This paper theoretically assesses whether the pipeline serves as an effective tool to levy this barrier to entry. A theoretical model and a simulation experiment that mimics the tendering process with heterogeneity in the bidders' cost structure are presented. In particular, the impact on the ex ante bid preparation effort willingness and the mark-ups is assessed by heuristically approximating the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A statistical scenario analysis approves that mark-ups are lower when more projects are included in the pipeline, leading to fiercer price competition and a lower government procurement cost. Nonetheless, the incentive creation with respect to investment efforts is limited according to the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Cash flow projections for selected TxDoT highway projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RESOURCES	In planning for contractor payments, an owner with multiple projects needs to estimate the amount of money to be paid to contractors in coining months. For an owner as large as the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDoT), one is faced with the problem of organizing the budget to ensure that there are sufficient funds for all projects. This investigation was requested by TxDoT to provide a tool to forecast future project payments. Recent account summaries of TxDoT projects from 2001 to 2003 were analyzed for creating mathematical models representing monthly payments for various projects. The data were organized into categories of project types and subcategories of project contract amount. A fourth degree polynomial regression analysis was run on the data and the regression curve, when statistically significant, was taken to be the forecast payment curve. Finally, a computer program was developed to implement the results of the investigation for TxDoT's needs. The methodology provided will help other highway agencies to create their own equations to better predict project cash flows and trends. This investigation might also benefit researchers in projecting cash flows and trends, while also allowing for improvements.

This paper reports on models constructed to predict performance of DB and DBB projects on 11 areas, using project-specific data collected from 87 building projects. The study included collecting, checking, and validating industry data, and the statistical development of multivariate linear regression models for predicting project performance. Robust models are developed to predict construction and delivery speeds of DB and DBB projects. Gross floor area of the project is the most significant factor affecting speed. Besides this, for DBB projects, contractors' design ability, and adequacy of plant and equipment would ensure speedy completion of the projects. For DB projects, if the contract period is allowed to vary during tender evaluation, this would slow down the project. Robust models to predict turnover and system quality of DB projects are also constructed. A DB contractor's track record is an important variable. They must have completed past projects to acceptable quality and have ability in financial, health and safety management.

Therefore the contractor needs to ensure engineering man-hours (MH) in order to estimate project costs accurately as well as carry out the accepted orders. In this paper, we develop MH based order acceptance strategies and investigate their effects on the total expected profit through a long-term operation in EPC projects under a competitive bidding situation. To this end we build a simulation model describing relations among the volume of MH for cost estimation, accepted orders, revenues, and profits in EPC projects. Using our model, we show that the strategy, which maintains the appropriate balance of MH for cost estimation and project execution under the variability of accepted orders with competitive bidding situations, improves the total expected profit in EPC projects.

Analysis of hand-arm vibration risk to highway utilities maintenance and repair operatives	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Health and safety; Hand-arm vibration; Mechanical equipment; Utilities workers	EXPOSURE	Hand-arm vibration (HAV) is an occupational hazard to workers using hand-held mechanical equipment. Highway utilities maintenance and repair operatives (HUMRo) use an array of such equipment; their risk is assessed as a basis to inform health and safety management, in particular, as a first step in helping establish a semi-automated risk assessment system within a collaborating national (GB) utility contractor organisation. A work study regime is implemented with the collaborating contractor to record HUMRo's use of mechanical hand-held equipment during typical working days. Analyses on these data determine average daily HAV exposure levels and these are evaluated against UK legislative benchmarks. The majority of HUMRo are exposed below the legislative "action" level; while 15% were above this, of which 1.5% of these exceeded the defined legal maximum exposure. Workers performing "opening up/services" work type on "gas supply" equipment might be at most exposure risk; as are "alpha-males" who tend to use mechanical equipment more than their work colleagues.

J	ABUDAYYEH, O				ABUDAYYEH, O			PARTNERING - A TEAM BUILDING APPROACH TO QUALITY CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The main objective during a construction project is to deliver a quality product in a timely, cost-effective, and safe manner. However, due to the risky and competitive nature of construction contracting, conflicting objectives among the different parties involved in a contract are bound to occur. In many instances this leads to expensive claims and litigation. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has adopted an approach called ''partnering'' to define its relationship with its contractors in an attempt to reduce or eliminate claims and litigation. The partnering approach relies on the fact that the best conflict-resolution strategy is one that prevents conflicts from occurring. Therefore, the main objective of partnering is to encourage all parties of a contract to change their relationships from adversarial to cooperative, by building a friendly environment with all parties acting as members of one team. This change in relationships requires changes in attitudes to achieve mutual trust, respect, and open communication among all parties involved. The paper presents and describes the partnering process as implemented by Caltrans. It also presents, as an example, a complete partnering agreement between Caltrans and one of its contractors.

Underpricing in Social Infrastructure Projects: Combating the Institutionalization of the Winner's Curse	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Auction; Bid; Brazil; Infrastructure; Procurement; Underpricing; Winner's curse	AUCTIONS; TENDERS; PRICES	Research examining underpricing in social infrastructure projects has been limited (e.g., schools), yet this is a reality that confronts many governments worldwide. The upshot of underpricing is often contractual claims and delays, which can harm the social and economic well-being of citizens. Cognizant of experiencing potential cost overruns, this paper demonstrates that agencies within the Brazilian public sector institutionalized the winner's curse to ensure their infrastructure projects did not exceed their budgets. This action resulted in contractors abandoning works before they were completed and, in doing so, being subjected to contractual sanctions. For the government agencies, this led to increased costs because an alternative contractor was required to complete works. The decision to accept a low bid, therefore, had the opposite of the desired effect because the final project costs exceeded their budgets. It is proposed that government agencies introduce an irresponsible bid threshold, which acts as a benchmark for determining a bid's disqualification to address the winner's curse phenomenon.

J	Tang, YQ; Chen, YQ; Hua, YY; Fu, YC				Tang, Yinqiu; Chen, Yongqiang; Hua, Yuanyuan; Fu, Yongcheng			Impacts of risk allocation on conflict negotiation costs in construction projects: Does managerial control matter?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Conflict negotiation costs; Risk allocation; Managerial control; Transaction cost economics	POST TRANSACTION COSTS; OPPORTUNISM; PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; TRUST; CONTRACTS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS	The negotiation costs for project participants to resolve conflicts significantly undermine the project performance, but how to reduce these costs remains largely unexplored. This study proposes that risk allocation in the contract between the client and contractor will impact the conflict negotiation costs and managerial controls of the client will moderate this relationship. Hypotheses were tested with a sample of 226 projects collected from Chinese construction firms. The results show that conflict negotiation costs will increase with more risks allocated to the contractor. Moreover, behavior control of the client strengthens this positive relationship but outcome control weakens it. These findings offer a nuanced understanding of how conflict negotiation costs occur and contribute to the project governance literature by exploring how ex-post governance (managerial control) aligns with exante governance (risk allocation). Practitioners can benefit from this study by understanding how to formulate risk allocation strategies and exercise different managerial controls.

However, many projects experience extensive delays and thereby exceed initial time and cost estimates. Construction delay is considered to be one of the most recurring problems in the construction industry and it has an adverse effect on project success in terms of time, cost, quality, and safety. This study is conducted to investigate the time performance of road construction projects in the West Bank in Palestine to identify the causes of delay and their severity according to contractors and consultants through a questionnaire survey. The field survey included 34 contractors and 30 consultants. A total of 52 causes of delay were identified during the research. The survey concluded that the top five severe delay causes are political situation, segmentation of the West Bank and limited movement between areas, award project to lowest bid price, progress payment delay by owner, and shortage of equipment.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk management; Identification; Assessment; Mitigation; Cost performance; Capability; International construction projects	CONSTRUCTION; CONTRACTORS; UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Risk identification, assessment, and mitigation have been widely used for effective risk management in international construction projects. However, contractors sometimes cannot know what risk exists, and even when they identify the risk, they sometimes do not know the impact on project cost or how well it can be mitigated after award. Thus, this study analyzes 20,008 risk data points, which are composed of checked risk before bid, actual risk after award, and residual risk after mitigation, and shows that 15% of unidentified risks before a bid actually happen as risks after award, 33% of identified risks are underassessed, and 62% of actual risks are not mitigated after award. This study examines the influence of risk identification performance on assessment and mitigation performance and which risk management phase impacts cost performance more. This study also shows risk factors that are not well identified, assessed, and mitigated. These results help in managing practical risk control and identify which risk control should be studied further. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Project services are typically complex and abstract, and hence their benefits are difficult to directly explicate. The aim is to investigate how contractors and suppliers can overcome this dilemma and exercise value-based selling in terms of the typical services they provide. A design science inspired study was used to create a service configurator addressing the dilemma. At the same time the configurator provided a means for studying the value identification and communication process in six sales projects. It is concluded that contractors and suppliers ought to approach customer value by looking for problems that create uncertainty in the underlying investment and to match them with suitable services. Key in communicating the value of the services is to focus on creating certainty as to the parties' ability to cope with the uncertainty in the investment with the help of these services.

This paper proposes a new and practical methodology to capture and represent construction project knowledge by using project-based Communities of practice (Cops) approach. Using project-based CoPs concepts, project participants and engineers can get an overview of available knowledge in core project areas and take appropriate management in tacit and explicit knowledge. This study proposes a Construction Project Cops-based Knowledge Management (ConPCKM) system for use by general contractors during the construction phase. The ConPCKM is then applied in selected case study of a construction building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge. The combined results demonstrate that a ConPCKM-like system can be an effective tool for tacit knowledge management by utilizing the CoPs approach and web technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When implementing BIM, however, individual firms inherently safeguard their self-interests regardless of the fact that inter-firm cooperation might reap joint BIM benefits for a project overall, which epitomizes a typical problem of moral hazards in project-based organizations. This paper develops an outcome-linked benefit sharing model that considers sharing joint BIM benefits among stakeholders including designers, contractors, and clients for tracking moral hazards therein. By modeling stakeholders' behaviors as evolutionary games within a principal agent formalism, it has been deducted that (1) designers/contractors could be incentivized to cooperate had each stakeholder received a share higher than the quotient of BIM costs over value-creation in the design/construction phase; and (2) how joint BIM benefits can be more than noncooperation outcomes is key for clients to support BIM implementation.

Subcontractor schedule control method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Trade coordination and claims documentation is a challenge on any project, particularly for specialty subcontractors. The writers introduce a schedule control method initiated by the subcontractor, which facilitates coordination and communication between a subcontractor and other project participants as well as documentation to the prime contractor. A case study illustrates the preparation of a trade-specific critical path method (CPM) schedule, which is updated on a regular basis. The writers also address the interrelationship between the CPM schedule, internal reporting, schedule of values, and labor tracking. It is difficult to ensure that all subcontractor-produced documentation is complementary, but it is well worth the effort when it comes to supporting a claim. Monthly schedule updates and narratives communicate the conflicts, issues, and schedule constraints the subcontractor experiences or anticipates on a project, thereby providing contractually required notice to the prime contractor during the project. This increases the likelihood of resolving issues during the project, while simultaneously protecting a subcontractor's position if change order requests are denied or if back charges are levied prompting a subcontractor to enforce its rights, execute a claim, or proceed to litigation.

A real option model links uncertainty to the value of an underlying traded asset, providing an objective measure of this managerial flexibility. A case study that investigated the value of options to extend a general contractor's software platform showed that it is possible to construct a real option model which measures the value of this flexibility, since the major risk (the architect's adoption rate) is external to the investing organization. In another case study. a contractor evaluated the value of the pilot project in view of the information it is expected to generate. Since the risks are internal. a decision analysis model is used instead of a binary option model. The results show that it is possible to quantify the Value of managerial flexibility for IT investments in the architecture, engineering, and Construction industry, but that the proper method to use is contingent oil the nature of the investment project.

Therefore, accuracy of construction project cost estimates is pivotal in project success. Several studies have determined factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates. Comparatively less information is available for construction industries in developing countries. This study identified factors influencing the accuracy of cost estimates for construction projects in Pakistan. Cost data was collected for 46 completed construction projects. Four dimensions 60 factors were considered. Dimensions included: project characteristics, project team, estimating procedures, and (costing related) information items. A rigorous analysis framework based on principal component analysis and regression analysis was used. Involvement of the contractor in the estimation procedure and labour rates were found to be the most significant factors. Early involvement of the contractor can result in realistic estimates through timely input from subcontractors, materials suppliers and manufacturers among others. This also helps in controlling labour costs as most of the construction projects in Pakistan employ labour through subcontractors.

The objective of this study is to develop an Artificial Intelligence Quality Inspection Model (AI-QIM) that can execute quality inspection on steel bars at the construction site. The proposed AI-QIM is built on the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) technique, which can perform instance segmentation of steel bars. This object detection technique is integrated with a stereo vision camera to generate information on steel bar installation. A contractor can use the proposed AI-QIM to estimate the quantity, spacing, diameter, and length of steel bars during quality inspection. A sample case study indicated that the AI-QIM yielded a maximum relative error of 3% when measuring steel bar spacing and a maximum relative error of 8% when measuring steel bar lengths within a range of 1-2 m from a stereo camera.

From the case project, 472 value-assignable BIM issues were derived, and they were quantified regarding various aspects, such as the BIM utilization value and BIM contribution value, using a contract budget (CB). It was found that BIM has contributed to identifying and/or resolving issues whose contractual values are as much as 15.92% of the total direct cost of the project. In addition, a survey of trade contractors was conducted to determine how much they think BIM has contributed to their works, which is defined as the BIM sensible value. It was also shown that the higher utilization and contribution of BIM were accompanied by a higher sensible value, which trade contractors experienced regarding the cost reduction and construction period acceleration.

J	Stenbeck, T				Stenbeck, Torbjoern			Quantifying effects of incentives in a rail maintenance performance-based contract	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HIGHWAY PROJECTS	Methods to quantify and evaluate quality become important when lump sum and performance contracts replace traditional unit-price or cost-plus contracts. Here, a combined graphical and mathematical method is described along with its results when applied on a Swedish rail maintenance contract with incentives. The regression analysis tools in the Excel software were used. The result of the incentives was that train delay decreased about 10% and the number of technical errors decreased about 20%. The improved quality took place without cost increase. The good relation between the owner and the contractor did not suffer from the rise of efficiency. On the contrary, it was improved. With minor modifications and clarifications the owner now intends to use it for in-house contracting, as the case studied, as well as when outsourcing to private companies. With other performance indicators, the elaborated method and lessons learned should be applicable also for other sectors, where a contractor assuring a specified service level during a period of time is paid a bonus depending on degree of fulfillment.

J	Cottrell, DS				Cottrell, DS			Contractor process improvement for enhancing construction productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRENDS	This paper presents a regression model that relates job site productivity to process improvement initiatives (PIIs) executed both before and during construction. Applied during early project stages, this model helps industry practitioners to predict the expected value of labor productivity based on certain inputs related to preconstruction planning and construction execution. The model demonstrates the strong relationship of project performance to a variety of PIIs including design completeness, definition of a project vision statement, testing oversight, and project manager experience and dedication. The correlational research methodology targeted 75 projects representing approximately $274.53 million in civil construction. The data collection effort considered 45 PIIs (independent variables) using quantitative and qualitative measures. The modeling technique involved the use of multiple linear regression, a method that exploits available data from multiple, independent sources to focus on specific outcomes. The model was developed directly from contractor specific information and subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. The model provides project managers as front line industry practitioners with a deliberate yet practical approach to project management and productivity enhancement. The modeling results include verification analysis and a discussion of the model's usefulness and limitations.

This study aims to examine the relation between conflict management styles and relationship quality and the moderating effect of the level of task conflict on the relation between conflict management styles and relationship quality. Drawing on data from 165 questionnaires distributed to owners and contractors in the construction industry, multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. The research results show that the integrating style is positively related to relationship quality, whereas the compromising style is negatively related to relationship quality. In addition, with an increase in the level of task conflict, the positive effect of the obliging style on relationship quality will be weakened and the positive effect of the avoiding style will be strengthened.

Exploring Coordination Goals of Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coordination goal; Goal achievement; Coordination method; Replacement possibility	MEDIA CHOICE; DEVELOPMENT TEAMS; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; RICHNESS; DESIGN	Effective coordination has been regarded in both theory and practice as a critical factor of success in construction projects. Previous coordination studies have focused on the time spent on coordination, its frequency, and its relationship with performance. However, coordination goals have received less attention, and their relationships with coordination methods and performance are not known. This paper studies coordination methods and goals for construction projects to identify what coordination goals are adopted and to what extent goals are achieved. In the research process, eight coordination methods and six goals were derived. A questionnaire was designed accordingly and sent to seven contractors for survey. Follow-up interviews were conducted with three or four managers and engineers from each contractor. The analysis results indicate that most coordination methods have multiple goals; written coordination methods such as plans, schedules, reports, and contract documents tend to have appropriate goals; and projects performed well by using coordination methods effectively to achieve the coordination goals.

In order to achieve the project objectives, a survey was designed and sent to Michigan roofing contractors. To design an adequate survey, the research team first collected background information using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics online database, published research, and contractor interviews. Of the 48 roofing companies asked to participate, 24 completed the survey. The survey results indicated that hand and finger injuries due to cutting operations and back injuries due to the manual handling of heavy and bulky materials to be the most frequent roofing contracting task/injury combination. Falls from elevations as well as on the same level typically occurred when carrying heavy and bulky materials such as bundles of shingles on slippery and inclined walkng/working surfaces. These findings from this study may assist safety professionals in the construction industry in making effective changes for improving safety and productivity.

J	Vidogah, W; Ndekugri, I				Vidogah, W; Ndekugri, I			Improving management of claims: Contractors' perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	There is high incidence of disputes arising from construction contract claims. Even with the most expert understanding of construction contract clauses and the most equitable risk-allocation regime, claims will continue to present problems if they are poorly managed in practice. The research reported in this paper was aimed at identifying shortcomings, and their causes, in claims-management practice. It consisted of a comprehensive review of literature on the subject, a postal questionnaire survey of, and interviews with, contractors and consultants, and case studies of claims on projects. A major finding is that claims management is not treated as a management function on the same footing as estimating, planning, scheduling, and cost control. It is poorly resourced and performed in an ad hoc manner. As a consequence claims-related issues are too often put in abeyance until project completion when necessary resources are released from recognized functions. Issues, documents, and information normally at the center of disputes have been identified. These have to be the focus in decision making, in training, and in redesigning relevant company information systems, and must change management strategies.

This has been a persistent and pernicious problem encountered by international contractors. Various sets of variables have been suggested in the literature focusing on different aspects of political risk management (PRM) for international construction enterprises (ICEs). It is crucial to identify the relative importance and groupings of these variables. This paper aims to identify critical variables associated with PRM in international construction projects, and to analyze their rankings and underlying relationships. A total of 17 variables were identified through a literature review and consolidated by pilot studies with professionals in the international construction industry. Questionnaire instruments containing the 17 variables were sent out to the practitioners and academics, and 138 completed questionnaires were received. The top five ranked variables for PRM were (1) relationship with governments, (2) misconduct of contractors, (3) experiential knowledge of political risks, (4) relations with power groups, and (5) localization. Factor analysis was used as the data reduction tool and these 17 variables were further grouped into four resource dimensions, as follows: (1) relations, experience, acceptance, and localization; (2) recourse, organization, operation, and technology; (3) growth, ownership, leverage, and diversification; and (4) sustainability, opportunity, integration, and long-term. A management framework with both theoretical and practical meanings was finally developed for successful PRM in international construction projects. The findings would help the ICEs to clarify the highly prioritized variables and underlying factors which could be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the performance of PRM. Successful PRM would provide competitive advantages for the ICEs to survive and prosper in the host construction market, especially in those locations characterized by highly political risks.

J	Awwad, R; Ammoury, M				Awwad, Rita; Ammoury, Michael			Owner's Perspective on Evolution of Bid Prices under Various Price-Driven Bid Selection Methods	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agent-based modeling; Competitive bidding; Price-driven tendering; Simulation; Risk aversion; Average bid; Second low bid	CONTRACTOR SELECTION; DECISION-MAKING; SUPPORT; SYSTEM; MODEL	In the construction industry, it is crucial for owners to select the appropriate contract delivery method to achieve best performance on their projects. The low-bid method has been the most common competitive bid selection approach used for public projects in the US construction industry and worldwide. Although awarding the project to the lowest bid promises transparency in the selection process by considering only one objective criterion (the bid price), it often leads to adversarial relationships, less cooperation among different parties involved in the project, and potential compromise of the project quality. Furthermore, it is often accompanied by a significant number of claims and disputes that often result in cost overruns and schedule delays. Thus, there is a need to explore alternative competitive price-driven bidding methods which can preserve the transparency of the low-bid method and at the same time remedy the inconvenience of unrealistic low bids. This paper uses agent-based modeling to simulate the bidding process dynamics and to observe the long-term evolution of tendered prices and market equilibrium under different competitive tendering approaches including the second low, average, below-average, truncated average, and truncated below-average bidding methods. Whereas most previous bidding literature focused on the contractor's bidding decisions, this is the first study that addresses the owner's concern of choosing the most suitable bidding method for its current project and market conditions. This is achieved by analyzing how the bid criterion defined by each of the aforementioned bidding methods impacts the interaction among competing contractors and their bid price adaptation in the long term. Simulation results show that the below-average bid method is most favored for less-competitive projects, whereas the second low bid and average-bid methods are preferred when the level of competition is high.

J	Li, MS; Ashuri, B				Li, Mingshu; Ashuri, Baabak			Proportional Cox Hazards Model to Quantify the Likelihood of Underestimation in Transportation Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Owner's (engineer's) estimate; Bidding analysis; Cox regression; Survival analysis	CONSTRUCTION PRICE-INDEX; DECISION-MAKING; REGRESSION-MODELS; COST RISK; CONTRACTORS; INDICATORS; PREDICTION; SELECTION	Preparing accurate cost estimates for highway projects always has been challenging for transportation agencies. It is a common problem that the lowest submitted bid significantly deviates from owner's estimate. This might result in project delay or cancellation, budget pressure, and cost overrun, which are problematic for both owner organizations and highway contractors. There is a need to enhance understanding of transportation agencies about the likelihood of underestimation. This research assessed relations of several potential drivers to explain and forecast the likelihood of underestimation. This research for the first time used concepts and methods from survival analysis and applied them into construction bidding process. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was developed which is capable of examining significance of variables representing characteristics of project, bidder, and external (environmental) market, and using them to predict the likelihood of underestimation in transportation projects. The results showed that number of bidders, number of pay items, total number of projects awarded in the same month at state level, project types, producer price index for construction machinery manufacturing, value of construction put in place for commercial, unemployment, and highly active contractors are significant drivers of likelihood of underestimation. This research contributes to the state of knowledge in construction bidding analysis by identifying drivers of the likelihood of underestimation and creating a Cox model to explain and predict the likelihood of underestimation using information available from the identified drivers. It is anticipated that the results will help transportation agencies better understand the extent of risk of deviation between low bids and owner's estimates, prepare more-accurate cost estimates and budgets, and develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies for successful project delivery.

J	Awwad, R; Shdid, CA; Tayeh, R				Awwad, Rita; Shdid, Caesar Abi; Tayeh, Ralph			Agent-Based Model for Simulating Construction Safety Climate in a Market Environment	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agent-based modeling; Construction safety; Contractor behavior	MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; RISK	A strong construction safety climate is sought after by governments, owners, and insurance providers. When making safety policy changes, legislative bodies and construction stakeholders alike try to successfully predict the impact such reformative actions will have on emergent safety patterns. Identifying optimal strategies for improving the market's safety climate is a difficult task to achieve given the complex interactions between the various parties involved. An agent-based model is developed and presented in this case study that mimics the interactions among project stakeholders at the market level within the context of construction safety during both bidding and construction phases. In addition to incorporating various behavioral patterns and financial attributes of contractors and owners, the model makes use of insurance premium models and government fines to simulate safety climate patterns at the project and market levels. The model is shown to be capable of realistically depicting emerging safety patterns in a given environment when reformative actions are initiated by various stakeholders. The model is promising as a tool for policy makers to identify optimal strategies for improving the market safety climate. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Choi, K; Bae, J; Kwak, YH				Choi, Kunhee; Bae, Junseo; Kwak, Young Hoon			OPTID: Optimal Incentives and Disincentives	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Incentive; Contracting; Project acceleration; Road user cost (RUC); Level-of-service; Net present value	MODEL; SCHEDULE; TIME	Contracting agencies must be able to offer incentive/disincentive (I/D) rates greater than the builder's added cost (BAC) of acceleration. Doing so encourages qualified contractors to bid on projects. Most agencies determine I/D amounts either by road user cost (RUC) or as a percentage of the total project cost. Estimating I/D rates that will motivate the expedited delivery of projects, exceed BAC, and remain below the overall monetary savings realized by the contracting agency is an exceedingly daunting task. To overcome this pressing practical challenge, this study developed and validated a novel decision support system that estimates optimized I/D (OPTID) rates. The OPTID model integrates the project duration estimate, contractor's additional cost commitment, and RUC. An optimal I/D rate is then estimated via a systematic seven-step method. The practicality of OPTID was tested using a real-world highway rehabilitation project. The proposed OPTID model will provide local agencies with the first integrated tool that can be used to establish optimal I/D amounts. This research will help decision makers and planners make the most well-informed decisions when utilizing I/D contracting provisions.

Contract Administration Tools for Design-Build and Construction Manager/General Contractor Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; PROCUREMENT	Alternative contracting methods (ACMs) such as design-build (DB) and construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC), when used strategically, have been shown in some studies to offer cost and schedule advantages over design-bid-build. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is promoting the use of ACMs, and agencies are increasingly implementing ACMs. However, state agency ACM manuals and federal guidebooks tend to focus on pre-award activities. A need exists to provide guidance to agencies on how to administer ACM post-award activities effectively in order to realize their benefits. This paper presents 36 tools for ACM contract administration that were collected from 30 project case studies with 18 transportation agencies involving 91 interviewees. Integrated DEFinition (IDEF0) modeling was used to map and compare differences between delivery methods at the functional level, whereas previous ACM models focused on contract relationships and lines of communication.

J	Agarwal, P; Everett, JG				Agarwal, P; Everett, JG			Strategies for construction contractors to reduce workers' compensation costs	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Workers' compensation insurance (WCI) premiums for construction companies are higher than those for most other industries. WCI is increasingly affecting contractors' ability to conduct business and has already made the costs of performing certain types of work in certain states prohibitively expensive. However, there are a number of strategies construction companies can employ to lower their WCI costs. These include the formation of industry groups, safety programs and lobbying for legislative reform. Groups of like-minded employers pool risk and provide better credit worthiness to potential insurers. Insurers in return are able to reduce marketing costs as well as claims processing and safety costs. An effective safety program can also greatly reduce workplace injuries. Multidepartmental and multilevel teams with the support of top management can help establish, implement, and continuously improve safety programs. Along with voluntary measures that an employer can take, it is essential that employers encourage their legislators to cure the workers' compensation system. In states where legislative reform has taken place, losses and premiums have declined significantly. The writers hope that this paper will encourage construction companies to better understand the control they have over their own WCI costs and the benefits of improving their own safety performance.

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of decision-making models evaluating the exact role of TPL providers as drivers for supply chain (SC) integration and optimisation. This study aims to develop a decision-making model for construction supply chain (CSC) optimisation, with possible TPL integration. The proposed model considers two types of purchased materials (type-1 and type-2) and assists the main contractor in determining construction supply chain management (CSCM) strategies, including supplier selection, order quantity determination, and TPL use evaluation. Using the model, the main contractor can take advantage of the TPL provider's warehouse and order larger quantities, if necessary, to obtain lower prices offered by suppliers. Through case examples in Canada, we find that the proposed model performs better in optimising total SC cost, as compared to the model without TPL. Model validations also show that TPL can be conditionally used to improve construction logistics performance and to meet practical requirements targeting issues in the construction industry.

Risk ranking and analysis in target cost contracts: Empirical evidence from the construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Risk analysis; Construction industry; Target cost contracts; Guaranteed maximum price contracts; Hong Kong	PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE	The construction industry is often characterized by the traditional adversarial working relationships between contracting parties. There has been a strong call for applying target cost contracts to align the interest of owners and contractors together. By doing so, it aims to achieve a win-win situation under a partnering arrangement within the construction industry. Even though a multitude of research studies have been undertaken on target cost contracts (TCC) or guaranteed maximum price (GM P) contracts, not many of them have focused on the risk management and analysis of these procurement strategies. This paper aims to identify, rank and compare the key risk factors encountered with these forms of procurement based on an empirical questionnaire survey geared towards the clients, contractors and consultants in Hong Kong. Despite the limited number of completed TCC and GM P (TCC/GMP) construction projects in Hong Kong, the chosen sample was perceived to be truly representative of the survey population. A four-level data analysis framework was applied in this paper, including descriptive statistics, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney U test. The research findings showed that the client group, contractor group and consultant group are in general agreement on the impact of individual risks. The identification of the key risk factors and their relative significance is important in the risk management of target cost contracts and guaranteed maximum price projects, which, if properly done, would enhance the value for money throughout the whole procurement process. This research study also helps various key project stakeholders to be equipped with better knowledge and understanding of TCC/GMP scheme by paying close attention to those high-risk factors and then the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation measures in a proactive manner.

J	Lew, YL; Hassim, S; Muniandy, R; Hua, LT				Lew, Yoke-Lian; Hassim, Salihudin; Muniandy, Ratnasamy; Hua, Law Teik			Structural equation modelling for subcontracting practice: Malaysia chapter	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Questionnaire survey; Management	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS PERFORMANCE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; IMPACTS	Purpose Most of the previous studies conducted on the subject of subcontractors often focussed on a single phase of subcontracting practice; either on registration, selection of subcontractors or on monitoring of subcontractors without much integration to other different phases involved. Thus, on the basis of that reason, the purpose of this paper is to link the gap between different phases of subcontracting practice. This study also attempts to explore the relationships between the key criteria used by general contractors in selecting subcontractors before job awarding (CSSC) and the key criteria used for monitoring subcontractors during construction work (CMSC); which will then include an investigation of the effects these criteria have on project performance (PP). Design/methodology/approach The data obtained from a total of 162 G7 contractors in Malaysia were analysed. The interrelationships between the criteria and the effects of these criteria on PP were investigated simultaneously by employing a single model based on structural equation modelling (SEM) method. Findings The final model has discovered four major criteria that are often considered during the selection of subcontractors namely, communication, relationship, general obligation and resource management of a subcontractor. Meanwhile, the major criteria that are referred to in the monitoring of subcontractors are workmanship, awareness of environment, health and safety and communication and relationship. The four CSSC were found to be interrelated among themselves and affected CMSC during the construction stage. The research also revealed that the criteria used in monitoring subcontractor do affect the performance of a project. Thus, based on the result of this investigation, the monitoring of subcontractor is essential in discerning the performance level of a project. Originality/value An established SEM improves a subcontracting practice by creating platforms for CSSC, CMSC and PP to influence each other. With the gap between selection and monitoring subcontractors are filled, then the prediction of the subcontractors' performance can be made possible.

J	Sabug, BJR; Pheng, LS				Sabug, Bon Jovi Ramos; Pheng, Low Sui			Competitive and entry strategies for UK transnational contractors in the Singapore rail sector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive strategies; entry strategies; international construction; Singapore rail sector; UK transnational contractors	CONSTRUCTION FIRMS; RECESSION	In contributing to achieve the Construction 2025 target to reduce the trade gap in construction products and services by 50% by 2025, UK transnational contractors (UKTCs) must seek key opportunities and improve their competitiveness overseas. The Singapore rail sector is a good case in point; the market is mature, rapidly growing and has a strong pipeline of rail projects scheduled for completion by 2030. Despite the strong historical link between the UK and Singapore, UKTCs have been outnumbered and outperformed in the past decade by their rivals within the Singapore rail sector. This study investigates the competitive strategies that are most significant for UKTCs to improve their competitiveness in the Singapore rail sector. Despite its popularity and generalisability, something is fundamentally missing from Porter's generic typology because it places no emphasis on the entry strategies that are specifically essential for firms that compete overseas. Empirical results obtained from 75 questionnaires and validated in 35 interviews found a combination of Porter's generic typology in addition to entry strategies to be most significant for UKTCs to compete in the Singapore rail sector. The perceived importance of some strategic practices varied significantly between interviewees from different organisation types. Significant correlations were also found between several strategic practices associated with cost leadership and differentiation, while focus and entry strategies appeared to be mutually exclusive. The findings appear to differ from Porter's theoretical proposition that firms should adopt a single strategic approach to gain a competitive advantage and achieve superior performance. Instead, a combination of strategies is feasible and more suitable for the construction industry. A hybrid taxonomic framework that comprises the most significant strategic practices associated with Porter's generic typology in addition to entry strategies is recommended for UKTCs to compete in the Singapore rail sector.

Seventy six articles regarding success in the international construction market in the period 2008-2017 are reviewed to identify the barriers and the competitive advantages that most affect the international success of contractors. The Chi-Square (chi(2)) statistical test is used to verify the influence of the origin and destination countries on these variables. The literature identifies the provision of trained human resources as the most important competitive advantage and cultural differences and political risks as the main barriers. The Chi-Square (chi(2)) test indicates a dependency relationship between the origin country and the competitive advantage "managerial ability" to achieve international success, and between the external barriers "link between countries", "political environment" and "economic environment" with the target market. Results of this paper provide valuable information for any construction company seeking international success.

The results reveal that the networks become dense over time and exhibit distinct scale-free properties. Furthermore, these macrolevel characteristics of network dynamics significantly relate to the structure-based preferential attachment effect, the ownership similarity effect, the geographic proximity effect, the negative scale similarity effect, and the ownership-based individual covariate effect, which operates at a microlevel. The findings not only provide a network view of how construction organizations select subcontractors in projects, but also contribute to broadened understanding of how project-based collaborative networks among firms in the construction industry evolve as complex adaptive systems whose macrolevel dynamics closely relate to a set of micro-organizing mechanisms.

Logistic regression analysis was used to empirically determine which factors have the largest effect on bidding success. Data was collected from 123 bids submitted by several infrastructure companies with subsidiaries in Australia. The analysis found that having a competitive advantage and a local partner, and also not competing against a local company were the most important factors; as they significantly increase the chances of success. However, four other factors, having relevant expertise, resource availability, a previous relationship with the client, and a previous relationship with consortium members, are 'essential' to be able to compete; as the absence of any of these four factors results in bid failure, although having them is not a guarantee of success. Results of this paper provide valuable information for any company considering the opportunity of entering into Australia's infrastructure market as well as for companies that are already present in that country and are considering whether to bid for a specific project.

To seek answers to this question, this study tackles the following questions related to fundamental decisions in the procurement process: 1) For which project owners are likely to employ one delivery method or the other? 2) To which contractor owners tend to award Design-Build projects? and 3) How different are the consequences of the decisions between the two methods in terms of cost and schedule? Economic theories of contract selection suggest that Design-Build would fit better with large, environmentally uncertain, and technologically challenging projects, thereby, requiring better-qualified contractors. However, analyses of comprehensive data on public transportation projects in Florida reveal some misfits between theories and the reality. Regardless, Design-Build seems advantageous to schedule control, while cost advantages of one method over the other is still inconclusive. This study concludes with some implications of these findings for efficient deliveries of public infrastructure projects.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Bhih, M; Hegazy, T				Bhih, Moneer; Hegazy, Tarek			Enhanced But-For Method to Apportion Net Delays and Accelerations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; But-for; Collapsed as-built; Modified but-for; Schedule acceleration; Schedule delay analysis; Forensic analysis		The but-for analysis and its improved modifications have been proposed in the literature to provide a systematic methodology to analyze project delays and accordingly determine the parties' contribution in a manner that does not depend on any party's viewpoint. These methods, however, only apportion net project delays, overlooking net project accelerations that can be owner requested or voluntarily done by the contractor. This technical note thus aims at extending the but-for computations to apportion net schedule accelerations. The proposed enhanced but-for method (EBFM) uses Venn diagrams and set theorem to represent all concurrent delays/accelerations that are shared among the three project parties: owner, contractor, and third party. Accordingly, a mathematical formulation has been proposed to compute each party's contribution to net project delays and/or accelerations. A case study is used to demonstrate the EBFM method and prove its usefulness to both researchers and practitioners. EBFM offers a computational approach to help prepare and settle claim disputes in a fair and repeatable way, considering a variety of project conditions that include delays and accelerations.

A previously unanswered question is, Did the costs of the actual work zone impacts that were avoided justify the incentives paid? This paper answers that question affirmatively based on an evaluation of 20 I/D projects in Missouri from 2008 to 2011. Road user costs (RUC) were used to quantify work zone impacts and included travel delays, vehicle operating costs, and crash costs. Conditions during construction were compared to after construction. Delay costs and crash costs were computed using published data. For every dollar paid in incentives, approximately 5.3 dollars of RUC savings resulted from the use of I/D. Also, I/D projects had a higher on-time completion percentage and a higher number of bids per call than average projects. However, I/D projects resulted in 4.52% higher deviation from programmed costs and possibly more changes made after the award.

J	Moselhi, O; Alshibani, A				Moselhi, Osama; Alshibani, Adel			Optimization of Earthmoving Operations in Heavy Civil Engineering Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Large scale earthmoving operations require the use of heavy and costly construction equipment. Optimum utilization of equipment is a crucial task for the project management team. It can result in substantial savings in both time and cost of earthmoving operations. This paper presents optimization model for earthmoving operations in heavy civil engineering projects. The developed model is designed to assist general contractor in optimizing planning of earthmoving operations. The model utilizes genetic algorithm, linear programming, and geographic information systems to support its management functions. The model assists in planning earthmoving operations; taking into consideration: (1) availability of resources to contractors; (2) project budget and/or time constraints, if any; (3) scope of work; (4) construction site conditions; (5) soil type; (6) project indirect cost; and (7) equipment characteristics. The model also determines the quantities of earth to be moved from different borrow pits and those to be placed at different landfill sites to meet optimization objective set by the user and to meet project constraints. The model has been implemented in prototype software, using object-oriented programming. Two numerical example projects are presented to validate and demonstrate the use of the developed model in optimizing earthmoving operations.

The following combinations of PC project conditions leading to schedule delays were identified: (1) the use of multiple types of PC components and nonuse of building information modeling (BIM) for schedule management; (2) PC construction included in the critical path, insufficient experience of the contractor in PC projects, and nonuse of BIM for schedule management; and (3) nonresidential building project, insufficient experience of the contractor in PC projects, and non-use of BIM for schedule management. To understand these findings more deeply, this research further investigated the relationships of the use of BIM with other schedule delay factors based on focus groups. The PC project schedule delay leading indicators identified in this research can help construction managers to mitigate schedule delay risks at an early stage in PC projects.

Mobilizing Institutional Knowledge for International Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institutional differences; Institutional knowledge; International business; Knowledge management; Organizations	DYNAMIC THEORY; FIRMS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY	Multinational engineering consultants, contractors, and real estate developers work on projects in various countries, encountering many challenges that arise from cross-national differences. These projects frequently bring together diverse participants in an unfamiliar environment. In these situations, firms are exposed to different "institutions"-regulations, norms, and cognitive-cultural beliefs-that can increase misunderstandings, delays, and costs. Knowledge of these institutional elements is critical to create a project that is both locally sustainable and profitable for the firm. Departing from institutional theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, we conduct exploratory research based on interviews from informants in 15 firms to identify the methods that multinational real estate developers, contractors, and engineers use to transfer and mobilize institutional knowledge for their global projects. We contribute to theory by adding to the developing literature that uses institutional theory to examine differences on global projects and by analyzing the specific methods firms use to transfer institutional knowledge internally, across projects and divisions. Ultimately, this research, combined with the work of others, can develop new processes for firms engaged in international projects to enhance their mobilization of institutional knowledge, and thereby improve the outcomes of international projects.

Drawing on the resourcebased view theory, this study examines the moderating effects of government support on the relationships between adhocracy culture, market orientation and sustainable construction among 172 large contractors in Malaysia, using a 61 item instrument. Both mailed and personally administered survey methods with structured questionnaires were used to collect the data. Using a partial least squared - structural equation modelling for the data analysis, we found a significant positive relationship between the adhocracy culture and sustainable construction. Similarly, the results also indicated that market orientation had a significant positive relationship with sustainable construction. The study also found a significant but negative relationship between government support and sustainable construction. As expected, government support was found to moderate the relationship between adhocracy culture and sustainable construction, while an insignificant interaction effect was found between market orientation and sustainable construction. Implications for practice and future research were also discussed.

Operators and contractors are confronted with an array of challenges that hinder the cost-effective and safe completion of decommissioning projects. The costing and technological challenges that confront the oil and gas industry are identified using a series of semistructured interviews. One of the most prominent challenges identified was the inability to reliably estimate the volume and cost of work to be undertaken. This is exacerbated by a supply chain with limited capacity and experience in executing decommissioning projects in this fledgling sector in the oil and gas industry. As a result of the analysis that is undertaken, it is recommended that an industrywide decommissioning forum be established to facilitate the sharing of experience and knowledge, particularly with regard to cost information so that operators and contractors can ameliorate the planning and management of the decommissioning process.

Strong interorganizational relationships are considered relevant to project performance. Previous research has focused on contractual relationships in direct supply chains, with little attention to suppliers and their non-contractual relationships. This study develops and tests a framework of relationship strength and its antecedents in the non-contractual relationship between suppliers and designers as third parties in construction projects. The intent is to identify the key factors relevant to enhancing the supplier's non-contractual relationships with designers. The results reveal the supplier's activeness and technical capability as antecedents to trust, and supplier's technical capability and supplier designer cooperation beyond project boundaries as antecedents to commitment. The different antecedents of trust and commitment imply alternative pathways for strengthening non-contractual relationships in construction projects, thereby deviating from activities in contractual relationships. Further research is proposed on other types of third parties and other antecedents of commitment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Pham, VHS; Phan, KA				Pham, Vu Hong Son; Phan, Kim Anh			Elaboration of willingness to pay and compensation demanded for costly bid preparation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Noncooperative game; bid compensation; construction bidding process; Nash equilibrium		Encouraging contractors to dedicate considerable effort in the bidding process is the cornerstone of a successful bid management system. However, the bid preparation cost is usually high, and preparing a high-quality tender submission is time-intensive. To motivate contractors to devote additional effort to bid preparation, owners should consider compensating the second-best bidder. However, the practice of this bid compensation notion is still rare and lacks empirical demonstrations. Hence, the study aims to expand the existing tender management system by developing a contingency standpoint on how to effectively utilize bid compensation. The proposed model focuses on the effects of bid compensation and develops appropriate compensation strategies for the owner and bidder alike. Game theory was adopted for modelling the dynamics and deriving high-effort strategies from bid compensation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Nash equilibrium solutions under bid compensation, quantitative formula, and qualitative implications for the formation of bid compensation strategies. Based on the analysis, the offering of bid compensation can effectively encourage the bidders to make extra efforts in the early stage. Conditions for the effective use of bid compensation and strategic implications for practitioners are identified and suggested accordingly.

D.; Teo, Pauline; Morrison, John			Revisiting Quality Failure Costs in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Benchmarking; Nonconformances; Quality failures; Quality performance; Rework; Contracting	REWORK COSTS; DESIGN	Quality failure costs have been reported to range from less than 1 to over 20% of a project's original contract's value (OCV). Inconsistencies in their definition and determination have rendered such costs often being cited inappropriately to support a case for addressing poor quality in construction. Quality failure costs, which are expressed in the form of nonconformances (NCRs) costs, are derived and analyzed for 218 projects delivered by a contractor between 2006 and 2015. A total of 7,082 NCRs are categorized and quantified in accordance to their cost, and the differences among project type, procurement, and contract size are statistically examined. The analysis revealed that (1)mean NCR costs were 0.18% of OCV; (2)structural steel and concrete subcontracted works had the highest levels of NCRs; and (3)differences were found in the cost of NCRs among different procurement methods and contract sizes. The research provides the international construction community with invaluable insight into the real costs of quality failure that have been borne by a contractor. Thus, the paper makes a call to reinvigorate the need to engage with performance benchmarking so as to engender process improvement throughout the international construction industry.	[Love, Peter E.

Case Studies of the Allocation and Reduction of Time Buffer through Use of the Last Planner System	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Planning; Uncertainty; Buffer; Labor and personnel issues		Buffers are used in construction to absorb variation caused by the inherent complexity and uncertainty present in construction projects. The case studies presented here focus on time buffer added to construction task durations. For this research, time buffer is defined as extra time added during planning to individual task durations to compensate for uncertainty and protect against workflow variation. Two case studies were conducted with one involving a mechanical contractor and the other involving a large general contractor. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by: (1) investigating the time buffer impact on project performance; (2) empirically demonstrating the effect of last planner system (LPS) on reducing time buffer and increasing percent planned complete (PPC); and (3) examining the buffer trends of different trades and activity types. The findings demonstrate LPS as an example of an effective planning strategy for construction managers in improving project performance and help them understand what drives the need for buffer in their construction schedules, allowing efforts focused on strategically addressing the most critical areas of concern and uncertainty.

Friedman's Bidding Model: Errors and Corrections	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive bidding; Friedman; Construction; Management; Contracting; Probability models; Bidding models; Optimal bid; Markup; Probability to win; Expected profit; Mistakes; Errors		Friedman's classic 1956 bidding model for the case in which a contractor is bidding against an unknown number of opponents applies Friedman's multiplicative model for the probability to win, which applies only when bidding against at least one opponent, to the case in which the number of opponents is zero, to which it does not apply. Thus, both the resulting general equations and the examples for the probability to win, as well as those for expected profit, are incorrect. Moreover, the example graphs offered are not true representations of these incorrect equations. The causes and consequences of these errors are described in detail and new equations are offered as replacements. Exact graphs of the incorrect equations as well as of their replacements are presented. Four new bidding models are developed by which a contractor can find the optimum bid price that maximizes expected profit when the number of opponents is unknown and could be zero. These include the case of an owner with a reserve price that leads to a distinct and novel bidding strategy.

D.; Kakarapalli, Raghu			An Empirical Analysis of Project Performance Outcomes for Best-Value Procurement in Design-Bid-Build Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Best-value procurement; Design-bid-build delivery method; Cost and schedule performance; Owner's satisfaction		The best-value (BV) procurement method has been increasingly used by owners in the context of design-bid-build (DBB) project delivery. The objective of this study was to determine whether a statistically significant difference existed between project performance outcomes (cost growth, schedule growth, and owner's satisfaction) and the qualifications of the selected contractor as rated by the owner's evaluation team during the bidding stage. The data sample consisted of 118 DBB vertical institutional projects, including project data on awarded cost and schedule information as well as the owner's evaluation results of common qualifications-based evaluation criteria. Inferential testing of the performance variables showed that contractors who received the highest qualifications scores for technical proposals, past performance, and interviews achieved better project performance in several areas of schedule growth and owner's satisfaction. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying the extent to which higher qualifications correspond with incrementally improved project performance outcomes, which may help project owners make more informed procurement decisions.

J	Rose, T; Manley, K				Rose, Timothy; Manley, Karen			Motivational misalignment on an iconic infrastructure project	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction projects; contracts; goal commitment; incentives; motivation; organizational management; performance	GOAL-SETTING PROCESS; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; WORK MOTIVATION; JUSTICE; COMPENSATION; CONSTRUCTION; COMMITMENT; REWARDS; TRUST; RISK	Aligning the motivation of contractors and consultants to perform better than 'business-as-usual' on a construction project is a complex undertaking and the costs of failure are high as misalignment can compromise project outcomes. Despite the potential benefits of effective alignment, there is still little information about optimally designing procurement approaches that promote motivation towards 'above business-as-usual' goals. A contribution to this knowledge gap is made by examining the negative drivers of motivation in a major construction project that, despite a wide range of performance enhancing incentives, failed to exceed business-as-usual performance. A case study of an iconic infrastructure project in Australia shows that incentives provided to contractors and consultants to achieve above business-as-usual performance can be compromised by a range of negative motivation drivers including: inequitable contractual risk allocation; late involvement of key stakeholders; inconsistency between contract intentions and relationship intentions; inadequate price negotiation; inconsistency between the project performance goals and incentive goals; and unfair and inflexible incentive performance measurement processes. Future quantitative research is planned to determine the generalizability of these results.

However, how learning is facilitated in the inter-organizational project remains under-developed in the literature. Design/methodology/approach This research analyses the exploitative learning process in the longest tunnel project on land in the Netherlands realized in a densely populated area. Data were collected through archived documents, in-depth interviews, site visits in the ethnographic research to analyze the actors, the daily practices and social situations in projects. Findings The empirical findings indicate that exploitative learning is promoted positively between the owner and the contractor and internally within the contractor. The most significant change that the exploitative learning process has led to is the change in mindset toward the collaboration. Project culture is considered to be shaped by exploitative learning in the inter-organizational project. However, there is a gap between the transfer of knowledge from the inter-organizational project to the parent organization. Originality/value The findings have implications for understanding learning in the inter-organizational project setting.

J	El-Abbasy, MS; Elazouni, A; Zayed, T				El-Abbasy, Mohammed S.; Elazouni, Ashraf; Zayed, Tarek			Generic Scheduling Optimization Model for Multiple Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Scheduling; Multiobjective optimization; Multiple construction projects; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)	GENETIC ALGORITHM; RULES; FLOW	In the construction industry, contractors usually manage and execute multiple projects simultaneously. Typically, this situation involves sharing different types of resources, including cash, equipment, and manpower. The management of resources becomes a major challenge in these problems. In this situation, contractors are concerned with optimizing a number of different objectives which often conflict with one another. These objectives include duration, total cost, financing cost, required cash, profit, and resource fluctuations. This paper presents the development of a multiobjective scheduling optimization model for multiple construction projects using the fast elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The purpose of the proposed model is to obtain optimal trade-offs between different projects' objectives. The scheduling optimization model comprises submodels of project scheduling, resource allocation and leveling, and cash flow forecasting. The optimization model was successfully implemented and tested using different case studies of multiple projects of different sizes. The developed model is expected to help construction companies in solving the problems of prioritizing projects under resource-conflict conditions, allocating limited resources, and optimizing all the projects' multiple objectives under certain funding limits.

J	Pan, M; Pan, W				Pan, Mi; Pan, Wei			Understanding the Determinants of Construction Robot Adoption: Perspective of Building Contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction robots; Innovation adoption; Building; Technology-organization-environment	INNOVATION; MODEL; RISE	Construction robots have emerged as a revolutionary technology for buildings. However, real-world adoption is still limited. Little is known how the decision of adopting construction robots or not is made in organizations, which inhibits the benefits of robots from being fully realized. This paper aims to investigate the determinants affecting construction robot adoption for building works at the organizational level. Drawing on the technology-organization-environment framework, a research model with 11 hypotheses on determinants was developed and empirically evaluated via a survey of 94 typical building contractors in Hong Kong using a partial least-squares structural equation modeling technique. The results indicate that relative advantage, top management support, organizational readiness, market competitive pressure, and high costs are significantly related to the adoption, among which top management support is most influential. A two-stage conceptual framework is derived that provides theoretical insights on the determinants and reveals the complexities and influence dynamics of determinants on the adoption during technology development. The findings offer useful suggestions for the effective development of robots for building works and lay a foundation for construction innovation adoption in a wider context.

In the aftermath of these disasters, there is a present challenge to quickly analyze various reconstruction plans and assess their impacts on restoring transportation services. This paper presents a new methodology for optimizing post-disaster reconstruction plans for transportation networks with superior computational efficiency employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model is capable of optimizing transportation recovery projects prioritization and contractors assignment in order to simultaneously: (1)accelerate networks recovery; and (2)minimize public expenditures. The full methodology is presented in two companion publications, where the focus of this paper is to propose new methods for (1)decomposing traffic analysis; (2)assessing the traffic and cost performance of reconstruction plans; (3)reducing the massive solution search space; and (4)phasing the use of mixed-integer linear programming to optimize the problem. An illustrative example is presented throughout the paper to demonstrate the implementation phases. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A financial decision making framework for construction projects based on 5D Building Information Modeling (BIM)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						5D BIM; Cash flow analysis; Financial decision making; Project financing	MANAGEMENT; COST; SCHEDULE; FAILURE	Analyzing cash flows and undertaking project financing are important for contractors in managing construction projects. Traditional methods for cash flow analysis are based on the manual integration of time and cost information. However, the manual integration process can be automated by using five-dimensional building information modeling (5D BIM). Previous studies on 5D BIM have focused on estimating cash outflow rather than cash inflow analysis and project financing. This paper proposes a BIM-based methodology framework for cash flow analysis and project financing. The framework considers contract types and retainage to estimate cash inflow, and cash outflow patterns for equipment, manpower, and materials in order to more accurately measure cash outflow. Project financing scenarios can also be evaluated using the framework. Illustrative examples are demonstrated to validate the proposed framework by considering two what-if scenarios. Results show that the framework can help contractors analyze the cash flow and make appropriate decisions for different design and payment scheme alternatives in construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach Critical narrative and opinion based on personal worldview, experiential knowledge and future insight/vision. Findings It is argued that enduring CS research has become somewhat stagnated. It has over-emphasised selection process models vis-a-vis the reliability and currency of their processing components, and has inadequately focused on achieving real-life impact. Research limitations/implications The principal implication is to engender constructive debate in the field and encourage a change of direction in CS research. The limitation is that this response reflects a personal view and so will be open to challenge. Practical implications Potential to encourage increased practicability, accessibility and generalisability of CS research products, leading to their increased real-life take-up and improved impact on practice. Social implications For society, the optimal implications would be improved project outcomes; healthier stakeholders' financial interests; and an enhanced constructed environment.

The goals of public utility owners and U.S. federal tax regulations suggest why design-build-operate (DBO) projects have been selected over other procurement processes. The research reported in this paper contributes to the body of knowledge and benefits industry practitioners, by identifying tax regulations and best practices that when jointly considered improve the project delivery selection process, while enhancing risk-mitigation efforts on DBO water and wastewater projects. A procurement selection process using multiple-criteria decision and financial risk analyses is presented to select the most economically sustainable delivery method given each project's characteristics. A present value analysis establishes a range of values that takes into account variables that will potentially impact lifecycle costs. The selection of the procurement process and the contractor is based on best value where financial risks to the concerned government and contractor are mitigated through dynamic service fee agreements in accordance with current U.S. federal tax regulations.

Usually the area is divided into several zones to accommodate the renovation in sections. A zone closure forces the users to take an alternative route that could be longer or more congested. The impact of such rerouting must be minimized by properly planning the work crews. In this paper, the author proposed a model using simulation to estimate the impact of the extra walking distance on pedestrians, and ant colony optimization to search for the near-optimal work crew schedule. The author applied the model to the renovation of a public pedestrian area in a villa resort. It provides a near-optimal work schedule for a variety of work crews with minimal walking time delay for the pedestrians. This model takes into account total wallking time delay, average delay per person, and total duration in order to evaluate all alternatives to allow both owner and contractor to decide the appropriate work schedule.

Evidence from mining mega-projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complexity; Project procurement; Contracts; Make or buy; Prior interactions	KNOWLEDGE-BASED EXAMINATION; FORMAL CONTRACTS; TECHNOLOGICAL-DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNANCE; MECHANISMS; CHOICE; TRUST; FIRM; BOUNDARIES; SERVICES	We investigated mining mega-projects to analyze the effect of project complexity on (1) the "make vs. ally" choice for the implementation stage of a project and the "fixed-price vs. cost-plus" contractual choice when an "ally" was chosen; and (2) the extent to which prior interactions with a contractor at earlier stages of the same project impact the "fixed-price vs. cost-plus" decision. Contrary to expectations, we found that project complexity promoted allying with external contractors but that, as expected, it promoted the use of cost-plus contracts. In addition, we found that prior interactions promoted fixed-price contracts and that this effect was more pronounced for less complex projects in which learning and knowledge acquired during prior stages was more easily transferred into contractual detail. Given that fixed prices are contractually heavier than cost-plus agreements, this result suggests that complexity strongly moderates the relationship between formal and relational contracting.

J	Bremer, W; Kok, K				Bremer, W; Kok, K			The Dutch construction industry: a combination of competition and corporatism	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Dutch construction; construction business system; research and development; training public sector procurement; institutional change; price-ringing; corporatism; risk avoidance; contractors; contracting system; The Netherlands		The development of the contracting system in the Dutch construction industry is presented in terms of the poldermodel of corporatist institutions. Although stiff competition exists between construction firms, corporatist arrangements have developed in The Netherlands to reduce high costs and risks to individual firms. The implications and benefits of these corporatist arrangements for research and development, employment, training and housing investment are assessed and concluded to provide well-balanced market competition and regulation while maintaining long-term needs. The relationships between the many parties in the construction process (clients, investors, contractors, suppliers, designers and regulatory authorities) are analysed. A particular area in which corporatist arrangements have predominated is in tendering for public works, where there is a tradition of price-ringing on the grounds that this reduces transaction costs and favours social solidarity. However, the European Commission has banned such arrangements on competition grounds. The Dutch construction industry's attempts to reform tendering arrangements on a more competitive basis, while retaining the valued aspects of the poldermodel are assessed.

J	Zhang, XL; Yu, Y; He, WT; Chen, Y				Zhang, Xinli; Yu, Yu; He, Wentao; Chen, Yuan			Bidding Decision-Support Model for Construction Projects Based on Projection Pursuit Learning Method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding decision; Construction project; Data-driven; Multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM); Projection pursuit learning	REGRESSION; SELECTION; AHP	The decision of whether or not to bid is a crucial task for contractors in the construction industry because multiple attributes with the features of uncertainty and ambiguity can enhance the complexity and difficulty of decision-making. Meanwhile, traditional methods for bidding decisions primarily depend on experience and the subjective evaluation of decision-makers, and it is difficult to develop a more reliable model through data-driven techniques when the historical bidding data is limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a bidding decision-support model for construction projects using the projection pursuit learning method (PPLM), which can explain the characteristic rules in the bidding of contractors through the digging of information of previous bids and help one to make a reasonable and effective decision for bidding a new project. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the novel model. The results indicate that the method developed based on the training set can correctly classify 10 testing projects and has a better performance in fitting and predicting the accuracy of bidding decisions when compared with other approaches.

To address this issue, this paper develops a novel ELECTRE III-based MCGDM approach for bid evaluation, in which generalized comparative linguistic expressions (GCLEs) are used to evaluate bidder performance. The collected GCLEs are further transformed into possibility-distributionbased hesitant fuzzy linguistic-term sets (HFLTSs) to facilitate the qualitative construction of individual expertise. A consensus-reaching process is introduced to promote decisions that are agreed upon by experts and thereby ensure an enhanced state of mutual agreement among the experts. Subsequently, an integrated subjective-objective approach is proposed to calculate criterion weights and to implement an ELECTRE III-based method that incorporates HFLTS possibility distributions, which allows us to treat the indetermination, imprecision, and uncertainty embedded in appraisals of alternative-criterion decisions when evaluating bids. The potential advantages of the proposed approach are validated by a real-life contractor-selection case.

The objective of the research is to identify unique features of whole life project management and their relationship to building sustainability by using a case study of a social housing project. The procurement method adopted in the case study is private finance initiative (PFI), which requires private contractors to manage the whole life of a project. The project reached a financial close in 2007, with a contract period of 30years. Data were collected from multiple sources, including interviews, document reviews, and on-site visits during a three-year period. Based on seven microlevel attributes for building sustainability, data were content-analyzed to discover effective strategies used in whole life project management to achieve the sustainability objectives of the client. The PFI procurement process increased the accountability of the private contractor in sustainability, while the whole life project management approaches smoothed the progress in practicing sustainable construction. The analysis results show that the whole life project management of the different project stages contributes to seven sustainable attributes in a variety of forms.

A framework is introduced that records the legislation, guiding principles and policies influencing government clients towards new professional practices embracing dynamic interactions between people, process and technology. The framework is used to analyse case studies related to two US government client organizations: the General Services Administration (GSA) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The study finds that GSA and NREL are actively seeking innovation and influencing their consultants, contractors and other US government agencies through their policies and programmes, notably by piloting new professional practices associated with integrated project delivery and open communication. The initiatives and their effectiveness are further studied in a broader, international context of emerging best professional practices. Government clients are key agents for leading and motivating change, particularly through capacity-building in other professional services firms and contractors. Government clients can further expand their sphere of positive influence specifically in the assessment and integration of emerging technologies and in the extension of professional service contracts related to building performance and occupant engagement.

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used multicriteria decision tool in civil engineering applications. However, the chief drawback of AHP is that it requires a large number of inputs (pairwise comparisons), which frequently leads to inconsistency in decision making. The main objective of this study is to reduce the number of inputs in AHP without compromising consistency. This study proposes to modify AHP with the use of the additive transitivity property of fuzzy preference relations because it significantly reduces the number of inputs, which minimizes inconsistency. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through a case study for selecting a contractor from six contractors. Inputs were taken from three decision makers for both traditional and proposed AHP, and the rankings obtained by the proposed method were compared with traditional AHP. The comparison revealed the use of a lesser number of inputs in conjunction with additive transitive fuzzy preference relations generated consistent judgments in minimal time.

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES TO ELIMINATE INTERFACE CONFLICTS IN COMPLEX SUPPLY CHAINS OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; interface management; project management; supply chain; integration; conflict; IPD	MANAGEMENT	The supply chains of complex construction projects are characterized by multi-disciplinary participants, adversarial short-term relationships and fragmentations in project delivery procedures. Multi-disciplinary participants tend to make decisions on project activities based on their own objectives and value systems independently with little regard of holistic project performance. The lack of common values results in a limited understanding of how behaviors of one discipline impact on the related disciplines. This has led to tons of interface conflicts which ultimately affect project effectiveness. This paper investigates this problem by discussing Interface Value for the core players to understand the value-driven behaviors on the boundaries among owner and multiple prime contractors in complex construction projects. Two types of interface conflicts are recognized and defined. Value Optimization Strategy is proposed under status quo delivery methods by adjusting and reallocating interface responsibilities between related contractors. Improvements of procurement procedures are the key solutions to interface conflicts. Prospects of integrated project delivery (IPD) in eliminating interface conflicts are also discussed. The paper concludes that Value Optimization Strategy and IPD-based approach are expected to eliminate interface conflicts of complex construction projects, integrate the complex supply chain and lower the potential risks for project delivery delay and cost overrun.

Reuse can be a part of the deconstruction process resulting in cost and environmental benefits. Several studies have identified various design principles that facilitate the deconstruction process. These may consequently maximize the reusability of building components. However, the extent to which these measures are effective is unclear. This study examines the importance of these principles in relation to the reusability of building components. A questionnaire survey investigating design principles based on previous studies was administered to building industry professionals including civil engineers, architects and demolition contractors. It was designed to determine the degree of suitability and relevance of the design principles to the practice of reuse. Over 170 responses were collected and analysed using a number of statistical approaches including ANOVA and factor analysis to identify critical technical design principles (TDPs) and to determine the potential relationships among them. Nine TDPs were identified as highly significant for the practice of reuse. Statistically significant differences between the opinions of demolition contractors and of building designers to eight principles were also determined and are also discussed.

With the increasing complexity and size of the construction projects in India, the number and frequency of claims, also bound to increase, which adversely affects the construction environment. So, an early prediction of these claims is crucial to avoid their costly negative impacts. This paper aimed to develop artificial neural network models to predict the frequency of claims in construction projects. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a total of 39 factors causing claims were identified first, and then refined by Delphi interview with 10 experts. Subsequently, a questionnaire was further developed and disseminated to different owners, contractors, and consultants' organizations working in the Indian construction sector, which received 206 valid replies. The questionnaire data were then utilized to develop and validate the construction claims frequency prediction models. For this, an artificial neural network approach was used to construct the models. These models will help the construction professionals in predicting the frequency of occurrence for different types of claims throughout the course of the project and enable them to select the best strategy available to avoid or mitigate their occurrence at an early stage.

J	Chen, CS; Tsui, YK; Dzeng, RJ; Wang, WC				Chen, Chun-Sung; Tsui, Yu-Kun; Dzeng, Ren-Jye; Wang, Wei-Chih			Application of project-based change management in construction: a case study	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction management; information system; change management; web-based system	DESIGN; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; ORDERS; MODEL	Real-time information is vital to enhance dynamic control and management via information sharing and analysis in order to reduce construction conflicts and project delays. However, most construction project management programs are ineffective for project prompt responses, especially with respect to change management. This work presents a novel construction project management system called the web project-based change management (WPCM) system. The WPCM system responds to changes in information efficiently in order to facilitate change management among project participants (e.g. general contractor, suppliers, and subcontractors) in a construction project environment. Capable of increasing information sharing in construction change management, web-based technology can also provide cost savings via the Internet. A case study involving a commercial building project in Taiwan demonstrates the effectiveness of both the proposed WPCM system and information sharing in change control during the construction phase. In addition to increasing the efficiency of change control and management for a general contractor, as well as dynamic project tracking and management, the proposed system enables subcontractors and suppliers to access and manage the change information timely.

J	Meng, XH; Gallagher, B				Meng, Xianhai; Gallagher, Brendan			The impact of incentive mechanisms on project performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Incentive; Disincentive; Performance; Construction project	TARGET COST CONTRACTS; INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE CONTRACTS; CONSTRUCTION; PRICE	Contractual incentives have been increasingly practised in construction projects. In this study, a questionnaire survey is carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to analyse the relationship between the use of incentives and the performance of a project. The analysis is made in a comparative way. First of all, four payment methods are compared in terms of their impact on cost performance. Secondly, incentive projects are compared with non-incentive projects in terms of time and quality performance. Thirdly, both time and quality performances are compared between the projects with a single incentive and those with multiple incentives. The analysis results provide empirical evidence for the significant impact of incentive mechanisms on project performance. Subsequent to the questionnaire survey, a case study is conducted to examine how to appropriately apply incentives in practice, revealing that the use of incentives aligns the contractor's objectives with the client's expectations in a project and in order to ensure the success of incentive mechanisms the contractor needs to make extra efforts for the enhancement of project management processes, the creation of collaborative working environments, and the motivation of his staff and workforce.

Managing relationships with suppliers and/or subcontractors in such projects is even more critical due to additional dependency on them to complete the job. Yet it is not clear which factors influence such relationships in IEPC projects. This study intends to close this gap in the extant literature. Data has been collected from professionals involved in IEPC projects and it has been investigated how various aspects of relationship with suppliers and/or subcontractors may influence project outcomes. Logistic regression and neural networks have been used to analyze the data and subsequently identify four critical factors: service provided by suppliers and/or subcontractors, continuous improvement, supplier and/or subcontractor delivery reliability, and effective problem solving, which impact IEPC project success to the greatest extent. The findings suggest that the main contractors should pay particular attention to these aspects of relationship management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The risk assessment of PPP projects is essential in ensuring project success. The objective of this study is to develop an Analytic Network Process (ANP) based risk assessment model for hydropower investments, and a tool to facilitate quantification of risk ratings based on this model. The results show that the three most important risk factors that affect the overall risk rating of a PPP hydropower investment are legal risks, contractor/subcontractor risks, and operator risks. In addition, the three most important risk clusters were identified as stakeholders, government requirements, and resources, whereas market was the least important cluster. The tool that measures the risk rating of a PPP of hydropower project was tested on ten real cases, and satisfactory results were obtained in terms of its predictive capability. The contributions of this research include (1) identification of the risk factors and clusters of factors associated with PPP hydropower investments; (2) determination of the priority of each risk factor and cluster; (3) development a tool that guides the investors through the risk assessment of PPP hydropower investments.

The developed EFHNN combines neural networks (NN) and high order neural networks (HONN) into a hybrid neural network (HNN), which acts as the major inference engine and operates with alternating linear and non-linear NN layer connections. Fuzzy logic is employed to sandwich the HNN between a fuzzification and defuzzification layer. The authors developed and applied the EFHNN to assess subcontractors performance by fusing HNN, FL and GA. Enhancing subcontractor performance assessments are crucial in terms of providing to general contractors information on historical contractor performance essential to guiding a selection of appropriate subcontractors for a specific current or future subcontracting need. Results show that the proposed EFHNN may be deployed effectively to achieve optimal mapping of input factors and subcontractor performance output. Moreover, the performance of linear and non-linear (high order) neuron layer connectors in the EFHNN was significantly better than performances achieved by previous models that used singular linear NN.

Lean is an operations strategy prioritizing flow efficiency. In construction, empirical underpinning of operations strategies has been limited. The aim is to capture how perceptions of operations strategy in construction practice aligns with existing theories of operations strategy organized in decision categories. Nine in-depth interviews with contractor middle managers were transcribed and analyzed to capture their perceptions of operations strategies. Results show: (1) decision categories in construction differ from manufacturing, and (2) differences between resource and flow efficient operations strategies exist. A resource efficient strategy focuses cost and delivery as competitive criteria, while customer value is targeted in a flow efficient strategy. Proposed structural decision categories are standardization, organization and production planning, supply chain, and infrastructural decision categories are human resources, continuous improvement, long-term perspective, process vs. project, and performance measurements. Infrastructural categories are more difficult to replicate and render competitive advantage if successfully aligned with business strategy. An operations strategy strictly focused on project delivery, such as lean construction, is not automatically aligned with the business strategy, but can achieve satisfactory project performance.

Causes of claims in road construction projects in the UAE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						claims; construction industry; road projects; United Arab Emirates	MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; DISPUTES; DELAY	Claims are inevitable in construction projects and road construction projects in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are no exception. A claim is a request for time and/or monetary compensation for damages incurred by any party to the contract. The number and frequency of claims have increased over recent years due to the increase in the size and complexity of these projects. These claims result in cost overruns, schedule delays and adversarial relationships amongst the contracting parties. The objective of this paper is to identify and assess the most frequent causes of claims in road construction projects in the UAE in addition to the root causes that contribute to the occurrence of claims. Sixteen causes were identified through a literature review. A survey was then developed and distributed to construction professionals experienced in claims in road construction projects. Fifty-one surveys were completed. The reasons and their root causes were ranked based on the weighted average of the responses. Variation was identified as the most frequent cause of claims, followed by contractor's delay and inadequate site investigation before bidding. The results show that consultants and clients have strong agreement on the ranking of the claims and weak agreement with the contractors.

Proper analysis of compensability and quantum of a delay event is of prime importance. Any delay analysis application can be considered as a result of the combination of contract documents, scheduler, record-keeping mechanism at the site, communication among project participants, delay analyst, and delay analysis methodology. The main purposes of this study are to identify the shortcomings frequently encountered in the implementation of delay analysis applications in all stages of a construction project, to address the responsible element, and to propose a set of rules to overcome these shortcomings and obtain accurate and reliable results. For this purpose, 17 shortcomings were identified. Moreover, an integrated approach is developed which is composed of a set of rules solving all of the identified shortcomings, and a flowchart guiding the parties from scratch until the end of the project.

J	Gransberg, DD; Molenaar, K				Gransberg, DD; Molenaar, K			Analysis of owner's design and construction quality management approaches in design/build projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper explores and classifies current approaches to evaluating quality in design/build (DB) proposals. It does so by a thorough content analysis of 78 requests for proposal (RFPs) for public DB projects with an aggregate contract value of over $3.0 billion advertised between 1997 and 2002. In most DB projects, the owner requires the DB contractor to establish a firm-fixed price on a project that has not yet been designed. Usually, the owner also fixes the project delivery period. In the traditional design/bid/build (DBB) system, quality is fixed through the plans and specifications. Thus, in DBB, with schedule and quality fixed, the cost of construction is the factor in which the owner seeks competition. Conversely, in DB, with cost and schedule fixed, the scope and hence the level of quality is the main element of competition. This paper identifies the six owner approaches to articulating DB quality requirements in their RFPs. The six approaches are quality by qualifications, evaluated program, specified program, performance criteria, specification, and warranty. These are important for DB contractors to understand so that they can craft their proposal in a manner that is both responsive to the owners' requirements and consistent with the owner's system to make the best value contract award decision.

Construction Risks: Single versus Portfolio Insurance	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk management; Bootstrapping; Options theory; Insurance	MORAL HAZARD; REVENUE INSURANCE; MANAGEMENT; MARKETS; VARIABLES; OPTIONS	Risks and uncertainties are naturally inherent in the construction industry and negatively affect contracting parties and executed projects. This paper explores the possibility of insuring against construction risks, which are beyond the control of contractors and not covered by surety policies, through single and portfolio insurance strategies. Accordingly, the writers programmed Iman and Conover's bootstrapping method for inducing correlations using Microsoft Excel and consequently, developed a technique for pricing insurance premiums as an exotic option using Monte Carlo simulation. The aforementioned methodology was applied on a data set of five defined risks that were collected from small, medium, and large scale projects in California. Pursuant to this study, the calculated premiums for insuring against the defined risks are in line with the premiums available in market for other insurance policies. Moreover, the estimated premium for the proposed portfolio insurance product is more advantageous to contractors in both risk coverage and cost because it is well below the estimated premiums for single insurance products covering individual risks. It is foreseen that this research could open horizons for new construction related insurance products, which would significantly contribute to the efficiency of the risk management process in the construction industry.

Furthermore, a process has been developed insuring that the output produced conforms to customer satisfaction without violating any environmental, health, and safety rules and regulations. An effective QES program not only assures a quality product but also reduces costs, and enhances productivity. It is a top down process, i.e., top management together with line management and other employees develop the program and motivate all personnel to accept the process. Important functions to take under consideration are (1) explain and clarify the quality, environmental, and safety performance expected; (2) involve employees in decision-making and problem solving; (3) describe the consequences of poor quality and unsafe/unhealthy work conditions; (4) establish QES goals and provide feedback on performance; (5) provide a self-monitoring system; and (6) recognize and reinforce good performance and develop a reward system. This paper presents a discussion of the development of a portion of a QES management system which has been employed by a medium to large size construction company.

J	Syben, G				Syben, G			Contractors take command: from a demand-based towards a producer oriented model in German construction	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						project coalition; institutional change; tendering; construction business system; client; architect; contractor; Germany		The construction process in Germany is traditionally dominated by the client and its agent - the architect. This results in severe problems for the construction companies which do not enter into the process until all the important decisions have been made. In particular, the rate of utilization of their facilities is more or less fully dependent on other actors rather than themselves. Recently, the larger construction companies with nationwide and international activities have initiated changes to take over the construction process and assume the leading position within the project coalition. This has been achieved by integrating parts of the construction project that have been under the command of other actors. At the beginning of the process, this concerns part of the work traditionally performed by the architect on behalf of the client, at the other end it concerns the function of the client itself. So it is the producer who - inside a deep crisis which affects the whole of the industry over the last few years - takes command inside the construction process. This will result in restructuring the entire industry and will cause severe problems for other actors, in particular the small and medium construction companies degraded to subcontractors only.

Determinants of construction labour productivity in Oman	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction labour productivity; efficiency; operatives; contractors; Sultanate of Oman	MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS; COST; DELAYS; PROJECTS; MODEL	Notwithstanding the technological developments, construction continues to be a labour-intensive industry, and hence labour productivity remains the industry's predominant determinant of performance. One of the primary challenges facing the construction industry in the Sultanate of Oman is low labour productivity. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify, explore and rank the relative importance of the cardinal determinants of construction labour productivity in Oman. A statistically representative sample of contractors was thus invited to participate in a structured questionnaire survey comprising 33 productivity factors. Using the relative importance index technique, the findings distinguish the following factors as most significant: (1) errors and omission in design drawings; (2) changes to orders during execution; (3) delay in responding to requests for information; (4) lack of labour supervision; (5) clarity of project specifications; (6) coordination level amongst design disciplines; (7) working overtime; (8) rework; (9) inclement weather; and (10) physical fatigue. The outcomes not only fill a gap in knowledge of the critical determinants of labour productivity in the Sultanate, but may also be used by academics and industry practitioners to develop a deeper and wider perspective on the factors influencing the efficiency of the construction labour force.

J	Odusami, KT				Odusami, KT			Perceptions of construction professionals concerning important skills of effective project leaders	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The purpose of this study was to identify the most important skill of an effective project leader as perceived by the significant actors in the construction industry. A total of 120 questionnaires drawn from six construction-related professionals, comprising architecture, building, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering, estate surveying, and quantity surveying were collected and used for the study. These professionals were employed in clients' organizations (N=40), consultancy firms (N=48), and contracting firms (N=32). Frequency counts of the responses were computed, from which the mean item score for each skill was calculated to obtain the relative importance index. The relative importance indices were then ranked from the highest to the lowest for the clients, the consultants, the contractors, and the weighted average. The results showed that the most important skill is decision making for the client and for the three groups combined. The consultants agreed that leadership and motivation is the most important skill for the project leader. This is followed by decision making. The contractors ranked communication as the most important skill of an effective project leader. In the overall analysis, there is no significant difference in the perceptions of the three significant actors regarding the ranking of the skills. The implications of these findings for practice and research are analyzed and discussed, herein.

J	Lu, WX; Zhang, LH; Li, Z				Lu, Wenxue; Zhang, Lihan; Li, Zhi			Influence of Negotiation Risk Attitude and Power on Behaviors and Outcomes When Negotiating Construction Claims	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction claims; Negotiation; Risk attitude; Power; Contracting	CONFLICT; AVERSION; IMPACT; CONTRACTORS; STYLES; ORIENTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; SETTLEMENT; TACTICS; SCALE	When confronted with construction claims, negotiation is always the preferred method for owners and contractors. The authors conducted a questionnaire survey to explore the correlation between negotiation risk attitude and power as well as the influence of these two parameters on behaviors and outcomes in construction claim negotiations. The results indicate that to some extent, negotiation risk-taking is correlated with high power. The risk taker usually performs collaborating behaviors (better than avoiding and obliging), while the risk averter always adopts obliging behaviors (which are proved to be less beneficial than collaborating and avoiding). The risk averter enjoys a remarkable increase in reaching better outcomes with an increasing degree of adopting dominating behaviors. The high-power party with frequently used dominating behaviors has access to better outcomes than the low-power party while the low-power party that commonly uses obliging behaviors is more likely to face deterioration. The findings can be used by construction practitioners as references to evaluate their negotiation risk attitude and power in negotiations. Consequently, they can adjust their negotiation strategies accordingly to achieve better outcomes. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The organising of these CLS is contingent on the interaction among several types of actors. The purpose of the paper is to advance the understanding of the design and use of CLS and the distribution of various outcomes of such arrangements on the actors involved. The paper analyses the role of public actors in the initiating of CLS and how this affects the relational interfaces in the CLS triad of developers, contractors and logistics service providers, and the outcomes of their interactions. First, the main reason for a public actor to initiate a CLS is not cost, productivity or innovativity gains, but to decrease disturbances on third parties. Second, developers and contractors are forced to use the CLS initiated by the public actor. This makes them take on a forced customer role, explaining why these actors are often resistant to adopt to a certain CLS. Third, ripple effects, such as unintended costs and productivity impacts, occur in the construction supply chain because of the use of CLS.

This case study documented the accelerated rehabilitation process, assessed traffic impacts, and compared collected productivity data. Compared to the productivity rates of traditional nighttime closures. the 55-h weekend closures effectively reduced the construction duration and the overall traffic inconvenience. Noticeable improvement ("learning-curve effect") in the contractor's production rates was observed as the weekend Closures were repeated. As a result of a significant (38%) traffic demand reduction through the work zone, the traffic impact of construction closures was tolerable to the extent that traffic was in free-flow condition throughout the highway network. This case study will be useful for transportation agencies and contractors in developing integrated construction and traffic management plans for urban freeway rehabilitation projects to maximize pavement life expectancy and construction productivity while minimizing agency and road user costs.

Factors affecting construction labour productivity: a case study of Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; Jordan; labour productivity; factor analysis; construction labour	CRAFT WORKERS; PERCEPTIONS; PROJECTS	Improving productivity in construction is a way of increasing profit with little or no increase in cost. Labour productivity in construction in developing countries, including Jordan, is relatively low and needs to be improved significantly. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyse the factors that affect construction labour productivity. To achieve this goal, a questionnaire survey containing 27 questions (variables) was conducted. It was sent to 200 engineers and foremen who work for contractors. The 90 returned responses were statistically analysed by calculating the average, standard deviation, and RII of each variable. The results of a Spearman correlationrankcoefficient test showed that no significant differences existed between the responses of the engineers and foremen. It was concluded that the top three ranked dimensions were Productivity increases as experience increases', Financial incentives increase productivity', and Trust and communications between management and workers increase productivity'. Furthermore, the data was analysed using the principal components method of factor analysis. Of the 11 extracted factors, only five were considered, while the others were dropped since the observed variables had low loadings on these factors. Contractors and officials can benefit from this study in understanding factors affecting productivity, and act upon that understanding.

However, the success of the traditional PPP model has been contested, and recently PPPs have started focusing more on collaboration and investment sharing. So far, this development in practice has barely been reflected in the research. This paper seeks to widen the theoretical lenses on PPPs by developing a theoretical framework integrating agency theory, social capital theory, and self-determination theory. The aim is to allow for a better understanding of incentives for goal alignment by including motivational and relational aspects in addition to the transactional view. A multiple case study comprising four Norwegian PPP projects was conducted to empirically apply and further develop the framework. The findings suggest several benefits of social and psychological mechanisms to goal alignment in PPPs, including trust, reciprocity, and intrinsic motivation. Early involvement of contractors combined with risk sharing and relationship building are important factors to this end.

Factors associated with the influence of service quality (SQ) on construction client satisfaction and how it affects their behavioural intentions in Cambodia are investigated. A theoretical structural model was developed to investigate the influence of five SQ factors on CS and their links to the future behavioural intentions of the client. A partial least square approach of the structural equation modelling technique (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse data collected from a questionnaire survey of 227 participants comprising the clients of small and medium size projects. The structural model adapts 22 attributes across five SQ factors, namely: reliability; responsiveness; assurance; empathy, and tangible factors. PLS-SEM outcomes confirmed that the future behavioural intentions of the client are influenced by their satisfaction over the service excellence provided by construction companies. Moreover, treating every client individually and demonstrating an approachable attitude towards their needs will increase their satisfaction with the experience they had with a contractor. Findings and recommendations of the study may be useful to construction companies who are seeking ways to improve CS in developing countries.

However, research findings show that risk management is either not used or done ineffectively in domestic construction projects. One of the primary reasons for this appears to be the lack of risk management (RM) capabilities and knowledge. A study aimed at developing a system for supporting the effective use of RM is presented. The system has been designed so as to provide the required functionality to assist owners and contractors to develop their capabilities to manage risk effectively, including: a) to assess the existing RM organizational maturity and to report on the existing gaps, b) to propose recommendations for improving the organizational RM capabilities in the light of the detected gaps, and c) to help companies with the implementation and improvement of RM within the organization. The system prototype has been successfully applied in several companies that served as initial case studies. It is anticipated that the system will assist clients and contractors to advance effective risk management capabilities and to improve their project risk management performance in the medium range. The system can also be applied in other countries that face the same RM difficulties.

The accessibility of explicit interaction of decision makers at a single platform in the form of embedded group decision environment is a great impediment to the researchers. Accordingly, this research aims to tailor a novel alternative system of dealing with the embedded group decision under a remote group decision environment via integrating MACBETH and Exploratory Factor Analysis. The study finds that an embedded remote group decision making system could serve as an alternative system of group decision making which has plentiful perks in group decision applications. This system could help researchers to carry out research without confusing in embedded group decision environment but including all decision-makers in the model. The implication of proposed system is not only limited to MACBETH; however, due to system's versatility, a similar approach could be fruitful for other group-related environments involving collective decisions.

J	Lin, YC; Lee, HY; Yang, IT				Lin, Yu-Cheng; Lee, Hsin-Yun; Yang, I-Tung			DEVELOPING AS-BUILT BIM MODEL PROCESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR GENERAL CONTRACTORS: A CASE STUDY	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; process management; building information modeling; information system; web-based system; BIM management	CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; DOCUMENTATION; PROJECT	As the application of building information modeling (BIM) becomes more common, BIM model management becomes necessary and important to enhance the effectiveness of BIM implementation for a general contractor (GC) during the construction phase. Implementation of BIM models in the construction phase, which typically involves participants from different fields, often has numerous BIM-related interfaces and problems. Therefore, feedback from the most recent as-built model tracking and BIM model problems are essential for BIM process management (BIM PM) in the construction field. BIM PM has become the most important aspect of a sound as-built BIM model management strategy. Changes in as-built BIM models should be identified, updated, and tracked for BIM PM, such that version management of as-built BIM models can be improved, while minimizing rework and reducing as-built BIM models development duration. Systematic approaches and information on management platforms for enhancing BIM PM during the construction phase are lacking. This study proposes a novel approach to the BIM model management which is to manage and track all versions of as-built BIM models. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a web Construction BIM-based PM (ConBIM-PM) system to enhance a General Contractor's ability to share BIM PM information and track construction projects more efficiently. The ConBIM-PM system provides users with a centralized storage of all versions of as-built models during the construction phase of a project so that they are able to track and manage the current status of modified as-built models and BIM PM information effectively. Finally, the ConBIM-PM system is applied to a case study of a building project in Taiwan to verify its efficacy and demonstrate its effectiveness.

The aim of this study is to determine the critical causes affecting projects delays in Moroccan construction industry. Forty-nine causes of delay were identified from the literature review and redefined through interviews with Moroccan experts. These causes are classified according to nine categories: client, contractor, consultant/designer, finance, planning and scheduling, communication and contractual relationship, material, labours and equipment, and external. A questionnaire survey was conducted with public and private contractors and consultants in order to assess the relative importance of construction delay causes in Morocco. A total of 330 valid responses were collected. Statistical analysis of data collected from this survey study reveals that the top-10 delay causes are: delay of progress payment, lack of training for employees, lack of waste management strategy, unrealistic contract duration imposed by clients, rework due to the construction errors, excessive subcontracting, delay in obtaining permits from governmental agencies, ineffective planning and scheduling, lack of collective planning, and unskilled workforce. These findings can be helpful for construction project managers to guide efforts in improving the performance of the Moroccan construction industry.

These have shifted the focus of the nation's construction industry towards mass production and modular products. A proper study on site selection criteria for new IBS precast manufacturing sites has now become essential. The preliminary study in this research determines the IBS precast manufacturing site selection criteria from literature reviews. Questionnaires pertaining to IBS acceptance and preference criteria were send to manufacturers, policymakers, academicians and contractors. The outcome analyses the respondents' view towards 15 site selection criteria. The result from the ANOVA statistical test indicates that most respondents agreed with the selected criteria except political and regulation criteria, urban requirement criteria, and personal criteria. However, there is a significant difference within the opinions of the contractors and manufacturers sector. Likewise, the mean ranking analysis of criteria shows significant difference in their preferences. The ideal rank of criteria preferred by the correspondents are costs, transportation and optimum distance, land sites, resources and utilization, infrastructures, economy markets, labour, inter-industry linkage, environmental risk, competition, personal, population, capacity, political and regulatory, and urban criteria.

However, research has primarily focused on new build and has neglected refurbishment projects which become relevant due to an aging building stock in Sweden and Europe. Various actors are involved in refurbishment projects which makes it important to study each actor as well as tensions between them. By using a service ecosystem perspective and relying on 38 interviews, this paper aims to investigate tensions and barriers between actors within the service ecosystem of CDW for refurbishment projects in Sweden. Based on the results, spatial barriers are the most mentioned barrier which also create the highest number of tensions between project and contractor mother firm, subcontractors, waste recycling firms and society/citizens. The majority of the tensions are found between projects and the contractor mother firms, followed by tensions between projects and clients and projects and subcontractors. Unlike previous studies investigating only one of the actor's waste management practices, this paper contributes by investigating the interactions between seven different actors which is important for improving waste management practices in refurbishment projects.

Project-oriented contractors need a unified performance-measurement system that integrates project attributes. A unified system framework is presented that formalizes contractors' project evaluations and assists in controlling projects during the execution phase. It measures performance of all critical objectives of a project separately, assigns a priority to each using the analytical hierarchy process, then integrates the measurements into a single metric for overall performance. The overall index is based on eight objective project-performance measurements. A case study assessment of an airport rehabilitation project's performance is presented. This research attempted to expand performance measures to include aspects other than just quantitative (e.g., cost, schedule) information. Soft performance measures (e.g., safety, customer satisfaction) were integrated into the overall project performance and an integrated project-performance index was developed. This approach was applied to a case study in which the researchers worked directly with the company, and the study results showed that the key performance index was easy to implement and achieved practical results.

The objective is to generate a robust baseline schedule to minimize the contractor's maximal cumulative gap between cash outflows and cash inflows. Owing to the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop two metaheuristics, i.e. simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS), which have different search structures and are equipped with an improvement measure, to solve the problem. An extensive computational experiment is conducted on a data set generated by ProGen to evaluate the performance of the metaheuristics. The results demonstrate the effects of the improvement measure and indicate that the efficiency of TS decreases, whereas that of SA tends to increase with increasing problem scale. The influence of the key parameters on the objective function is analyzed and the following conclusions are drawn: The contractor's maximal gap of cumulative cash flows decreases with an increase in the expected project deadline, times of attenuation coefficient, payment number, compensation proportion, advanced payment proportion, whereas it increases with an increase in the times of marginal cost and the retention proportion.

A project-oriented data warehouse for construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						database; information system; decision support system; construction; data warehousing		A construction organization generates a great amount of operational data that are distributed across various functional systems to support its daily operations. Although those data may be potentially useful for future projects, they are not widely collected and centrally stored in the organization. This research presents a Project-oriented Data Warehouse (PDW) for contractors. PDW is designed with dimensional data models consisting of 26 tables. Sixteen of the tables are dimension tables for storing general descriptive information, and the other ten are fact tables for detailing various facts that are captured in the lifecycle of construction projects. PDW can be directly populated with data from existing operational systems, such as P3 files, MS Access, P3/e databases, and Excel files. It maintains each data in the context of its associated project so that a user can retrieve a specific piece of information plus any background information of the related project. PDW has been populated with three sample project data. Through the user interface, a user can generate interested query reports as needed. The presented warehouse structure and data models are scalable. They may be adopted by medium or large contractors for developing company-level data facilities. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM				Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM			Applying pareto ranking and niche formation to genetic algorithm-based multiobjective time-cost optimization	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRADE-OFF PROBLEMS	Time-cost optimization (TCO) is one of the greatest challenges in construction project planning and control, since the optimization of either time or cost, would usually be at the expense of the other. Although the TCO problem has been extensively examined, many research studies only focused on minimizing the total cost for an early completion. This does not necessarily convey any reward to the contractor. However, with the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are more concerned about the combined benefits and opportunities of early completion as well as cost savings. In this paper, a genetic algorithms (GAs)-driven multiobjective model for TCO is proposed. The model integrates the adaptive weight to balance the priority of each objective according to the performance of the previous "generation." In addition, the model incorporates Pareto ranking as a selection criterion and the niche formation techniques to improve popularity diversity. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype system has been developed in Microsoft Project for testing with a medium-sized project. The results indicate that greater robustness can be attained by the introduction of adaptive weight approach, Pareto ranking, and niche formation to the GA-based multiobjective TCO model.

The application of LC principles could lead to significant gains in road maintenance projects where the effect of delay in service is profound and the consequences are far-reaching for all project stakeholders. However, classical practices in the infrastructure asset management domain have less embraced lean thinking when planning for maintenance and rehabilitation. This paper presents a novel decision-making model to integrate LC principles in a classical formalized road maintenance planning and scheduling to facilitate the reduction of non-value adding activities. A case study is adopted to validate the proposed approach. Analysis of the case study revealed a reduction in the cost allocation for the selected highway with similar condition levels in comparison with the classical practices. The model could drop non-value activities, limit the gap on lead time variability, and reduce operational complexity as three main principles of lean thinking. Also, the presented approach could assist road agencies in minimizing delays, optimally assign project resources, and select qualified construction contractors more efficiently.

Closer connections and collaboration (such as strategic partnerships) among architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) companies and across the values chain is often prescribed as a strategy to improve the performance of the construction industry. However, the institutional roles of AEC companies and their archetypical business models serve as important reference points for the sector. How these business models interact, and the friction created when they come in close contact is not well researched and understood. This paper identifies business models archetypes for architect, engineer, contractor and materials supplier based on workshops and interviews with practitioners. Friction is identified in and between the business models of AEC companies engaging in strategic partnerships. The analysis shows that architect archetypes face friction with regard to their profit formula and could benefit from profit sharing. The engineering archetypes face friction in their processes since they have to coordinate with specialists from other companies. Contractor and supplier archetypes face friction in their profit formula since the open books force them to alter business practices.

This study is designed to develop a tool for scoring materials management practices for building projects and, on that basis, build a tool for predicting productivity. The research was carried out in two phases. During Phase I, in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 experts and context-specific materials management practices were identified. During Phase II, questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data from 39 contractors. To prioritize the practices that were identified during Phase I, the quantitative data were analyzed. Based on the analysis, tools for measuring and planning the materials management practices and probability-based regression models were developed. Procurement plans for materials, long-lead materials identification, and materials delivery schedule are the three most significant practices. Contractors can use the scoring tool to measure the levels of implementation of the practices and assess the risk of having low productivity using the predictive models. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by developing construction materials management practices measuring, planning, monitoring, and evaluating tools in the context of building projects. In addition, the logistic and linear regression models can be used to assess whether a certain level of implementation of the construction materials management practice might be associated with higher or lower labor productivity.

Most previous studies have dealt with entry location, entry timing and entry mode (ELETEM) decisions in an isolated way by considering one dimension or a combination of dimensions in particular. Although there have been various models relating to international market entry decisions, there is currently no model that attempts to integrate the factors linking the ELETEM decisions for construction firms. The purpose is to determine a linkage between the ELETEM decisions by incorporating the factors that are mutually inclusive and have significant influence on these decisions. Forty-five (45) Malaysian contractors undertaking projects in international markets responded to the survey. The findings suggested that the mutually inclusive and significant factors (MISFs) influencing the ELETEM decisions were: the firm's ability to assess market signals and opportunities, the firm's resources and the firm's experience in similar works. It was observed that the firms had adopted long-term strategies, repositioned their knowledge from research and development activities and readapted their resources and experience in their global operations. The findings led to the development of the ELETEM decision model to guide interested firms in making better decisions for their future international ventures.

Scoring rules and abnormally low bids criteria in construction tenders: a taxonomic review	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Bidding; competitiveness; international comparison; scoring rule; tendering	PUBLIC PROCUREMENT TENDERS; CONTRACTOR SELECTION; PREQUALIFICATION; PROJECTS; PRICE; CORRUPTION; COLLUSION; AUCTIONS; SUPPORT; UTILITY	In the global construction context, the best value or most economically advantageous tender is becoming a widespread approach for contractor selection, as an alternative to other traditional awarding criteria such as the lowest price. In these multi-attribute tenders, the owner or auctioneer solicits proposals containing both a price bid and additional technical features. Once the proposals are received, each bidder's price bid is given an economic score according to a scoring rule, generally called an economic scoring formula (ESF) and a technical score according to pre-specified criteria. Eventually, the contract is awarded to the bidder with the highest weighted overall score (economic+technical). However, economic scoring formula selection by auctioneers is invariably and paradoxically a highly intuitive process in practice, involving few theoretical or empirical considerations, despite having been considered traditionally and mistakenly as objective, due to its mathematical nature. This paper provides a taxonomic classification of a wide variety of ESFs and abnormally low bids criteria (ALBC) gathered in several countries with different tendering approaches. Practical implications concern the optimal design of price scoring rules in construction contract tenders, as well as future analyses of the effects of the ESF and ALBC on competitive bidding behaviour.

Towards an organizational culture framework in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture in construction; Artifacts; Factors; Framework	PERFORMANCE	Organizational culture gives identity to an organization. Notwithstanding the individuality of the staff members, their actions are collectively bound by the organizational culture. A review of the literature in this topic reveals that despite a number of organizational culture models have been developed, these are mainly for generic business settings and there has yet one developed for construction contracting organizations. This paper reports a study for this purpose conducted in Hong Kong. Firstly, artifacts of organizational culture were long-listed through a literature review. Construction professionals working for developers, consultant offices and contractors assessed the appropriateness of using these artifacts to identify organizational culture in construction. Through a principal component factor analysis, these artifacts are arranged into a seven-factor organizational culture framework. The seven factors are 'Goal settings and accomplishment', 'Team orientation', 'Coordination and integration', 'Performance emphasis', 'innovation orientation', 'Members' participation' and 'Reward orientation'. The ANOVA result suggests no significant difference in the rankings across respondents working for developers, consultants and contractors. The relative importance rankings among these factors were also assessed according to their significance scores. The findings of the study suggest that the construction contracting organizations in Hong Kong favor culture of clear goals with stability. They are less externally focused with a relatively lower emphasis on innovation. These findings suggest construction maintains a local industry mentality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

J	Pryke, S; Pearson, S				Pryke, Stephen; Pearson, Steve			Project governance: case studies on financial incentives	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business models; collaboration; governance; incentives; prime contracting; procurement; project dynamics; project organization; social network analysis; team integration	SOCIAL NETWORKS; AGENCY	Appropriate financial incentives within construction project coalitions can contribute to effective project governance. However, the dearth of primary research material is partly attributed to the lack of a suitable methodology with which to study projects. Social network analysis (SNA) is proposed as an analytical tool to explore coalition governance. Primary data are presented for three European case studies employing quite different approaches to the use of financial incentives in project governance. The case studies investigate pain share/gain share arrangements implemented under a prime contracting procurement approach; an unusual use of activity-related penalties in the French system of procurement; and the use of guaranteed maximum price supplements within a UK standard form of (without contractor's design) building contract. The use of SNA enables the observation of a number of transaction sets and the formulation of a framework for the quantification of construction project governance. The first case study demonstrates the decentralization of client-orientated financial management, from consultant quantity surveyor to a number of multidisciplinary cluster leaders. The second case study illustrates the importance of incentive contiguity in effective project governance. The third case study uses SNA to demonstrate the way in which financial governance could be transformed through the transference of client-orientated financial management from the client and their professional adviser to the main contractor.

Supplier Quality Management Inside and Outside the Construction Industry	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Supplier Quality Management; Construction Industry; Supply Chain; Rework	IMPACT; CHAIN	Supplier quality management (SQM) inside the construction industry is complex given the one-off nature of projects and the enormity of project size and life cycle. The resultant supply chain that supports these projects is extremely broad and deep, creating unique challenges with managing a network of hundreds and even thousands of independent contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers that often span the globe. It is a continual challenge to ensure that the project equipment, products, and materials that are produced are not in need of rework. This article summarizes findings from the literature of diverse approaches for SQM in the construction industry, and from other industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, and food and restaurant. The aim is to identify approaches that could be beneficial to the construction industry such as supplier partnerships, category captain management, and product life cycle management and to determine how these approaches might be adapted to the construction industry. Engineering managers are challenged to improve SQM within an environment of limited resources. By investigating effective practices of SQM inside and outside the construction industry, the engineering manager can leverage and apply these practices. The contribution of this article includes examining and identifying diverse practices for assuring supplier quality. These practices can be applied by engineering practitioners to improve the current management systems so that poor quality problems can be prevented.

This is a unique forensic study involving a warranty specification, where the contractor may or may not be liable for the cost of repairs, depending on the outcome of the study. Extensive field tests, including FWD, seismic, GPR, and DCP, were conducted. Laboratory tests were also done to determine gradation, moisture content, capillary action, and indirect tensile strength. Four trenches were opened to test each layer directly and to obtain samples for laboratory testing. Two of the trenches were located in distressed/failed areas, while two others were in intact areas. Based on this study, the forensic team concluded that the rutting and alligator cracking are associated with failure of the foamed asphalt base. Since the subgrade strength in the failed areas was similar to the intact areas, the subgrade strength could not have been the sole cause of the failure. The foamed asphalt base was found to be susceptible to moisture and exhibited a severe loss of strength when subjected to moisture. Thus, it is imperative to verify the moisture susceptibility during the design phase. Based on the findings of this study, the contractor did repair the failed section at his own expense.

Construction workers' perceptions of safety climate can form at different levels and vary between subunits. A multilevel safety climate measurement tool was proposed, which identified five important safety agents, i.e. client, principal contractor, supervisor, co-workers, and individual workers. Surveys were conducted at three construction projects commissioned by Fonterra Co-operative Group. A total of 356 participants completed the survey. The data was subject to scale reliability analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that all scales achieved satisfactory internal consistency and the multilevel factorial structure was generally supported. At the organizational level, the tool measures clients' overall safety priority and safety actions, and principal contractors' general commitment to safety. At the group level, the tool measures supervisors' safety actions and safety expectations, and co-workers' general safety values and practices. The tool also measures individual safety responses reflected by safety compliance and safety participation. The measurement tool would help construction organizations to diagnose potential weaknesses in their safety management practices for safety improvement and also help to develop a social and cultural work environment that is supportive of safety at all levels.

Prediction of simulated cost contingency for steel reinforcement in building projects: ANN versus regression-based models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Simulated cost contingency; Monte Carlo simulation; artificial neural networks; regression based models; steel reinforcement prices	NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; TIME; RISK	If cost contingency is too high, it might cause the construction project to be uneconomic, aborted, and lock-up funds not available for other organizational activities; if too low, it may result in unsatisfactory performance outcomes. To predict the simulated cost contingency (SCC), a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is applied. However, the use of simulation in most cases is difficult, cumbersome and rarely used in the construction industry. The objective of the current research is to develop ANN and regression based (RB) models to predict the SCC for building projects due to the variability of steel reinforcement (SR) prices. For all the adopted scenarios in dealing with the independent variables, the results revealed that on the average, ANN models are more powerful than RB models in theoretical modeling of SCC when comparing its predicted value with its actual simulated value. On the contrary, RB models outperform ANN models from practical point of view when comparing predicted SCC with its real value. Thus, contractors are advised to adopt RB models in predicting SCC for the practicality in estimating cost contingency. However, the developed models are expected to be highly beneficial for contractors in making SCC calculations easier.

As a result, the situations occur, the consequences of which can be very damaging to the project. Inaccurate evaluation of the strategy related to capital investment and project implementation is one of the reasons why such estimates are not required in practice. Instead, classification approaches may be used for this purpose. Contractors of international construction projects are often faced with complicated situations working in the conditions of uncertainty in construction. One of the potential risk factors is associated with the requirements of contract conditions. One of the major aspects is project or contract management. Project developers need various models of large and complex projects' management. The suggested method for evaluating contract effectiveness may be successfully applied at one of the stages of project management. This paper presents methods of multiattribute comparative analysis (CLARA and UniComBOS methods) of variants of classified investment risks and contract alternatives in investment and building projects of construction. A practical case illustrating the work of the methods is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Failure factors-a comparative study of private and government construction firms	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction; Engineering; Management	BUSINESS FAILURE; SUCCESS FACTORS; PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES	Purpose The purpose of the present study is to examine the failure factors for the construction firms in a developing nation. Furthermore, the comparison of failure factors for private and government firms are evaluated. Design/methodology/approach In the present study, comparison between private and government construction firms is done in the context of a construction firm failure. About 60 construction firms were selected in and around the Nashik region for the investigation, where a simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) is used for analysis purpose. Findings It is found that for private firms (private contractors and builders) lack of experience is the major factor for failure of the business as against lack of managerial experience is a critical factor in case of a government contractor. Practical implications The outcome of the present study will be used to guide the policymakers during the implementation of governmental and private projects in order to lessen the construction project failures. Originality/value Construction company failure is an important aspect in developing countries like India. The limited studies were available in literature which shows failure factors for government and private firms and distinguished them. Hence, the present study extends the construction company failure literature by focusing on government and private firms. Also, the study provides some theoretical guidelines for management to avoid construction company failure in India.

Studies indicated that the estimation of contingency sum is associated with challenges, where some contractors consider contingency as part of their profit and this has resulted in disputes amongst consultants and contractors. Researches in developing economies (Ghana) have focused on the generic determination of cost contingency with little on the perspective of quantity surveyors who are the main players in the determination of contingency. The aim of this study was to identify the main triggers influencing the determination of contingency sum for building works from the perspective of Ghanaian quantity surveyors. Through literature, triggers were analyzed and ranked with relative importance index, also, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to measure the degree of agreement amongst public and private quantity surveyors. Though all the categories were relevant, economic, exogenous and technical were paramount. Taxation was among the least influential triggers. This study provides information for players in building sector on triggers that require attention and also help them establish their own cost data, which will assist Quantity Surveyors and policy makers in their budgetary preparation for future projects.

J	Polat, G				Polat, Gul			SUBCONTRACTOR SELECTION USING THE INTEGRATION OF THE AHP AND PROMETHEE METHODS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subcontractor selection; multi-criteria-decision-making; AHP; PROMETHEE; GAIA; sensitivity analysis	BLOCKS MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS; EVALUATION SYSTEM; DECISION-MAKING; CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; CRITERIA; MODEL; SUB; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTS	On many construction projects, especially building projects, 80-90% of the tasks are performed by subcontractors. Since the success of the project highly depends on the performances of the subcontractors, selecting the right subcontractor for the right job is critical. Main contractors generally tend to select the subcontractors that offer the lowest bid price. However, working with unqualified and insufficiently financed subcontractors may result in inefficiencies and failures. Thus, a combination of several compromising and conflicting criteria underpinning financial capacity and competencies of the subcontractors should be considered during the subcontractor selection process. This paper proposes an integrated decision approach, which employs analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) together, for the subcontractor selection problem. In the proposed approach, AHP is used to analyze the structure of the subcontractor selection problem and to determine the weights of the criteria, and PROMETHEE is employed to obtain complete ranking and perform sensitivity analysis by changing the weights of criteria. The proposed approach is applied to a problem of selecting the most appropriate subcontractor to be worked with in an international construction project. Company management found the proposed decision approach satisfactory and implementable in future subcontractor selection problems.

Validating a model of cooperative procurement in the construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Cooperation; Partnering; Procurement	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; TRUST; DETERMINANTS	Project management in the construction industry involves coordination of many tasks and individuals, affected by complexity and uncertainty, which increases the need for efficient cooperation. Procurement is crucial since it sets the basis for cooperation between clients and contractors. This is true whether the project is local, regional or global in scope. Traditionally, procurement procedures are competitive, resulting in conflicts, adversarial relationships and less desirable project results. The purpose of this paper is to propose and empirically test an alternative procurement model based on cooperative procurement procedures that facilitates cooperation between clients and contractors in construction projects. The model is based on four multi-item constructs - incentive-based compensation, limited bidding options, partner selection and cooperation. Based on a sample of 87 client organisations, the model was empirically tested and exhibited strong support, including content, nomological, convergent and discriminant validity, as well as reliability. Our findings indicate that partner selection based on task related attributes mediates the relationship between two important pre-selection processes (incentive-based compensation and limited bid invitation) and preferred outcome of cooperation. The contribution of the paper is identifying valid and reliable measurement constructs and confirming a unique sequential order for achieving cooperation. Moreover, the findings are applicable for many types of construction projects because of the similarities in the construction industry worldwide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The safety climate serves as an outline of the basic safety culture's features and forewarns on safety-related problems. This study aims to investigate safety climate information in international construction projects, and find out specific factors affecting perceptions of safety climate in an international context. A questionnaire survey was administered on five construction sites contracted by Chinese international contractors. A total of 571 valid questionnaires were collected from this survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis reveals that nationality, religious beliefs, and employment mode can significantly affect perceptions of safety climate from different facets. In the present case, Chinese workers tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than their Vietnamese coworkers. Workers with religious beliefs tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than those without such beliefs. Finally, workers employed by subcontractors tend to have more positive perceptions of the safety climate than those employed directly by the main contractor. The findings identify the crucial factors affecting safety climate, which in turn enable practitioners to create a positive safety culture to enhance safety performance in international construction projects.

Stochastic-Based Model for Setting Formwork-Productivity Baseline	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Monte Carlo simulation; Labor productivity; Formwork construction; Baselines	CARLO-SIMULATION APPROACH; LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; DECISION-MAKING; CONSTRUCTION; BENCHMARKING; SELECTION	Setting the baseline labor productivity (BP) values for construction activities is essential to compare the productivity performances of projects or contractors. The BP value can also be used to estimate the costs incurred due to the loss of productivity on a certain project. The objective of this research is to develop a Monte Carlo simulation-based baseline labor productivity model (MCBPM) that can be used to determine the BP value for formwork operations. After proposing a framework for the MCBPM, empirical data regarding the labor productivity of timber formwork for several building structures were collected from 40 contractors in Ethiopia. Thereafter, a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to simulate the formwork labor productivity, and BP values were set. Following the simulation, the BP values for column, beam, slab, and wall formworks, at 95% probability, were found to be 0.94, 0.80, 0.93, and 1.0 m2/h, respectively. Compared to the previous BP models, the MCBPM provides more reliable estimation accuracy and efficiency to set the BP value based on the confidence level. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a stochastic labor productivity model that can be used as a practical tool in construction projects to forecast the BP values at certain confidence levels.

However, there is evidence that in many developing countries, public clients do not adequately consider H&S in the procurement of public projects. This study therefore sought to understand this issue by exploring the constraints that hinder public clients from adequately promoting H&S in public works procurement. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with public clients and contractors, and a survey was conducted with public clients, contractors, and consultants. The interview data was analysed using inductive thematic analysis, while the survey data was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Nine themes of constraints including regulatory; budgetary; human resource constraints; lack of management commitment; lack of H&S knowledge and education; unethical procurement practices; political influence; absence of guidance materials; and poor attitude towards H&S were identified. Based on the findings, this study recommended strategic interventions to promote the consideration of H&S in public procurement. This study contributes to the broader research on H&S management by focusing specifically on public clients in developing countries and providing an in-depth understanding of the issues which have implications for both developing and developed countries.

Construction contractor firms' strategic response to environmental turbulence is appropriately documented but evidence regarding Construction Professional Service Firms (CPSF'S) remains scarce. CPSF's are characteristically different from contractor organizations due to the intangibility of services and high knowledge intensity. The purpose of the study is to ascertain the impact of environmental turbulence on strategic decision-making process characteristics in CPSF's, specifically Irish Quantity Surveying (QS) practices. Using a mixed-methods research strategy, data collected over two dissimilar stages on the economic cycle is presented. A comparative analysis over time exposes the varied impact of environmental turbulence on strategy process characteristics, however, a notable shift in the strategic choice is evident. An emergent approach to strategizing coupled with a move from written strategic plans is evident, while competitor analysis remains superficial. A taxonomy of the strategic decision-making process is derived from the empirical data which uniquely highlights the role of path dependence for CPSFs. The paper provides theoretical advancement in the discipline of CPSF strategy and also identifies a crucial component for consideration in driving transformational change required across the sector.

The extreme requirements for time deadline and competition function expose the venues construction to high risks. These risks would potentially bring negative impacts on the site safety performance. Meanwhile, there is a lack of systematic management for safety risks in China's construction industry, especially for large projects such as the Beijing Olympic venues construction. This paper identifies and assesses safety risk factors inherent in Beijing Olympic venues construction with the involvement of 27 experienced and highly respected experts from government agencies, the construction industry, and academe through brainstorming, workshop discussions, and questionnaire surveys. The finding reveals that more than half of the critical safety risk factors are from contractors and subcontractors such as: lack of emergency response plan and measures; workers' unsafe operation, and contractors ignoring safety under schedule pressure. Based on these critical safety risks, a risk register is composed and a model is developed in application of the analytic hierarchy process to assess the status of risks on site safety. The model has been attempted in two Olympic venue projects under construction and the validity has been approved. The risk checklist, register, and assessment model developed in the paper were integrated into the risk management system that has been used for Beijing Olympic venues construction.

As mega hospital construction projects face various kinds of limitation which affect the cost dramatically, many developing countries such as Iran have focused in these kinds of projects. Only a few studies have been conducted which are associated with cost overrun factors in hospital construction projects in developing countries. The aim of this study is to identify and rank cost overrun factors in mega hospital construction projects of Iran. Delphi and SWARA methods were used in order to align experts' opinions in categorizing cost overrun factors and weigh the cost overrun factors, respectively. These factors were then allocated to consultants, employers and contractors. The results illustrated that "Unacceptable quality of work which leads to rework" with score of 0.458, "Not allocating sufficient budget from the government during the project" with score of 0.429 and "Lack of supervisors' technical knowledge" with score of 0.44 were the most crucial factors in contractors, employers and consultant groups, respectively. The identified factors inform the main literature on hospital projects and results in decreasing cost overruns in the mentioned projects.

J	Awwad, R; Barakat, B; Menassa, C				Awwad, Rita; Barakat, Boushra; Menassa, Carol			Understanding Dispute Resolution in the Middle East Region from Perspectives of Different Stakeholders	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	The construction industry in the Middle East (ME) is witnessing continuous growth that attracts international contractors and investors to its large-scale projects. However, this growth is accompanied by an inevitable increase in claims and disputes, which consequently leads to significant delays and additional costs to the project. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods are often used to address these conflicts, but different issues and backgrounds of stakeholders in the ME affect which ADR is used if any. In light of this, the main aim of this study is to explore dispute causes and resolution practices in the ME as perceived by the different stakeholders involved. Based on extensive literature review, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted involving 177 professionals from different sectors of the ME construction industry. The responses were analyzed from three distinct perspectives, namely contractors, owners, and claim advisors. Findings revealed that contractual causes are the most common disputes in the ME region, and traditional resolution methods are continually practiced despite the recognized need for new alternatives. This research provides professionals in Middle Eastern and foreign countries with invaluable insights into construction claims' types and dispute resolution (DR) systems in the region. Moreover, it allows the various construction stakeholders to understand and take into consideration the perceptions of others when applying risk and dispute prevention techniques.

J	Younes, B; Bouferguene, A; Al-Hussein, M; Yu, HT				Younes, Bashar; Bouferguene, Ahmed; Al-Hussein, Mohamed; Yu, Haitao			Overdue Invoice Management: Markov Chain Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Invoice lead time; Markov modeling; Probabilistic sensitivity analysis; Invoice processing improvement; Quantitative methods		The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Canadian construction industry in 2012 amounted to $ 111 billion, all having been exchanged in the form of invoices. In fact, a typical construction company processes tens of thousands of invoices for payment annually. There are two significant challenges associated with this invoice processing: (1) process costs due to remuneration of the construction owner's highly paid personnel, and (2) the cost of delayed invoice payments, which is typically a cost absorbed by the contractor that is consequently added to the overall project cost. Ensuring on-time payment of invoices, even when funds are available, can be a challenging exercise because of variety, volume, and the unpredictable number of received invoices. These realities make overdue invoices a pressing problem to be addressed, which in the long term leads to loss in profit and damaged reputation for both contractors and owners. The research presented in this paper utilizes a cohort Markov model to evaluate invoice processing. It seeks to identify and rank bottlenecks to highlight and prioritize opportunities for process improvement, thereby leading to a null-overdue invoice-processing approach. Furthermore, given the stochastic nature of invoice processing, various probabilistic sensitivity analyses are proposed, including an empirical approach that can be used at the experimental design stage where data are either limited or unavailable.

The use of social customer relationship management by building contractors: evidence from Tasmania	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Customer relationship management; customer-value segmentation; relationship marketing; social customer relationship management; social media	IMPACT; WEAK; CRM; STRENGTH; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; TRUST; MODEL; TIES	Despite its ever-increasing popularity with consumers and businesses, many organizations are still unsure how to effectively use social media in a marketing context. One way in which building firms can use social media is as a customer relationship management (CRM) tool to improve customer engagement and satisfaction (known as social CRM). In order to explore how social CRM (SCRM) can be used, and is being used by building firms, semi-structured interviews with accredited building practitioners were utilized to collect data on SCRM use in the sector. The data were analysed to determine the factors that influence social media use, the extent of SCRM use, and the ways in which building contractors are using SCRM. It was found that builders are using social media to manage client relationships, but to a limited extent due to the complex nature of the builder-client relationship and a lack of perceived trustworthiness. Building firms favoured a transactional approach to social media use, and preferred not to use formal social media strategies. Builders are also reluctant to use social media to assist them in segmenting customers by their value to the firm. For effective social media use, builders may consider two main issues: SCRM strategy and customer-value segmentation to develop profitable customer relationships.

J	Wright, JN; Fergusson, W				Wright, J. Nevan; Fergusson, Warwick			Benefits of the NEC ECC form of contract: A New Zealand case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Procurement; Forms of contract; NEC Engineering and Construction Contract		This paper examines by means of a case study the effectiveness of the project and process method detailed in the NEC Engineering and Construction Contract (ECC), as developed and published by the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE), and makes recommendations regarding its future use. The performance of the ECC with that of a conventional form of contract delivered by two separate contractors to the same employer on the same site in similar timeframes in New Zealand provided a unique opportunity for comparison. The objective was to determine if the benefits claimed by the proponents of the NEC ECC were realised, to understand the factors which need to be considered to ensure successful use of this form of contract and to understand if any changes are needed to make the contract more effective in the NZ environment. Qualitative data were gathered by way of a series of semi-structured interviews with the project management teams of the employer and with both contractors, supplemented by secondary quantitative data extracted from project records. It is concluded that use of ECC does deliver business benefits. Minor changes are recommended for alignment with NZ statutes. It is considered that the findings will be of interest to project managers for larger and complex engineering and construction projects in any country. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

Perceptions about Design for Construction Worker Safety: Viewpoints from Contractors, Designers, and University Facility Owners	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accident prevention; Accidents; Construction industry; Design; Occupational safety; Owners; Safety; Project planning and design		Decisions made before construction can affect safety on the construction site, either positively or negatively. This was observed from past research that identified the link between design decisions and fatalities. The concept of implementing design decisions that positively affect safety falls under the general concept of prevention through design (PtD), which attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process to eliminate the risks of injury or damage during construction. Prevention through design is practiced in other countries, primarily through legislation. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a survey that was conducted to identify construction industry stakeholders' views on the concept of PtD and gauge the possibility for implementing PtD in the U.S. construction industry through either legislation or other means. Four distinct groups were surveyed: engineers, architects, contractors, and owners. Within this study, PtD was described and introduced to survey participants as design for construction worker safety (DCWS) to differentiate PtD efforts in construction from efforts in other industries. The survey consisted of questions that asked about the industry's knowledge of PtD and the extent of PtD practice in the United States, participants' opinions on designer and owner safety knowledge and perceptions, and obstacles and enablers for designer participation in construction safety. The responses from the various groups were compared to identify the groups that are more receptive to the idea of designer participation in construction worker safety. The results showed that architects were the least receptive to the idea, whereas the other groups were more likely to be supportive, with some hesitations. Architects and engineers identified the existence of economic, legal, and contractual obstacles for designers to practice DCWS, whereas contractors only identified economic obstacles. No enablers were identified by any group. The research contributes additional information that can be used by construction industry practitioners and organizations desiring to expand and optimize PtD implementation in the United States. The research results can be used by project teams to plan for PtD education and training efforts on projects and by construction industry organizations to develop PtD diffusion strategies.

Taking on a wider view: public value interests of construction clients in a changing construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Public value; public clients; public service delivery; value conflict; the Netherlands	PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS; GOVERNANCE; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTS; FRAMEWORK; HYBRID	For financial and strategic reasons, public and semi-public construction clients increasingly depend on private parties to carry out public service delivery. They subcontract operational responsibilities to private parties while remaining socio-politically responsible for ensuring public values. Public administration literature mainly addresses the importance of procedural and performance values in safeguarding public values. However, safeguarding the quality of the built environment also requires a focus on product values. In this study, we aim to increase the understanding of the meaning and significance of public values in the daily practice of public construction clients and identify the challenges they face in commissioning these seemingly opposing values. A set of semi-structured interviews with the public administrators of a variety of public and semi-public construction client organizations in the Netherlands shows that both internal and external factors influence the collaborative practices between clients and contractors. This causes a value shift from an emphasis on procedural values to managing performance and product values, indicating that clients need to take on a wider view on public values. Six main public value dilemmas were found that complicate the task of developing an open, transparent and sustainable long-term client-contractor relationship. The current contractual system, however, lacks the flexibility to facilitate this product-based value view in construction.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has suggested the construction sector as best placed to improve its energy performance in order to help Ireland to meet the European Union (EU) GHG reduction target of 20% by 2020. An action research (AR) approach was used to explore the construction phase energy reduction opportunities on a selected case study in the West of Ireland. The participating contractor's current onsite energy management practices were benchmarked to inform the implementation of a series of quick-win measures at a cost of (sic)706.04. The resultant savings of (sic)19 853.03 represented 17.5% of the total expenditure on energy usage on site ((sic)113 397) and resulted in an estimated saving of 5.5% of the assumed project profit ((sic)358 800). A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated for both phases of the project with a 75% reduction in the cost of electricity per floor area from phase 1 to phase 2. The findings suggest that improving site energy use provides scope for the contractor to increase profit margins, improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.

As part of a large study, the authors developed and implemented a 5-h training program to improve construction supervisors' safety-efficacy, in order to enhance the safety climate on construction worksites. The training program covered fall prevention, silica exposure, leadership, communication, and safety planning. This study evaluated pretraining and posttraining changes and safety-efficacy six months posttraining. A total of 118 supervisors, contractors, and workers from more than 50 construction firms in Massachusetts attended the training. Statistically significant improvements were observed in participants' safety knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Six-months postintervention, 58% of supervisors, contractors, or both, perceived that the training contributed "a lot" to their ability to communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking workers, to take on a safety leadership role (52%), and to conduct effective training (62%). This study determined that when supervisors perceive that they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make changes, they may better fulfill their role as a safety leader. Construction supervisor training courses might be revised to include leadership and effective communication topics.

Such EPC projects are not without their difficulties-for example, the time pressures frequently brought by overlapping design, procurement, and construction increase uncertainty and complexity in managing the multiple interfaces between different interacting stakeholders. This paper aims to quantitatively and systematically examine how trust, openness, and communication interrelate to improve interface management performance in international EPC projects. A conceptual model is developed and tested with data collected from a questionnaire survey and interviews. The path analysis demonstrates that trust not only can be directly conducive to interface management but also has a positive impact on interface management through enhanced interorganizational openness and communication. Social network analysis visualizes contractors' industrial relations and reveals different impacts of stakeholders in trust and interface networks of international EPC contractors. This study advances previous research by developing a systematic framework on the basis of trust for understanding and promoting interface management. Understanding the in-depth underlying interrelations of trust, openness, and communication can contribute to improving alignment between stakeholders and to appropriately applying interface management in practice.

J	Fong, PSW; Chen, L				Fong, Patrick S. W.; Chen, Le			Governance of Learning Mechanisms: Evidence from Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction companies; Contractors; Construction management; Knowledge-based systems; Performance characteristics; Evaluation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED THEORY; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; MICROFOUNDATIONS; COMPETITIVENESS; PERFORMANCE; ADVANTAGE	The focus of knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry is moving towards capability building for value creation. The study reported by this paper is motivated by recent assertions about the genesis and evolution of knowledge management capability (KMC) in the strategic management field. It attempts to shed light on the governance of learning mechanisms that develop KMC within the context of construction firms. A questionnaire survey was administered to a sample of construction contractors operating in the very dynamic Hong Kong market to elicit opinions on the learning mechanisms and business outcomes of targeted firms. On the basis of a total of 149 usable responses, structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis identified relationships among knowledge-governance mechanisms, knowledge processes, and business performance, thereby supporting the existence of strategic learning loops. The study findings provide evidence from the construction context for capability assertions that knowledge-governance mechanisms and processes form learning mechanisms that carry out strategic learning to create value, effect performance outcomes, and ultimately drive the evolution of KMC. The findings imply that it is feasible for managing construction firms to govern learning mechanisms through managing the capability-based holistic KM system, thereby reconfiguring KMC to match needs in the dynamic market environment over time.

Although they deal with numerous issues in the purchasing and manufacturing processes, selecting effective and efficient material suppliers is among the most critical one. This selection is often very challenging when lacking precise information. Moreover, the construction contractor and the suppliers often have conflicting interests and make decisions individually. As research concerning the aforementioned issues is still relatively scarce, this paper proposes a multiobjective bilevel programming model with random fuzzy coefficients for supplier selection problem with multiple items (SSP-MI) in a large-scale construction project. The upper level problem deals with the construction contractor who selects suppliers to minimize total cost, maximize service, and item quality. The lower level problem deals with the suppliers who allocate supplied items to maximize their own total profit. For solving this complex bilevel nonlinear model with uncertainties an expected value operator method is first used to deal with the uncertain variables, and then Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and a combinatorial algorithm with a sectional genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic controller (flc-SGA) and a weighted-sum method (WSM) based on satisfactory degree (SD) denoted as flc-SGA with SD-based WSM are proposed. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated to be effective when carried out in the Pubugou Hydropower construction project.

J	Chao, LC; Liaw, SJ				Chao, Li-Chung; Liaw, Shinn-Jye			Fuzzy Logic Model for Determining Minimum Overheads-Cum-Markup Rate	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bids; Competition; Overheads; Markup; Bid position; Fuzzy logic; Regression analysis; Loss risk	DECISION	Contractors in bidding for a construction project often focus on the direct cost and determine a bid price by applying an overheads-cum-markup rate on top of the estimated direct cost. Such a simple method is prone to incorrectness if a rate is charged without a sound basis. As an improvement, a fuzzy logic model is proposed for determining the minimum rate for a project based on the bid position of a contractor. Using the estimates of chance of winning and loss risk as inputs, the model incorporates the bid position in a set of fuzzy rules that reflect the degree of need for work and risk attitude. A regression equation built from bid data for public sector projects connects the ratio of winning bid to owner's budget with project attributes and is used in estimating the chances of winning for various rates. An illustrative example is provided, in which the rules representing the bid positions in nine scenarios were formulated and recent bids in Taiwan were collected for building the regression equation. The results of simulation of bidding for two bidding cases show that the model can differentiate the bid positions and suggest minimum overheads-cum-markup rates consistently. The model may prevent inadequate rates in bidding under intense price competition, thus advancing the field of bidding. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Management tools are necessary for sustainability assessment of construction equipment fleets to allow contractors to reduce their emissions and comply with local or federal regulations. In addition to management tools, there is a need for a metrics that will allow companies to accurately assess the sustainability of their construction equipment fleets. The State of California USA is adopting innovative approaches to reduce adverse impact of humans on the environment. Once successfully implemented, the chances are that such practices attract other states to adopt similar approaches. This paper presents an evaluation of construction equipment fleets and data analysis. When measured and recorded, such results can be used along with decision-support tools for selection and utilization of construction equipment. The metrics for construction equipment evaluation as well as the tool for sustainable decision-making are developed based on readily available data from manufacturers or maintenance shops without a need for additional effort by contractors or government agencies for their adoption. The metrics developed and the decision support tool incorporate logical strategies of supply chain management for optimal selection of construction equipment for construction site while taking into account the availability, cost, and mobilization related constraints. The metrics and the model can benefit both the government agencies responsible for inspection of fleets and owners of construction companies in their decision-making processes related to environmental sustainability.

J	Yan, P; Liu, JY; Zhao, XB; Skitmore, M				Yan, Peng; Liu, Junying; Zhao, Xianbo; Skitmore, Martin			Risk response incorporating risk preferences in international construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						International construction projects; Risk response strategies; Risk preference; Fuzzy chance constrained programming; Credibility theory	DECISION-MAKING; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; SELECTION; PERSPECTIVE; ATTITUDES; AVERSION; DRIVERS; DESIGN	Purpose The objective of this research is to develop a decision method that can generate appropriate risk response strategies for international construction project managers (PMs) and allow these strategies to reflect their different risk preferences. Design/methodology/approach The optimal model approach is adopted. A credibility-based fuzzy chance constrained programming (CFCCP) model is developed, which simultaneously minimizes the expected losses of risk events and total costs of risk response. To solve this multi-objective model, a fuzzy interactive solution method is used. Moreover, the model performance is demonstrated by a real international industrial plant project. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the model is conducted. Findings The result of the sensitivity analysis indicates that PMs with a greater risk aversion can lead to a higher mitigation ratio of expected losses of risk events and a higher total cost of risk response. Practical implications This research provides contractors with an effective decision-making model to develop a project risk response plan, and it will assist contractors to minimize risk losses and enhance the project performance in the international construction market. Originality/value Previous studies overlook the risk preference, which is an important behavioral factor influencing decisions in risk response strategy selection. This research proposed a novel risk response strategy selection decision method that considers different attitudes toward risk among decision makers.

J	De Biasio, A; Murray, A				De Biasio, Alberto; Murray, Alex			The social network of the UK PPP secondary equity market - returns and competition in an emerging market	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Competition; public-private partnerships; social network analysis; secondary equity market; special purpose vehicles		In recent years, the UK's private finance initiative secondary equity market has increased in size and maturity as primary investors, principally contractors, liquidate their stakes. As an emerging unlisted market, research challenges include the availability of timely and comprehensive information about equity transactions, as well as established methods for their interpretation and comparison. Data on transactions between 1998 and 2012, collected in the European Services Strategy Unit PPP equity database, are used to map this market and analysed using network theory. Active sellers and buyers are identified providing insight on the levels of competition. Following Granovetter's conceptualization of SNA, actors operating in the secondary equity market (buyers and sellers of SPV equity - contractors, equity funds, banks, institutional investors amongst others) are characterized in terms of out-degree centrality, increasing with the number of actors within a seller's ego network. The ties created through equity sales are applied in the formation of the market network. The notion that out-degree centrality of sellers can improve overall financial returns is examined with data on initial equity investment and sale values. Isolating returns on equity based on capital appreciation for a sample of transactions reveals that annualized return on equity is seemingly not improved by higher out-degree centrality, when compared to average returns. A more general contribution is provided through the visualization of the network of equity transactions in this emerging market.

J	Lindhard, S; Larsen, JK				Lindhard, Soren; Larsen, Jesper Kranker			Identifying the key process factors affecting project performance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance; Knowledge management; Communication; Success factors; Failure factors	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; QUALITY PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; MODEL	Purpose - A construction project traditionally involves a variety of participants. Owners, consultants, and contractors all have diverse opinions and interests, but they all seek to ensure project success. Success is habitually measured as performance output regarding cost, time, and quality. Despite previous research mapping the success and failure factors, construction managers seem to have difficulty in attaining success. To provide clearer guidance on how to fulfill success criteria, the purpose of this paper is to identify the underlying factors that affect performance and thus project success in construction processes. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based on a literature review provided 25 key process factors divided into five key categories. Based on the responses from commonly involved construction parties, the factors were ranked and tested for significant differences between the parties. Findings - The top five most important process factors were found to relate to the sharing of knowledge and communication. Moreover, testing the ranking for significant differences between owners, consultants, and contractors revealed five differences. The differences related to the interpretation and importance of trust, shared objectives, project coordination, and alternative forms of coordination. Originality/value - All respondents identify improved knowledge sharing and communication as the key to improved cost, time, and quality performance and are therefore the areas where construction managers need to focus their resources. Thus, improved experience sharing and communication will increase the likelihood of project success, through improving competences, commitment, and coordination.

Building on a theoretically driven approach and a case study, we first established a set of propositions and then substantiated this set through empirical illustrations. This study investigated the multiactor Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line (HSL) project (1990-2017) with the use of social network analysis supplemented by qualitative evidence. The findings show that actors' behavior is affected by the project public institutional context, coupled with contractual commitments. A closer examination of the data found two factors that drive the escalation dynamics: (1) the timing mismatches-a ubiquitous feature of public sector project owner's organization-leading to the incapacity to influence governance during the project front-end and (2) owner's passive behavior during implementation. From the management perspective, an active owner with high project response capability is necessary for effectively interacting with contractors, and for selecting and managing both contractual and trust-based governance mechanisms effectively. Based on the findings, the authors offer theoretical and managerial implications for promoting the effectiveness of owner-contractor collaboration in large-scale infrastructure projects.

J	Abdullah, A; Yaman, SK; Mohammad, H; Hassan, PF				Abdullah, Abd Halid; Yaman, Siti Khalijah; Mohammad, Hairuddin; Hassan, Padzil Fadzil			Construction manager's technical competencies in Malaysian construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Management; Construction planning	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS	Purpose Problems of Malaysian construction industry have often been associated, in part to incompetent construction manager (CM) when managing the construction projects. Although various education and training provisions have been introduced, critics argue that the provisions have not been effective. Central in the debate on the adequacy of the CM education and training offered is the answer to the question of what constitutes the technical competency of the CM? The purpose of this paper is to present the study that identifies the technical competencies required by the CM to address the question. Design/methodology/approach Multi-layered thematic analysis of literature was first carried out to identify the technical competency elements. Then, interviews were undertaken to confirm the elements of competencies. It was followed with questionnaire surveys to test the validity of the technical competencies against different contractors' category and grade/size. Findings The findings suggest that the technical competencies of CM are generic, regardless of the size of construction organisation or the types of projects they undertake. A total of 16 CM technical competencies were identified which include the ability to manage: staff, materials, labour, plant, sub-contractors, safety, money, quality, time, environment, site administration, pre-construction activities, project closeout and handover, third parties, computer literacy, and construction contract. Originality/value The findings suggest that generic education and training is possible to develop technically competent CM. It also provides insights to the CM technical competencies which the industry is expecting.

One root cause behind this challenge is the presence of variability in the project workflow. In fact, impacts of variability at both the trade contractor level and project level remain difficult to manage. This paper aims to analyze impacts of variability in the workflow caused by rework and fluctuating work quantities. Toward this end, production data of two residential construction companies were collected, and a mixed method of mathematical and simulation modeling was used to analyze performance and productivity at both the trade and project levels. Performance metrics such as completion times, work-in-process levels, and delays were then measured in different real-life production scenarios. The findings clearly show that the workflow variability significantly downgrades performance metrics by causing inflated completion times, longer queues of uncompleted jobs, and excessive delays, resulting in productivity loss. The paper provides those who manage construction projects with recommendations on stabilizing the workflow in the interconnected network of trade contractors to improve productivity and performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in engineering management by enhancing the insight into workflow variability and its impacts on tangible performance measures.

A postal and email surveys were undertaken on Malaysian building companies, focusing on the benefits and difficulties associated with the implementation of quality cost system. Statistical analyses based on Chi-Squared test and Relative Importance Index techniques were used to investigate the significance of the findings and determine the relative importance of the factors. The most important benefit of measuring quality costs is "getting management attention and increase quality awareness" as perceived by the sample of the study. The possible barriers that may affect the management's decision to implement quality cost system are identified and grouped into three categories, which are culture and knowledge; system; and company. The study suggests that the level of the site staff's knowledge should be as important as that of the management to successfully collect and record quality costs data. The findings of this research will raise the level of awareness and sensitize managers and those involved with building industry about the importance of quality cost system and collecting quality costs data.

To continue on their path to recovery, many households have, when other resources became scarce, relied on informal housing reconstruction, such as building without a contractor and using untrained labor. Housing in Puerto Rico has a history of informality that goes back long before Hurricane Maria, and behind this behavior are many complex, interwoven drivers. As one way to understand why certain households-and not others-were able to use informal reconstruction in their recovery process, this study uses social capital theory, in the form of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. This study answers the following question: "What forms of social capital are most salient in supporting informal housing reconstruction by households in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria?" Surveys were conducted with household owners in two municipalities of Puerto Rico. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that people's bridging social capital was positively associated with their level of informal housing reconstruction, and negatively associated with their level of completed reconstruction among homeowners who reconstructed informally. These results have theoretical implications for social capital in disaster recovery, including the importance of promoting connections among heterogeneous groups. The research contributes to policy and practice by specifying the key social relationships that allow households to continue rebuilding when official processes, such as using a contractor or obtaining permits, become inaccessible or ineffective.

The purpose of this paper is to respond to the call for further research on the framework suggested by Li et al. (2015) who presented 26 factors that determine project transaction costs. The objective is to empirically test the framework to identify factors that have the greatest influence on project collaboration so that practitioners can prioritize their efforts on the most salient factors that will improve collaboration and reduce transaction costs. Design/methodology/approach The paper employed interviews with 38 project practitioners from three different industries in Norway. The respondents had in average 20 years of professional experience. Findings The quality of communication, project uncertainty, owner's organizational efficiency, change orders and trust were the five most frequently found factors that influence both project transaction costs and collaboration level. When the authors compared findings between different industries the authors found that the quality of communication was important for all industries. The owner's organizational efficiency was also highly important in oil and gas and ICT projects. Trust was particularly important in oil and gas projects while frequency of claims was particularly important in construction projects. Originality/value The paper contributes to the conceptual theory of transaction costs and collaboration as it empirically tests and extends the framework developed by Li et al. (2015).

A megaproject may involve hundreds of organizations that may be competing for a new subproject while collaborating on other subprojects. However, some organizations have competitive advantages to win more tenders than others, and the reasons for such emergence are not thoroughly investigated yet. This study analyzed the network-based bidding competitiveness and the evolution of collaboration networks by social network analysis (SNA) through a 6-year (2008-2013) case study of a zone development project in Wuxi, China, a total number of 1,897 construction projects. The constructed megaproject collaboration network consists of four key project stakeholders: owners, contractors, designers, and quality supervisors. The analytical results show that during the evolution of the collaboration network in China, contractors and designers who exhibit higher normalized degree centralities and larger K-core values are more likely to win a new project tendering competitively. At the same time, owners are primarily inclined to choose the "return" partners, especially designers, as collaborators for future projects. This study enriches the existing literature on the bidding competitiveness in megaprojects and helps us better understand the mechanism of collaboration and competition in megaprojects and provides effective and dynamic strategies to establish relational contracts in megaprojects.

To be competent is to have the ability to apply the set of related knowledge, skills and abilities to perform a task effectively. This paper examines the competency requirements for quantity surveyors (QSs) in the face of changing and increasing client needs. Design/methodology/approach Based on a detailed meta-analysis of the literature, 12 basic/core and 16 evolving competencies are identified. Primary data were gathered through a field survey involving practicing QSs from client, consultant and contractor organisations, and university students undertaking QS programmes in Malaysia. The data obtained were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical tools. Findings The significance of the basic/core and evolving competencies are presented. Overall, the most important contemporary skills are cost planning, valuation of works, measurement/quantification and contract documentation. The evolved roles require expertise in communication and negotiation, ethics and professional conduct and value management. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates there are misaligned expectations of the proficiency levels needed to provide contemporary and future services between practitioners in client/consultant organisations, contractors and new generation students. Originality/value The findings provide guidance on the education, training and practice of quantity surveying to deal with emerging challenges in the dynamic built environments in Malaysia and beyond.

For this purpose, 83 delay factors were identified, categorized into 9 major groups through a detailed literature review process as well as interviews with experts from the construction industry. The relative importance of these delay factors and groups was quantified by using the relative importance index method. The ranking of the factors and groups was demonstrated according to their level of effect on delay. A delay assessment model was proposed using the fuzzy set theory by taking into account the delay factors characterized in construction projects. The assessment model was developed using a commercial software product. The proposed methodology was tested in a real case study; and the probability of the delay of the project was evaluated by means of the assessment model after the required inputs were entered into the software. The factors and groups that contribute most to the probability of delays were discussed depending on the case study results. The assessment model results were found to be satisfactory. Finally, some recommendations were made in order to minimize and control delays in construction projects.

J	Chua, DKH; Godinot, M				Chua, DKH; Godinot, M			Use of a WBS matrix to improve interface management in projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Many researchers agree that smoother construction would result from better communication between designers and constructors about specific requirements and constraints for construction that can be incorporated into the design. The same principle can be generalized to apply to all the phases of a construction project (design, equipment procurement, transport, delivery, installation, and testing, as well as hand-over activities), to the different partners (main contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers), and even internally to the teams working on different parts of a system for the same contractor. Specific requirements and constraints at work interfaces that are technical, organizational, temporal, and geographical in nature have to be made transparent so that they can be managed and resolved to avoid unnecessary reworks and delays. This paper proposes to use the work breakdown structure (WBS) concept to improve work interface management. In the manufacturing industry, the WBS concept is well exploited by crossing a horizontal breakdown of production activities with a vertical breakdown of final products, thus obtaining a WBS matrix, which is more complete and useful than the classical WBS tree. In this paper, the WBS and interface management concepts are first clarified. Then, it is proposed to transpose the WBS matrix concept into the construction industry and to analyze, in a case study, how it may be used to improve interface management. The case study involves the construction of a segment of a mass rapid transit system comprising many specialty trades spanning track works, power supply, signaling, passenger vehicles, and control.

J	Bayram, S; Al-Jibouri, S				Bayram, Savas; Al-Jibouri, Saad			Application of Reference Class Forecasting in Turkish Public Construction Projects: Contractor Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contract sum; Project final cost; Cost forecasts; Reference class forecasting; Optimism bias		Cost overrun in construction projects is an important problem that can have serious financial consequences. It also reduces the effectiveness of planning and decision making not only for the contractor but for all parties involved. The problem keeps occurring despite many attempts made over the years to improve cost estimation and forecasting methods. This paper focuses on analyzing cost overruns in Turkey and comparing the cost estimates produced using the traditional estimating method against cost forecasts produced using the reference class forecasting (RCF) method. RCF is used to predict the final cost of a project predicated on actual cost outcomes of accomplished similar projects in the same reference class. RCF has been so far used to address estimation bias in early project development before design is completed and before all risks are accounted for to help a client to produce a more realistic forecast of the final project cost. In this paper, however, it is used to produce a forecast of the final project cost based on the contract sum. The work described in the paper involves collection of contract sum and final project cost data from 420 completed building projects. In order to test the ability of RCF to produce realistic forecasts of projects' final costs, 75% of the data are used to produce the cost overruns distribution and to determine the required optimism bias uplift values for the building projects, while the other 25% of the data are used for testing the accuracy of the forecasts produced for the final costs of projects in the established reference class. The results have indicated that the required uplift values are in the range of 4 to 44%. For instance, if the acceptable chance of cost overrun is 50%, 65% of the test projects would have required only 4% uplift of the contract sum to produce accurate forecasts of the final costs. If, on the other hand, the acceptable chance of cost overrun is only 10%, 5% of the test projects needed to use a 44% uplift to enable more accurate final project cost forecasts for the contractor. Additionally, to check the accuracy of the test data results obtained through applicable optimism bias uplift values, three standard error measuresroot-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)are used.

This model contains causal mechanisms that relate a number of project governance variables to project performance. Our proposed model includes relevant variables for measuring project governance in construction projects in uncertain environments. The variables incorporated in the model consider project governance aspects of the relationships between the contracting party and contractors. These aspects cover the early involvement of the contractor in the design and estimation of costs, procurement procedures, integration of design and construction, the incentives and disincentives regime, risk allocation, contract flexibility, and actions that allow the contracting party to maintain bargaining power during possible renegotiations. The proposed model has prediction and diagnosis capabilities enabling decisions to be made on a project-by-project basis and is based on existing theoretical constructs. In developing the model, we used a database consisting of mutually independent records from 58 European infrastructure projects. The records originate from a review of the pre-and post-contract transactions made in these projects. We illustrate the use of the proposed model with examples. After a set of exhaustive analyses, we provide a ranking of the most robust governance actions and factors associated with the occurrence of cost and time underruns. In this way, we show that the proposed model can guide prioritizing project governance actions in specific settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

An alternative classification of project delivery methods used in the United States building construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Early contractor involvement; integrated project delivery; latent class analysis; typology	LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS	Although many sources describe the project delivery methods available to owners, there is little empirical data on their defining characteristics. The objective of this research was to examine patterns in contract arrangements, procurement practices and compensation terms used in the US building construction industry. Survey data were collected for projects completed between 2008 and 2013 (N=204) from owners and contractors belonging to large US professional organizations. A latent class analysis was used to identify five distinct patterns or classes' based upon eight characteristics of the project delivery process. These classes were defined as: (I) late builder and trade involvement, with an open, cost-based selection and lump sum contract (9% of projects in sample); (II) late builder and trade involvement, with a prequalified, cost-based selection and lump sum contract (19%); (III) early builder and late trade involvement, with a prequalified non-cost based selection and guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contract (26%); (IV) early builder and trade involvement, with a prequalified, cost-based selection and lump sum design-build (DB) contract (27%); (V) early builder and trade involvement, with a prequalified, non-cost based selection and GMP DB contract (18%). Compared to existing classifications of project delivery methods, these classes are data-driven typologies that represent how participants are procured and organized into a project team. The findings have implications as an alternative classification system in project delivery research and as guidance to owners considering their project delivery options.

The development of PC projects reflects the effects of both policy supervision and PC practice, which aids the government in reasonably identifying the key issues of PC's promotion and rationally improving the policy deployment. However, existing studies fail to address this aspect, especially lacking quantitative exploration. This study explores the micro mechanism of PC's promotion, from the perspective of developing PC projects. Design/methodology/approach A tripartite evolutionary game model based on prospect theory of the government, developers and contractors is constructed. After rigorous theoretical deduction, this study adopts Changchun in China as a case city and collects the data using the Delphi technique, policy documents and literature analysis. Findings Results indicate that contractors are generally willing to implement PC projects and the government chooses to actively supervise PC's promotion. The negative investment behavior of developers is the main obstacle to promote PC in Changchun currently. Practical implications The conclusions are applicable to other comparable regions. This study is of value to promote PC with high efficiency and effect. Originality/value The tripartite evolutionary game model based on prospect theory proposed in this study is conducive to reveal the essence of PC's promotion. This is an important breakthrough in extant studies, with a broad applicability in the PC domain beyond China.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of two formal maintainability programs drawn from that research. The programs differ in terms of application and project type and size, in addition to the organization leading the implementation (owner-led versus contractor-led). This paper identifies program attributes contributing to effective maintainability programs. These have been grouped into five categories: (1) corporate commitment; (2) program resources: (3) maintainability planning; (4) maintainability implementation; and (5) program updating. Additionally, the comparative analysis provides readers with insights into different applications used to implement maintainability.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the causal causes of schedule overrun and cost escalation of highway projects in Egypt in order to be used as independents variables in mathematical models for predicting the percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation of such projects in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of a randomly selected samples yielded responses from 40 owners, 15 consultants and 56 contractors. The survey includes 38 schedule overrun factors and 26 cost escalation factors. The effectiveness degree of the identified factors has been identified by the triangle fuzzy approach. Findings - The results of the survey show that "contractor's technical staff is insufficient and ineligible to accomplish the project" is the most important cause of schedule overrun, while the major cause of cost escalation is inadequate preparation of the project concerning planning and execution. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is predicting the percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation of highway projects in Egypt. Through the application of the linear regression analysis method and statistical fuzzy theory, four predictive models have been developed and it has been noted that the linear regression-based model shows prediction accuracy better than statistical fuzzy-based model in predicting percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation.

Talat			Identification of Risk Paths in International Construction Projects Using Structural Equation Modeling	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk paths; Risk identification; International construction; Structural equation modeling	SYSTEM	The major aim of this research is to demonstrate that causal relationships exist among various risk factors that necessitate identification of risk paths, rather than individual risk factors, during risk assessment of construction projects. International construction projects have more complex risk-emergence patterns because they are affected by global and foreign country conditions and project-related factors. Identification of a network of interactive risk paths, each of which initiated from diverse vulnerabilities of the project system, is considered to be a better reflection of the real conditions of construction projects than the use of generic risk checklists. In this study, using the data from 166 projects carried out by Turkish contractors in international markets and utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, 36 interrelated risk paths were identified and the total effects of each vulnerability factor and risk path on cost overrun were assessed. SEM findings demonstrate that every risk path is initiated from a specific vulnerability factor related to project environment, and that contractor-specific vulnerabilities have the most effect on project cost overrun. Risk identification using SEM helps decision makers in answering what-if questions in the early stages of a project, tracing the effects of interdependent risks throughout the life cycle of the project and evaluating the influence of alternative mitigation strategies, not only on specific risks but also on the whole network of interrelated risk factors.

The social procurement practices of tier-one construction contractors in Australia	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Community; corporate social responsibility; social procurement; social value; social enterprise; third sector	ENTERPRISES	Social procurement is becoming an increasingly important requirement in the delivery of private- and public- sector construction projects across the world, yet there is relatively little research done in this area. Mobilising Furneaux and Barraket's social procurement typology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers from eight tier-one contractors in the Australian construction industry to explore and classify the types of social procurement strategies used in projects, the types of social value created and the barriers to implementation. Documentary data were collected in the form of company policies and contract requirements. Results demonstrate the conceptual merit of Furneaux and Barraket's typology in a construction industry context by highlighting different constraints on social value creation for each type of social procurement. These results also indicate that approaches to social procurement in the Australian construction industry are generally driven by a philosophy of risk mitigation rather than opportunity maximisation, and are confined to low-value and low-risk construction activities and are constrained by a lack of existing and new supply chain social-value creation capacity. Construction industry social value chains are fragile in Australia, and it is concluded that in building the sector's significant untapped capacity to deliver social value to the communities in which it builds, priority should be given to three main strategies: third sector capacity building; barrier-to-entry reduction and skills development in managing new cross-sector collaborations among public, private and third sector organisations.

Despite the increased use of financial incentives, there is little literature addressing means of optimizing outcomes. Using a case-study methodology, the examination of a successful Australian construction project demonstrates the features of a positively geared procurement approach that promotes the effectiveness of financial incentives. The research results show that if the incentive system is perceived to be fair and is applied to reward exceptional performance, and not to manipulate, then contractors are more likely to be positively motivated.

If clients' requirements can be adequately evaluated, projects can be planned with more certainty and be tailored to greater client satisfaction. The research involved 60 clients' ranking of eight project needs: aesthetics, economy, function, quality, working relationships, safety, lack of surprises, and time. Clients' needs were classified broadly into three hierarchical groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly desired. The results showed that quality, safety, and function were the predominant needs. Each client's stated needs should dictate how the dependent variables of design, drafting specifications, selection of contractors, and resource allocation are combined.

J	Ma, QW; Li, S; Cheung, SO				Ma, Qiuwen; Li, Shan; Cheung, Sai On			Unveiling Embedded Risks in Integrated Project Delivery	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integrated project delivery (IPD); Critical risks; IPD projects; Previous; future partnership	MANAGEMENT; COLLABORATION; CHALLENGES; EVOLUTION; ALTRUISM; PARTNER	Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is an innovative procurement approach through which the client, designer, and contractor work together under one contract as a team. While an integrated team is expected to be able to create extra value for the project, this practice may bring new risks if not all team members are committed. The slow uptake of IPD may possibly be due to the insufficient understanding of the risks involved, especially those hidden risks associated with inappropriate integration practice. This study identifies critical risks in IPD projects, and investigates if risk criticality can be alleviated by having previous or future partnership between IPD partners. By collecting the views of construction professionals on the level of criticality of general risks and IPD-specific risks, it is found that (1) most highly critical IPD project risks are borne from multidisciplinary teams of poor integration quality, inaccurate target costs, or unreasonable cost estimates; and (2) having future cooperation intent can significantly alleviate the criticality of certain IPD risks, whereas no effect of previous partnership was found on risk criticality. This study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on IPD by providing insight into the effect of new and general risks on IPD project outcomes in particular and clarifying the role of previous/future partnership in risk management. This study suggests active involvement of client and contractors in the design of IPD and signals future cooperation intent to IPD partners during the project process.

Due to the nature of construction projects, which frequently have large budgets, long durations and many activities with complex procedures, project segmentation involves complicated decision-making. To fill this gap, this study aims to develop an integrated model for planning project segmentation. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model integrates a simulation and multiple attribute decision-making method. The simulation is used to evaluate the bidding outcome of various project segmentations. The owner can then determine the bid-price behavior of contractors in response to varying work package sizes. The multiple attribute decision-making method is used to select the optimal segmentation solution from the simulated scenarios. Findings The proposed model is applied to a large road preservation project in Indonesia and incorporates bid participants and market conditions. The model provides seven scenarios for segmentation. The range of scenarios captures increasing competitiveness in the construction with the average bid price becoming gradually more beneficial for the owner. The model also utilizes a multiple attribute decision-making method to select the optimum scenario for the owner. Originality/value This study presents an applicable model for project segmentation that is useful for both project owners and contractors. By utilizing the proposed model, a project owner can segment a large project into smaller contract packages to create improved project pricing.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing from supplier development theories and practices in the manufacturing sector, a mixed interpretivist and empirical methodology is adopted to examine the body of knowledge within literature for conceptual model development. A self-reporting survey questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale is used to assess 30 construction professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of 37 SC development practices classified into five categories. Descriptive statistics, weighted means, and t-tests are used for data analysis. Findings SC prequalification, commitment, incentives, evaluation and feedback practices can be effective in generating high-performing SCs. Practices that require more direct involvement and linkages between GC and SC are perceived to be less effective. Research limitations/implications Theoretical contributions include a framework to foster future research to advance knowledge and understanding to enhance the adoption of SC development practices in the construction sector. Practical implications Implementation of ranked SC development practices can equip GCs with a network of high-performing SCs for improved competitive advantage and revenues. Originality/value The proposed conceptual model expands discussions on the modification of supplier development theories and practices currently utilized in the manufacturing sector toward their application in the construction sector. This research differs from previous research, which primarily focused on the manufacturing sector.

Causes of disputes, factors affecting dispute resolution and effective alternative dispute resolution for Sri Lankan construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Alternative dispute resolution; construction industry; disputes; Sri Lanka	ADJUDICATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS; BOARDS	Construction industry is typically vital to the economy of any country. It appears that on-going large-scale building and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have attracted numerous international contractors. Moreover, in Sri Lanka, there are several foreign investors, and to-be-funded mega government projects at their inception and initial stages, increasing competition which has already been fierce. However, these massive projects under various stakeholders with different interests usually initiate conflicting claims, if not resolved, will likely lead to disputes, and filing law suits. Once a dispute is crystallized, there are commonly used alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. However, the causes leading to the claims to form a dispute, and the effective ADR methods are largely dependent on the perspective of the stakeholders. This research aims to identifying those dispute causes, factors affecting the selection of dispute resolution methods, and the most effective ADR method in the perspective of different parties to construction projects in the Sri Lankan construction industry. First, an extensive literature review was carried out to identify the ADR context in Sri Lanka. Second, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted involving professionals representing various stakeholders such as contractors, clients and consultants. Survey responses were then analyzed using special purpose statistical software (SPSS). To determine the statistical significance difference among stakeholders' perception, Kruskal-Wallis H test was used with a 90% confidence level. This research thus provides additional insights into causes of claims and ADR selection from different perspectives.	[Illankoon, I. M. C.

To improve the situation, senior managers overseeing portfolios of construction projects need to understand the safety risk levels of their projects so that interventions can be implemented proactively. Safety leading indicators is one way to flag sites that are of higher risk. However, there is a lack of validated leading indicators that can reliably classify sites according to their safety risk levels. On the other hand, despite the success of machine learning (ML) approaches in other domains, it is not widely utilized in the construction industry, especially in the development of safety leading indicators. This paper presents a ML approach to developing leading indicators that classify sites in accordance to their safety risk in construction projects. This study was guided by the industry-recognized Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework and the key types of data used include safety inspection records, accident cases and project-related data. These data were obtained from a large contractor in Singapore and the data were accumulated from year 2010 to 2016. Out of thirty-three input variables (also known as features or independent variables), 13 input variables were selected using a combination of Bonita feature selection technique and decision tree. Of the 13 selected input variables, six of them are project-related (project type, project ownership, contract sum, percent completed, magnitude of delay and project manpower) and seven of them are items in the contractor's safety inspection checklists (crane/lifting operations, scaffold, mechanical-elevated working platform, falling hazards/openings, environmental management, good practices and weighted safety inspection score). Five popular ML algorithms were then used to train models for prediction of accident occurrence and severity. During validation, random forest (RF) provided the best prediction performance with an accuracy of 0.78 and has achieved a substantial strength of agreement with Weighted-Kappa Statistics of 0.70. Comparing with similar studies, this result is promising. The prediction (i.e. the output variable) provided by the RF model can be used as a safety leading indicator of the risk level of a site. It is recommended that the predictive RF model be deployed in construction organizations, especially large public and private developers, contractors and industry associations, to provide monthly forecast of project safety performance so that pre-emptive inspections and interventions can be implemented in a more targeted manner.

J	Sundquist, V; Hulthen, K; Gadde, LE				Sundquist, Viktoria; Hulthen, Kajsa; Gadde, Lars Erik			From project partnering towards strategic supplier partnering	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case study; Strategic management; Construction site; Construction planning	CHAIN INTEGRATION; COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; DECADE	Purpose Partnering has been at the top of the management agenda in the construction industry for many years as a means of improving performance. Previous research shows that partnering has not reached the desired level of strategic partnering, but stopped at project partnering. The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical framing for transformation from project partnering towards strategic partnering with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach The framework is based on two building blocks: a case study of a contractor involved in implementing strategic partnering with four of its suppliers and a literature review dealing with partnering in construction; and models for close and long-term buyer-supplier collaboration in other contexts. Findings Transformation towards strategic partnering should preferably be based on extension of project partnering in two dimensions: extension in time through relationship development with suppliers and extension in space through increasing network orientation across projects. Practical implications Succeeding with relationship development and network orientation requires contractors to abandon two significant aspects of established construction logic that serve as significant implementation barriers. Competitive bidding in single projects needs to be replaced by collaboration over series of projects. The decentralisation of authority to the project level needs to be supplemented with increasing centralised decision making. Originality/value Previous research showed that despite the considerable interest in partnering there is a lack of systematic theorizing of the phenomenon. This paper contributes to theoretical anchoring through the combining of the case study and the literature review in the abductive approach applied.

Despite the advantages of prefabricated construction systems, they are not extensively used in Turkey because of specific yet largely undefined challenges. Therefore, the purpose of this study aims to determine the factors currently affecting the extensive use of prefabricated construction systems in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach The reasons for such systems not being used extensively in Turkey were examined using responses to a questionnaire distributed amongst architects working at design firms, prefabricated-building manufacturers and contractors. The obtained survey data were statistically analysed using the SPSS 22 and LISREL 8.7 software to rank the severity of the identified challenges and determine the most critical factors. Findings Eight critical factors groups affecting the use of prefabricated construction systems and their associated factors were identified according the responses provided by the participants. Potential solutions and recommendations were proposed based on these factor groups that are expected facilitate the implementation of prefabricated construction systems in Turkey. Originality/value Little previous research has provided insight into the specific factors limiting the use of prefabricated construction systems. This study accordingly approaches the subject considering all phases of prefabricated construction systems and presents a structural model of the factors obtained by a confirmatory factor analysis for application to expand the use of prefabricated construction systems.

Many researchers focus on social network centralities (e.g. degree, betweenness, and closeness) and global network measures (e.g., network density, degree distribution, and clustering coefficient) to investigate the relationship patterns in project networks. However, little is known about the local relationship patterns, i.e., relational structures among a small number of project organizations. In this paper, we will construct the contractors' collaboration networks by mapping collaborative relationships between hundreds of contractors within the electronic database of National Quality Award Projects (NQAP) of China. The research purpose is to make use of the normative network motif approach in characterizing the local relationship patterns of project networks and in demonstrating how such relationship patterns evolve, thus contributing to the field of project network research. We find two distinct types of local collaboration patterns, i.e., motif and antimotif in the NQAP collaboration network. The motifs are the evolutionary favored patterns induced by macro network clustering tendency and individual structural embeddedness. Moreover, the evolution of the NQAP collaboration network shows a phase transition characterized by the distribution of the local collaboration patterns. The motif approach is expected to help project organizations devise appropriate strategies to select partners as well as to help governors establish effective strategies of project network governance.

However, previous studies on diversification performance show conflicting results on the correlation between diversification and business performance. Although this is partly because of the different theoretical perspectives of researchers, it is mainly derived from the differences between the various industries and their market environments. Thus, this study considers the influencing factors, such as construction market environment, company size, and business segment, which affect the relationship between diversification and business performance to analyze the relationship between international business diversification and the business performance of international contractors. Based on the data released in the Engineering News Record and financial reports, varied statistical exploration including correlation and clustering analysis were performed to derive effective strategies grounded in the relationship between diversification level and business performance. According to the analysis results, the international business diversification levels showed a clear positive correlation with sales revenue, whereas business diversification, profit margin, and current ratio did not show a strong correlation; rather, a higher level of diversification tended to weaken the profit margin and current ratio. From the result showing the correlation between diversification and business performance derived from the clustering analysis, it was found that although diversification is essential to facilitate growth in the size of the company, it can reduce the profitability and stability of a diversified company. Ultimately, this study will provide appropriate and effective business strategy guidelines for international contractors endeavoring to expand their international markets.

Process Indicators to Track Effectiveness of High-Performance Green Building Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable development; Case studies; Integration indicators; Process metrics; Project management; Construction industry	PUBLIC-SECTOR; DESIGN-BUILD; DELIVERY; SYSTEMS	High-performance green buildings, which maximize energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality, require increased collaboration among interdisciplinary professionals during project delivery. Recent theoretical and applied research illuminates the critical role of delivery attributes in performance outcomes. Despite such evidence, rigorous research is still needed to establish links between delivery attributes and performance outcomes in sustainable projects to further motivate owners and project teams to adopt and successfully implement sustainable practices and eventually improve actual energy performance and indoor environmental quality of buildings. This paper used quantitative methods to identify statistically correlated in-process indicators with project performance outcomes such as green level, cost, and schedule in sustainable building project delivery. The sample set used data from two previous studies totaling 51 green-certified building projects. Results yield statistically significant corresponding weightings for 7 to 15 in-process indicators for sustainable building project delivery including setting owner-initiated sustainable goals, having all major project parties attending design charrettes, running energy and lighting simulations no later than the schematics-design phase, adequacy in owner capabilities for scope definition and decision making, selecting contractors from a restrained pool, and enabling contractor involvement in the delivery process no later than the design-development phase. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by offering statistical evidence underlining the importance of in-process indicators for sustainable building project performance outcomes and proving insights to elevate team integration through the delivery process.

While the optimal capital structure and equity capital structure of the project company have been extensively investigated, few studies have examined how to allocate equity shares among different private participants. Considering both public and private benefits, this study focuses on the optimal equity structure between construction contractor (CC) and operating contractor (OC). A game model is used to analyze how quality benefit and marginal contribution of CC and OC's effort affect the optimal equity structure. The findings reveal that the private consortium expects the party (CC or OC) with higher marginal contribution of effort to own more equity shares, while government expects the party (CC or OC) with lower marginal contribution of effort to own more equity shares. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between the optimal equity structure and government's bargaining power is found. The results also manifest that the quality benefit of construction on operation is a nontrivial factor when designing the equity structure. If unconsidered, the CC's optimal equity ratio will be either undervalued (when a higher construction quality can reduce the operating cost) or overvalued (when a higher construction quality can increase the operating cost). These findings can provide some insights into designing the equity structure for PPP projects in the bidding process.

J	Tserng, HP; Lin, YC				Tserng, HP; Lin, YC			Developing an activity-based knowledge management system for contractors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						project management; knowledge management; information technology; IDEF		Knowledge Management (KM) has become an important term in the IT industry. Knowledge management involves creating, securing, capturing, coordinating, combining, retrieving and distributing knowledge. Most know-what, know-how and experience exist only in the minds of individual participants during the construction phase of construction projects. The knowledge can be reused and shared among the engineers and experts involved who participate in projects in order to improve the construction process and reduce the time and cost of solving problems. Sharing and reusing knowledge depends on acquiring and preserving both tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge as the property of a corporation. Effectively using information and web technologies during the construction phase of a project enables knowledge to be captured and managed to the benefit of future projects. This study addresses application of knowledge management to construction projects in the construction phase and proposes a Construction Activity-Based Knowledge Management (ConABKM) concept and system for General contractors. This paper proposes the concept of integrating IDEF (Integrated DEFinition function modeling) modeling methods and provides a prototype used for designing construction knowledge management systems. The ConABKM system is then applied in a case study of a highway construction project; the results demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge in the construction phase. The combined results demonstrate that by utilizing the latest web technology, knowledge exchange and storage concepts and modes of implementation, a ConABKM system is an effective tool for all experts and engineers participating in the construction phase of a project.

Our findings suggest that open and closed innovation can be combined by creating an appropriate communication and exchange environment, whose elements include organizational arrangements (e.g., team organization and task assignment) and methods and rules of communication. We also found that innovation in megaprojects can be successfully driven when the contractors are encouraged to search for and implement incremental solutions to minor problems, not just radical and strategically relevant innovations.

It is difficult for insurance companies to diversify their risks by undertaking enough similar policies, and participating in on-site risk management has become an important method of active risk control. Based on the principal-agent relationship between the owner, insurance company, and contractor, this paper establishes incentive mechanisms for risk management considering the common agency and exclusive agency models. The results show that an insurance company's involvement in the common agency model creates external effects that can improve the utility of both the owner and the insurance company. The owner is then willing to provide a higher incentive coefficient, and the contractor's nonrisk and risk management efforts increase accordingly. From the owner's perspective, the influence of the participants' characteristics and external uncertainties on the incentive strategy are discussed. The results recommend that it is better for the owners and insurance companies to jointly establish a good cooperative relationship and build the incentive mechanism. The spillover effect has a positive effect on the cooperation between the two parties, while the impact of the uncertainty in risk management output on the cooperative relationship is negative. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge for understanding the on-site risk management considering stakeholders' participation and provides a practical mode for owners and insurance companies to implement active risk management in mega projects, thus achieving better risk governance of mega projects.

Staff from organizations operating at the blunt end (e.g., clients/design engineers providing finance and information) and those at the sharp end (e.g., contractors at the "coal-face") of a project's supply chain were interviewed to make sense of the rework that occurred. The analysis identified the need for managers to de-emphasize an environment that prioritizes production over other considerations and instead systematically examine mechanisms and factors that shape people's performance.

Domestic contractors faced maximum challenges in contractual scope management, which was implemented by such organizations based on their existing codes of practice. The purpose of this paper is to understand these barriers in scope management as faced by the domestic contractors of Afghanistan. Design/methodology/approach The research employs a mixed methodology to cater to its objectives. Face-to-face structured interviews of 14 industry experts and extensive literature review were conducted to identify unique barriers pertaining to Afghanistan construction industry. Further, quantitative assessment of these barriers through the statistical tools of "mean score ranking," "Kendall's test" and "independent sample t-test" was carried out to understand the severity of the barriers. Findings In total, 39 unique barriers were identified under the groups of "scope formulation," "scope completeness," "scope pricing," "scope implementation" and "scope change control." The consequential impacts of these barriers and their existence at different stages of the project were illustrated. The most severe barriers were identified as the "inadequacy of site investigation reports" and the "unavailability of resources in local markets." Originality/value The understanding of the challenges faced by local stakeholders, as highlighted by this study, can be utilized by these international organizations in their strategy and planning to ensure successful projects while also propagating the adoption of sustainable construction practices.

J	Tansey, P; Spillane, JP; Brooks, T				Tansey, Paul; Spillane, John P.; Brooks, Tara			Creating opportunities in the face of an environmental jolt: exploring turnaround strategizing practices within large Irish construction contractors	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Internationalization; Ireland; organizational turnaround; retrenchment; strategy-as-practice	AS-PRACTICE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PRACTICE PERSPECTIVE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; ECONOMIC RECESSION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FIRM TURNAROUNDS; RETRENCHMENT; BUSINESS; DECLINE	Firms that face organizational decline choreographed from an environmental jolt must seek new ways of creating opportunities in order to successfully turnaround. As such, the identification of pertinent turnaround strategies becomes increasingly important for senior management. Within the strategy-as-practice scholarly, there have been recent calls to move beyond empirical isolationism and to connect with other larger social phenomena; while across the turnaround literature there have been calls to explore the process and micro-structure of turnaround strategies in cyclical environments. To address this research gap, the purpose of the study is to adopt a tall ontology by blending the strategy-as-practice lens with the organizational decline and turnaround lens. By drawing on five exploratory case studies of large Irish construction contractors, the central objective is thus to explore firms' turnaround strategizing practices during an environmental jolt. In order to advance our tall ontology, we developed a turnaround strategizing process model (and propositions) that integrates our findings, and which offers the fundamental building blocks of a new blended theory. We find that successful turnaround attempts entail the simultaneous interaction of non-aggressive cost retrenchment actions and non-extensive internationalization. The case studies further suggest that during a prolonged environmental jolt, cost retrenchment is more often a long-term strategy. Lastly, the findings provide valuable support for practitioners in developing a successful turnaround response, and in aiding the selection and timing of operational and strategic actions.

J	Bakry, I; Moselhi, O; Zayed, T				Bakry, Ibrahim; Moselhi, Osama; Zayed, Tarek			Optimized acceleration of repetitive construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Repetitive projects; Acceleration; Linear scheduling	LINEAR SCHEDULING MODEL; COST OPTIMIZATION	Contractors and/or owners frequently need to accelerate the delivery of construction projects. Contractors may have to accelerate in order to benefit from contractual bonus, avoid penalties, recover from delays and/or avoid undesirable weather and site conditions. Owners, on the other hand, may order acceleration to meat business and operational opportunities. This paper presents an algorithm for schedule updating, dynamic rescheduling and optimized acceleration of repetitive construction projects. Schedule updating captures the exact progress on site. Dynamic rescheduling aims at capitalizing on the repetitive nature of the project to fine-tune the remaining portion of the project. Optimized acceleration presents an optimized time-cost trade-off that is tailored for repetitive projects. Through a set of iterative steps, the optimized acceleration procedure divides each activity into segments and identifies the segments that would shorten project duration if accelerated. For those identified segments, the ones with the least cost slope are selected and queued for acceleration. Through the proposed segmentation of activities this algorithm provides optimum allocation of additional acceleration resources, thus is rendered capable of identifying least cost acceleration plans. The algorithm allows users to select among different acceleration strategies such as working overtime, working double shifts, working weekends, and employing more productive crews. The presented algorithm maintains work continuity and accounts for typical and non-typical activities. The algorithm is implemented in a spreadsheet application, which automates calculations, yet allows users to fine tune the algorithm to fit the project at hand. The developed algorithm is applied to a case study drawn from literature in order to illustrate its basic features and demonstrate its accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The methods evolved over time largely depend on the amount of information available at the time of estimation. More often than not, the estimate produced during the pre-tender stage is far more than the tender cost of the project and sometimes, it is perilously underestimated and caused major problems to the client in the monetary planning. The purpose of this paper is to determine the most influential factors on the deviation of pre-tender cost estimation in Malaysia by conducting a survey. Design/methodology/approach Fuzzy logic, combined with artificial neural network method (fuzzy neural network) was then used to develop an estimating model to aid the pre-tender estimation process. Findings The results showed that the model is able to shift the cost estimation toward accuracy. This model can be used to improve the pre-tender estimation accuracy, enabling the client to take the necessary early measures in preparing the funding for a building project in Malaysia. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study on tender price estimation standardization for a construction project in Malaysia. In addition, the authors have used factors from literature for the model, which shows the thoroughness of the developed model. Thus, the findings and the model developed in this study should be able to assist contractors in coming out with a more accurate tender price estimation.

Variation orders result in time delay, cost overrun, quality defects, and other negative impacts. This is common in construction projects in Gaza Strip. The main objective of this study was to analyze the causes of variation orders in construction projects in Gaza Strip. The causes of variation orders in construction process in Gaza Strip were investigated through questionnaire survey of 36 classified construction companies, 25 consultants and 15 owners. 64 causes of variation orders were identified from literature review. The study results identified the top ten most important factors that include lack of materials and equipment spare parts due to closure, change in design by consultant, lack of consultant's knowledge of available materials, errors and omission in design, conflicts between contract documents, owner's financial problems, lack of coordination among project parties, using inadequate specification for local markets by international consultant, internal politics, and change is specification by owners. In general, the study shows an agreement among owners, consultants and contractors regarding the ranking of the 64 factors causing variation orders. The results also reveal that factors related to consultant are the most important causes of variation orders followed by the factors related to owner. An understanding of the causes of variation orders would be helpful for building professionals in assessing variation orders. Furthermore, the study would also assist professionals in taking proactive measures for reducing variation orders in construction projects. The findings from this study would also be valuable for all construction professionals in general.

Risk Index Model for Minimizing Environmental Disputes in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Although the number of environment-related disputes is increasing, no risk management approach exists to minimize such disputes at construction sites. The purpose of this study was to develop an environmental risk index model for general contractors to minimize third-party environmental disputes at construction sites. The analytic hierarchy process is used to weigh and calculate an environmental risk index. A case study demonstrated how to apply this model for risk evaluation, on-site monitoring, and environmental management, whereas a comparative analysis revealed that the model decreased the number of disputes to some degree at sites where it was used. This model makes it possible to minimize environmental disputes in the field effectively.	[Eom, Creed S.

J	Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD				Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD			Predicting construction plant maintenance expenditure	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction plant; financial management; linear interpolation; maintenance; management; prediction; stochastic random numbers; UK	EQUIPMENT SELECTION	Utilization of construction plant and equipment forms an essential part of construction contractors' efforts to augment productivity and reduce costs. However, efficient and effective management of plant and equipment is requisite to maximizing its potential benefits. A problem in this respect is not knowing when a maintenance event might occur, or its extent in terms of cost and time. This paper presents a stochastic mathematical modelling methodology (using random numbers) to predict the probable cost of 'the next' maintenance event for tracked hydraulic excavators; where a maintenance event includes both breakdown and scheduled maintenance. Information on a random sample of 33 360 degrees tracked hydraulic excavators were obtained from contractors operating within the opencast mining industry. From these, 9473 maintenance event 'cost' observations were recorded and modelled. Validation of the model is achieved using a random 'hold out' sample of 50 maintenance cost observations taken from nine machines. Analyses reveal that overall model predictive performance is robust, having a mean percentage error (MPE) of 4.46 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23.63. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and a paired t-test are conducted to determine the accuracy and consistency of model predictions respectively. With an r of 0.76 and no significant difference being found between the mean of predicted/actual values, the model shows both accurate and consistent cost predictions. The random number technique shows potential for improved maintenance practice by providing a practical methodology for planning, scheduling and controlling future plant resource requirements. The paper concludes with direction for future research which includes: (1) the application of this research to plant items working in other operational environments (e.g. civil engineering and construction); and (2) prediction of the next breakdown event.

J	Umeokafor, N				Umeokafor, Nnedinma			An investigation into public and private clients' attitudes, commitment and impact on construction health and safety in Nigeria	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public sector; Commitment; Construction industry; Attitude; Private sector; Owner; Health and safety (H&S)	SECTOR	Purpose This purpose of this paper is to report the findings of a study that assessed the attitudes, commitment and impact of public and private sector clients' involvement in construction health and safety (H&S) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Structured questionnaires were designed based on literature review and a pilot study, and administered to public and private clients in Nigeria's construction industry. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyse the data. Findings The result shows that while clients' attitudes towards H&S are not encouraging, public clients commitment and attitudes are better than that of private clients. This is emphasised by the significant difference between the categories of clients and: accident investigation; clients auditing contractors H&S records at the preconstruction stage. The common client H&S practice includes conducting site visits and inspections and attending H&S meetings, while engaging in H&S awareness and H&S audit during construction are not common. However, when clients are involved in H&S, it has resulted in a reduction in accidents, compensation claims, rework and improved the relationship between clients and contractors. Practical implications The findings form a basis for improving client involvement in H&S (factoring in the differences in clients) which policymakers, the construction industry and academics will find beneficial. Originality/value The study contributes to understanding the attitudes and commitment of public and private clients in H&S, evidencing the implications of the differences in their needs, characteristics and behaviours. While the study is the first to investigate the area in Nigeria, it also extends the knowledge of the discourse comparatively in broader terms.

J	Zhang, ZQ; Pan, W; Pan, M				Zhang, Zhiqian; Pan, Wei; Pan, Mi			Critical considerations on tower crane layout planning for high-rise modular integrated construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Tower crane layout planning; Modular integrated construction; High-rise modular building; Construction planning; Multicriteria decision-making	LOCATION OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; SELECTION	Purpose Modular integrated construction (MiC) is the most advanced off-site construction technology. However, the application of MiC for high-rise buildings is still limited and challenging. One critical issue is tower crane layout planning (TCLP) to guarantee safe and efficient multiple crane-lifts for module installation, which, however, has been insufficiently explored. For filling this knowledge gap, this paper aims to systematically explore the critical considerations on TCLP for high-rise MiC to support contractors in determining the optimal crane layout plan. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a multimethod strategy. First, previous studies on TCLP and critical features of MiC were reviewed to develop a conceptual model of TCLP considerations. Second, expert interviews with 15 construction planners were conducted to identify the critical TCLP considerations for high-rise MiC. Third, a multicase study with three high-rise MiC projects was undertaken to demonstrate and verify the identified considerations. Findings The paper characterises critical considerations on TCLP as performance criteria and influencing factors and identifies 7 critical performance criteria and 25 influencing factors for high-rise MiC. Specifically, the features of MiC (e.g. various modularised layout design, heavyweight and large size of modules) were found to significantly affect the crane layout performance (i.e. technical feasibility, safety and economic efficiency). Originality/value The paper is the first-of-its-kind study on crane layout planning for high-rise modular buildings, which contributes a two-stage multicriteria decision-making framework integrated with systematic TCLP considerations. The findings should help contractors determine safe and efficient tower crane layout plans for high-rise MiC projects.

Quality Control Scheme Selection with a Case of Aviation Equipment Development	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Quality Plan Selection; Aviation Equipment Development Project; Optimal Multilevel Decision; Decision Sequence; Modularity; Operations Management Program & Project Management	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT; MODULARITY; MODEL; ARCHITECTURES; UNCERTAINTY; COMPLEXITY; CAPABILITY; INNOVATION	Due to the complex outsourcing characteristics of aviation equipment development, one key issue is how to coordinate quality and cost decisions during development. This article focuses on the quality control plan selection from the multilevel perspective and builds a multilevel algorithm. Considering a complex research and development (R&D) project involving an integrator (client, tier 1 in a supply chain) and a contractor (tier 2 in a supply chain), this study builds two models by taking two different kinds of decision sequences into account. In the first case, the client moves first (i.e., the client makes decision first) while the contractor is the first mover in the second case. Two objectives are considered: the quality improvement rate and the resource cost. The results show that it is not necessary for the client to be the first mover in the decision-making process when alternative plans show no obvious difference in both the quality improvement rate and resource cost. In addition, because of the transitivity of quality objectives and resource constraints, the component quality from lower level will take effect on upper-level quality. Moreover, we find that the client, as the first mover, has a marked impact on the total quality improvement rate of the project only when alternative plans show obvious differences in either the quality improvement rate or the resource consumption. Our study offers insights on the importance of exploring the relationship of decision sequences on quality plans for a project manager.

Factors influencing transaction costs of prefabricated housing projects in China: developers' perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Transaction cost; Prefabricated housing; Developers; Stakeholders; Ordered logistic regression		Purpose The recent promotion of prefabricated housing (PH) in China has resulted in a prosperous period for its implementation. However, transaction costs (TCs) cause low economic efficiency to stakeholders and hinder the further promotion of PH. No relevant study has yet been made to investigate the TCs and their causes in the PH field. This paper identifies critical TCs and explores the influencing factors from the developers' perspective. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey were used to collect data about TCs and influencing factors. The most influential factors are identified with their impacts on particular TCs, yielded from correlation analysis and logistic regression. Findings From the developers' perspective in China's PH market, this study identified that the most concerning sources of TCs are: hidden costs arising from disputes, extra workloads from design changes, learning costs, intensive communication and coordination in assembly and unexpected information costs in decision-making. The use of an ordered logistic regression approach indicates that the four most influential factors are: qualification of the general contractor, mandatory local policies, owner type and competitiveness of the developer. Practical implications To reduce the TCs, experiencing learning and ensuring the design scheme's complicity are recommended to save information searching and exchanging costs. The implications for the PH developers are for them to: (1) professionalize their own organization and (2) procure high-qualified general contractors. For the policymakers, this means they should improve the clarity of the mandatory local policies for PH step-by-step. Originality/value By applying the TCs economic theory, this study explores factors that influence TCs in the PH industry. It sheds light on the influencing mechanism behind the TCs in the context of prefabricated housing.

J	Lu, WS; Ye, KH; Flanagan, R; Jewell, C				Lu, Weisheng; Ye, Kunhui; Flanagan, Roger; Jewell, Carol			Nexus between Contracting and Construction Professional Service Businesses: Empirical Evidence from International Market	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting; Construction professional services; Lead-lag effect; International construction market; Organizational issues		The construction market around the world has witnessed the growing eminence of construction professional services (CPSs), such as urban planning, architecture, engineering, and consultancy, while the traditional contracting sector remains strong. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see a design firm taking over the work of a traditional main contractor, or vice versa, of overseeing the delivery of a project. Although the two sectors of contracting and CPS share the same purpose of materializing the built environment, they are as different as they are interrelated. Much has been mentioned about the nexus between the two but little has been done to articulate it using empirical evidence. This study examined the nexus between contracting and CPS businesses by offering and testing lead-lag effects between the two sectors in the international market. A longitudinal panel data composed of 23 top international contractors and CPS firms was adopted. Surprisingly, results of the panel data analyses show that CPS business does not have a significant positive causal effect on contracting as a downstream business, and vice versa. CPS and contracting subsidiaries, although within the same company, do not necessarily form a consortium to undertake the same project; rather, they often collaborate with other CPS or contracting counterparts to undertake projects. This paper provides valuable insights into the sophisticated nexus between contracting and CPS in the international construction market. It will support business executives' rational decision making for selecting proper contracting or CPS allies, or a proper mergers and acquisitions strategy in the international market. The paper also provides a fresh perspective through which researchers can better investigate the diversification strategies adopted by international contracting and CPS firms.

Forecasting Private-Sector Construction Works: VAR Model Using Economic Indicators	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction works; Economic indicators; Granger causality; Vector auto-regression model; Quantitative methods	NONRESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT; GROWTH; MARKET	Accurately modeling and forecasting construction works completed by main contractors is pivotal for policymakers, who require reliable market intelligence to adjust or develop optimal labor and housing policies. Yet, despite its importance, limited research has been conducted to systematically develop approaches to investigating future trends of works completed in the private construction sector. Against this backdrop, this paper provides a study of the annual financial value of construction work in the private residential market. A vector auto-regression (VAR) model developed utilizes economic indicators (used by private financiers when making investment decisions) to estimate the value of annual construction work carried out by main contractors. Using data from the Hong Kong private residential market and constructing an accumulated impulse function, the developed model suggests that construction work completions in private residential markets can be explained by changes in economic indicators such as gross domestic product and the property price index. These economic indicators have been identified as having a large and direct effect on forthcoming construction works. The developed model also provides a high degree of accuracy (producing an adjusted R-2 value of 0.72) when simulating or forecasting future changes in the value of construction works over a short-term 5-year forecast. The output of this study contributes to the literature by systematically developing a reliable approach using economic indicators that is useful for forecasting private-sector construction completions. Such knowledge is of paramount importance when estimating the industry's future workload and supply of residential buildings. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Sing, Michael C.

Identifying impact of variables in deep learning models on bankruptcy prediction of construction contractors	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Construction contractor; Deep learning; Variable impacts; Shapley value		Purpose The study seeks to identify the impact of variables in a deep learning-based bankruptcy prediction model, which has achieved superior performance to other prediction models but cannot easily interpret hidden processes. Design/methodology/approach This study developed three LSTM-RNN-based models that predicted the probability of bankruptcy before 1, 2 and 3 years using financial, the construction market and macroeconomic variables as input variables. Then, the impacts of the input variables that affected prediction accuracy in each model were identified by using Shapley value and compared among the three models. This study also investigated the prediction accuracy using variants of input variables grouped sequentially by high-impact ranking. Findings The results showed that the prediction accuracies were largely impacted by "housing starts" in all models. As the prediction period increased, the effects of macroeconomic variables on prediction accuracy increased, whereas the impact of "return on assets" on prediction accuracy decreased. It also found that the "current ratio" and "debt ratio" significantly influenced the prediction accuracies in all models. Also, the results revealed that similar prediction accuracies could be achieved using only 8, 10, and 10 variables out of a total of 18 variables for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction models, respectively. Originality/value This study provides a Shapley value-based approach to identify how each input variable in a deep-learning bankruptcy prediction model. The findings of this study can not only assist in obtaining better insights into the underlying concept of bankruptcy but also use to select variables by removing those identified as less significant.

Establishing the Influence of Owner Practices on Construction Safety in an Operational Excellence Model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Operational excellence; Owner's impacts; Construction safety; Analytical hierarchy process; Quantitative methods		Often, construction contractors usually consider safety as the sole responsibility of the contractor. Under this prevailing assumption, owners are often excluded and exempted from construction safety issues. However, a growing number of construction safety researchers and practitioners recognize that the owner's engagement in construction safety plays a vital role in safety performance improvement. Although some research efforts were made, the owner's role in construction safety is still heavily under-researched. Operational excellence (OE) is a concept successfully applied for performance improvement in numerous industries. The essence of the OE philosophy is that desirable results stem from predictable behaviors. Operational excellence is defined as doing the right thing, the right way, every time, even when no one is watching. Based on OE, efforts were made to establish an effective model to quantitatively measure and improve owner's impacts on construction safety. This model, entitled the Owner's Role Rating Model, contained six elements that are vital to the owner's engagement in jobsite safety, called critical to safety (CTS). It was unreasonable to assume that all six CTS elements are equally important to the owner's safety role. Therefore, the analytical hierarchy process was applied to determine relative weights for each of the six CTSs through an extensive questionnaire survey. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is to weight and present a practical and effective model for owners and other construction practitioners, to evaluate the performance of the owner's role in safety, and identify opportunities for improvement.

J	Dewlaney, KS; Hallowell, MR; Fortunato, BR				Dewlaney, Katherine S.; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Fortunato, Bernard R., III			Safety Risk Quantification for High Performance Sustainable Building Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Sustainability; LEED; Risk	INJURY	A recent study found that Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings have a recordable injury rate that is 9% higher than traditional, non-LEED buildings. A follow-up study showed that there are distinct aspects of the design elements and means and methods of construction used to achieve LEED certification that have negative impacts on worker safety. The research described in this paper builds on previous knowledge by quantifying the percent increase in base-level safety risk resulting from the design strategies and construction methods implemented to earn specific LEED credits. A total of 26 interviews and 11 validation interviews were conducted with designers and contractors who had completed an average of four LEED projects, 100 traditional projects, in their average of 18 years of experience in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The results indicate that design elements and means and methods of construction implemented to achieve 12 of the 49 LEED credits increase the frequency of injuries or exposure to known, high risk environments. The most significant impacts are a 36% increase in lacerations, strains, and sprains from recycling construction materials; a 24% increase in falls to lower level during roof work because of the installation of on-site renewable energy (e.g., PV panels); a 19% increase in eye strain when installing reflective roof membranes; and a 14% increase in exposure to harmful substances when installing innovative wastewater technologies. These results can be used to understand the safety impacts of sustainable building design, will enhance designer awareness, and help contractors to better prioritize safety resources.

J	Keenan, M; Rostami, A				Keenan, Mark; Rostami, Ali			The impact of quality management systems on construction performance in the North West of England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Quality management; quality management systems; construction performance; North West of England	ISO 9001	As the total construction output in the North West of England (NWE) is forecast to rise by an average of 2.5% over the next five years. It is imperative for organizations in the region to improve their overall construction performance, particularly if they are to hit the targets presented by UK Government in the construction 2025 report. Despite the known benefits of quality management systems (QMS) its implementation in relation to construction performance is very limited, particularly in the UK. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether QMS can affect construction performance in the NWE. A pragmatic mixed method approach of sequential explanatory strategy was adopted to conduct this research. This initially involved a quantitative approach of questionnaire surveys to gain opinions and views of a representative sample of industry professionals based in the NWE. The quantitative results were analyzed to discover relationships in the data and further formulate the questions for the qualitative interviews. Three interviews with leading industry professionals were then conducted and the data was analyzed using a thematic approach. The themes identified in the interviews were then cross-referenced with the data discovered in the questionnaire survey and literature review. The findings provide a clear indication that the implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on construction performance in the NWE. Immediate improvements in efficiency of a construction organization when implementing a QMS were discovered, including greater managerial control and the recording and reduction in defects. Long term effects of changing company attitude by setting out company requirements and responsibilities through highlighting the significance of quality, and furthermore encouraging a culture of co-operation and teamwork, were also proven to increase construction performance as time progresses. To further enhance this research the focus could be on the whole of the UK. However, a greater amount of time would be required to gain the required representative sample. Furthermore, although the questionnaire survey was distributed equally within the selected sample, a greater number of respondents working for contractors responded. Therefore, the respondents of the questionnaire survey were not equal in terms of organization (client, contractor, sub-contractor, project manager). According to the best knowledge of the authors and through searching many sources, there are no specific studies examining QMS and their effect on construction performance in the UK and particularly in the NWE. Therefore, it is believed the study is the first of its kind. The study discovered many findings that can be considered as a contribution to practice and theory. Moreover, it can be considered as a fundamental base for future studies in this research area.

A total of 21,104 and 17,464 injuries and nonconformances (NCR), respectively, were identified and categorized. A total of 86% of injuries that were incurred were because of minor cuts or sprains, but allowed the person to continue to carry out their normal duties. NCRs less than AU$20 thousand accounted for 96% of the total costs incurred. Moreover, NCRs greater than AU$100 thousand and those between AU$20 thousand to AU$100 thousand accounted for 42 and 36%, respectively. The number of NCRs attributed to rework was 47%, which represented 84% of their total cost. Further analysis revealed that injuries were significantly correlated with NCRs, specifically rework (p < 0.01). As the variance for injuries significantly exceeded its mean, there was overdispersion within the data. Therefore, a negative binomial model was developed to predict injuries, while simultaneously considering the relationship with NCRs and different types of projects based on the worker-hours worked. The mean monthly predicted against actual injuries for 106-month period was computed. The developed model provides an accurate prediction of injury frequency and thus could be used as a passive lead-indicator as part of a contractor's safety and quality performance programs. In addition, it is promulgated that it can support the process of requisite imagination, which involves anticipating what might go wrong and provide the impetus for testing problems in advance of commencing the construction process with regard to quality and safety issues.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate various factors (time, cost, technical know-how, organizational, sustainability, etc.) and their influence on the choice of the construction method. The paper examines the different assessments of designers, manufacturers, and contractors regarding precast construction in comparison to traditional in-situ methods, and highlights the major differences in their views. Design/methodology/approach - Structured face-to-face surveys were conducted with top management personnel of precast manufacturers, architectural and engineering firms, and contracting companies in Lebanon. In addition, a case study from the largest precast project in Lebanon was used to provide a deeper understanding of factors encouraging the use of precast concrete, and to highlight major onsite issues associated with its implementation. Findings - On the one hand, the findings highlight technical, logistical, organizational, and cultural factors that inhibit the use of precast concrete as a construction method. On the other hand, results reveal that cost, time, sustainability, and flexibility factors are the main enablers for increasing the uptake of modular concrete construction. Originality/value - The main contribution to knowledge is that this study presents different stakeholders' perspectives on precast concrete construction. Moreover, this is the first research addressing precast concrete construction in the Middle East and Lebanon. The results of the study provide valuable global insights and recommendations that may help increase the uptake of precast concrete construction. They can also guide project stakeholders to properly match project characteristics and precast concrete as a construction method.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework and propositions on enhanced relationship strength between component suppliers and designers as third parties. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual approach is used in this paper. Previous empirical research on business relationships, project networks and relationship strength is reviewed systematically, to identify factors required for strengthening the relationship in project networks. Findings - Cooperative practices needed for strengthening the relationships in project networks were identified. The framework on how such practices are associated with relationship strength between supplier and designers was developed. Propositions on strengthening the relationship between component suppliers and designers were stated. These propositions can be developed further and tested in a hypothetic-deductive study. Research limitations/implications - The research was delimited by the choice of designers as third parties. The authors used some excerpts from the earlier interview study with over 20 designers, to illustrate the issues. Empirical analysis was not included in this paper which causes an evident limitation to validity. Additional research is proposed on analyzing the contractors' and suppliers' viewpoints to third-party relationships. Practical implications - The paper suggests cooperative practices for construction component suppliers to enhance their relationship strength with third parties in project networks. Originality/value - Limited research attention has been directed at the third-party relationships of suppliers in project networks. This paper offers important knowledge about these less salient relationships in project networks, beyond a simple dyadic relationship in the direct supply chain.

J	Polat, G				Polat, Gul			PRECAST CONCRETE SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING VS. INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						precast concrete; building systems; developing countries; industrialized countries; questionnaire; Turkey; USA	PREFABRICATION; PERFORMANCE	Precast concrete technology is recognized worldwide as offering significant advantages. Despite the advantages they offer, precast concrete building systems' share in both Turkey and the U. S. is very low, especially when compared to many European countries. Since Turkey is a developing country that is technologically dependent on the developed world, low share of industrialized building systems is highly expected in that country. However, the U. S. is a developed and industrialized country, so it was very interesting to see that these systems are not extensively used in that country either. This study investigated the factors that prevent the extensive use of precast concrete systems in the U. S. and Turkey through an extensive questionnaire survey. The survey results revealed that the perceptions of the American vs. Turkish respondents on most of the factors that affect the use of precast concrete systems are significantly different from each other. While American respondents considered size and load restrictions on transportation, poor communication among parties, and lack of qualified contractors specialized in precast concrete systems as three most important barriers to the extensive use of precast concrete systems in the U. S. building construction market, Turkish respondents ranked lack of good communication among parties and lack of structural engineers and contractors specialized in precast concrete systems as the most important three factors that prevent the extensive use of these systems in Turkey. This study indicated that precast concrete users and manufacturers should recognize that the main reasons for low utilization of precast concrete systems predominantly depend on the prevailing conditions of the country in question.

J	Gadisa, B; Zhou, H				Gadisa, Benti; Zhou, Hong			Exploring influential factors leading to the poor performance of public construction project in Ethiopia using structural equation modelling	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Questionnaire survey; Construction planning	FIT INDEXES; QUALITY; OVERRUN; SECTOR	Purpose It is well recognized that the construction industry is characterised by inefficient and ineffective service delivery due to various causative factors. Thus this study aims to examine the influential factors affecting public construction project performance in Ethiopia to improve the industry's service delivery. Design/methodology/approach From the extensive literature reviewed, 58 potential factors affecting construction project performance have been compiled. Based on the evidence accumulated, the conceptual model of this paper has been developed. By using survey questionnaires, valuable data were collected from the construction industry professionals in Ethiopia; analysed and interpreted with the use of both SPSS and AMOS software. Findings It is concluded that failure factors related to the "performance" of the contractor, the "capability" of the owner, the "project design-procurement process," and project contract management can significantly contribute to the poor performance of public construction projects in Ethiopia. Ten key factors include inadequate contractor capacity, weak project site management and supervision, weak project management skills and capabilities of the owner, additional work orders, delayed payment, lack of comprehensive project plans between parties and incomplete project design, rising material prices, ineffective project schedules, and cost management, rising market prices and devaluation of the currency. Research limitations/implications The scope of this study confined to public projects in Ethiopia. It suggests that further research needs to consider public and private construction from a comprehensive perspective in the developing countries. Practical implications It provides practitioners with information and guidance on the factors that affect the performance of construction projects. Originality/value It provides inclusive evidence related to many factors that affect the performance of public construction projects.

J	Poirier, EA; Staub-French, S; Forgues, D				Poirier, Erik A.; Staub-French, Sheryl; Forgues, Daniel			Measuring the impact of BIM on labor productivity in a small specialty contracting enterprise through action-research	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Labor Productivity; Building information modeling; Prefabrication; Action research; Performance assessment; Small or medium enterprise (SME); Construction; Specialty contractor	CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE	Productivity in the construction industry is a well-documented and expansive field of research. It benefits from over four decades of research that have developed models and methods for evaluation and identified multiple factors that influence it. In parallel, building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a disruptive innovation, showing great potential to mitigate many of the factors negatively affecting construction productivity. Indeed, studies are increasingly looking into the impact of BIM on project performance. Improving construction productivity, labor productivity in particular, is one of the widely reported benefits. For organizations looking to transition to BIM, being able to grasp these benefits and quantify their impact is extremely important to ensure the viability of the BIM implementation process. This article presents the findings of an action-research project undertaken with a small mechanical contractor which investigates the impact of BIM on labor productivity on a large commercial project. The objective of the action-research was to assist the organization in reconfiguring its performance measurement practices in light of the transition to BIM and prefabrication. The article discusses the challenges of this reconfiguration and presents the findings from the performance measurement process which was put in place. The findings suggest a clear positive impact of BIM on labor productivity on the project studied: the areas that were modeled and prefabricated showed an increase in productivity ranging from 75% to 240% over the areas that were not modeled. More importantly, however, the article operationalizes a strategy allowing organizations to consistently assess their performance relating to labor productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Anderson, SD; Fisher, DJ; Rahman, SP				Anderson, SD; Fisher, DJ; Rahman, SP			Constructibility issues for highway projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								State transportation agencies recognize the need for contract documents that will ensure rational bids and minimize problems during construction of facilities. A significant aspect of developing high-quality contract documents is to incorporate constructibility reviews into project planning and design. Before state transportation agency management can address constructibility implementation, critical issues affecting implementation must be understood. A survey was conducted to capture specific constructibility issues from the perspective of agencies, design firms, and construction contractors. These issues are categorized into those relevant to project execution processes, project planning and technical design documents, and project resources. Analysis and interpretation of the issues within these three categories suggest eleven paradigm shifts that state transportation agency management must address to successfully implement a constructibility program.

J	Avetisyan, H; Skibniewski, M				Avetisyan, Hakob; Skibniewski, Miroslaw			Web-based construction equipment fleet management system: cost-effective global and local allocation	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction equipment; Equipment assignment optimization; Web-based asset management	SUPPORT	Over the last two decades, construction contractors have been gradually making more investments in construction equipment to meet their needs associated with increasing volumes of construction projects. At present, from an operational perspective, almost all contractors pay more attention to maintaining their equipment fleets in well-sustained workable conditions and having a high accessibility of the necessary equipment pieces. However, such an approach alone is not enough to maintain an efficient and sustainable business. In particular, for large-scale construction companies that operate in multiple sites in the U.S. or overseas, the problem extends to an optimal allocation of available equipment. Given the current state of the construction industry in the U.S., this problem can be solved by geographically locating equipment pieces and then wisely re-allocating them among projects. Identifying equipment pieces geographically is a relatively easy task. The difficulty arises when informed decision-making is required for equipment allocation among job sites. The actual allocation of equipment should be both economically feasible and technologically preferable. To help in informed decision-making, an optimization model is developed as a mixed integer program. This model is formed based on a previously successfully developed decision-support model for construction equipment selection. The proposed model incorporates logical strategies of supply chain management to optimally select construction equipment for any construction site while taking into account the costs, availability, and transportation-related issues as constraints. The model benefits those responsible for informed decision-making for construction equipment selection and allocation. It also benefits the owners of construction companies, owing to its cost-minimization objective.

J	Stenbeck, T				Stenbeck, Torbjorn			Budgeting Performance-Based Winter Maintenance: Snow Influence on Highway Maintenance Cost	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								Swedish contracting of winter maintenance is combined with weather-regulated payment since the beginning of the 1990's. It reduces the weather risk for the contractor and has helped performance-based specifications to find acceptance. The performance-based approach was introduced to save costs and create incentives for innovation. Theory and practice are often unconnected since the mathematical links are lacking behind the political rhetoric around performance-based contracting. This study attempts to bridge some of the gap between theory and practice by linking a climate factor, snow, to highway maintenance costs. To handle the complexity of weather, an iterative process was assumed necessary, with simplification as a first step. An answer was achieved to the two research questions: which stations correlated best with costs and what the winter maintenance cost would be, given the snowfall at these stations. Once having achieved this answer under simplified circumstances (one weather parameter, one region, few observations, linear relationship), the assumptions were relaxed, one after the other, in second and third iterations, to increase the generalizeability of the method and the results. Maintenance cost and weather data of Washington state were used. The method can be used anywhere where the actual costs of the maintenance are known. In countries and regions with privatized highway maintenance, like in Sweden, British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, the actual costs are not public. The lessons learned from this study may therefore be of particular interest to such privatized systems. The study supports that the Swedish road weather information system stations are in the right spots and proposes snowfall to weather regulate the payment to the contractor.

J	Liu, DH; Wu, Y; Li, S; Sun, YZ				Liu, Donghai; Wu, You; Li, Shuai; Sun, Yuanze			A real-time monitoring system for lift-thickness control in highway construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Highway construction; Lift-thickness; Quality control; Real-time monitoring; Robotic total station (RTS); Laser	MODEL; GPR	Monitoring and controlling lift-thickness are critical in pavement construction, because lift-thickness can affect the durability and long-term performance of pavement. Existing methods for measuring lift-thickness are not sufficient due to four limitations. First, the reliability of manual measurements is questionable, since manual measurements can only be conducted at sparse points instead of entire pavement surface. Second, the accuracy of lift-thickness measurement is not satisfactory. For instance, the string-line method and balance beam system are unable to achieve millimeter-level accuracy. Third, current techniques cannot indicate the accurate positions of weak areas where the lift-thickness is not compliant with construction standards. Fourth, the agency and supervisor cannot monitor lift-thickness remotely in real time with current techniques. To overcome the above limitations, this study created a novel system that integrates inclinometer, robotic total station, laser ranging sensors, and wireless communication technologies to monitor lift-thickness during highway construction. The elevations of datum plane and the layer being paved can be accurately obtained using this system. Lift thickness then is measured in real-time as the difference between the elevations. Visualization of weak areas, warning messages, and monitoring reports are synchronized among the operator, contractor, supervisor and agency, guiding them to adjust operations and to ensure paving quality. Field applications demonstrated that this newly created system could monitor lift-thickness in an automatic, accurate, continuous, and real-time manner. In addition, the operator, contractor, supervisor and agency could access the information of construction quality simultaneously; and thus work closely to resolve quality issues in time. This system facilitates an integrated quality control mode that is suitable for the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, hindered by various factors, construction has long been recognized as an industry with low innovation. Innovation is essential to the productivity, cost effectiveness, and, more importantly, the sustainable development of any organization and industry. Following rapid globalization, technological advancement, and the trend toward partnering between the public and private sectors, the importance of innovation has increased dramatically for construction firms, particularly for large-size construction firms. However, studies investigating the association between leadership and innovation in the construction context are still rare. Using an innovation climate as a proxy for organizational innovation, this study investigates the effect of leadership on the innovation climate in construction firms. A questionnaire survey was designed and distributed to 300 construction professionals in major (Group C) contractor firms in Hong Kong. A hundred and thirteen valid returns were collected, representing a response rate of 37.7%. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, and structural equation modeling using SPSS version 19 and Lisrel version 8.8. Three leadership factors were identified, namely transformational leadership, development exchange leadership, and corrective avoidant leadership. The results of the structural equation modeling revealed that an innovation climate is predicted positively by transformational leadership and is predicted negatively by development exchange leadership. The results of this study have implications for construction academics and practitioners regarding the importance of leadership to foster innovation in the industry.

The proposed BIM adoption model assesses BIM implementation benefits, costs and challenges faced by SMOs. Correlation between BIM adoption in SMOs and the associated impacting factors, including knowledge support and BIM adoption motivation, is captured through the model. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of BIM adoption in construction was first presented. Research data, collected from 80 SMOs in Australia through a conducted survey, are then analysed. Descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate SMOs' understanding of BIM, and to qualify the correlations among the proposed latent variables impacting BIM implementation at SMOs, respectively. Additionally, this study used chi(2) test to compare differences between BIM users and non-BIM users regarding BIM understanding, interested applications and attitudes towards implementation benefits and challenges. Findings Potential benefits associated with BIM implementation are a major motivation factor when it comes to BIM adoption at SMOs. In addition, existing staff's capability in using BIM tools positively affects the establishment of an organisational knowledge-support system, which determines the decision of adopting BIM eventually. Ultimately, there is a need for further emphasis on staff engagement in the implementation process. Originality/value Results of this study provide an insight into the adoption challenges of BIM in SMOs, given that the focus of previous studies has been mostly placed on BIM adoption in architectural firms and large contractors.

J	Huh, YK; Hwang, BG; Lee, JS				Huh, Young-Ki; Hwang, Bon-Gang; Lee, Joong-Seok			FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS MODEL FOR DEVELOPER-PROPOSED HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						housing development project; feasibility analysis; analysis factor; analysis model; Monte Carlo simulation	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	The current construction industry recession in the republic of Korea has caused many construction companies to promote their own housing development projects. However, developers are still proposing many housing projects. While many studies on feasibility analysis for housing projects have been released, the focus was on economic feasibility, and factors related to developers have not been identified clearly enough to be used in practice. A feasibility analysis model is developed for apartment development projects in Korea to help main contractors make sound decisions on projects proposed by developers. To establish the model, 31 driving factors behind projects' success, in seven categories, were identified through several meetings with experts and surveys. Factors such as 'developer', 'method of raising funds' and 'method of contract', which were considered less important in previous studies, were included in the model. Criteria for each factor were also developed to assess the factors quantitatively. Then, each factor was assigned a weight by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process. 'Salability', 'economic feasibility', 'site location' and 'method of raising funds' have relatively high weights. Finally, based on a Monte Carlo simulation, a feasibility analysis model was established, providing a probability distribution of each project's grade. The model was applied to 12 housing projects constructed in Busan (seven successful projects and five abandoned projects) to verify its reliability. The application results showed that the model properly filtered projects that are unlikely to be profitable, indicating that it is reasonably reliable. Our model could thus be a useful tool for contractors, especially those with limited experience in analyzing project development feasibility.

J	Larsson, J; Eriksson, PE; Pesamaa, O				Larsson, Johan; Eriksson, Per Erik; Pesamaa, Ossi			The importance of hard project management and team motivation for construction project performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Structural equation model; Hard project management; Process performance; Team motivation	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; SUCCESS; INDUSTRY; MODELS; IMPACT; RECOMMENDATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; COMPLEXITY; INDICATORS; SYSTEM	Purpose - Hard project management practices, based on strict planning and control, are traditionally applied in construction projects, although research frequently promotes the importance of teams for various project outcomes. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of hard project management and team motivation for process performance in construction projects. A hypothesis tested is that hard project management can impair process performance if team motivation is not promoted. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents and empirically tests a structural equation model, with and without a mediating link between hard project management and process performance, based on data from a survey of 2,175 respondents, representing contractors and clients involved in 109 Swedish construction projects. Findings - The results confirm that hard project management is best conveyed through teams to enhance process performance. "Path analysis," using the model with the mediating link, confirms that neglecting team motivation can significantly impair process performance. Research limitations/implications - The data set provides unusually high representation of views of contractors and clients involved in diverse Swedish construction projects. Thus, the results have likely relevance in other project-based industries and/or national settings, but this possibility requires further investigation. Originality/value - The findings show that team motivation is a key process performance factor; hard project management may indeed be important, but its effects will be enhanced by (and partially mediated through) team motivation. Thus, the findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the development of project management practices.

Talat			Ontology for Relating Risk and Vulnerability to Cost Overrun in International Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						International construction; Risk management; Vulnerability; Ontology	CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Risk management is about identifying risks, assessing their impacts, and developing mitigation strategies to ensure project success. The difference between the expected and actual project outcomes is usually attributed to risk events and how they are managed throughout the project. Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects.

J	Dhakal, S; Mrawira, D; Rankin, J				Dhakal, Sharad; Mrawira, Donath; Rankin, Jeff			Effect of Specifications Type on the Quality of Paving Contracts in New Brunswick	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction specifications are used by transportation agencies to define the client's requirements of the final product. The primary motivation of adopting the newer end result specification (ERS) or performance related specification over method-based specification (MBS) is to reduce clients' costs, encourage contractors' innovation, and improve overall quality. However, some transportation agencies have been reluctant to fully implement ERS due to lack of demonstrated evidence on whether they achieve comparable level of quality or performance. This paper investigates if the specification type has any effect on quality. The case study presented is based on data from New Brunswick Department of Transportation (NBDOT) from years 2003-2007. NBDOT generally uses ERSs to call paving contracts equal to or larger than 8,000 t. MBSs are used for all other smaller paving contracts. The most prevalent indicator variables for accepting asphalt paving jobs in North America [that is, percent theoretical maximum relative density, asphalt binder content, air voids, voids in mineral aggregates, percent passing 4.75 mm (No. 4), and 75 mu m (No. 200) sieves] were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the deviation of the quality indicator variables from their respective job mix formula values for paving projects that used MBS or ERS. ANOVA results revealed that there were no significant differences between the qualities achieved from the two specification types. Also, no significant differences were found from within-specification comparisons over the time frame examined. Given the possible cost advantages from agency's point of view, the flexibility of the contractors to innovate and the fact that this study demonstrates quality is not compromised, there is an opportunity for agencies to expand or fully adopt the use of ERS specifications.

Hierarchical regression results provide evidence that after controlling for related organizational characteristics (including organizational experience in participating in large and influential projects, organizational ownership type, organization age, and organization size), degree and eigenvector centrality in relationship networks in an earlier period as a group significantly predicts organizational success in winning new project contracts in a later period. The results also provide evidence that due to their differences in BIM capability and innovation reputation, the competitiveness of designers and general contractors relate differently to the structure of their project-based interfirm relationship networks, with the competitiveness of designers more associated with the quantity of collaborative ties, whereas the competitiveness of general contractors relates more to the collaborative ties with high-status partners. As an exploratory effort at using longitudinal data to investigate the associations between interfirm relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness in the construction industry, this study contributes to the construction literature not only by validating the value of project-based interfirm relationships in generating social capital and thus relating to organizational competitiveness, but also by providing evidence for how the specific association between project-based relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness is contingent on the attributes of the network actors.

J	Lu, WX; Liu, J				Lu, Wenxue; Liu, Jian			Research into the moderating effects of progress and quality performance in project dispute negotiation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Progress and quality performance; Project dispute; Dispute negotiation; Moderating effect	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; BARGAINING POWER; GOVERNANCE; PERSONALITY; OUTCOMES; TACTICS; CHOICE	Project disputes are inevitable. However, for disputes to be settled, a contractor is faced with the dilemma of choosing between an extension of the time for completion under its entitled rights, and expediting to avoid delay. In order to decide which strategy is the most beneficial, this paper explores the moderating effects of progress and quality performance on the relationship between bargaining power (dependent variable) and its critical factors (independent variable). To achieve this, we conducted a questionnaire survey. First, through a study of the literature and expert interviews, we identified 11 factors of bargaining power (as well as which ones were the most critical) using a principal component analysis to calculate the factors' influence weight on bargaining power. Second, we adopted moderated multiple regression (MMR) analysis to examine how progress and quality performance affect the relationships between these critical factors and bargaining power. The result suggests that there are nine MMR models that have a significant moderating effect on these relationships. We then identified six of these models with the strongest relative moderating effect. The results illustrate that progress and quality performance can help improve negotiation outcomes. Therefore, when project disputes occur, the contractor's best strategy is to strive to reduce the project time loss, guarantee the quality of the project, and gain the owner's recognition, which will help to resolve the project dispute successfully through negotiation, and achieve their shared intended goal.

J	Petroutsatou, K				Petroutsatou, Kleopatra			A proposal of project management practices in public institutions through a comparative analyses of critical path method and critical chain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Critical Chain Project Management; critical path method; public works; infrastructure projects; public institutions	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; COST OVERRUNS; CONSTRUCTION	The term "Project Management Practice" is construed in several ways. For this research, we comply with the project management use of tools and techniques on project's time and cost (Crawford 2005; Olateju et al. 2011; Abassi and Al-Mharmah 2000). Project scheduling still is based on the traditional methods of critical path method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique for the majority of contractors and public institutions. The aim of this work is to critically highlight the reasons under which the use of the Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is indispensable for scheduling and monitoring public works by public institutions in Greece. In particular, the conclusions of this study are very important for public institutions that don't implement modern project management practices, tools and techniques. The methodology is exemplified by the analysis of 27 infrastructure projects. The contracts include 300 km of motorway, 46 km of road tunnels and 20 km of bridges constructed for the Egnatia Motorway in Northern Greece from 2002 to 2012. The results confirms that CCPM can perform better than the traditional method of CPM by achieving less construction time combined with accurate resource levelling in the early stages. The aforementioned procedure results in reduced indirect costs due to project's time reduction and reduced direct costs due to better resource allocation (ensuring "on time" availability of resources). As a conclusion, better financial planning is ensured for both the contracting parties i.e. the contractors and the public institutions. It should be noted that in literature the case studies are rare with very small sample size.

J	Williams, T				Williams, Terry			The Nature of Risk in Complex Projects	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						complexity; systems thinking; risk; project risk analysis; mapping	SYSTEM DYNAMICS; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; MAPS	Risk analysis is important for complex projects; however, systemicity makes evaluating risk in real projects difficult. Looking at the causal structure of risks is a start, but causal chains need to include management actions, the motivations of project actors, and sociopolitical project complexities as well as intra-connectedness and feedback. Common practice based upon decomposition-type methods is often shown to point to the wrong risks. A complexity structure is used to identify systemicity and draws lessons about key risks. We describe how to analyze the systemic nature of risk and how the contractor and client can understand the ramifications of their actions.

J	Chalker, M; Loosemore, M				Chalker, Mathew; Loosemore, Martin			Trust and productivity in Australian construction projects: a subcontractor perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Trust; Collaboration; Supply chain management; Communications; Productivity capacity	SUCCESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between trust and productivity from a subcontractor perspective. More specifically it investigates: the perceived level of trust that currently exists between subcontractors and main contractors; the factors affecting trust at the project level; the relationship between trust and productivity. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line survey was undertaken with of 112 senior construction managers working for tier-1 and tier-2 subcontractors in the Australian construction industry. The survey was based on a combination of validated questions from Lau and Rowlinson's (2009) interpersonal trust and inter-firm trust in construction projects framework and Cheung et al.'s (2011) framework for a trust inventory in construction contracting. Findings - In contrast to the large number of research projects which have highlighted a lack of trust in the construction industry, the findings show that level of trust that Australian subcontractors have in main contractors is generally high. However, bid shopping is a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry which acts to undermine trust. The findings also provide strong evidence that high levels of trust influence productivity on site by enabling greater collaboration, better communication and greater flexibility, agility and informality in project relationships. Research limitations/implications - This research was undertaken in the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and within an economic boom. It is quite possible that outside this regional context which tends to dominated by larger construction firms and in an alternative economic context that the results of this research could be quite different. This possibility needs to be investigated further. Practical implications - The results indicate that this relatively healthy level of trust is down to good communication and empathy on the part of main contractors to the subcontractor's welfare. While the results showed that bid shopping is clearly a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry, subcontractors also felt that their contracts were clearly defined and that they were given sufficient time to innovate on their projects. This suggest that new communications technologies can be used to build trust through the supply chain. Given that much of the construction supply chain is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses, the challenge of diffusing these new technologies into this business environment should be a priority. Social implications - Trust in basis of effective collaboration which has been shown to produce numerous social benefits such as greater equity and justice in business relationships and higher levels of productivity and safety. Originality/value - The originality of this research is in using theories of trust to give subcontractors a greater "voice" in the construction productivity debate.

J	Han, YL; He, TZ; Chang, RD; Xue, R				Han, Yilong; He, Tianzhi; Chang, Ruidong; Xue, Rui			Development Trend and Segmentation of the US Green Building Market: Corporate Perspective on Green Contractors and Design Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Engineering news record; Green building company; Green building market	CONSTRUCTION; BARRIERS; DRIVERS; IMPACT; CHINA	In the past decade, the architecture, engineering, and construction industry has witnessed increasing growth in the green building market and continues to expect a promising future. Although companies in the industry have played a significant role in developing the green building market, scarce studies have analyzed changes in the market from the perspectives of these corporations. Also, few studies classify green building companies by characteristics. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we explored the characteristics of the US green building market from a corporate perspective, specifically investigating green contractors and design firms. We first collected data of 464 top US green building companies identified by the Engineering News-Record over the past decade and explored the development trend of the green building market, based on the green revenue generated by these companies. We found that the general growth trend in the US green building market in the past decade could be divided into three stages: a rapid-growth stage (2000-2008), a steady-growth stage (2009-2013), and a maturity and transformation stage (2014-2016). We then categorized the 464 organizations into three groups with distinct characteristics by k-means cluster analysis techniques, including mature green building companies, sector-oriented green building companies, and primary-stage green building companies. This study provides the academic and practitioner communities with a holistic understanding of the development of the US green building market from the view of burgeoning companies. Corporate-level management systems and sustainable practices of the three clusters of green building companies also provide guidance for construction companies in the various stages of transformation towards sustainability to adopt different strategies.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			TRENCHLESS EXCAVATION CONSTRUCTION METHODS - CLASSIFICATION AND EVALUATION	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Traditionally, trenchless excavation construction (TEC) methods have been considered only in congested and critical conditions as an alternative to open cutting. As more utilities are placed underground, the demand for these methods has increased. It is common practice in Japan and in European countries to specify the installation of the complete system by TEC methods. This is a growing trend in the United States. For the project to be designed and constructed with minimal delays and disputes, it is important that the major project decision makers (i.e., owner, regulatory-agency representative, architect/engineer, and contractor) be familiar with the available TEC methods and the basic principles of operation. The purpose of this paper is to present a classification system and a comparative analysis on the specific methods.									0	0	0	0	0	ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS	RESTON	1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA	0733-9364	1943-7862		J CONSTR ENG M	J.

The findings indicate that corruption influences government project failure on all the failure criteria that were used for the evaluation. However, corruption influences failure at two different levels: project management and product phase. At the project management level, corruption has direct influence, while at the product phase level, the influence is indirect.

J	Munns, AK				Munns, AK			Measuring mutual confidence in UK construction projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INTERPERSONAL-TRUST	When embarking on any new construction project there will be a probability that some, if not all, participants have not worked together before. Participants, because they lack previous knowledge, will anticipate a type of behavior from the other parties befitting the behavior normally attributed to the group they belong to. If the other party is an architect they will attribute a behavior that belongs to architects in general. This paper seeks to measure this attributed behavior between the three main groups involved in construction; namely, the clients, design professionals, and contractors. it presents the results of a survey measuring the level of mutual confidence between the three groups. The implications of the survey for potential conflict and breakdown of relations are discussed.		Munns, AK (corresponding author), UNIV DUNDEE,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,DUNDEE DD1 4HN,SCOTLAND.

J	LARSON, E				LARSON, E			PROJECT PARTNERING - RESULTS OF STUDY OF 280 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Partnering has generated considerable excitement in the construction industry. However, this enthusiasm is largely based on anecdotal evidence. The results of a study of 280 construction projects in which the relationship between project success and alternative approaches (including partnering) to managing the owner-contractor relationship are reported in this paper. The findings indicate that partnered projects achieved superior results in controlling costs, the technical performance, and in satisfying customers compared with those projects managed in an adversarial, guarded adversarial, and even informal partnering manner. Further, whether the contract was awarded on a low-bid or non-low-bid basis did not affect the relationship between partnering and project success. Conclusions and findings pertaining to alternative management approaches are briefly addressed here.

They believe that a decision support system would assist managers when confronted by the consequences of arising delays, and by the decision whether and how to accelerate the remaining construction activities. The system has the advantages of providing support when facing an ill-structured decision about accelerating progress when delays occur; it also helps as a predictive management tool for minimizing or avoiding delays and their consequential claims.

Although the problem may start with a single subcontractor, it can result in all contractors feeling some impact to their work. In this paper, a case study is presented of a project with seven different mismanagement scenarios. A description of each scenario is provided as well as a quantification of the damages that result from the problem. A construction claims section is also included that addresses many of the issues that could result from a claim for each of the seven scenarios. A discussion is presented outlining possible preventative steps to minimize the damages from the problems presented.

Dynamic management of contingency escrow accounts during project execution poses decision-making challenges. Project managers use key performance indicators (KPIs) for contingency release decisions. However, their subjective mental models influence risk perception, exacerbating the decision-making dilemma. This research integrates project KPIs with future risk perception to develop a mathematical model for facilitating such decision making. Results suggest timely completion, project cost, stakeholder satisfaction, quality and safety as top KPIs, and the influence of managerial pressure as a significant decision contributor. The proposed model helps project managers in dynamic decision making for cost contingency.

J	Mohamed, E; Jafari, P; Hammad, A				Mohamed, Emad; Jafari, Parinaz; Hammad, Ahmed			Mixed qualitative-quantitative approach for bidding decisions in construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Bid/no-bid decision; Procurement management; Construction management; Tendering; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic	BID/NO-BID DECISION; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; CONTRACTORS; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Purpose - The bid/no-bid decision is critical to the success of construction contractors. The factors affecting the bid/no-bid decision are either qualitative or quantitative. Previous studies on modeling the bidding decision have not extensively focused on distinguishing qualitative and quantitative factors. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to improve the bidding decision in construction projects by developing tools that consider both qualitative and quantitative factors affecting the bidding decision. Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach to deal with both qualitative and quantitative factors. The mixed qualitative-quantitative approach is developed by combining a rule-based expert system and fuzzy-based expert system. The rule-based expert system is used to evaluate the project based on qualitative factors and the fuzzy expert system is used to evaluate the project based on the quantitative factors in order to reach the comprehensive bid/no-bid decision. Findings - Three real bidding projects are used to investigate the applicability and functionality of the proposed mixed approach and are tested with experts of a construction company in Alberta, Canada. The results demonstrate that the mixed approach provides a more reliable, accurate and practical tool that can assist decision-makers involved in the bid/no-bid decision. Originality/value - This study contributes theoretically to the body of knowledge by (1) proposing a novel approach capable of modeling all types of factors (either qualitative or quantitative) affecting the bidding decision, and (2) providing means to acquire, store and reuse expert knowledge. Practical contribution of this paper is to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive model that mimics the decision-making process and stores experts' knowledge in the form of rules. Therefore, the model reduces the administrative burden on the decision-makers, saves time and effort and reduces bias and human errors during the bidding process.

The proposed distributed scheduling model (DSM) employs an information system to store data related to various work sites, activities' optional construction methods, and available resources. The DSM also incorporates a scheduling algorithm that is resource focused, and maintains crew work continuity under any sequence of distributed sites. To minimize cost and meet project time and resource constraints, the DSM uses genetic algorithms to determine the optimum set of construction methods and the optimum routing order among sites. Details of the DSM formulation are presented in this paper and the benefits to municipalities and contractors are outlined.

Factors Affecting Construction Labor Productivity in Kuwait	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor productivity; Efficiency; Operatives; Contractors; Kuwait; Constructability; Relative importance index	IMPACT; MOTIVATION	Construction labor productivity has become such a buzz word and one of the most frequently researched topics. In most countries, labor cost comprises 30 to 50% of the overall project's cost, and thus is regarded as a true reflection of the economic success of the operation. There are many challenges facing the construction industry in the state of Kuwait but one of the most important is low productivity. The objective of this research, therefore, is to identify and rank the relative importance of factors perceived to affect labor productivity on construction sites in Kuwait. To achieve this objective, a statistically representative sample of contractors was invited to participate in a structured questionnaire survey, comprising 45 productivity factors, classified under the following four primary groups: (1) management; (2) technological; (3) human/labor; and (4) external. Among the factors explored, the subsequent 10 are discerned to be the most significant in their effects on labor productivity: (1) clarity of technical specifications; (2) the extent of variation/change orders during execution; (3) coordination level among design disciplines; (4) lack of labor supervision; (5) proportion of work subcontracted; (6) design complexity level; (7) lack of incentive scheme; (8) lack of construction manager's leadership; (9) stringent inspection by the engineer; and (10) delay in responding to requests for information. The results obtained fill a gap in knowledge of factors affecting labor productivity in Kuwait, which can be used by industry practitioners to develop a wider and deeper perspective of the factors influencing the efficiency of operatives and provide guidance to construction managers for efficient utilization of the labor force, hence assist in achieving a reasonable level of competitiveness and cost-effective operation.

J	Mejlaender-Larsen, O				Mejlaender-Larsen, Oystein			A three-step process for reporting progress in detail engineering using BIM, based on experiences from oil and gas projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; Design; LOD; Scheduling; Case study; Engineering; Building information modelling; Project execution model; Control object; Engineering schedule; Object status; Progress management	BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; WORK	Purpose Traditionally, progress in detail engineering in construction projects is reported based on estimates and manual input from the disciplines in the engineering team. Reporting progress on activities in an engineering schedule manually, based on subjective evaluations, is time consuming and can reduce accuracy, especially in larger and multi-disciplinary projects. How can progress in detail engineering be reported using BIM and connected to activities in an engineering schedule? The purpose of this paper is to introduce a three-step process for reporting progress in detail engineering using building information modeling (BIM) to minimize manual reporting and increase quality and accuracy. Design/methodology/approach The findings of this paper are based on the studies of experiences from the execution of projects in the oil and gas industry. Data are collected from an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor and two engineering contractors using case study research. Findings In the first step, control objects in building information models are introduced. Statuses are added to control objects to fulfill defined quality levels related to milestones. In the second step, the control objects with statuses are used to report visual progress and aggregated in an overall progress report. In the third step, overall progress from building information models are connected to activities in an engineering schedule. Originality/value Existing research works related to monitoring and reporting progress using a BIM focus on construction and not on detail engineering. The research demonstrates that actual progress in detail engineering can be visualized and reported through the use of BIM and extracted to activities in an engineering schedule through a three-step process.

J	Wu, CL; Song, XY; Wang, T; Fang, DP				Wu, Chunlin; Song, Xinyi; Wang, Tao; Fang, Dongping			Core Dimensions of the Construction Safety Climate for a Standardized Safety-Climate Measurement	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety climate; Core dimensions; Structural equation modeling; Labor and personnel issues	MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; CULTURE; MODEL	The prevalent disparity and divergence in the identification of safety-climate dimensions in the academia cause general confusion and inconvenience to both construction researchers and practitioners in terms of safety-climate measurement. Existing review studies identified several key dimensions or common features of safety climate, but only in a qualitative way. Whether these common features fit the reality and reflect the essence of construction safety climate is still to be verified by empirical studies. This research defined the core dimension and specific dimension of safety climate, identified the four most commonly used dimensions, and built a core dimension structure of safety climate accordingly. Empirical data collected from 21 Chinese construction enterprises were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling. The proposed core dimension structure and the corresponding measurement scale were validated rigorously by structural equation modeling approaches. Furthermore, two specific subgroups of the enterprises were analyzed to prove that the core dimension structure also applies to specific construction enterprise types, such as building contractors and specialty trade contractors. It is concluded that the proposed core dimension structure of safety climate is applicable in construction practices, especially to building enterprises. Practical implications of the safety-climate core dimension research are discussed in detail. This study contributes to the construction safety-climate study primarily by depicting relationships among the common dimensions as well as relationships between common dimensions and specific dimensions, which have rarely been involved or interpreted deeply in the past research. This can in turn facilitate the standardization of construction safety-climate measurement by providing a unified criterion (core dimension structure of safety climate) for both researchers and practitioners. It is a valid starting point to design specific measurement scales in different settings. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Dhal, M				Dhal, Manoranjan			Labor Stand: Face of Precarious Migrant Construction Workers in India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor stand; Migrant labor; Construction; Precarious work; Trade union; Government	TO-URBAN MIGRATION; WOMEN; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES	The construction sector of India is the best representation of the informal workforce, which employs 36.12 million workers. These laborers flock together in a particular place on early morning every day in order to find a wage provider for them. It is a sale of labor for the day, where workers stand and make themselves available for a day to be hired by contractors or individual house owners. These places are known as labor stands, a stop for finding daily laborers for construction work, which is the distinctive addition of this research to the scant literature. This paper tries to explore the labor process among these unique informal construction workers' labor assemblies consisting of 15,000 laborers per day and explore their employment conditions and labor relations. The paper also aims to examine the role of various actors of industrial relations such as trade unions and the government in regulating this employment relationship. The paper is based on a field study encompassing the transcribed records of observation, field interaction with 84 migrant construction workers, and 118 still photographs. The data were analyzed by using qualitative analysis software and adopting open thematic coding and later by developing categories and hierarchy and doing comparative analysis. The findings reveal that these laborers experience precariousness and are challenged by nonavailability of regular work, shortages of food, burden of large family size, and social evils of living in a slum, and also face being harassed by goons as well as contractors with minimal support from trade unions and government. Employers are apathetic toward their legal obligations. With labor stands being a primary source of labor supply to the construction sector, the findings of this paper will help in enriching labor relations and policy measures for its regulation.

Project planning for construction under uncertainty with limited resources	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						project management; uncertainty principles; resource management; construction industry	CRITICAL-PATH METHOD; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Much of the project scheduling literature treats task durations as deterministic. In reality, however, task durations are subject to considerable uncertainty, and that uncertainty can be influenced by the resources assigned. The purpose of this paper is to provide the means for contractors to optimally allocate their skilled workers among individual tasks for a single project. Instead of the traditional use of schedules, we develop control policies in the form of planned resource allocation to tasks that capture the uncertainty associated with task durations and the impact of resource allocation on those durations. We develop a solution procedure for the model and illustrate the ideas in an example. The data for the example is collected from a real project.

This study examines the compatibility of the revised ISO 9001: 2000 Quality Management Standard with ISO 14001: 1996 for the purpose of integration. A survey of 96 construction firms was conducted for those who were considering or were already ISO 14001: 1996 certified. Findings on the possibility/difficulty and benefits/costs of integration between ISO 14001: 1996 and ISO 9001: 2000 were obtained. Industry concerns relating to potential problems and implementation challenges were discussed. The study concludes that the revised ISO 9001: 2000 serves as an opportune platform for construction firms to consider certification to ISO 14000: 1996 through an integration exercise.

However. in order to find the desired information. it may be necessary to enter keywords using a trial-and-error process. This research recognizes that professional procurement experience can help users search website information more effectively, by using fewer keywords. and so proposes a learning model and suggestion model that can capture such experience. thus guiding inexperienced users in their search. Experiments, evaluating the performance of the system, were also conducted. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nassar, K				Nassar, Khaled			Integrating discrete event and lighting simulation for analyzing construction work zones lighting plans	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						nighttime; construction; lighting; visualization; rendering; animations		Nighttime construction is being widely adopted in the United States as a way to mitigate the impact of construction operations on the traveling public. Although a number of states have developed standard specifications for nighttime lighting, these standards are usually in the form of generic requirement statements that only specify minimum illuminance levels. The lighting standards do not include specific ways to achieve this illuminance level, such as lighting arrangements and configurations for various work zone plans and construction operations. This leaves confusion between the traffic engineers and the contractors and does not guarantee consistency in those plans, thus affecting productivity and safety. Therefore there is a need to develop a tool that can help contractors and engineers to design and implement lighting plans for nighttime construction. The main objective of this paper is to present a new lighting design framework that utilizes three dimensional lighting analysis and construction operation simulation to study and model lighting conditions of a construction site. A prototype software tool called NiteLite that implements the proposed framework was developed and is presented here. Various lighting plans can be studied using the software to provide for typical applications including lighting fixture's locations, fixture photometric web, mounting height, angle, and fixture type. The results from the developed software tool were validated through comparisons with previous research conducted using field measurements. It has been shown that NiteLite can provide accurate lighting analysis, as well as having the ability to model a wider range of conditions and work zone configurations and considering new lighting criteria such as Glare Rating. Furthermore, NiteLite allows users to study the dynamic nature of lighting in construction sites by allowing the animation of expected equipment and traffic patterns and thus studying the impact of lighting conditions on glare in the construction site.

Design/methodology/approach - PP definition phrases extracted from a literature review were sorted into a basic framework of who, what, how, when and where. In a web-based survey, a group of experts marked the phrases from the literature review as being specific, generic, or irrelevant to PP. The expert group comprised highly ranked and experienced PP researchers. Based on the survey results, a new definition was formulated. The new definition specifies the participants, the objectives and the knowledge, skills, tools and techniques applied to pursue the objectives in PP. A verification survey of the expert group gave a 78-96 per cent combined approve and support score for each element of the new definition. Findings - PP and a partnering project are defined by a framework encompassing three basic dimensions: participants, objectives, knowledge, skills, tools and techniques applied to pursue the objectives. The new definition is: "project partnering is a relationship strategy whereby a project owner integrates contractors and other major contributors into the project". Through commitment to mutual project objectives, collaborative problem solving and a joint governance structure, partners pursue collaborative relationships, trust and improved performance. The new definition indicates that PP neither varies with early contractor involvement nor gain and pain share, but varies with the degree of mutual project objectives, collaborative problem solving and joint governance structure. Originality/value - PP is a complex concept with no widely accepted definition. The basic framework applied to the formulation of the definition in this project can also be applied to define and implement a partnering project and to define and distinguish between other relationship-based procurement forms.

There has been an ongoing discussion in the project marketing literature about whether project marketing is part of project management or project management is part of project marketing. Marketing is done by organizations to create a demand for products or services that have value for customers. The authors identify three types of organization involved in the management of projects, the project, the initiator and the contractor, and review current thinking on how they market their products and services, and create networks and dialogs to bring value to stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the literature on project marketing, and develop new models based on an organizational perspective. The authors develop propositions as a basis for further research. Findings - Marketing is done by three types of organization. The authors label these as marketing BY the project, marketing FOR the project by the contractor, and marketing OF the investment made by the project by the investor. The authors draw links with marketing theory, and introduce the service-dominant logic as a new perspective on organizational project marketing. Research limitations/implications - Traditionally, project marketing theory has taken the perspective of the overlap between project management and project marketing. The authors take an organizational perspective, and identify avenues for research into how the types of organization involved in the management of projects create dialog with their customers and stakeholders to exchange products and services that have value for them. Practical implications - Project managers have not traditionally viewed project marketing as having relevance to them. The authors show that providing a service to stakeholders is an essential part of the management of projects. Originality/value - The authors develop directions for research into project marketing as part of organizational project management.

J	Alleman, D; Lee, EB				Alleman, Douglas; Lee, Eul-Bum			Mitigating the legal challenges of imposing disincentives on nonperforming transportation projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction planning; Scheduling; Risk management; Information and communication technology applications; Road user costs (RUC); Liquidated damages (LD); Incentive; disincentive (I; D)	ROAD USER COSTS; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES; INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE CONTRACTS; CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS; MODEL; TIME; INCENTIVES; REHABILITATION; SPECIFICATION; TECHNOLOGIES	Purpose The publication presents an analysis of the cost and schedule performance of incentive/disincentive projects and case studies toward developing a systematic disincentive valuation process, with Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies (CA4PRS) software integration that aids agencies in minimizing the likelihood of court challenges of disincentives. Design/methodology/approach From a California transportation database, the authors performed cost and schedule analyses of 43 incentive/disincentive (I/D) projects and case studies on four of those I/D projects. Interviewees included subject matter experts from transportation organizations to ensure applicability and maximum value-adding, and the process was implemented on ten California transportation projects and monitored for performance. Findings The presented process mitigates the contractor's ability to claim disincentives as penalties in a court of law through the following: (1) all calculations are performed using project-specific bases, backed by estimations of actual incurred costs; (2) the CA4PRS software allows for estimation transparency and (3) the clarity of cost inclusions reduces any chances of "double-dipping" between disincentives and liquidated damages. Practical implications Transportation agencies have historically faced legal challenges to their enforcements of disincentives. As agencies continue to apply disincentives on more megaprojects, contractors will likely attempt to pursue legal challenges more frequently. The presented process mitigates the likelihood of these challenges going to court and increases the accuracy and efficiency of disincentives. Originality/value While there have been publications that discuss the legal challenges of imposing disincentives, they mainly provide guidelines and lack applicable processes. Existing literature that does present incentive/disincentive valuation process focuses on incentive valuations and neglects the disincentives' legal challenges. The following publication fills this gap by presenting an applicable disincentive valuation process for transportation projects which incorporates the guidelines for legal mitigation.

Engineering Approach Using ANN to Improve and Predict Construction Labor Productivity under Different Influences	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction labor productivity; Engineering approach; Improving; Tendering; Traditional method; Predicting model; Artificial neural network (ANN); Cost and schedule		Construction labor productivity is a fundamental piece of information for estimating, budgeting, and scheduling a construction project. The current practice to estimate construction labor productivity relies primarily on the traditional method, which uses the published productivity data and/or the estimator's own experience, with an apparent lack of systematic approach to measuring, estimating, and predicting it. An investment for the sole purpose of productivity data collection and modeling is not likely to be successful for a construction company. To make the investment economically feasible, the productivity system should be integrated into the overall database and information system of the construction company. To achieve these advantages and overcome the current practice weaknesses, this paper introduces an engineering concept to document, control, predict, and improve the contractor's labor productivity. A wide range of influencing factors on the micro level (project management and administration) and the micro/micro level (activity level at construction site) has been considered. The proposed engineering approach was applied to model construction labor productivity of two construction crafts, carpentry and fixing reinforcing steel bars of different types of concrete foundations, using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique and utilizing the transfer function of the hyperbolic tan function (tanh). The results showed an adequate convergence with reasonable generalization capabilities, and more accurate and credible results compared with not only the traditional method, but also the existing approaches in the literature. This study contributes to the construction engineering and management body of knowledge by providing insight into using different ANN activation and transfer functions along with a wide range of influencing factors to benchmark the contractor's construction labor productivity. Moreover, the utilized engineering approach shows how a readily available practical database can help optimize several objectives. It supports two main pillars of sustainable construction: the economic dimension and the social dimension. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Lin, SC				Lin, Shyh-Chyang			An Analysis for Construction Engineering Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORK; PROJECT; MODEL	Civil engineers at a construction site form a particular population because of their unique work location, the danger involved in their work, and the need for support from others. Teamwork and effective order enforcement are therefore critical for construction project success. This research establishes the order-management, technical-consultation, and interpersonal-social networks of site engineers using a questionnaire that surveyed the Husan dam project in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to discover the underlying job-site management problems and potential technology interfaces by analyzing three job-site social networks. It was found that the order-management network, which is a goal-directed and hierarchical architecture, has the highest degree of social density among the three because of abundant resource infusion and institutional enforcement. The interpersonal-social network has no goals or resource inputs and is not formally organized; hence, it exhibits a highly disjointed structure. The technical-consultation network topology lies between the above two networks because its resource infusion is not apparent. In the order-management and technical-consultation networks, the site manager and principal engineers assigned by the owner or contractor are the central figures in these networks; however, they become outliers in the interpersonal-social network. Two ideal network models for order-management and technical-consultation are proposed in this paper for effectively executing construction projects. In the order-management aspect, a giant network (largest isolated subnetwork) with two interconnected hierarchical structures, the owner and contractor, can increase order and information transmission efficiency within the network. The technical-consultation network with a small world architecture may not only encourage interdisciplinary interaction leading to technology renovation, but also prevent engineering errors or delay because of misaligned technological interfaces. Applying social network analysis to construction projects allows understanding the actual management structures, identifying central figures in an organization, and exploring the potential threats that cause engineering mistakes.

However, there is no comprehensive study that explores the important project management factors from the perspective of architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms, whose decisions can significantly affect the environmental performance of building projects. In Singapore, Green Mark, a certification for green building, has become a compulsory requirement for all new buildings. AEC firms are now facing challenges on how best to attain Green Mark certification with minimum cost and resources. The purpose of this research is to identify the controllable critical project management factors for delivering Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher Green Mark ratings. Nineteen controllable project management factors were first identified from related literature, and then a survey was carried out to collect data needed to perform the principal component factor analysis. The factor analysis revealed that the controllable project management factors could be grouped into five major components, namely, (1) human resource-oriented factors, (2) technical and innovation-oriented factors, (3) support from designers and senior management, (4) project manager's competence, and (5) coordination of designers and contractors. Finally, multiple regression analysis was applied. It was found that the coordination of designers and contractors and technical and innovation-oriented factors are the most critical success factors, and possible reasons are discussed. With the help of the research findings, project organizations in Singapore will manage their Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher rating levels in a more efficient and effective way.

G.; Fayek, Aminah Robinson			Fuzzy Similarity Consensus Model for Early Alignment of Construction Project Teams on the Extent of Their Roles and Responsibilities	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Owners; Fuzzy sets; Expert systems	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; DELIVERY; OPINIONS	A fuzzy similarity consensus (FSC) model is presented for alignment of construction project owner and contractor project teams to their roles and responsibilities, identifying and reducing fundamental problems of conflicts, duplication, and gaps in roles and responsibilities as early as the project initiation stage. The model achieves its objective by incorporating consensus and quality of construction project teams in aggregating their opinions to decide on the party responsible for every standard task of a construction project. The roles and responsibilities of the owner and contractors are described to different extents using seven linguistic terms defined by triangular membership functions and constructed using a three-step Delphi approach, which allows experts to develop common understanding of the meaning of the terms by determining their overlap on a fuzzy linguistic scale. A modified similarity aggregation method (SAM) aggregates experts' opinions in a linguistic framework using a consensus weight factor for each expert that is based on the similarity of his or her opinion relative to the other experts to ensure that the experts' final decision is a result of common agreement. A fuzzy expert system (FES) determines an importance weight factor, representing expert quality for each expert; opinions are aggregated using this factor and the consensus weight factor. The FSC model contributes to the construction industry by solving a fundamental problem for project owners who want to identify and reduce potential conflicts between their project teams on the extent of their roles and responsibilities prior to the construction stage. Also, the FSC model provides an improvement over previous consensus-based approaches, which rely on a subjective assessment of experts' important weights in aggregating their opinions, and it modifies the SAM to adapt it to a linguistic environment.

J	Meng, XH; Brown, A				Meng, Xianhai; Brown, Andrew			Innovation in construction firms of different sizes: drivers and strategies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Construction; Strategic management	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; LEVEL INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT; ORGANIZATIONS	Purpose The importance of innovation has been increasingly highlighted in construction as a large and complex industry sector that is more challenging than ever before. To bridge the knowledge gap about how firm size affects innovation in construction, the purpose of this paper is to explore firm-level innovation through an empirical investigation and compare innovation in construction firms of different sizes in terms of drivers and strategies. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a combination of a literature review, a group of qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire survey. In this research, the questionnaire survey is the main instrument to collect empirical data. Main contractors, subcontractors and specialist contractors as well as suppliers of labor, material and equipment are used in this research to represent construction firms of different sizes. On the other hand, client organizations, design firms and management consultants are not included in this research. Findings This research provides clear evidence for the embrace of innovation in construction. Many forces can drive construction firms to innovate and many strategies can be applied to construction innovation. Innovation drivers can be either internal or external. On the other hand, innovation strategies fall into four categories: technology, resource, marketing and management. For innovation drivers and strategies, both commonalities and differences can be found among construction firms of different sizes. Originality/value The finding of commonalities describes the general trend of innovation development in construction. It also encourages all construction firms to innovate regardless of firm size. On the other hand, the finding of differences enables construction firms of different sizes to realize what forces better drive their innovation and what strategies are more appropriate for their innovation. A thorough understanding of innovation drivers and strategies offers an important framework for construction organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice.

Understanding the nature of this kind of uncertainty can reduce the level of inconsistency that reinforces the safety management system in CI. The purpose of this paper is to present an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy-improved score function and weighted divergence based approximation (IVIF-ISF-WDBA) approach for ranking main stakeholders with clear duties that can influence workers' unsafe behaviours as well as risk reduction in final decisions. In this method, a score matrix is compiled based on improved score performance and IVIF decision matrix, and then a linear programming model is developed to determine the weight of unknown criteria. In addition, a divergence measure has been developed to find out the degree of performance of the alternatives. Next, we perform comparative and sensitivity analyses with different proposed methods and different weight criteria sets to determine the stability of the developed approach. The results indicated that the most effective safety factors (ESFs) are safety climate factor(3) (SCF3) (safety management rules and regulations) at 45%, and safety perceptual factor(2) (SPF2) (workers' preferences and behaviours related to safety category) at 25%. The LP-model ranked client, designer, construction manager, and contractor as the authoritative bodies that should carry out extensive inspections of ESFs, namely, SCFs, SPFs, and workplace condition factors (WCFs) in the preconstruction phase. However, these priorities can change during the construction phase among the contractor, construction manager, supervisor, client, and designer. This study concluded that workers' unsafe behaviours could be linked to stakeholder duties in complex and dynamic conditions of the CI.

J	Park, SH				Park, Sung Ho			Whole Life Performance Assessment: Critical Success Factors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Whole life costing (WLC) has become the best practice in construction procurement and it is likely to be a major issue in predicting whole life costs of a construction project accurately. However, different expectations from different organizations throughout a project's life and the lack of data, monitoring targets, and long-term interest for many key players are obstacles to be overcome if WLC is to be implemented. A questionnaire survey was undertaken to investigate a set of ten common factors and 188 individual factors. These were grouped into eight critical categories (project scope, time, cost, quality, contract/administration, human resource, risk, and health and safety) by project phase, as perceived by the clients, contractors and subcontractors in order to identify critical success factors for whole life performance assessment (WLPA). Using a relative importance index, the top ten critical factors for each category, from the perspective of project participants, were analyzed and ranked. Their agreement on those categories and factors were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. All participants identify "Type of Project" as the most common critical factor in the eight categories for WLPA. Using the relative index ranking technique and weighted average methods, it was found that the most critical individual factors in each category were: "clarity of contract" (scope); "fixed construction period" (time); " precise project budget estimate" (cost); " material quality" (quality); "mutual/trusting relationships" (contract/administration); "leadership/team management" (human resource); and " management of work safety on site" (health and safety). There was relatively a high agreement on these categories among all participants. Obviously, with 80 critical factors of WLPA, there is a stronger positive relationship between client and contactor rather than contractor and subcontractor, client and subcontractor. Putting these critical factors into a criteria matrix can facilitate an initial framework of WLPA in order to aid decision making in the public sector in South Korea for evaluation/selection process of a construction project at the bid stage.

J	Yap, JBH; Abdul-Rahman, H; Chen, W				Yap, Jeffrey Boon Hui; Abdul-Rahman, Hamzah; Chen, Wang			Collaborative model: Managing design changes with reusable project experiences through project learning and effective communication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication management; Construction; Design change; Overruns; Project learning	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CHANGE MANAGEMENT; DELAY MITIGATION; COST OVERRUNS; KNOWLEDGE; REWORK; LITIGATION; IMPACTS; QUALITY; SYSTEM	This paper empirically studies the importance of managing design changes in dealing with time delay and cost overruns in construction projects. The main objective of this paper is to identify the causes of design changes and the implications on the Malaysian construction projects measured in terms of cost and time. It also aims to determine how rework induced from the design changes is detrimental to project performance and to suggest recommendations on how to overcome the related problem with project learning and effective communication in building construction. To investigate the factors giving rise to design changes, a total of 43 causes were first identified through a comprehensive literature review. The factors are categorised into client, consultant, contractor, site and external-related themes. This is followed by a qualitative research study involving semi structured interviews with 12 experienced industry practitioners comprising of clients, consultants, and contractors. Critical incident technique employing content analysis is used to analyse the interviews transcripts in detail to provide a rich picture of the causes of design changes, the implications for project delivery performance, enablers of effective communication, enablers of project learning and types of reusable project knowledge. The research findings were further integrated to develop a collaborative model to manage design changes using effective communication and project learning approach. This model highlights the importance of effective communication and project learning towards improving the level of competency and cohesiveness of project team in managing future projects. Capturing and sharing of reusable project experiences is essential towards maximising the benefits of past experiences (lessons learned), shortening the learning curve and adding value to future projects in design change management.

However, the relational norms of alliances are not sufficient on their own to eliminate opportunistic behaviors. This study shows that, investing in mechanisms supportive of governance, culture, and trust provides a platform upon which firms may foster collaboration and limit self-interest oriented behavior amongst alliance partners. Our qualitative case study of a major project-based organization reveals the impact of these mechanisms, and more pointedly, how they interact and often reinforce each other. Governance, culture and trust are interlinked and complementary, and managers need to reflect holistically on their interactions in order to establish collaborative, rather than opportunistic behaviors.

Construction projects delay mitigation using integrated balanced scorecard and quality function deployment	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction project management; Causes of delay; Balanced scorecard (BSC); Quality function deployment (QFD); Planning; Critical project success delay factors; Key performance indicators; Delay risk management	PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; COST; MANAGEMENT	Purpose Delays occur mostly in the construction process of many projects, which can have a consequent effect on the overall performance of the project in areas such as profitability, efficiency and safety. This study aims to suggest a structure that can be applied to manage construction projects effectively and, thus, to reduce delays. The integrated balanced scorecard (BSC) and quality function deployment (QFD) framework proposed in the present study enabled the identification and ranking of the objectives of the financial perspective and the enablers of construction delay mitigation. This will help construction industry professionals prioritize the enabling factors that influence the financial perspective, thereby helping them focus on the achievement of the most important ones which subsequently results in efficiency. Consequently, more tasks are accomplished with the use of less time and resources as the actions tend to be more narrowly focused on the achievement of the most important factors such as client and contractor-related factors, as opposed to the low-value adding factors. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to determine the essential factors that would help resolve or reduce delays. A total of 41 mitigation factors (seven financial objectives and 36 enabler objectives) were identified and categorized into four BSC perspectives: financial, client, contractor and project management team, and innovation and learning. Two management tools, the BSC and QFD, were used to develop the system based on the mitigation factors defined. Findings The results of this study show that the most significant factors affecting the achievement of the financial objectives of the project are mainly customer-related factors, accompanied by factors related to contractors and project management teams. With the fishbone diagram and cause and effect analysis, the proposed BSC and QFD system provides a long-term approach for all stakeholders to help professionals in the construction industry prioritize and reduce delays more effectively. Moreover, the findings of the present study highlight the utility of the integrated BSC and QFD framework in quantifying the strengths of association of different objectives of the financial perspective and the enablers of construction delay mitigation. Originality/value The contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the proposed integrated structure for BSC and QFD that can serve as a comprehensive and structural approach to rating the essential enabling delay mitigation factors based on the magnitude of their effects on the financial performance of the project. The proposed framework can be considered a novel tool since this is the first integrated BSC and QFD framework for construction delay mitigation. Finally, the proposed BSC and QFD framework, along with the fishbone diagram and cause and effect analysis, provides a long-term strategy for all stakeholders to mitigate delays. Thus, the proposed integrated BSC and QFD framework can serve as a systematic and structural approach for measuring the strength of influence of the enablers of delay mitigation against the financial perspective.

An alternative strategy is developed to create new competitive advantages for construction firms with low financial resources. Resource-based strategic management is reviewed and its relevance extended to the construction industry. A pilot study involving ten construction companies in Botswana assessed their attempts to create competitive advantages. This case study indicates that small construction firms with low financial resources can build competitive advantages by creating firm-specific capabilities rather than imitating the strategies of large construction firms that are often based on the accumulation of large physical and financial resources.

Innovation drivers in these categories are active at the transfirm, intrafirm, and interfirm level in the network of organizations in the construction industry. Empirical research in the Dutch construction industry illustrates that the innovation drivers are used by managers of the authorities, clients, architects, consultants, and contractors to stimulate and facilitate innovation processes. It also exemplifies that driving innovation on the transfirm, intrafirm, and interfirm level in the network of organizations is an opportunity for managers of both public and private organizations to develop, improve, and renew their organizations' positions in the market, the quality of their organizations' projects, and the cooperative structure of the industry as a whole.

However, implementing project scheduling that takes into account the potential quality loss cost (PQLC) in time-cost tradeoff problems is a practical approach, since individual activity quality is defined by conformance to project contractor requirements. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model that considers the PQLC for excessive crashing activities. This model will help project planners develop practical project schedules.

J	Wang, NM; Adeli, H				Wang, Nengmou; Adeli, Hojjat			SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainable building design; material; system; optimization	SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; DAMPERS	Sustainable building design has become a wide and multidisciplinary research endeavor including mechanical, electrical, electronic, communication, acoustic, architectural, and structural engineering. It involves the participation of owners, contractors, suppliers and building users. There has been a lot of talk about sustainable buildings in the past few years. Most of the published research is concerned with saving energy and water and making the buildings more environmentally friendly by, say, reducing the carbon emissions. In this article, sustainable building design is reviewed from the viewpoint of structural engineering. Different strategies presented in the literature are summarized. Finally, the authors argue that the next big leap in sustainable building design should come from the integration of the smart structure technology including the use of hybrid and semi-active vibration controllers that can result in substantially lighter and more efficient structures.

The future of the local construction industry remains uncertain. Forecasting of future development would be attractive to parties in the industry. Based on past data of the local construction industry, a grey forecasting model is developed to predict the annual growth of construction demand for Hong Kong over the next ten years. With the implementation of ten large infrastructure projects and further collaboration with the Pearl River Delta region, there will be many potential opportunities for the local industry, especially in the transportation sector. The data and the forecast are useful reference for clients, contractors and other industry participants to formulate their short-term and long-term strategic planning.

To advance understanding of such delicate balancing among multiple reference audiences, we adopt the lens of institutional theory to illustrate that PPPs inherently exhibit strong institutional complexity due to the presence of multiple institutional logics, making them organizationally challenging to manage. Our theoretical contribution includes the development of a set of propositions to form a conceptual model to explain not only why and how PPPs exhibit institutional complexity, but also how to respond to it through logic by combining strategies such as organizational hybridization.

The BMCMC approach is known to be theoretically optimal for handling tender-price problems. The BMCMC model provides a practical solution that can reflect not only objective information but also subjective experience and knowledge. The BMCMC model allows contractors to estimate the tender price more accurately by reflecting the prior distribution function on key factors. Conclusively, this model was found to improve decision-making processes for setting an optimum tender price. An applied example showed that the proposed methods are feasible.

This situation creates a gap between the quality perceived by both contractors and customers. An analysis of 52552 handover defects in 2179 flats in Spain is presented which identified their nature, the building element and trade where these defects are located. These results are compared with previous studies that analysed defects detected during the construction stage and those that remain after handing over the building to the client. The research reveals that structural defects are resolved during construction due to existing quality standards. However, other aesthetic and functional defects remain and/or arise at handover. Some defects are not resolved until customers complain after they first occupy the dwelling. Many functional defects arise due to the lack of involvement of end users in the early project stages.

In this paper, using data from 1,722 highway projects in Indiana, random-parameter statistical models are estimated to study the factors that contribute to the likelihood of encountering a project time delay and its duration. The model estimation results show that the likelihood and duration of project time delays are significantly influenced by factors such as project cost (contract bid amount), project type, planned project duration, and the likelihood of adverse weather.

To address this issue, a dynamic simulation model is developed using system dynamics. This model represents the generic RMC operation process and can customize its structure and parameters for different operational conditions. Through model simulation, the RMC supply process is analyzed, focusing on the tradeoff between the truck mixer dispatching interval and queuing time on-site. The research findings indicate that the model-generated information helps in achieving an economical RMC supply by maintaining the number of queuing truck mixers at the desired level, while satisfying the contractor's need. Ultimately, this dynamic model could potentially be used as an effective automated tool to assist RMC suppliers in supply planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Park, M; Nepal, MP; Dulaimi, MF				Park, M; Nepal, MP; Dulaimi, MF			Dynamic modeling for construction innovation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT	Previous research on construction innovation has commonly recognized the importance of the organizational climate and key individuals, often called "champions," for the success of innovation. However, it rarely focuses on the role of participants at the project level and addresses the dynamics of construction innovation. This paper therefore presents a dynamic innovation model that has been developed using the concept of system dynamics. The model incorporates the influence of several individual and situational factors and highlights two critical elements that drive construction innovations: (1) normative pressure created by project managers through their championing behavior, and (2) instrumental motivation of team members facilitated by a supportive organizational climate. The model is qualified empirically, using the results of a survey of project managers and their project team members working for general contractors in Singapore, by assessing casual relationships for key model variables. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the model structure for fostering construction innovations.

Overseas construction projects tend to have various risk factors that can diminish project profitability. This paper provides a comprehensive hierarchical framework to investigate the cause-and-effect relationships of various profit-influencing factors for international construction projects. After long-term profitability trends are analyzed based on a total of 3,487 international projects performed by Korean global contractors during the last 4 decades, case surveys of 126 overseas projects are conducted to draw the criticalities of each factor and to develop a hierarchical framework. An in-depth comparative case study of 20 additional international projects is also performed to verify the applicability of the hierarchical framework. Finally, we present significant distinctions between successful and failed projects from the comparative case study.

This study introduces an impact assessment methodology to assess the ecological effects of different building construction tasks according to the construction equipment used. In this study, global warming potential (GWP(100)), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), photochemical oxidation formation potential (POFP) and human toxicity potential (HTP) are considered as impact categories and evaluated at the global, regional and local levels. A case study of an administrative building in Egypt is used to validate the practicality of the developed model. The results demonstrate that the developed model can efficiently evaluate the ecological effects of construction tasks, and contractors can use it as a tool for choosing ecologically friendly construction strategies.

However, DB has been especially criticized by the public sector for practicing subjective evaluation, for requiring excessive resources, and for providing only limited accessibility to small and medium-sized contractors. In Korea, similar critiques have been raised, as these qualities have prevented public owners from benefiting from the potential advantages of DB. In order to address these challenging issues, the present research systematically analyzes the characteristics of the DB delivery system in Korea. Based on industry surveys and an extensive literature review, a qualitative system dynamics model is developed and used to propose and test hypothetical DB policy alternatives which are expected to enhance DB performance. Furthermore, after the appropriate customization processes, these research findings can also be applied to the industry settings of different countries.

Surface heave is one mechanism through which directionally drilled installations may damage existing surface structures such as pavements and foundations. Several factors contribute to the development of surface heave including backream rate, borehole pressure, downhole tooling, depth of cover, annular space size, and geotechnical properties. This paper presents and discusses results of a detailed field experiment which monitored surface heave under various installation characteristics. Four borepaths were designed to implement a full factorial examination to determine the interaction of backream rate, depth of cover, drill mud flow, and reamer type have on the development of surface heave. With greater understanding of how drilling practices affect the development of surface heave, practitioners of this technology may better plan installations to minimize the impact of their operation.

However, so far no serious comprehensive effort has been made to measure the degree of informatization at the industry level. In order to address this problem, in this paper we propose an informatization assessment methodology for the construction industry. An informatization index for the construction industry (IICI) is developed based on specifics of the construction industry. A survey using IICI was conducted among general contractors in Korea, and the results are analyzed in terms of the measure of assessment, IS phases, construction business functions, and size of the firm. It is found that the proposed methodology can provide meaningful indicators that can be used in quantitative comparative assessment from many different perspectives. Details and implications of the case study are briefly presented.

Contractual pre-arrangements should provide a blueprint for collaborative behavior and trust development but the characters of megaprojects challenge such arrangements. This longitudinal study explores practices of trust development in the collaboration of commissioner and contractor consortia in the Dutch road infrastructure megaproject 'Schiphol, Amsterdam and Almere' (SAA). The findings show that six different types of workshops have been used to intervene in the collaboration of project partners in order to develop trust. The study contributes to the debate on governance in megaprojects showing how governance arrangement are enacted in the daily practice in megaprojects. To buffer the potential loss of trust through conflicts, project partners negotiated for a balanced reciprocal relationship, which is the simultaneous exchange of equivalent resources without delay.

With an increasing emphasis on the quality and value of procurement, economically most advantageous tender (EMAT) has been widely adopted as an alternative contract-awarding criteria, which has changed competitive strategies in the construction industry. A conceptual model of competitive bidding in EMAT is first established to reflect the credibility of the bidding situation. A bidding game for EMAT projects is performed by 24 participants to partially test the conceptual model. The result reveals that the game has the potential to reveal important factors in the bidding situation, simulate competitive bidding behaviors, and explore competitive advantages in the EMAT bidding process. The learning effect from the game should be useful for contractors who are preparing to deliver optimal tenders in EMAT projects.

The limits and benefits from the client and user perspectives are also explored. The interest in using LCC approaches for economic evaluation of investment decisions is large. However, constraints exists at a number of levels: uncertainties related to the long term forecasts used, difficulties in achieving relevant input data and lack of experience in using LCC models, incentives for consultants and contractors. Nonetheless, the LCC perspective is proving to be most useful during the design phase where the possibilities of cost reductions related to operation and maintenance are large. LCC can provide motivation for environmental progressive building despite the sometime higher initial cost. The implication for expanding the use of LCC are considered for government, clients/developers, professionals.

J	Campagnac, E				Campagnac, E			The contracting system in the French construction industry: actors and institutions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						French construction; construction business system; institutional change; architects; contractors; public sector procurement; contracting system; France		An overview is presented of development in the French construction industry responding to economic, regulatory and legal changes over the last 20 years. As the French industry moved into recession in the early 1980s, the large French construction corporations increasingly moved upstream taking greater responsibility for design, and downstream becoming increasingly concerned with concessions for public works and services. The public sector clients' reactions to these developments is analysed, in particular the passing and implementation of the law on the public sector client. This safeguards a larger role for the architect in the construction process and tends to favour a shift back from general contracting to seperate trades contracting. The analysis is presented in terms of a struggle between the different actors in the French contracting system for predominance, and shows how the balance of relationships in the system is dynamic.

J	Iskandar, KA; Hanna, AS; Lotfallah, W				Iskandar, Karim A.; Hanna, Awad S.; Lotfallah, Wafik			Modeling the performance of healthcare construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Project management; Productivity; Decision support systems	DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; SUCCESS	Purpose-Healthcare-sector projects are some of the most complex in modern practice due to their reliance on high-tech components and the level of precision they must maintain. Existing literature in healthcare performance specifically is scarce, but there is a recent increasing trend in both healthcare construction and a corresponding trend in related literature. No previously existing study has derived weights (relative importance) of performance metric in an objective, data-based manner. The purpose of this paper is to present a newly developed mathematical model that derives these weights, free of subjectivity that is common in other literature. Design/methodology/approach-This paper's model considers 17 exceptional projects and 19 average projects, and reveals the weights (or relative importance) of ten performance metrics by comparing how projects relate to one another in terms of each metric individually. It solves an eigenvalue problem that maximizes the difference between average and exceptional project performances. Findings-The most significant weight, i.e. the performance metric which has the greatest impact on healthcare project performance, was request for information per million dollars with a weight of 16.07 percent. Other highly weighted metrics included construction speed and schedule growth at 13.08 and 12.23 percent, respectively. Rework was the least significant metric at 3.61 percent, but not all metrics of quality had low ratings. Deficiency issues per million dollars was weighted at 11.61 percent, for example. All weights derived by the model in this paper were validated statistically to ensure their applicability as comparison and assessment tools. Originality/value-There is no widely accepted measure of project performance specific to healthcare construction. This study's contribution to the body of knowledge is its mathematical model which is a landmark effort to develop a single, objective, unified project performance index for healthcare construction. Furthermore, this unified score presents a user-friendly avenue for contractors to standardize their productivity tracking-a missing piece in the practices of many contractors.

However, the real-world implementations of breakdown structures for cost and schedule are at different levels of detail, which makes the integration of cost and schedule information quite complex. Given the pressing need for an effective yet relatively easy-to-compile approach, this research proposes an innovative scheduling approach that enables contractors to develop a schedule based on the pay items in the contract during the tendering and construction phase. By using Microsoft Visual C#, a system with the proposed approach is implemented and, thus, pay items and schedule information are automatically integrated. A case study is investigated to demonstrate the merits of this system. The research shows a true synchronization between the cost and schedule functions and provides useful insights into future project planning and scheduling in construction projects.

One of the strategic ways for solving this crisis is through identifying the culture (personality) of organizations. The study identified organizational culture typologies of construction firms in Ghana, which is in response to the need for culture studies in construction and the unavailability of such studies in the Ghanaian Construction Industry. The study was quantitative; data were collected from Indigenous contractors in Ghana using a questionnaire survey. Analysis was done using Mean Score Ranking, Relative Importance Index and Exploratory Factor Analysis. Workplace Culture, Business Culture, System Culture and Group Culture were the identified typologies for the study. The cultures identified reveal the strategic areas of construction organizations which need management planning and commitment, to help in reshaping them to be competitive in the business environment.

Though researchers generally agree that when firms form into networks they will gain access to new knowledge, the question of learning beyond the firm at the boundaries between firms or at the level of the project network itself remain less explored. We simulate the impact of task interdependence and relational instability on learning in project networks comprised of multiple specialist firms. We find that relational instability in project networks slows learning and task interdependence moderates the impact of increasing relational instability on network productivity rates. The findings have significant implications for interorganizational learning theory. The simulation results provide insights into appropriate firm-level and project network-level strategies for change.

We have investigated the use of VRML in the production and communication of construction documents, the final phase of architectural building design. A prototype, experimental Web site was set up and used to disseminate design data as VRML models and HTML text to the design client, contractor, and fabricators. In this paper, we discuss the way our construction documents were developed in VRML, the issues we faced implementing it, and critical feedback from the users of the Web space/site. We analyze the usefulness of VRML as a communication tool for the design and construction industries. Finally, we discuss technical, social, and legal issues the AEC industry faces as it shifts to embrace widespread use of a "paperless" Web-based communications infrastructure for design documentation.									4	11	12	1	3	ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV	AMSTERDAM	PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0926-5805			AUTOMAT CONSTR	Autom.

J	Zidane, YJT; Andersen, B				Zidane, Youcef J. -T.; Andersen, Bjorn			The top 10 universal delay factors in construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Norway; Construction projects; Delay causes; Delay factors; Top 10; Universal	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; COST ESCALATION; TIME; OVERRUNS; PERFORMANCE; RANKING	Purpose Projects often face delays and unnecessary use of time due to various factors and reasons, and hence suffer from unfavourable consequences. The purpose of this paper is to identify the universal delay factors from an intensive literature review, complemented by delay factors in major Norwegian construction projects based on empirical data. Design/methodology/approach The study in which this paper is based includes an intensive literature review, and semi-quantitative open survey questionnaires. This paper addresses frequency and type of delay factors in construction projects, in Norway based on the survey, and worldwide based on the previous studies. Findings From the study, the causes of delays facing the Norwegian construction industry are: poor planning and scheduling; slow/poor decision-making process; internal administrative procedures and bureaucracy within project organisations; resources shortage (human resources, machinery, equipment); poor communication and coordination between parties; slow quality inspection process of the completed work; design changes during construction/change orders; sponsor/owner/client lack of commitment and/or clear demands (goals and objectives); late/slow/incomplete/improper design; office issues; and users' issues. And the top 10 universal delay factors are: design changes during construction/change orders; delays in payment of contractor(s); poor planning and scheduling; poor site management and supervision; incomplete or improper design; inadequate contractor experience/building methods and approaches; contractor's financial difficulties; sponsor/owner/client's financial difficulties; resources shortage (human resources, machinery, equipment); and poor labour productivity and shortage of skills. Research limitations/implications When it comes to the identification of delay factors in major Norwegian projects, the research is based on a sample of 202 respondents from an open survey questionnaire. It should be noted that analysing a large population of respondents that have been asked open questions can be challenging due to the vague findings it might lead to. Also, when it comes to the identification of the universal delay factors, there were different methods used by different authors, within different context. Similar future studies in Norway based on qualitative and quantitative methods will give better verification for the findings. Practical implications This paper has documented the critical delay factors/causes in Norway. The results of this study will help project managers, in Norway and elsewhere, to be aware and know about the potential causes of delay in their construction projects, which will help to identify the possible risks in the early phases of the project. Another practical implication is to make project managers and policy makers conscious that delays are quite universal, making it necessary to identify them as a first step. Social implications The identification of delays factors and causes can permit projects to implement mitigation actions to avoid delays, thus allowing delivering schools, hospitals and other necessary infrastructure on schedule or ahead of schedule to society. Originality/value This paper highlights most (almost all) of the studies in the literature, including to the study done in Norway, concerning the delay factors in construction projects and large construction projects in general. This wide review of relevant literature will save time other academicians from having to conduct similar studies. This study will assist both academic and professional experts providing more insight about the delay causes in large-scale construction projects.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Potential for implementing relational contracting and joint risk management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper focuses on the outcomes of the second survey in a broad Hong Kong-based study on joint risk management (JRM) through relational contracting (RC). The questionnaire survey itself focused on issues relating to the formation of a coalesced team for JRM at the postcontract stage, comprising owners, consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Results indicate the greater importance of more relational, trust, and joint responsibility-related factors in general, both for selecting different parties and for building a successful relational contract. While some differences in group perceptions emerge, respondents recommend mobilizing project participants at earlier stages of projects, that is, mostly before the contract award, and they strongly support the JRM option for managing various unforeseen risks. Respondents also suggest adjustment/extension of contract provisions for managing unforeseen events, indicating emerging preferences for flexibility in contracts. All these are indicative of a perceived trend toward more RC, teamworking, and collaborative working environments.

The purposes of this research are to identify construction equipment management practices that have the potential to improve productivity in multistory building projects, develop a tool for measuring such practices, and on that basis, build a logistic regression model for predicting the probability of exceeding a baseline productivity factor when the levels of implementation of equipment management practices are known. The research adopted a two-phase exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. During Phase I, in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 experts who have been involved in the delivery of multistory building projects. The qualitative data were analyzed, and construction equipment management practices that have the potential to improve productivity were identified. In Phase II, data were collected from 39 principal contractors on 39 projects using questionnaires. The quantitative data were analyzed to prioritize the practices identified in Phase I, and on that basis, a scoring tool for measuring the practices was developed; a logistic regression model was also developed for predicting the probability of exceeding baseline productivity factor using a sigmoid graph when the score of the practices is known. Construction equipment maintenance, construction equipment procurement plans, and construction equipment productivity analysis are identified as the three construction equipment management practices that could improve productivity in multistory building projects. Contractors can use the probability-based predictive model to assess the risk of low productivity for specific levels of implementations of construction equipment management practices. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by developing a construction equipment management practices measuring, planning, monitoring, and evaluating tool in the context of multistory building projects. Also, the logistic regression model can be used to test whether a certain level of implementation of a construction equipment management practice might be associated with higher or lower productivity compared to the baseline.

Impact of Information Technologies on Performance: Cross Study Comparison	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper evaluates the use of information technology (IT) and its impact on project and company performance in the construction industry. Using project level data from 139 projects and company level data from 74 companies, the current state of IT use in the construction industry was studied and statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between IT use and performance. Analyses are segregated by owner and contractor stakeholder groups and findings suggest that more IT use correlates with improved performance. Schedule performance has a strong positive association with increased IT use, whereas cost performance, although positively correlated, has a weaker relationship. These findings are in line with previous studies, adding to the research that IT has a positive impact on performance. Further comparison is made to show that IT use has increased over time among projects drawn from a similar sample population.

J	Karna, S; Junnonen, JM				Karna, Sami; Junnonen, Juha-Matti			Designers' performance evaluation in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Customer satisfaction; Performance measures; Design management; Critical success factors; Project participants satisfaction	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SATISFACTION; QUALITY	Purpose - In a construction project, "participants' satisfaction" is one of the main dimensions used for measuring the successfulness of a project. Designers perform a major role in attaining the project goals and managing project complexity during production. The purpose of this paper is to examine the designers' performance as evaluated by the main participants: the client, the project consultant/manager and the main contractor, and to identify the main success factors of designer performance using the participants' evaluation. The study also aims to examine how the economic size of a project affects the project participants' assessment of the designer's performance. It is assumed that as the size of a project increases, so does the complexity of the project, which will affect the scope of work and demands on the designers' operational performance for the specific project level. Design/methodology/approach - The Finnish project evaluation and benchmark database was used in this study as empirical data. The quantitative data consists of surveys on the project level and are based on a multi-dimensional standard evaluation wherein the main participants evaluate each other's performances. The client, project consultant and main contractor evaluated the designer's performance. The data of the study consisted of a total of 892 evaluations. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the differences between the project participants' assessments based upon the different economic sizes of the projects. Findings - Contractors were satisfied with the designers' performance in small projects, whereas the client and the project consultant/manager rated the designers' performance most successful in large projects. This result may be due to small projects are typically simple and less complex, in which case design solutions are generally well-defined. Nonetheless, the participants' level of satisfaction follows the same factors. The main problems in the designers' performance were related to the design content: the flawlessness and comprehensiveness, as well as the compatibility and consistency of designs. These factors were emphasized particularly in the client's low satisfaction of the designer's performance. However, project participants were satisfied with the collaboration with designers; however, room for improvement could be found in internal communication and collaboration within the design teams. The findings illustrated that the assessment of the success rate of a project was party-specific, which was clearly affected by the size of the project, as large projects appeared to be more complex than smaller ones. Practical implications - The findings suggested that there is a need to develop project-specific practices in managing multidisciplinary design teams. Additionally, particularly in large projects, designers should focus more on solving problems and design requirements occurring at the construction site. However, this should be implemented in such a way that this does not interfere with the design activities conducted with the client and project management. While client satisfaction is low in the small projects, designers should focus more on customer-oriented methods to serve client needs better. Originality/value - In construction project management studies, there is a need to measure the importance that various participants assign to different success factors. Since project success factors depend on project type, a more project-specific approach is suggested to identify the main parameters for measuring project success. This study provides a holistic approach of the designers' performance, which contributes to the theory of project success and designers' performance improvement.

To overcome this issue, an option-pricing framework is developed that enables financial assessment of different types of road projects in the presence of different government support mechanisms. However, this paper focuses on evaluation of highway projects under the presence of PACs. By providing a framework for calculating the value of government support mechanisms and long-term material and energy contracts, this model can help road agencies and contractors with choosing effective hedging strategies.

With the pre-program. adiabatic hydration curves, which are used to determine the internal heat generation, are calculated. An artificial neural networks approach is used for this purpose. Adiabatic hydration curves, which were included in the learning set, were determined by our own experiments, using the adiabatic calorimeter which uses air as the coupling media. The main program is implemented in the finite element code. This program allows concrete structure designers and contractors to quantify and evaluate the effects of some concrete initial parameters on the adiabatic hydration curves and corresponding temperature development at an arbitrary point in the concrete element. Some examples are also presented and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the implementation level and the types of TQM practices adopted in construction companies. Eight elements had been identified from both organizational-/management- and construction-related studies to represent the TQM spirit. These elements are top management leadership, customer management, people management, supplier management, quality information management, process management, organizational learning, and continual improvement. A questionnaire survey was conducted to solicit the implementation level of the identified TQM elements. The survey findings indicate that customer, process management, and top management leadership were implemented at a higher level than the remaining elements with quality information management implemented at the lowest level. Important practices that constitute each element were also identified. Based on the findings, we propose a TQM implementation framework for construction companies.

This paper described the Six Sigma concept as a quality initiative that may be applied in the building industry. The principles, methodology, and metrics of Six Sigma are first discussed. The implementation phases as well as the training programs required are explained. A case study of how Six Sigma was pioneered in an organization in the building industry is presented. The findings suggest that management initiative and support, relevant training, appropriate selection of pilot projects, and commitment by team members are crucial for the successful implementation of Six Sigma in the organization. The application of Six Sigma for improving the quality of internal finishes during construction is also explained. Improvement measures taken by a contractor helped to raise the sigma from 2.66sigma to 3.95sigma for quality of internal finishes.

In this study, the impact of "resources and capabilities," "strategic decisions," "project management competencies," and "strength of relationships with other parties" on "company performance" was investigated. A questionnaire survey was administered to 73 Turkish contractors and the results of the survey were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that, as expected, resources and capabilities and strategic decisions have an important and direct impact on company performance, whereas project management competencies and strength of relationships with other parties impact company performance only indirectly, through their impact on companies' resources and capabilities and strategic decisions.

Mathematical relationships between scoring parameters in capped tendering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bid; Tender; Auction; Construction; Scoring system	OPPORTUNISTIC BIDDING BEHAVIOR; CONTRACTORS DECISION; COST; MODEL	Mathematical relationships between Scoring Parameters can be used in Economic Scoring Formulas (ESF) in tendering to distribute the score among bidders in the economic part of a proposal. Each contracting authority must set an ESF when publishing tender specifications and the strategy of each bidder will differ depending on the ESF selected and the weight of the overall proposal scoring. This paper introduces the various mathematical relationships and density distributions that describe and inter-relate not only the main Scoring Parameters but the main Forecasting Parameters in any capped tender (those whose price is upper-limited). Forecasting Parameters, as variables that can be known in advance before the deadline of a tender is reached, together with Scoring Parameters constitute the basis of a future Bid Tender Forecasting Model.

Unique Requirements of Building Information Modeling for Cast-in-Place Reinforced Concrete	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering	JUL 24-27, 2007	Pittsburgh, PA	ASCE				The building information modeling (BIM) tools that have matured for structural steel and precast concrete construction are not suitable for production modeling of cast-in-place (CIP) reinforced concrete structures. The main reason is that CIP structures are monolithic in nature, as opposed to the discrete objects that are typical of steel and precast. A consortium of 12 major contractors and design firms collaborated over a one-year period to formulate the functional requirements for development of a BIM tool for cast-in-place reinforced concrete. The functional requirements were derived from a process model used to scope and understand the processes surrounding reinforced concrete design and production. The functional requirements were finally expressed as a set of object schemas, defining relations, methods, and attributes needed. These are essential for software companies to incorporate in their BIM tools to provide for the unique needs of modeling CIP structures.

In many countries, e-bidding has become part of the public procurement reform. However, previous studies have reported the low uptake of e-bidding in the construction industry. This study develops a theoretical structural model representing the impact six latent variables on the willingness of construction organizations to participate in e-bidding. Data from a questionnaire survey of 64 respondents from clients, contractors, consultants, and suppliers organizations was used to analyze the model. The result of the data analysis suggests that perceived barriers, cost, the perceived benefits of e-bidding and security concerns are the factors influencing willingness participate in e-bidding with perceived barriers being the most significant influencing factor. The perception about the adequacy of the existing traditional paper-based tendering and the perception about the non-readiness of business partners are the underlying barriers that need to be addressed when introducing e-biding. This study also discovers that when the respondents concern about the cost of e-bidding is high, their reported willingness to participate in e-bidding is higher when the perceived benefits is high that when the perceived benefits is low. To enhance the participation of the industry in e-bidding, public sector and large private clients would need to take leadership by making bidder's capability for e-bidding and e-project management at all project phases a criteria in bid evaluation. E-bidding developers and promoters need to use test project cases to monitor, measure, and document the benefits of e-bidding. To disseminate the perceived benefits, promoters would need to work closely with industry professional associations to develop promotional programmes linked to continuous professional development (CPD) points. The analytical approach used in this study should assist other researchers who might wish to address a similar research problem under a similar data and model constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors discuss and analyze the current situation of rentseeking behavior in infrastructure construction projects, integrated project delivery (IPD), and the application of a building information model (BIM) in China. The authors analyze the collusive behavior between the supervision department and the contractor via the rent-seeking model on the basis of the game theory and present that BIM and IPD have a positive impact on rent-seeking activities of construction projects. The key factors influencing the rent-seeking activities from the perspective of the owner are studied via a questionnaire survey. Findings - The research status of IPD in China includes the application of IPD, IPD collaborative management and the combination of lean construction (LC), IPD and BIM. The enthusiasm of the adoption of BIM and IPD is higher for design institute, construction units, research institutions and universities. The findings indicate that the owner appears to have a significant influence on stakeholders in construction projects, such as supervising efficiency, rewards and punishment. Therefore, the results also demonstrate that the construction project based on BIM and IPD can effectively avoid the rent-seeking activities of the participants. Research limitations/implications - The findings are primarily based on questionnaire data originated from Central China; hence there are some limitations that are worth noting. Practical implications - First, it provides compelling data evidence for the adoption of BIM and IPD in China. Second, it paves a solid foundation for the behavior of stakeholders in construction projects based on BIM and IPD. Originality/value - In this paper, a game model of contractor, supervisor and owner is established, and a preliminary attempt is made to introduce BIM and IPD into the model for the behavioral research of participants.

To remain competitive in the market, it is crucial for companies to have an accurate estimate of their projects. Nevertheless, given that very little is known about the scope and details of the project, the conventional cost estimation methods tend to be slow and inaccurate. With the rise of computing power, there is now a tendency to use Machine Learning (ML)-based methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for more accurate cost estimation that can remain reliable in face of insufficient details during the tendering phase. While the use of ANN for cost estimation has been abundantly investigated from the perspective of contractors, there are very limited studies on the development and application of ML-based methods for engineering consultancy firms. Given that the nature of products/services offered by consultancy firms is inherently different from that of contractors (i.e. they are more abstract and less material-based) and also given that the type and level of detail of the available data at the tendering stage is dissimilar, it is important to investigate the applicability of ML-based methods for cost estimation in consultancy firms. To this end, this paper presents an artificial neural network approach for the cost estimation of engineering services. In developing the model, first, the influential factors that affect the costs of engineering services are identified. Thereafter, a model is developed using the data of 132 projects. Subsequently, a heuristic method is developed to systematically improve and fine-tune the performance of the model. Eventually, the findings show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can obtain a fairly accurate cost estimate, even with small datasets. In fact, the model proposed in this paper performed better than those proposed in other similar works. The model developed in this study showed a 14.5% improvement in the accuracy of the model, considering MAPE.

Construction firms can effectively use their organizational memory to enhance their decision-making abilities. A framework was constructed to model the organizational memory formation process in construction companies. Based on this model, an interview study was conducted to investigate both the organizational memory formation and the role of organizational memory in strategic decision-making within the construction industry. Eight Turkish contractors were assessed. The results suggest that construction companies make use of several knowledge sources and mechanisms to acquire knowledge. Although construction companies are successful at the collection and storage of knowledge, they are weak in the exploitation of organizational memory, especially at the strategic decision-making stage. In addition, they cannot increase their organizational teaming competence due to some company- and industry-specific barriers.

The research data were collected using stratified random sampling (P = 190) of construction management professionals in the state of California, USA. Hypothesis testing was conducted using one sample two-tailed t-test while the research inference derived from a synthesis of the parametric hypothesis testing and effect size. The results indicated that construction partnering has no measurable influence on the occurrence of requirement conflicts, but appears to lower the occurrence of construction requirement disputes. Moreover, the conflict and dispute occurrence data show partnering is not an antidote to the occurrence of requirement conflicts but a vehicle for amicable resolution of conflicts to reduce requirement disputes and prevent litigation.

Reducing Bias and Uncertainty in Multievaluator Multicriterion Decision Making	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decision making; Bias; Uncertainty; Contractor selection; Evaluation; Simulation; Mathematical model	CONSTRUCTION; QUALITY	Many decisions are based on more than one criterion, judged by more than a single evaluator. Multievaluator multicriterion (MEMC) decision making can be controversial if bias or uncertainty find their way into the final decision. In fact, both public and private organizations have recently faced challenges when making decisions. In a previous study, the authors of this paper developed a multievaluator decision making model that reduces the effect of possible uncertainty resulting from an evaluator's insufficient expertise in a particular criterion. This paper builds on the previous model by also correcting for any possible evaluator favoritism or bias. It presents a more comprehensive mathematical model that supports MEMC decisions and protects decision makers and their agencies from potential criticism. Testing of the model shows that it performs better than the simple averaging method on 100% of the simulations. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000206. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In Spain, despite the Ley de Ordenacion de la Edificacion (Building Regulation Act), which establishes a general framework to promote overall building quality, construction defects in residential buildings remain a pervasive problem. An analysis of 3647 construction defects is presented which identified the location within the building, subcontractors and building element in 68 residential building developments undertaken by two large Spanish contractors. The research reveals that the most common defects that arise during construction are related to the stability of the structure and inappropriate installation of roofs and facades. These technical faults are caused by poor workmanship rather than by the quality of the materials or products used. By comparing these results with a previous study on defects after handover, it can be concluded that while the nature of defects during construction is basically technical, at handover it is aesthetic or technical.

However, unique features of the Chinese business environment and their impact on the design services sector remain unclear to many of these potential new entrants. The objective of this paper is to survey the interior design services sector and provide guidance for foreign firms that wish to enter this market. Several systemic problems pertaining to this sector are identified from interviews, which include two different standards for design fees, short design cycles and an inappropriate design proposal review system. Several transnational marketing strategies are proposed: establishing alliances with Chinese private design firms, and establishing long-term cooperative relationships with developers and contractors to provide focused services. However, a more competitive pricing policy is not regarded as a sustainable strategy for foreign interior design firms.

For owner organizations involved in such projects, use of in-house resources versus outside contractors has been a major dilemma, with each approach having its potential benefits. This paper uses a real-life case study approach to investigate the delivery of 800 small reconstruction projects using in-house forces. Details are described related to the prioritization, budgeting, organization structure, and the mechanisms used for staff allocation. It was found that the main characteristics of projects that are best delivered by in-house forces include high urgency and inadequate scope definition. Outsourcing this type of projects exposes the owner to a large number of changes and their consequent cost overruns/delays. Based on the case study, the challenges facing in-house delivered projects and the factors that contribute to their success were investigated and outlined. To verify the findings a questionnaire survey among similar organizations is conducted and its results discussed.

J	MOORHOUSE, DC; MILLET, RA				MOORHOUSE, DC; MILLET, RA			IDENTIFYING CAUSES OF FAILURE IN PROVIDING GEOTECHNICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTING SERVICES	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								After first defining ''failure,'' the writers present the results of their examination of over 50 published and unpublished case histories of failures related to geotechnical and environmental consulting services. The case-history analysis indicates that there are four main participants in failures and a multiple of contributory causes. Tabular summaries of the frequency of occurrence of contributing causes and main participants were prepared separately for geotechnical and environmental cases. Findings indicate that there are at least two to three contributing causes leading to failure as well as a multiple of key participants. For geotechnical cases, the leading contributing causes were: clients or contractors not following the professionals' recommendations and lack of disclosure by the professional of risk, uncertainties, and consequences. For environmental cases, the most frequent contributing cause of failure was lack of staff training. It is concluded that, to significantly reduce the frequency of failures, attention and resources must be applied to the acts and policies of senior management and project management in professional service firms.

Design/methodology/approach Interview-based exploratory research strategy was used to survey senior managers and directors of medium- to large-sized road contracting firms in NZ. Empirical data were analyzed using the multi-attribute analytical technique. Findings Results revealed 70 productivity constraints faced by the RPMRCs in NZ; in diminishing order of influence, these constraints were aggregated into eight broad categories as follows: finance, workforce, technology/process, statutory/regulatory compliance, project characteristics, project management/project team characteristics, unforeseen circumstances and other/external factors. The most important constraints in each of the eight broad categories were presented. Research limitations/implications The key limitation of the research is that it was based on feedback from a limited number of participants which were less than the minimum required to represent the views of the potential participants in the sampling frame for the study. As a result, the findings may not be reliably generalized beyond the scope of the data used. Further research on the subject is recommended to ensure that the representation of the views of the individuals and companies that comprised the sampling frame is achieved. The current findings could be formulated as propositions or hypotheses to be tested in future confirmatory research. Practical implications At the industry level, the findings could provide the basis for the skill development programs of the NZ RPMRCs. The application of the research findings by the RPMRCs and consultants could result in significant improvement in the productivity of the NZ roading sector and the sector's enhanced contribution to the economy. Originality/value Currently, there is little research on the priority constraints to productivity and performance in the NZ roading sector. The findings contribute to knowledge by revealing critical factors constraining productivity performance of the NZ RMRCs and the associated improvement measures. New and more enriching viewpoints were provided on how contractors could leverage their limited resources to address the identified key constraints.

The factors contributing to construction accidents in Pakistan Their prioritization using the Delphi technique	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pakistan; Developing countries; Delphi survey; Construction accidents; Contributory factors; Inter-rater agreement analysis	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; INTERRATER AGREEMENT; WORK BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; CLIMATE; IMPLEMENTATION; MAINTENANCE	Purpose - The highest number of accidents in proportion to the employment rate is found in construction industry among all industries in Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to identify and prioritize the contributory factors of accident causation that can significantly reduce the rate of accident in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 32 contributory factors of accident causation were identified through a triangulation strategy comprising eight face-to-face semi-structured interviews with the academic and industry experts coupled with a comprehensive literature review. Delphi survey was then conducted among the four respondent groups (clients, contractors, safety official and academia) to prioritize these factors. A consensus was achieved among the respondent groups after conducting two rounds of Delphi survey. Finally, the results were validated using the technique of inter-rater agreement (IRA) analysis. Findings - All the shortlisted accident causation factors were graded as "important" to "extremely important". Moreover, a "moderate" to "strong level" agreement was developed among the respondent groups. The three most significant factors were highlighted as "poor enforcement of safety rules and regulations by the Government agencies", "insufficient allocation of safety budget and safety incentives by the client", and "insufficient provision of safety training and resources by the contractor". Practical implications - The findings will help the key stakeholders to prioritize their energies towards achieving zero accident in the construction industry. Moreover, addition of academic experts as one of the respondent groups will enhance the linkages between the academia and the industry practitioners. Originality/value - Besides highlighting the underlying causes of construction accidents in Pakistan, a detailed methodology is presented in this study for the analysis and validation of the Delphi survey data, which can be extrapolated in other regions and industries for elements prioritization. The findings of the study can also be generalized for other developing countries having similar work environment. The results validation through the use of IRA analysis is an addition to the field of construction safety research. The study also authenticates the applicability of IRA analysis to assess the agreement level among the respondents.	[Zahoor, Hafiz; Chan, Albert P.

Despite their large diversity, some of these indexes are common in all projects. This paper investigated the major indexes which are related to the owner/contractor agreement type in projects. A hybrid analytical model was utilized to determine the importance of the indexes. Four major indexes and 16 sub-indexes were adopted based on the PMBOK code and a review of the literature. Data collection was performed via two standard questionnaires, to determine the interrelationships and importance level of the indexes, based on a 9-point scale pairwise comparison. The data were analyzed using the fuzzy ANP method, in combination with the DEMATEL method. The results demonstrated that the 'legal index' had the highest impressiveness, followed by the 'financial', 'operational', and 'construction-related indexes', respectively. Accordingly, some strategies are recommended to reduce the damage indexes in projects.

Although construction management expertise is gained and significant amount of data are collected from past projects, completing projects on time remains a challenge. This article uses data from 466 MILCON projects to identify key factors that influence project duration and provide a new model to predict project time outcomes. The model generates accurate results and serves as a useful tool in the early phases of a project life cycle. Another key contribution of this study is the employed methodology, which includes the use of available data, targeting of relevant parameters, and development of the predictive model. The contributed methodology is applicable outside of the MILCON domain with the appropriate data set and by targeting the relevant influential factors to create models to predict time outcomes of future projects.

The case study method is used to compare theory to reality from different perspectives, building explanations from a Spanish contractor observed over a three year period. Findings suggest that innovation management can be standardized, which leads to an organizational improvement for the company, and at the same time this improvement facilitates organizational problem-solving on a regular basis, increasing technical capabilities, knowledge management, business profit, and client satisfaction. The framework described in this research aims to provide guidance for managers, thus they can innovate in a systematic way; however, this exploratory study has still to be validated by empirical investigations on a larger scale through a significant number of certified companies, which is currently not yet the case in the Spanish construction industry.

Due to their large size and their repetitive/distributed nature, construction and/or maintenance operations for such networks become complex tasks that require huge resources, particularly manpower. In order to provide a transparent tool for quick manpower planning and sensitivity analysis, a graphical approach (using nomographs) is introduced in this paper. The nomographs encode the mathematical formulation, and the results of many optimization experiments, of a distributed model for scheduling large projects with multiple sites. Accordingly, the nomographs can be readily utilized by practitioners to estimate the manpower needed to meet a predefined deadline, under anticipated network-level risks due to unfavorable site conditions. Details on the development of the nomographs are presented in the paper along with an example to demonstrate their usefulness for,supporting manpower planning decisions and for what-if analysis. The nomographs also present researchers with a simple yet powerful approach to make research results readily usable by practitioners.

This problem arises because of the asymmetrical distribution of quasi-rents between two trading parties. To put this theoretical proposition to a direct test, this research first uses the Nash bargaining model to derive a hypothesis that links quasi-rent differences to the excess profit margin that the contractor can achieve in ex post negotiations, and then collates a data set of 62 change-order cases to enable the hypothesis to be tested econometrically. The corroboration of the hypothesis lends empirical support to the core argument used in the analysis of construction holdup problems. This finding brings to the foreground the significance of recognizing that change orders might be attributed to the owner's strategic choice. Ignorance of this factor would bias the coefficient estimation in the empirical analysis of change orders.

Indeed, owners and contractors alike make key strategic decisions about individual projects and capital investment programs alike based on forecasted values. As a departure from current cost and schedule assessments solely based on deviations at completion, this article introduces the Predictability Index, a novel performance metric that also considers the project team's ability to timely predict outcomes at completion. This article conceptually explains and defines the index and, based on the statistical analysis of retrospective data from 135 completed projects, identifies threshold values of predictability performance. Complementary, lessons learned and observations collected from the adoption and assessment of predictability by industry organizations are also discussed. A significant cultural shift within an organization is necessary for project teams to focus on predictability performance. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A sample of 133 respondents from different stakeholder groups was picked from the UAE construction industry, and surveyed through an online questionnaire to collect data on respondents' experience, roles, and risk perceptions. Variations in risk perceptions were analyzed by grouping the respondents by experience and roles. Given the ordinal nature of the data, only nonparametric statistical techniques were used in the analysis. According to the results, the roles and experience of stakeholders significantly affected their risk perceptions in many cases. For example, there was a statistically significant discordance between clients and contractors regarding the importance of delegating decision-making authority. Likewise, significant discordance was observed between more experienced and less experienced sub-groups of clients regarding the importance of design quality and documentation.

To undertake this task, existing paper-based processes were re-engineered to accommodate the use of cloud-based BIM during construction. The design and implementation of a real-time object oriented bi-directional system, allowed information (e.g., the status of the 'As-Built' schedule) to be captured on-site and synchronized with a federated BIM. As a result of adopting cloud-based technology during construction, a new object oriented workflow and processes for progress management are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Randolph			Computer applications in intelligent compaction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The term "intelligent compaction" is now heard so often one might believe that the method used for documenting and controlling the quality of hot-mix asphalt pavement has evolved to a state of total commercial and engineering acceptance. In fact, today's most-used process for determining the density of an asphalt mat uses 1960's technology. Now, however, the responsibility for quality control (QC) of the paving and compaction process has largely been given to the contractor. This shift in responsibility comes at a time when the construction industry as a whole is faced with the worst labor shortage in history, limiting the number of qualified QC technicians and equipment operators. Recently, researchers introduced a patented system that, when mounted on a vibratory asphalt compactor, can render an asphalt density reading (in pounds per cubic foot) every 1 s in real time. This paper briefly describes the system and details the essential contributions made by computer hardware and software to a successful onboard asphalt density measuring system.	[Minchin, R.

To meet these challenges, state highway agencies must seek innovative approaches to deliver highway projects, including outsourcing some of the agency's functions and shifting maintenance responsibilities to contractors. Many states have implemented alternative contracting methods in project programming and execution to provide lasting and functional roadways at the optimum life-cycle cost to the public. The performance warranty is one of the innovative practices that has been declared operational by the Federal Highway Administration since 1996. Use of warranties in some states has required changes to state legislation and agency regulations. This paper discusses the laws and regulations needed to successfully incorporate performance warranties into current contracting practices and avoid litigation. The state of Alabama is used as an example of a state considering the use of performance warranties. Proposals for laws and regulations will be outlined.

Safety issues on global projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; CLIMATE	Global construction projects that involve collaboration between participants from multiple countries can often lead to conflicts and delays due to different cultural perceptions of acceptable levels of safety among the different project participants. The current literature has not explored the origins, extent and costs of these delays, as well as ways to remedy them on global projects. Detailed case studies of four comparable global infrastructure projects indicate that legal rules, cultural values and the prevailing economic situation in their countries of origin, influenced project participants' perception of safety. Differing mindsets on these projects clashed, leading to project delays and costs. Project participants unsuccessfully attempted to use a strategy of education to improve safety levels, and then resorted to more successful coercive strategies such as the imposition of fines. This research contributes to: practice, by identifying challenges that international contractors face when attempting to transfer safety techniques to developing countries on short-term global projects; and to theory by shedding light on cultural challenges faced on global projects.

However, previous studies indicate that current as-built schedule development methods are manual and rely on information scattered in various field diaries and meeting minutes. SHAs have started to collect field activity data in digital databases that can be used to automatically generate as-built schedules if proper computational algorithms are developed. This study develops computational algorithms and a prototype system to automatically generate and visualize project level and activity level as-built schedules during and after construction. The algorithm is validated using a real highway project data. The study is expected to significantly aid SHAs in making better use of field data, facilitate as-built schedule development, monitor construction progress with higher granularity, and utilize as-built schedule for productivity analysis.

Construction, as one of the pollution generators, is not exempt from EMS. However, in performing EMS, the greatest obstacle is the lack of objective performance evaluation criteria. ISO 14000 is an international environmental management system (EMS), which deals with the management of the organizational environmental performance. In 1999, ISO 14031 Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) was introduced for assessing the environmental performance related to the management and operational systems. The Hong Kong construction industry lags behind other sectors of the economy in implementing EMS and EPE because the self-initiating nature of the scheme lacks any external stimulus. The high initial cost of the scheme deters contractors from the implementation. However, the application of EPE offers many benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry. Therefore, this paper discusses the benefits and difficulties when implementing EPE in the construction industry. Some obstacles have been identified and suggestions to overcome them are made.

Considering this and the limited literature on market analysis, this paper aimed to explore the effects of contract announcements on the market value of firms in the context of construction industry. Through a rigorous sample-screening process, this paper selects and analyzes a total of 377 contracts awarded to Korean contractors between 2000 and 2010. Using the standard event study methodology, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are estimated to evaluate the overall level of project success and to compare groups categorized according to project characteristics. The results indicate that the stock market generally responds positively to contract announcements. In addition, contracts awarded during economic upturns are more likely to be favorably evaluated than those awarded during economic downturns.

During the construction period, the property loss of high-tech facilities is the issue of most concerned for the owners, investors, and contractors. This paper aims to study the risks of high-tech facility construction and identify the probability distributions suitable for the simulation of loss frequency, loss amount, and loss claim, respectively. The risks with the highest impact are attributable to negligence, fire, leakage, falling, and collision. Also, using the normalized loss factor as an indicator of the value at risk (VaR), this paper provides a way to estimate the maximum loss that might occur during a target time frame by means of the variance-covariance, historical simulation, and Monte Carlo methods.

This paper reports first results from a Bureau of Labor Statistics research group convened to measure construction productivity better. Results show that labor productivity growth has been positive, and fairly substantial, in all four industries where reliable deflators now exist. Shifts of labor between construction industries reduce productivity growth by 0.4% a year. Regulation is a significant negative effect on productivity, but reduces productivity growth by only 0.1% a year. Undocumented immigrants are important in construction, and often work off the books, but reasonable allowance for their increased presence reduces productivity growth by only 0.1% a year. The influences examined are not sufficient to explain why productivity growth is so much lower in construction than elsewhere. Later work will measure productivity growth in a broader range of industries, including some industries representing contractors. However, this further work requires access to restricted Census microdata, and so will take several years more to complete.

In this multidisciplinary environment, claims are immanent and appear to cause delays in delivering projects. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), claims are seen in almost every construction project. In an attempt to prevent/reduce claims, this paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among construction practitioners in UAE to investigate the types and causes of construction claims and their frequency and severity. The survey data was collected from contractors, designers and owners. Results of data analysis indicated that the 'changes' and 'delay' types of claims are the most frequent ones while 'contract ambiguity' is ranked last. The analysis also showed that 'change/variation orders' is the most frequent and severe cause of claims while 'delay caused by owner' is ranked second and 'owner personality' is ranked last. General recommendations on how to reduce/prevent claims are then presented.

Modeling and forecasting construction labor demand: Multivariate analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							REQUIREMENTS; MANPOWER	This paper presents the development of advanced labor demand forecasting models at project level. A total of 11 manpower demand forecasting models were developed for the total project labor and ten essential trades. Data were collected from a sample of 54 construction projects. These data were analyzed through a series of multiple linear regression analyses that help establish the estimation models. The results indicate that project labor demand depends not only on a single factor, but a cluster of variables related to the project characteristics, including construction cost, project complexity attributes, physical site condition, and project type. The derived regression models were tested and validated using four out-of-sample projects and various diagnostic tests. It is concluded that the models are robust and reliable, which merit for contractors and HKSAR government to predict the labor required for a new construction project and facilitate human resources planning and budgeting, and that the methodology used may be applied to develop equally useful models in other subsectors, and in other countries.

As current construction projects become larger and more complex, claim management becomes more diverse and essential for the success of the project. Although claim management has been the subject of many previous studies, few studies have investigated the performance indicators for claim management. By interviewing 21 industry practitioners from 10 companies in South Korea who have expertise in claims, this study proposes performance indicators for claim management based on the issues within various claim management processes. The proposed indicators are validated both qualitatively and quantitatively and proven to diagnose the process of claim management appropriately. These indicators are helpful in monitoring and controlling companies' claim management, which will contribute to managing claims more effectively. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of research results, they are faced with such problems as distributed sources and inter-disciplinary differences in terminology that prevent them from accessing the information they need. This paper presents the System for Active Knowledge Management (SAKM), a web-based system that addresses these problems by supporting effective information search and analysis, and by enhancing communication and collaboration among researchers. The system was implemented in the underground construction field, which has experienced tremendous growth and is facing increasingly complex and challenging research issues. Preliminary testing suggested that a tool like the SAKM could improve the information transfer of research results. The validation stage confirmed that the system met the requirements of the initially defined scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO				Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO			Evaluation of factors influencing construction clients' decision to build	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Evidence indicates that construction clients are not wholly satisfied with the performance achieved on many of their projects, with the blame for failures often attributed to both consultants and contractors. However, the findings of a survey described in this paper suggest that there are several factors influencing a client's decision to build that ultimately bear upon a successful project outcome. It is imperative for project participants to understand these factors before developing the project objectives. These factors operate in the following three main groupings: organizational variables, including director's preference, corporate ego, status/prestige, location, and profit/economic reasons; structural variables, including change of attitude, cultural influence, social expectation, workers' pressure; and externalities, including users' preference, and need for more facilities. Organizational factors predominate the decision to build. If the consultant in general and the client in particular can appreciate the factors that instigate the project, they will both perform their respective roles adequately and ensure a succesful project outcome.

First, the FAHP method integrates the AHP with fuzzy set theory to determine the weights of factors that influence the cost of a project. Second, the integration of the cumulative distribution functions that are generated by the Monte Carlo simulation with a regression model yields bid amounts that correspond to various confidence levels. The proposed approach is used to analyze data on bridge construction projects that are taken from a database of the Taiwan Public Construction Commission. The systematic bid assessment model and the cost-probability curve can be used as strategic tools for quantifying project risks and calculating bids for construction projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to assess the risks associated with the underground rail ICJVs in Singapore. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive literature review was carried out and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 33 contractors. The survey results reported "disagreement on some conditions in contract" as the most critical risk. Although the risk criticalities of some risks significantly differed according to multiple company characteristics, there was strong agreement on the risk rankings. With the help of this study, ICJV partners can identify the most critical risks and thus develop mitigation measures. Also, the findings from this study provide a comprehensive picture of risks for the companies that intend to participate in ICJVs in Singapore. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Facility managers begin their duties by rekeying the information found in these handover documents. This paper describes the facility management handover (FM) model view definition (MVD), an open-standard information exchange format that may replace current construction handover document requirements. The work was accomplished in conjunction with three buildingSMART chapters to ensure the widest possible international acceptance. The specification of the underlying industry foundation class (IFC) model with required business rules for use in the United States is called the construction-operations building information exchange (COBie) format. Procedures used to test software production and consumption of COBie were developed. Use of COBie has now been documented in several case studies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000196.

J	Hegazy, T				Hegazy, T			Computerized system for efficient delivery of infrastructure maintenance/repair programs	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper discusses three common approaches used by owner organizations to deliver infrastructure maintenance/repair (M/R) programs that involve multiple distributed sites: using in-house resources, outsourcing to contractors, and a combination of both. A scheduling model is then introduced that uses genetic algorithms to suggest the optimum combination of in-house crews and outsourcing that meet execution constraints. The scheduling model considers all the variables that relate to in-house delivery, such as available crews, methods of construction, sequence of work sites, and the time and cost of moving resources among sites. In addition, it incorporates a mechanism to examine the feasibility of replacing in-house resources by outsourcing to delegate execution risks, at minimum additional cost. Details of model development are discussed and an example application is presented to demonstrate the planning and control features of the proposed model. The model presents practitioners and researchers with a practical tool for realistic what-if assessment and greater level of control over the execution of infrastructure M/R plans.

Such problems have identifiable characteristics, including: (1) Problems frequently require simultaneous assessment of a large number of quantitative as well as qualitative factors that influence the solution; (2) traditional algorithmic and reasoning-intensive techniques are not adequate to model the problem; (3) solutions are devised in practice primarily based on analogy with previous cases coupled with a mixture of intuition and experience; and (4) domain knowledge is mostly implicit and very difficult to be extracted and described. For this class of problems, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are most suited for developing decision aids with analogy-based problem-solving capabilities. A methodology is presented and used to develop a practical model for markup estimation using knowledge acquired from contractors in Canada and the U.S. The model design, training, and testing are described along with the generalization improvements made using the genetic algorithms technique.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted. The findings reveal that most of the decisions in construction projects are based on their financial returns unless there is a special requirement to comply with Green Star or any other sustainable building rating system. Even though there is a trend towards environment-friendly construction, contractors are favourable towards methods involving financial incentives. Results also indicate that private developers are more price-driven compared with government clients. Findings reveal the necessity of enforcing legislation to improve waste management practices until such practices become culturally embedded in organizations across the supply chain. Similarly, end users' motivation towards waste management was also identified as a key to encouraging stakeholders of construction projects and improving their attitudes and behaviours towards waste management practices.

The advice of several organizations and researchers is summarized to describe expectations for ideal constructability. Actual current constructability practice, based on results and analysis of a Constructability State of Practice survey, is described. Approximately 100 owners, architects, engineers, consultants, contractors, and construction managers answered the survey's ten questions and provided written comments. The results provide a picture of current constructability practices in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry and progress in recent years. Major conclusions include: (1) constructability has gained acceptance throughout the industry; (2) constructability efforts are clearly beginning in early project phases; (3) a wide variety of constructability techniques and new technologies are being implemented; and (4) obstacles to improving constructability remain, but may be changing. Finally, recommendations are provided based on areas where constructability practice can still be improved. This report is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 16 risks were identified from the literature review and grouped into nine categories. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey with 95 professionals in China. The partial least square structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings The results suggested the risk categorization was confirmed, and that 15 hypothetical risk paths were statistically significant, which formed 13 chains of risk paths. Inadequate relevant knowledge and expertise was the primary root risk category of all the 13 chains of risk paths. Additionally, technological issues, poor information sharing and collaboration, and liability for data input had direct effect on the cost overrun with BIM, while all the other risks indirectly influence cost via these three risk categories. Research limitations/implications Most of the respondents were designers because few clients and contractors have adopted BIM. In addition, the impact and likelihood of risks were accessed by respondents' judgment based on their experience, which is a common problem of risk management research. As this study focuses on the Chinese architecture, engineering and construction industry, there would be geographical limitation on the findings. Practical implications This study provides practitioners with a clear understanding of the risks associated with BIM adoption and enables practitioners to take measures to mitigate the root risks and assure the potential benefits of BIM. Originality/value Although there have been studies on the risks associated with BIM adoption, most of them lacked empirical evidence and failed to examine the interactions between risks. This study is different from these prior studies, because it focuses on the interrelationships between risks and identifies the risk paths and root risks using the empirical data. Therefore, this study expands the literature relating to both BIM and risk management. Also, this study enables practitioners to take measures to mitigate the root risks and assure the potential benefits produced by BIM, thereby contributing to the practice.

This study presents an integrated fuzzy set theory and fuzzy Bayesian belief network model for a rational, realistic determination of contingency costs for infrastructure projects. The application of the model is demonstrated for real-world power plant projects in Bangladesh. The model has promising results for its ability to establish the amount of contingency costs with a maximum error of 20% between the contingency cost predicted with the model and the actual contingency cost. It has the potential to assist both the owner and contractor to set aside a realistic amount of contingency cost in the preliminary phase of a project. The approach is also equally useful for monitoring and controlling project risks, and dynamically updates the contingency cost amount during project execution.

FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						small; and medium-sized enterprises; mobile computing; mobile cloud computing; information technology for construction; construction site; ethnographic action research	BIM; ADOPTION; FLOW	Despite the increasing dissemination of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach, many firms are still far from BIM and are only starting to adopt information technologies. We conducted an ethnographic action research with an industrial partner that implements information technologies on its construction sites, with a strong preference for home-made applications. Results show that the development of such applications faces difficulties and that multiple iterations and versions are necessary before achieving the expected goals because the required competencies are lacking among internal development teams. Moreover, initial needs evolve considerably throughout the application's development and evaluation process. However, notwithstanding the difficulties encountered during the different application development phases, the industrial partner believes the decision to be worthwhile because of the desire to have internal control over the project data and the need to consider certain specificities related to business processes.

Exploring a shared comprehension between judicial approaches and scholar views pertaining to concurrent delays	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Causation; concurrent delays; dominant cause		The topicality of concurrent delays has been accentuated by the fact that contractors use it as a sword to claim extension of time while employers use it as a shield to refrain from paying prolongation costs. The law has been offering a series of differing solutions and scholars too have opposing views. The aim of this research is to gauge the level of unanimity between two perspectives if any and establish a shared comprehension via a comparative literature survey. A total of 36 prominent authorities and opinion of 36 scholars were closely examined to measure views held by judiciary and industry experts using dialogue mapping. The evidence indicates that there is a rife in perception. However, dominant cause approach has been found to be widely topical over a century. The results revealed 10 key attributes of court decisions and 10 shared conceptions among the scholars. The emerging trend across the judicial opinion is to give emphasis on the wordings of the contract.	[Jayalath, Chandana; Perera, B. A. K.

Canadian construction industry represents 30% of the total municipal solid waste deposited in landfills. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste has created negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts including contaminating ground water, emitting greenhouse gases, and adding more waste to scarce landfills. Literature is cited rework/waste generation due to ambiguity/errors in construction contract documents. Exculpatory clauses in contract documents are included in contractual agreements to prevent contractor claims, which often cause rework. After an extensive contract documents review, these clauses were categorized in to eight major areas. This paper (1) analyses expert opinions on pre-identified contractual clauses; and (2) introduces recommendations to minimize rework and waste in construction projects. It was found that the clauses related to quality, workmanship, and field quality control/inspection have the most potential to generate construction waste.

Construction delays are caused by many factors. The aim of this paper is to identify delay factors on construction projects and analyze these factors with the relative importance index method. For this purpose, 83 different delay factors were identified, categorized into nine major groups, and visualized by the Ishikawa (fishbone) diagram through detailed literature review and interviews with experts from the construction industry. The relative importances of these delay factors were quantified by the relative importance index method. The ranking of the factors and groups were demonstrated according to their importance level on delay. According to the case study results, the factors and groups contributing the most to delays (those needing attention) were discussed, and some recommendations were made to minimize and control delays in construction projects.

Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, New Jersey. South Carolina, and Washington State Departments of Transportation participated in this study. This study compares critical components of design-builder solicitation and selection. Design-builder selection methods are modeled and categorized into fixed-price, one-step, and two-step procedures. The states developed different procedures due to state procurement statutes, level of design at the request for proposal stage, project complexity, familiarity with the design-build process, and agency culture. Although four of the states used fixed-price or one-step methods to select design-builders on the cases studied, three have since adopted, or are seeking, legislation to adopt two step-methods due to their experiences on the cases presented. The use of design-build dictates a major cultural shift for all stakeholders in the delivery process. This paper offers guidance for other state transportation authorities, highway engineers, and contractors embarking on design-build.

Many owner and contractor companies understand this, however, they share the misconception that it is not economically feasible to spend the time or money necessary to adequately define the scope of work early in a project's life cycle. In other cases project participants are ignorant about the requirements for an adequately defined scope of work. A tool called the project definition rating index (PDRI) was created to address these problems. The PDRI is an easy-to-use, weighted checklist of 70 scope definition elements allowing the user to measure and manage the level of scope definition as project planning progresses. Results from 40 pilot projects will be presented showing that a specific PDRI point threshold provides some measure of confidence in project outcome. The implications of this tool in the project scope management process will be explored. Conclusions and recommendations about the PDRI will be made for project management professionals.

It is a complex production system characterized by product uniqueness and high product mix, which pose challenges to the analysis and improvement of this system. This research applies lean production principles and flow production to shop fabrication, and uses a simulation-based approach as a tool to facilitate its implementation. The work described in the paper is based on a real case study undertaken with an Edmonton-based industrial construction contractor. The traditional batch-and-queue fabrication system and the new cell-based work flow fabrication systems were compared and analyzed. Simulation models were built to experiment with the old and new production systems and quantitatively test the effects of lean principles on the performance of the systems. The developed simulation-based approach proves a practical and more powerful tool than the value stream map for modeling and for quantitatively evaluating the performance of a complex and dynamic spool fabrication shop.

However, the sheer volume of images and the difficulties in accurately and manually indexing them have generated a pressing need for methods that can index and retrieve images with minimal or no user intervention. This paper reports recent developments from research efforts in the indexing and retrieval of construction site images in architecture, engineering, construction, and facilities management image database systems. The limitations and benefits of the existing methodologies will be presented, as well as an explanation of the reasons for the development of a novel image retrieval approach that not only can recognize construction materials within the image content in order to index images, but also can be compatible with existing retrieval methods, enabling enhanced results.

The aim of this paper is to present a decision support tool so that bid mark-up values may be estimated in a more systematic way. For this purpose, various factors that may affect the level of risk, opportunity and competition in a project option have been identified. Using the 95 cases obtained from the Turkish contractors working in international markets, a case-based reasoning model (CBR) has been developed to estimate the risk, opportunity and competition ratings. These ratings are further converted to risk and profit mark-up values by using linear utility functions constructed according to the boundary values which were identified by the respondents considering worst, average and best scenarios. The applicability of the model has been demonstrated on a real case study. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To satisfy the foregoing objective, the Department of Rapid Transit System (DORTS) set the following criteria for tendering contracts. Civil works that did not require a high level of technology were channeled to domestic firms. More complex projects were assigned to private and government-owned companies that had accumulated a higher level of expertise because of joint ventures and their active involvement in international projects during the past three decades. The most technically challenging projects are given to international consortia in the form of either joint ventures or technical collaboration agreements with domestic companies. This paper discusses the goals of DORTS during the past several years as they relate to promoting (1) increased domestic input, (2) technology transfer, and (3) a higher level of achievement.

J	Lee, HY				Lee, Hsin-Yun			Renovation scheduling to minimize user impact of a building that remains in operation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ant colony optimization; Simulation; Scheduling; Renovation; Pedestrians	OPTIMIZATION; COLONY; PROJECTS; GA	When renovating a building that remains in operation, the closure of some areas is inevitable. If a corridor needs to be closed off, the accessibility of rooms may be affected. To minimize the numbers of rooms that need to be closed, contractors usually construct temporary passageways. Because temporary passageways are narrow, they often have a user impact, including time delay. This impact needs to be quantified and improved through work zone scheduling. This paper proposed an integrated model that calculates the amount of pedestrian time delay through simulation and searches for the near-optimal schedule using ant colony optimization. The model is applied to the scheduling of a floor tile renovation project of a building that remains in operation. The finding indicates that the model reduces the pedestrian time delay to a much greater extent compared to the schedule proposed by human planners based on the location sequence of work zones.

J	Pulaski, MH; Horman, MJ				Pulaski, MH; Horman, MJ			Organizing constructability knowledge for design	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTIBILITY	Construction contractors have significant constructability expertise to contribute to the design process of projects. To utilize this expertise most effectively, the right information must be made available to the design team at the proper point in time and at the appropriate level of detail. Current methods for utilizing construction knowledge in design have made significant advances to improving projects. However, they are typically rudimentary: unstructured, not very efficient, and rely heavily on reviews. Organizing constructability information according to its use in the design process will allow project teams to take the best advantage of the construction expertise. This paper introduces a model for organizing constructability information based on timing and levels of detail. The model differs from current approaches because of this focus. How the model was developed is described. It is tested on six case study projects to assess applicability on different projects. An illustrative example is provided using a detailed case study of the Pentagon renovation project to show how the model can be used as a metric to guide constructability input during design.

Relevant studies have addressed the frequency and information quality of communication, but their combination and contribution to the effectiveness of coordination methods need to be examined. This paper explores two variables that affect coordination effectiveness: quantity and quality, as well as their relationships with coordination effectiveness and project performance. Eight coordination methods used on construction projects were examined and a questionnaire was designed accordingly. Then 26 contractor engineers at three organizational levels working on seven large projects were surveyed and interviewed to collect information about their coordination methods. The analysis results indicated that coordination quality is more related to coordination effectiveness (and indirectly to project performance) than coordination quantity. Projects that performed well had better coordination effectiveness than projects that performed poorly. It was also found that engineers could spend less time on written correspondence, plans and procedures, and reports without reducing their effectiveness.

Portfolio selection has been the most interesting area in the last two decades in management research but there is poor investigation in the construction industry. Taking into account the risk, which is inherent in the construction industry and especially in the project selection phase is inevitable. This paper intends to propose a model for project selection and developing two main concepts including company portfolio and risk. The main innovation of this paper is presenting a new framework, which attempts to optimize project selection based on the endurable risk level of a company with regard to the existing portfolio. Considering the user-friendly characteristic of the model, this paper has applied the fuzzy multi criteria decision-making approaches. Finally, the model is implemented in a real case study.

This paper uses five systems that make up earthmoving equipment (implement, traction, structure, power train, and control and information) to analyze this technical advancement. The analysis of each system includes its purpose and operation, technical limitations and key technologies, and a chronology of major, advancements. The findings are the benefits of using the five systems for analysis of technical change, the sequence and timing of key technical advances in each system, the fundamental technologies that fostered these advances, and the integration of systems into balanced. equipment designs. This increased understanding from this analysis results in significant implications and relevance for civil designers working on integrated teams, contractors selecting methods and planning operations, equipment suppliers developing new machines construction educators teaching the technical basics of equipment, and researchers developing advanced modeling and simulation tools.

A literature search and a survey of 34 large companies (owners and contractors) resulted in more than 600 specific quality-measurement examples. A quality-measurements database was developed that included 62 industry ''best practices.'' A model, called the quality-measurement matrix, was developed to catalog examples in the database by the project phases of preplanning, design, procurement, construction, start-up, operation, and final disposition as well as the total-quality-management elements: customer focus, leadership, delivery, and employee empowerment. For each example in the database, the matrix shows the location and type of measurement, along with a brief description of how the measurement is used. These best practices can be used by project teams in defining, or refining, their current measurement needs and developing quality measurements for their own EPC projects. An example of the use of the quality-measurement matrix is provided.

Time-Series Analysis for Forecasting Asphalt-Cement Price	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Variations in the price of asphalt cement have become a serious challenge for Departments of Transportation in proper budgeting of transportation projects. This issue has also pressed contractors in their efforts to develop appropriate cost estimates for transportation projects. Although the price of asphalt cement increases over the long term, it is subject to significant short-term variations. In the current state of practice, the following approaches have been utilized to predict the future price of asphalt cement: (1) adding a fixed percentage of the estimated total cost of asphalt cement to escalate the price of asphalt cement (i.e., adding a risk premium); (2) inflating the estimated cost of asphalt cement to the expected midpoint of construction period to estimate the total cost of asphalt cement; and (3) conducting Monte Carlo simulation analysis to characterize uncertainty about future price of asphalt cement. None of these methods consider autocorrelation in the historical records of asphalt cement price. This paper departs from the existing body of knowledge and challenges the lack of proper treatment of short-term variations in predicting asphalt cement price. The research objectives of this paper are to: (1) identify and characterize variations observed in actual prices of asphalt cement over time; and (2) utilize this knowledge to create time-series forecasting models for asphalt cement price and examine whether and how time-series forecasting models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy compared to the existing approaches. Based on the identified time series characteristics, four univariate time series forecasting models, namely Holt Exponential Smoothing (ES), Holt-Winters ES, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and seasonal ARIMA, are created to take into account the short-term variation of asphalt cement price in forecasting its future values. The forecasting results show that all four time series models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy than the existing methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation. Among the four models, the ARIMA and Holt ES models are the most accurate forecasting models with errors less than 2%. This study can help both owners and contractors improve budgeting process, prepare more-accurate cost estimates, and reduce the risk of asphalt cement price variations in transportation projects.

The present study investigates the professional development of the BIM actor and how this role is perceived by BIM actors and non-BIM actors in Sweden. The study uses a questionnaire (N = 342) in eight companies, comprised of contractors, architects, and clients. The BIM and non-BIM actors were compared on similarities and significant differences in their characteristics, tasks, experience, education, and barriers to the role's development. We found that BIM actors perceive their role, characteristics, tasks and education as coordinating and driving change. However, non-BIM actors perceive the BIM actor role as focusing more on technical skills than on softer skills. The perceptions of the two groups indicate possible tensions toward the future professional development of the BIM actor role.

J	Pinto, JK				Pinto, Jeffrey K.			Project management, governance, and the normalization of deviance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Governance; Planning errors; Organizational learning; Deviance	GLOBAL PROJECTS; ANATOMY	The term "normalization of deviance" was coined by sociologist Diane Vaughan (1996) based on her study of the culture of NASA prior to the Challenger disaster. This concept continues to reverberate within organizational settings, as companies grapple with employee behaviors that are often counter-productive to achieving organizational ends but are often so hidden or "normal" that organizational actors are either unaware of them or assume that this behavior is a natural part of the project management process. Using results from interviews with 21 project managers, we will consider how normalization of deviance affects project management practices in the areas of 1) project proposals and strategic misrepresentation, 2) client/contractor relationships, and 3) planning and scheduling dynamics. Finally, the paper examines the role of organizational learning and corporate governance in identifying and subsequently, minimizing the negative impact of normalization of deviance behaviors on project-based work.

In this paper, a system dynamics-based approach is introduced for SC selection process which is modeled considering a complex inter-related structure of different factors influencing the SCs' work quality (SWQ). To this aim, cause and effect feedback loops are used to build a qualitative model (causal loop diagram). Afterward, the relationships among various factors are determined by using the expert's judgment to construct the quantitative model (stock and flows diagram). Finally, the model is evaluated by applying a real construction project and also evaluated by carrying sensitivity analyses on different factors. The developed model is expected to help the general contractor in making a fair judgment to assess the SWQ during the execution time of activities as well as before the beginning of the work packages.

The financing cost can be minimized if the financing decision considers different financing alternatives such as short-term and long-term loans and lines of credit. Financing optimization should be integrated into time-cost tradeoff analysis to minimize total cost and maximize profit. This study proposes an integrated model that performs time-cost tradeoff analysis and financing optimization. A hybrid GALP algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization by combining genetic algorithms (GA) and linear programming (LP). The proposed model is tested using small and large networks: (1) to prove that optimal results are obtained in terms of the financing cost and profit if the proposed integrated model is used, (2) to validate the performance and structure of each model, and (3) to confirm the practicality of the proposed models in large networks.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the applicability of kitting by focusing on its impact on work performance and requirements for management. The authors conducted a case study to analyze a kitting intervention in a general contractor and logistics company, comparing four renovation projects in the indoor construction phase with and without kitting. Findings indicate that kitting can stabilize assembly work and increase workplace utilization and on-site labor productivity. However, it requires centralized material logistics, smooth information flow between operations, and subcontractors' commitment to the production model. This research contributes to the connection between material logistics and work performance, suggesting that kitting should be linked to a redesign of the general production model toward a synchronized takt-based production system. The research is limited to four projects.

Determining strategic clusters and performance of construction organizations in South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competitive advantage; cluster analysis; organizational performance and Strategic clusters	SATISFACTION; ENVIRONMENT	This study examines the linkage of strategic clusters and performance of South African organizations, using Porter's generic strategies to determine whether differences exist between clustered organizations in terms of performance, characteristics, resources and capability and how the companies achieve strategic fit within different environments. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from construction companies registered in Grades 7-9 on the cidb contractor register. The study results show that four clusters of construction organizations exist in the South African construction industry; that the four strategic groups exhibited the characteristics of Miles and Snow's Taxonomy of Strategies; and that human resource capabilities were significantly different across the groups. However, the results show no statistically significant differences among the clusters in terms of performance. It emerged that all the respondents' organizations placed a high premium on employee satisfaction as a measure of achieving success. This study thus proved empirically that different clusters of organizations exist within the South African construction industry, and that they exhibit the characteristics of defenders, prospectors, analysers and reactors.

J	Yang, F; Li, XD; Zhu, YM; Li, YL; Wu, CL				Yang, Fan; Li, Xiaodong; Zhu, Yimin; Li, Yulong; Wu, Chunlin			Job burnout of construction project managers in China: A cross-sectional analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Job burnout; Construction project manager; Construction company; Structural equation model	WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT; STRESS; DEMANDS; AGE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTORS; PRECURSORS; SUPPORT; HEALTH; STRAIN	Construction project managers (CPMs) of contractors encounter a great deal of stress. The authors used job burnout as the core indicator of CPMs' chronic psychological stress. An occupation-oriented job burnout scale was developed based on MBI-GS. Then, a structural equation model was developed to investigate the cause and effect of job burnout among CPMs. The results show that CPMs suffer from a high level of job burnout, of which the major symptom is physical and mental fatigue. The highest level of job burnout occurs when CPMs reach their mid forties, which highlighting their midlife professional crisis. Job stress significantly aggravates CPMs' job burnout, and rather than traditional project objective management, stakeholder relationship management is the main stressor. Direct and indirect mitigating effects on CPMs' job burnout are also obtained from the management system of construction companies. Additionally, job burnout ultimately causes poor health conditions among CPMs and increases their turnover intention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The mediating role of contracts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project; Inter-organizational relationship; Prior interactions; Contract; Cooperative behavior	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; FORMAL CONTRACTS; TRUST; COORDINATION; OPPORTUNISM; INTEGRATION; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; SHADOW; TASK	There has long been inconsistence on the relationship among prior interactions, contracts and cooperative behavior. This study aims to examine how prior interactions affect cooperative behavior, including the effects of prior interactions on cooperative behavior and the mediating role of the contract. We classify cooperative behavior as in-role and extra-role behavior, and contract as a three-dimensional construct, including control, coordination and adaptation. Collecting data from 200 contractors in Chinese construction industry, the empirical results demonstrate the significance of the effect of prior interactions, the relationship between contract and cooperative behavior, and the mediating role of contractual coordination. According to our result, increasing contractual coordination emerges from prior interactions, while contractual control and adaptation are not related to these repeated collaborations. The findings reflect the interconnectedness of real-life projects and provide a nuanced explanation to the complex relationships among prior interactions, contracts and cooperative behavior.

To achieve this goal, 168 observable variables and 16 latent dimensions that affect safety performance of construction sites were collected through extensive literature reviews, expert opinions, and face-to-face interviews. A questionnaire form was developed and administered to construction professionals as a data-collection tool about the observable variables and latent dimensions. A total of 180 responses were achieved through data collection. Relationships between observable variables and latent dimensions of the safety performance of construction sites were studied and a multidimensional safety performance model was proposed. The proposed multidimensional safety performance model was supported by structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Moreover, 16 latent dimensions with respect to their relative weights and recommendations for construction safety professionals are provided to improve the safety performance of construction sites.

Therefore, the current study attempts to identify a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the success of construction megaprojects. By conducting a questionnaire survey, research data were collected, which contained 129 valid replies from three groups of respondents from the Chinese construction industries: owners, contractors, and designers. IBM SPSS version 25 software was employed to analyze five underlying dimensions for CMS: (1) project efficiency, (2) key stakeholders' satisfaction, (3) organizational strategic goals, (4) innovation and development of the construction industry, and (5) comprehensive impact on society. Afterward, the fuzzy set theory was utilized to evaluate the KPIs' effectiveness. The results of this research can contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of megaproject management and serve as a theoretical foundation for the enhanced performance assessment of construction megaprojects and related management success.

The impact of prevailing wages on the cost of construction projects to the taxpayers is an issue that continues to be debated at the state and federal levels. In this paper, data from recent school construction projects in Ohio are used to examine the impact of federal prevailing wage standards on construction costs and bid competition. Results from the examination of all bids and winning bids indicate that prevailing wage requirements do not have a statistically significant effect on building costs or the level of bid competition. Results from endogenous treatment estimators provide additional evidence that the prevailing wage policy does not increase costs or limit competition. Additional analysis of all bids indicates that the cost-reducing effect of increased competition is stronger on projects covered by the prevailing wage policy.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) partnering framework for public construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Public procurement; Building Information Modeling (BIM); BIM adoption; BIM partnering		Organizational and people centered issues pose the greatest challenge for Building Information Modeling (BIM) implementation. Studies showed that BIM implementation is still a challenge for the North American construction industry. The Canadian construction industry, in contrast, is well behind that of the U.S. in its BIM adoption rate. Maturity and adoption of BIM depends mainly on the client or the owner in construction projects. Public sector clients often think that the market is not ready for BIM and are afraid to increase project costs by limiting competition. Moreover, if the contractor is not integrated in the project in the design phase, BIM has limited power. This paper proposes a 'BIM partnering' based public procurement framework to ensure 'best value' in construction projects. The case study presented in the paper proved the feasibility of proposed BIM based procurement in publicly-funded construction projects. The suggested contractual arrangement for the project resulted in improved productivity, better coordination, and reduced error, and rework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Especially in urban areas, lane closures as a result of work zones have a considerable impact on local traffic. However, for a construction project that consists of several work zones and several work crews, the traffic impact may be improved by appropriate scheduling. Therefore, this paper proposed a scheduling model based on the route-changing behavior of road users. The proposed model calculates the traffic delay of vehicles by microscopic simulation, and applies team ant colony optimization to search for a near-optimal schedule. The project planner then ensures that the contractor executes the activities according to the near-optimal schedule. The proposed model is applied to schedule a sewer system construction project in a city. The results of our study indicate that with our proposed model the total traffic delay is reduced by 11.1% when compared with a schedule proposed by the project planner. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Delivery and performance of a low-energy ventilation and cooling strategy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; commissioning; feedback; monitoring; natural ventilation; passive downdraught cooling; procurement; project delivery; sustainable construction	ASSESSING BUILDING PERFORMANCE; FEEDBACK; DESIGN	There is an appreciable literature exploring environmental design strategies for low-energy, naturally ventilated and cooled buildings, but less is recorded about their implementation in practice. The commissioning and monitoring of the passive downdraught-cooled UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), London, is reported. The building contractor, his suppliers and subcontractors experienced considerable difficulty in achieving defect-free environmental systems, adversely affecting the practical delivery of the strategy for an extended period. The design team was closely involved throughout this period to assist in establishing a stable controls regime reflecting the design intent. However, this intent was itself modified by feedback provided by monitoring. The widely used professional appointment and construction contracts employed for this project do not envisage the need for such extensive commissioning. However, it is argued here that the new generation of advanced naturally ventilated buildings, much encouraged by policy-makers worldwide, will require just such a comprehensive commissioning exercise to deliver anything like their full designed performance.

Based on previous studies, a questionnaire survey was developed to investigate the relationships between reported risk and success factors, and the performance of ventures. Through structural equation modeling, the paper empirically examines the effect of key processes such as partner selection, venture formation, and operation on venture performance. The results provide evidence that local partner attributes influence venture formation which, in turn, is strongly and positively related to its operation. These results also suggest that the negative impact of host government-related risks on venture formation is direct, while their impact on venture performance is indirect, through creating a "less certain" operating environment. Project-related risks appear to have strong and negative dual "direct and indirect" effects on venture performance. Based on these empirical results, the paper advocates that selecting a suitable complementary local partner and adopting a proactive risk management strategy are vital antecedents to successful venture performance.

Drawing upon transaction cost theory, this study investigated the effects of two types of ties (relational ties and structural ties) on relationship quality. Data from 212 megaproject practitioners were analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The SEM revealed the indirect effects of two types of ties on relationship quality and the mediating role of contractual functions in the management of relationships. Through the lens of symbiosis, the fsQCA revealed three types of configurations that were sufficient for shaping relationship quality. This study provides a systematic and nuanced distinction between multi-dimensional strengths of ties and contractual functions in project management. Such knowledge would allow megaproject managers to develop effective interventions aimed at enhancing relationship quality.

J	Siew, RYJ				Siew, Renard Y. J.			Health and safety communication strategy in a Malaysian construction company: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						health and safety (H&S); communication; strategy; construction; company	ACCIDENTS; INDUSTRY	The accident statistics for the construction industry remain high when compared to other industries. This is not surprising given the fragmented nature of this industry and the involvement of multiple stakeholders in a project. Poor communication on health and safety (H&S) related issues has been identified as a major cause of incidents/accidents and is recognized as a key challenge to construction practitioners. Such communication typically gets diluted as it goes down the chain of command from top management to the project team. The aim of this paper is to report on the actual implementation and administration of H&S communication of a Malaysian construction company targeted at both internal and external stakeholders. The intrinsic case study approach is adopted to provide an in-depth analysis of the H&S communication model. The types of H&S communication, challenges and communication channels of this construction company is discussed. This paper will be of interest to construction practitioners including project managers, contractors, subcontractors and property developers.

A questionnaire survey was conducted and 138 responses were received from both academia and industry. The exploratory factor analysis was then adopted to uncover the relationships among these variables. The results showed that three exposure factors (i.e., attribute-based exposure, strategy-based exposure, and transaction-based exposure) and three capacity factors (i.e., core competitive capacity, relative bargain capacity, and integrate adaptive capacity) were believed to be the significant underlying factors for the project system vulnerability to political risks. Also, case studies were conducted and the results indicated that the emergent framework was suitable and tractable for application in the future. This study provides a method for measuring the project system vulnerability to political risks; thus, international construction enterprises can decrease their risk exposure and enhance their capacity for dealing with political risks in international construction projects.

Various modeling and prediction techniques for construction prices have been studied, but few researchers have considered the impact of global economic events and the seasonality of construction prices. In this study, global economic events and construction price seasonality as intervention dummies, together with a group of macroeconomic variables, are considered in a vector error correction (VEC) model to accurately predict the movement of construction prices. The proposed prediction model is verified against a series of diagnostic statistical criteria and compared with conventional VEC, multiregression, and Box-Jenkins approaches. Results indicate that the VEC model with dummy variables is more effective and reliable for forecasting construction prices. The VEC model with dummy variables can also assist construction economists to analyze the effect of special events and factors on the construction industry.

Although these new tools (such as iso-Score Curve Graphs, Scoring Probability Graphs, and Position Probability Graphs) are designed for bidders in capped tendering (tenders with an upper price limit), some of their principles can also be applied by a Contracting Authority to detect which bidders do not follow a standard pattern, that is, their bids are extremely high or low. Since a collusive bid generally needs to be sufficiently high or low to make an impact on the bid distribution, any person in charge of supervising capped tenders can be alerted to any bidder that might be involved in a cartel after identifying the same abnormal behavior in a series of tenders through simple calculations and a new type of graph.

As the profit values of the individual projects are maximized should their cash demands be fulfilled, the profit values of the individual projects constitute a set of multiple conflicting objectives. A Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) employing a logic-preserving crossover and mutation operators is developed to devise Pareto-optimal finance-based schedules of multiple projects. The Pareto-optimal solutions allow the decision makers select the best solution based on their own preference. The developed SPEA reproduced the same results of an existing GAs-based multi objective technique in the literature. The proposed approach has been developed and implemented on multiple projects of different sizes. The results proved the effectiveness of the SPEA to solve finance-based scheduling problems of multiple projects considering the conflict in their profit realization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Projects that require similar types of resources can generally be considered compatible or similar and thus are prime candidates for simultaneous delivery through project bundling as well as other construction management applications. Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted, robust, and quantitative measure of project similarity. This paper presents a methodology to quantify the similarity between different project types based on their constituent pay items. Two project types are considered similar if they have in common a large percentage of pay items. Cluster analysis was first carried out to evaluate how different project types can be clustered into different groups. Several approaches were then proposed for quantifying the similarity between any two project types and the average similarity among multiple bundled projects. The paper's framework can be used by highway agencies to serve as a guide in making or evaluating construction management-related decisions in various contexts including project bundling.

This paper presents the results of a questionnaire conducted to identify and evaluate the relative importance of the significant factors contributing to the Gas-Oil construction industry of Iran as a case study for developing countries. The survey respondents included project owners, contractors and consultants involved in Iranian Gas-Oil construction projects. The results of the survey revealed that the main causes of cost overrun in this industry include inaccurate cost estimations, improper planning, frequent design changes, inadequate labour/skill availability, inflation of costs of machinery, labour, raw material and transportation prices. The first three factors are the project consultants' responsibility and the appointment of qualified consultants and personnel training are strongly recommended to alleviate cost overrun. The paper also reviews and compares findings of a set of similar researches in a number of developing countries.

This research studies on the probability and impacts of asymmetric information phenomena systematically and focuses on information asymmetry among owners, contractors and supervisors. This is conducted by inviting construction industry participants in China to evaluate asymmetric information phenomena in project management by questionnaires. The evaluation includes two stages, i.e. bidding stage and performance stage. Risk significant index is used to identify the key asymmetric information phenomena. "Owner's financial condition" and "Owner's ability to pay progress payments" gains the highest score in these two stages respectively. The research helps to distinguish the primary and secondary order of asymmetric information phenomena and improves the efficiency of project management. Principal participants may use it as a reference to prevent and reduce the uncertainty and risk in project management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to develop a new MFDS model, which attempts to provide a more accurate way to support financial decision-makers in Chinese state-owned construction firms. Owing to the slow progress of passing the construction regulations, coupled with the inherited ownership problems in the Chinese booming construction industry, it is logical for Chinese project managers to make financial decisions with the consideration of the four objective functions (profit margin, risk factors, government relationship and market share), which are realistic representations of the present situation of Chinese construction industry. The proposed MFDS model is a practical method to support financial decision-making. For the model's computational performance, Module 3 (stochastic universal sampling selection, adaptive crossover and adaptive Mutation of Genetic Algorithm) is more superior. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this research is to identify and prioritise construction materials management practices that have the potential to enhance labour productivity in multi-storey building projects. The study adopted two-phase mixed-methods research design and it was conducted in the Victoria State, Australia. Fifty-eight project managers, contract administrators and project coordinators were involved in the survey. During Phase I, qualitative data was collected from 19 experts using interviews and the construction materials management practices that could increase labour productivity in multi-storey building projects were identified. In Phase-II, quantitative data was collected from 39 contractors involved in the delivery of multi-storey building projects by using questionnaires. The data was analysed to prioritise the materials management practices identified in Phase-I. Long-lead materials identification (RII = 0.92), procurement plans for materials (RII = 0.85) and materials delivery schedule (RII = 0.75) are found to be the three most important construction materials management practices.

Occupational safety and health performance in the Pakistani construction industry: stakeholders' perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						OSH factors; OSH practices; performance indices; Kruskal-Wallis test; stakeholders; construction industry	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE	Lack of compliance with Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) has resulted in a relatively higher construction accident rate in developing countries such as Pakistan. This study attempts to unveil the aspects of OSH that are ignored and discern the differences in the perceptions of key construction stakeholders. Data collected from 195 respondents were analysed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The results indicate that OSH training is the most neglected factor, followed by non-inclusion of safety in contract documents and workers' non-involvement. Stakeholders have dissimilar perception about three OSH factors, including management commitment to OSH, safety rules/procedures and policies, and OSH training. Regulatory authority is suggested to launch OSH awareness campaigns, announce safety incentives, institutionalize the OSH certification system, and incorporate safety credit points in contractors' registration process. Though this study pertains to Pakistan, the methodology and the recommendations can be generalized for other developing countries with a similar work environment.	[Zahoor, Hafiz; Chan, Albert P.

However, issues of adoption and implementation persist, particularly for on-site use of BIM tools in the construction phase. We describe an empirical case-study of the implementation of an innovative 'Site BIM' system on a major hospital construction project. The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that 'Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping. Technical IT skills were adopted into the construction project through personal relationships and arrangements rather than formal processes. Implementation was driven by construction project employees rather than controlled centrally by the corporate IT function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Practically, there are a huge number of bridges that need frequent inspection, which makes planning for this process crucial. In this regard, a bridge deck inspection planning (BDIP) model was developed to manage the inspection process of the concrete bridge deck. This model integrates agent-based and discrete event simulation approaches to mimic the sub-processes involved in the inspection using non-destructive technologies. This paper discusses the details and the adopted procedures to build this model starting from real system analysis to model verification, implementation, and validation. Verification and validation of the model demonstrate its ability to accurately estimate inspection duration and cost. The developed model can assist bridge authorities and contractors in planning this process, measure the traffic disorder due to inspection activities, and compare different scenarios for conducting inspection.

The greatest contribution of this paper is a novel model for e-negotiation using an adaptation of the FITradeoff method for group decision and negotiation with an unbiased mediator agent so as to reduce the number of interactions needed to reach an agreement. The elicitation process included within the negotiation model sees to it that the cognitive effort that the negotiators need to make is reduced because partial information and strict preference statements can be used. The mediator agent facilitates the negotiation phase, thereby allowing a general contractor to compare subcontractors and to decide if there should be a 1-1 or 1-N negotiation process. Moreover, this agent conducts the negotiation process and presents the best and suboptimal agreements to the negotiators. A prototype was built to test the model using data from a real construction project.

However, construction practitioners cannot count on sound methods for mediating when weather-related claims arise, nor harnessing the influence of weather variability in construction projects. Building on the few most recent quantitative studies identifying those key weather agents and levels of intensity that affect some standard building construction activities, a new stochastic model that processes and replicates the spatio-temporal variability of combined weather variables is proposed. This model can help anticipate weather-related project duration variability; improving construction productivity by selecting the best project start date; and objectively evaluating weather related claims. A two-building construction case study using different Spanish locations is used to demonstrate the model. The results showed that ignoring the influence of weather can lead to an extension of 5-20% longer project duration compared to planned.

The expert system is based on Mamdani fuzzy model. The purpose of the system is to improve the indices of assessing a construction enterprise by raising the level of partnering relations with other transactors in industry. The system indicates a recommendation supporting a decision-making system of any given construction enterprise and stating whether relations are to be preserved, changed or changed immediately to each of the fourteen relation parameters and for each of four transactors of enterprise's microenvironment. For every relation parameter, this decision is taken by the expert system with reference to the significance and assessment of this parameter identifying its influence on the success of a construction enterprise. Another task of the expert system is to select one parameter for each transactor which needs to be changed first. The process of choosing the parameter to be changed first for a given transactor is based on all input parameters.

This study aims to redesign a virtual organisational structure for such projects. Two-pronged action research was adopted. The survey was to redesign the virtual organisational structure. The case study was to validate the virtual structure redesigned and conduct an in-depth description of the application of the virtual organisational structure on real prefabricated projects. The result shows that the virtual organization's core actors are client, general contractor, designer, and PC manufactory. The chain of command starts with the client, and ends with peripheral actors such as subcontractor elements. Meanwhile, prefabricated buildings that adopted the virtual organisational structure proposed are better managed and have better project performance than those that did not. This study contributes to the knowledge of the management for prefabricated buildings by showing that a virtual organisational structure needs to incorporate stakeholder salience attributes and stakeholder relationships.

Introducing sustainability principles into the procurement of construction works - case of Indonesian developers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction work; developer; procurement; sustainability; principles	CONTRACTORS	The construction sector plays an important role in sustainable development, for example, through sustainable procurement of construction works. However, procuring for construction works in such a way has been particularly challenging. The objective of this research was to identify the owners' potential of applying sustainability principles into their construction works procurement. Data were collected using questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and additional review on the relevant documents, involving 6 public and 14 private developers of green buildings, located in major provinces. The scope of study focused on: (i) technical specifications, (ii) evaluation criteria and (iii) procurement processes conducted by the organization. The assessment of potential implementation was mainly based on the frequency of responses of 'Awareness', 'Willingness' and 'Implementation'. Further analysis identified the so-called Degree of Unwillingness and the Degree of Difficulty. Results show that the developers were more ready to implement sustainability into the technical specifications. Meanwhile, among the two other aspects of procurements, the most challenging issue was to introduce sustainable principles into the processes conducted within the procurement organization.

A systematic literature review is conducted on the current construction literature involving both RM and SM, through which we identify four linkage modes between risk and stakeholder management. We further suggest future directions that enable integrating risk and stakeholder management to benefit the management process and/or management outcome of RM and SM. These linkages and directions shed light on enhancing the effectiveness of RM and SM through new ways of thinking about, analyzing, and then managing risks and stakeholders in a holistic and integrated way, but not the traditional endeavor in individual areas. Integrating risk and stakeholder management is challenging, but can be a novel way for improving project performance for which this research conceptually justifies its feasibility and benefits, which merits further study.

This research presents an integrated fuzzy-system dynamics approach for quantitative risk allocation. All the factors affecting the risk allocation process are modeled using system dynamics approach. Fuzzy logic is integrated into system dynamics modeling structure to account for the existing uncertainties. The values of different factors that have an uncertain nature are determined by fuzzy numbers. The application of Zadeh's extension principle and interval arithmetic is proposed for the system dynamics to enable the system outcomes to be presented considering uncertainties in the input variables. Using the proposed integrated fuzzy-SD model, the project cost is simulated at different percentages of risk allocation. The optimum percentage of risk allocation is determined as a point in which the project cost is minimized. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by employing the method in a tunneling project. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Collaborative working (CW), as a new term and especially as a working model, is emerging for improving performance and enhancing competitiveness by responding to the changing environment in construction. This research presents the definition of CW underpinned by the principle of collaboration. Through a thorough literature review of selected papers from the well-known academic journals in construction management, the business environment and human behavior are identified as two key areas which impact the performance of CW in construction projects. Critical reviews on these areas are presented by focusing on different subcategories in each area to investigate the state of the art and trends of CW in construction projects. Some limits of research and practice on CW in construction projects are discussed and future research directions are recommended.

J	Wang, WC; Yang, JB				Wang, WC; Yang, JB			Applications of electronically facilitated bidding model to preventing construction disputes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						project procurement; bidding; quantity; unit price; equal; cost items; construction dispute		When a lump-sum public construction project is implemented, disputes often arise concerning issues around the accuracy of contracted quantities, the acceptability of unit prices of cost items, and whether an "equal (or equivalenty)" for a product (equipment or material) can be used. In Taiwan, contracted quantities and unit prices are primarily based on owner's estimations, and the trademarks of a product specified in a tendering documentation are only for reference. A contractor has to struggle for profit when the amount of work completed differs from the contracted amount, when change orders are priced according to the owner's estimates, and when inexpensive equals may be used. This work comprehensively elaborates the background of the current practice, and presents experience of applying an electronically facilitated bidding model to evaluating the bidder's submitted quantities, unit prices and equals in several practical projects in Taiwan. Results of this study indicate that the aforementioned construction disputes can be prevented or at least mitigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

No evidence has been found in the literature of research about transaction costs in industrial construction engineering projects. The objective of this paper is to identify ex-ante and ex-post transaction costs in industrial engineering construction projects. To accomplish this, empirical research with 4 case studies was conducted with a large engineering firm in Brazil. This research not only identified transaction costs already found by others, dividing them into ex-ante and ex-post, but also identified that travel, RFP clarification, support to strategic decisions of the owner and knowledge transfer are transaction costs not previously identified in the researched literature but that are very relevant to the respective subject. 'therefore, this research confirms that transaction costs should be considered ex-ante and ex-post by owners and contractors in industrial construction engineering projects and enlightens academics and practitioners on ways to achieve the reduction of such costs.

The design and production process is complex, dynamic, interconnected and dependent upon greater information mobility, requiring seamless exchange of data and information in real time. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, specialty contractors, can utilise cost-effective collaboration technologies, such as cloud computing using software as a service, to help in the effective transfer of information and data. The system dynamics (SD) approach gives a better understanding of the dynamics of complex systems. SD methodology is used as a modelling and analysis tool to understand and identify the key drivers in the absorption of cloud computing for SMEs. The aim is to determine how the use of SD can improve the management of complexity of information flow, leading to improved performance for SMEs. SD is shown to be a viable tool to manage information complexity using cloud computing for performance improvement in construction.
