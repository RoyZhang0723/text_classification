J	Hoxie, C; Berkebile, R; Todd, JA				Hoxie, Christina; Berkebile, Robert; Todd, Joel Ann			Stimulating regenerative development through community dialogue	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						built environment; community dialogue; community engagement; place; planning; regenerative design; stakeholders; sustainability		Definitions of regenerative design, regenerative development and regenerative thinking differ, but community engagement is an integral component of these definitions. A critical aspect in regenerative approaches is the focus on the uniqueness of 'place' and the creation of a story of the place, with the local community playing a crucial role in developing this story. Practitioners have found that engaging communities in these efforts requires a different approach, one that is designed to elicit and clarify aspirations and values and which enables the community to recognize and feel its connections to the natural systems of which they are a part. An approach to community engagement is presented that has been developed, tested and refined over the past two decades. Its basis is founded on establishing honest, deep and ongoing dialogue within the community and between the community and the project team. As the case studies presented in this paper indicate, one of the most important benefits of a process of dialogue is a community that has developed shared goals and leaders to ensure progress toward those goals over time. Wider implications for design and planning professionals include the potential to redefine their processes and services, examining responsibilities to the local community and working with the research community to develop a wider evidence base.

In recent years, the study of community resilience is becoming popular among scholars because of its perspective on disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, we apply database retrieval to untangle community resilience-related papers from multiple directions. We analyze the connotation, attribute, and composition of community, resilience, and community resilience comprehensively by summarizing important issues and research progress in community resilience. Challenges and shortcomings faced by community resilience development are also determined. Moreover, we put forward the research directions that future research can focus on. Through literature review, current research on community resilience focuses on the following aspects: "infrastructure construction," "crowd in the community," "economic resilience," "social capital," and "measurement of community resilience." Such research is not yet systematic and relatively decentralized. The attention to collective resilience in the community is relatively weak, which makes achieving the goal of "people-oriented and systematic control" difficult. Therefore, this study states that the development of future community resilience should stand from the perspective of "system of system" and build on knowledge and tools of various relevant domains. Therefore, public needs and participation are highlighted as breakthrough points. The research should integrate infrastructure and economic resilience, social resource allocation, network connection, and other aspects to build a holistic and functional resilient community.

J	Teo, MM; Loosemore, M				Teo, Melissa M.; Loosemore, Martin			Understanding community protest from a project management perspective: A relationship-based approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collective action; Community; Protest; Project management; Collective identity; Social capital	COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; RISK; PARTICIPATION; NIMBY; STAKEHOLDERS; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS; TRUST	Communities negatively affected by construction projects are becoming increasingly empowered, organised and willing to engage in protest. The importance of communities as project stakeholders is widely recognized in the project management literature, but there is little empirical research to help project managers understand how to effectively engage with communities to prevent protests developing and escalating. Contributing to the emerging 'Relationship Approach' in project management theory which focusses on communities as legitimate stakeholders in projects, this paper draws on theories of collective identity and social capital to present an ethnographic analysis of community action against a large-scale and highly controversial construction project in Australia. The results show that dealing with community protest is a complex and dynamic challenge for project managers due to the anarchic and self-organising properties of community-based protest groups. It is concluded that effective community engagement strategies require project managers to adopt trust-building strategies early in projects and an intimate understanding of community concerns and social structures.

Exploring the Determinants of Knowledge Exchange in Virtual Communities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge acquiring; knowledge sharing; social exchange theory; theory of reasoned action; virtual community	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; USER ACCEPTANCE; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; TRUST; MODEL; UNIDIMENSIONALITY; REPOSITORIES; MOTIVATORS; INTENTION; NETWORKS	Virtual communities have become ubiquitous and vital in nearly all professions. These communities typically involve voluntary participation, and given that these communities are not organization specific, community members' motivations for participation vary. In this study, we investigate the motivations of the members of a professional virtual community to engage in knowledge exchange. We synthesize social exchange theory and the theory of reasoned action to identify critical determinants of attitudes toward knowledge exchange in virtual communities, namely, trust among participants, anticipated reciprocal relationships, and the relevance of the community to participants' jobs. Additionally, we posit that attitudes will influence the intention to use the virtual community and that this relationship will be moderated by the perceived quality of the information exchanged within the community. We test our research model using data compiled from a community of research scientists in South Korea. Our findings indicate that trust among participants has a positive influence on attitudes toward both sharing and acquiring knowledge. The anticipation of a reciprocal relationship has a positive effect on attitudes toward knowledge acquisition, and job relevance has a positive effect on attitudes toward knowledge sharing. Furthermore, attitudes toward knowledge acquisition affect attitudes toward knowledge sharing, and attitudes toward knowledge sharing positively influence intentions to use a virtual community. We also find that perceived information quality negatively moderates the relationship between attitudes toward knowledge sharing and user intentions to use a virtual community. We interpret and discuss these findings, and their implications for research and practice.

The ability of project teams to take the perspective of local communities is an important influence on how community engagement occurs. However this involves project teams confronting contradictions and tensions between local community perspectives and their own. Understanding how project teams respond to tensions between and seek to balance both perspectives is thus important, but this is relatively unexplored in literature to date. In response, this study utilizes the concept of 'perspective-taking', adopting a paradox lens to examine how tensions between the perspectives of local communities and project teams manifest and how project teams navigate these during community engagement. Through an exploratory case, the study reveals the specific cognitive attributes that enable infrastructure megaproject teams to be more effective in perspective-taking through balancing both local community and their own perspectives.

It focused on post-disaster housing reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore and explain the impact of the barriers upon community participation, and how such impact can be eliminated or reduced. The analysed results were extended to facilitate the development of a framework for more successful community participation in post disaster reconstruction. This study identified five common barriers to community participation, which are: lack of community capacity, gender issues, lack of professional competence in NGOs, government policies and practices, and lack of adequate security. A logical framework is proposed as a pragmatic solution for community capacity development activities, which should lead to achieving the following objectives: to re-establish community structure; to encourage sense of project ownership; to provide disaster recovery support; and to provide livelihood opportunities.

This paper presents three new community-based metrics to identify the critical elements of a network system. Two of these metrics assess intracommunity and intercommunity behavior for any community structure, and the third metric accounts for the multiple levels of community structure. First, these metrics are studied to establish their characteristics with different community structures, and then the Great Britain Railway Network is used as a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of these new metrics. The results show that an assessment of the system using these metrics leads to the identification of not only those elements that are critical at the global level, but also those that greatly affect the local performance of the communities. Such identification of the critical components at the community and global levels would enable a better understanding of system behavior by stakeholders with competing demands.

By drawing upon the theoretical notion of social self and personal self, and conducting a field survey among 101 online healthcare community users, this study investigates how social identity in online healthcare communities and individual users' perceived disease severity jointly influence the health information-seeking propensity. This study contributes to the literature on health information seeking by investigating the influence of social self (social identity), personal self (perceived disease severity), and their interplay in online communities. The findings can guide healthcare providers and community managers in formulating strategic plans for promoting health information-seeking behavior.

Community resilience: sustained cooperation and space usage in collective housing	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						agency; built environment; collective action; community; cooperation; courtyards; housing; resilience; self-governance; spatial configuration	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; ADAPTATION; MOTIVATION	Collective action is a community resource crucial to ensure the resilience of communities. However, maintaining cooperation over time is also a significant challenge. Arguing that a major, though neglected, precondition for community resilience is sustained cooperation, this paper analyses the conditions triggering collective action in collective housing communities. Particular attention is paid to micro-level pathways through which characteristics of the common courtyard and the related rules for its use play for the maintenance or decay of collective action. The contours of an integrated theory of sustained cooperation is sketched. Drawing on Goal Framing (GF) theory and Common Pool Resource (CPR) theory, it is argued that CPR management institutions can only be effective in a community in which a normative goal frame is salient. Empirical material is presented from a multi-method comparative case study of four low-income urban collective housing communities in Mexico City in 2010. This evidence corroborates both approaches: the two communities characterized by sustained collective action exhibit a salient normative frame in combination with all elements of CPR managing institutions, whereas the two communities with failed collective action do not meet these conditions. The results suggest that both mechanisms are necessary for sustained cooperation to occur.	[Arana, Marina Montelongo; Wittek, Rafael P.

J	Johansen, C; Horney, J; Tien, I				Johansen, Chloe; Horney, Jennifer; Tien, Iris			Metrics for Evaluating and Improving Community Resilience	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								The growing risk of natural and artificial or manufactured hazards combined with a lack of community preparedness have revealed the necessity for comprehensive and effective metrics for evaluating and improving a community's resilience, i.e., the ability of communities to prepare for, withstand, and recover from disasters. In this paper, the authors review existing community resilience metrics and tools, classifying them into one of three main categories: community-level, sector-specific, or sociological. The paper provides short descriptions of each metric and comparisons across metrics within the three main categories and across classes. The authors assess the strengths and limitations of these metrics, discuss challenges in improving community resilience, and provide recommendations for the development of new measures of resilience. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of community resilience, particularly the need for metrics that apply across hazards, geographic areas, and factors affecting resilience. The authors propose that effective metrics are characterized by: breadth, measures that address community resilience comprehensively; utility, measures that are able to be utilized by the relevant entities to undertake actions to improve resilience; and scientific merit, measures that are scientifically validated through statistical methods, case studies, and fieldwork.

Recognising the importance of critical success factors (CSFs) in this exercise from different stakeholders' perspectives and at a project-level 'micro' view, this study identifies the CSFs of the Gemidiriya CDD project of Sri Lanka from a community perspective. Questionnaires were administered to beneficiary community members and community project managers at villages to assess the importance of various project model features and linkages with overall project success. Factor analysis identified three critical success factors: enabling community environment, measurable project management outcomes by village organization and community project management engagement. Project managers should view CSFs from an impact-on-ground-orientation rather than a task-orientation. Furthermore, the beneficiaries who were also involved in the project execution may have a greater tendency to assign a high weight on the impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Social foraging theory, particularly research on insect and other animal information sharing behavior, offers a new perspective. Borrowing concepts from social foraging theory, this study proposes that four factors drive people's intention to vote online content (positively or negatively): 1) altruistic motives; 2) identification with the community; 3) information quality; and 4) knowledge self-efficacy. The research model was tested in a survey of online news communities. It found that positive voting intention was predicted by altruistic motives, community identification, and knowledge self-efficacy. Information quality is important for positive voting, but it works indirectly through fostering stronger community identification. Negative voting intention was predicted by altruistic motives and information quality. Prior research has applied foraging theory to individuals acting alone, e.g., when an individual uses Google to search for information online. This study expands the application of foraging theory to the community context where individuals provide votes to influence others in their chosen community. The findings advance our knowledge about content voting and provide implications for practitioners of voting systems.

J	Derakhshan, R; Mancini, M; Turner, JR				Derakhshan, Roya; Mancini, Mauro; Turner, John Rodney			Community's evaluation of organizational legitimacy: Formation and reconsideration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Local community; Legitimacy; Organizational behaviour; Institutional theory	ATTRIBUTION THEORY; PROJECT; STAKEHOLDERS; MEGAPROJECTS; PERSPECTIVES; LESSONS; NIMBY	With the aim of delving into the legitimacy formation mechanisms used by communities to make judgements about project organizations, this research studied the local community and surrounding environment of four oil extraction projects located in three developing countries. The results of the cross-case analysis suggest that communities' negative perceptions from government and media can influence their judgement of organizational behaviour. Additionally, this research proposes that local communities' anticipation of the consequences of protesting against the organization can make them decide not to take any action. According to institutional theory, when community individuals arrive at a legitimacy verdict about an organization, their future perceptions will mainly be influenced by this decision rather than conscious consideration of the conditions. Accordingly, this research recommends that organizations aiming to recover their reputation need to adopt compensation activities with a substantial influence on the improvement of conditions. It is only in such conditions that communities will consciously evaluate organizational legitimacy. Trivial changes in organizational behaviour will only result in adding new evidences in support of the illegitimacy of organizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Community investment programs, as part of the corporate social responsibility concept, can take the form of philanthropy or charitable donations, employee volunteerism, and partnerships. The paper highlights how companies and communities benefit from these programs and presents an approach for designing, implementing, and reporting Such programs. Program ideas for infrastructure projects and case Studies are presented. Potential challenges, issues, and opportunities for community investment programs in developing Countries are discussed. By going beyond the minimal requirement to mitigate project-related negative social and environmental impacts, private sector companies can be models of social responsibility and good corporate citizenship.

This research suggests and validates a new research model that investigates theoretical variables positively associated with the elders' behavioural intentions to use a proposed community by extending the theory of planned behaviour. 72 participants in the United Arab Emirates experienced a virtual reality tour of the proposed community and statistical tests were conducted on the data collected from the post-test questionnaires. Among a number of significant results, it was inferred that elders find the proposed community functional regardless of other people's influences and that the overall community functionality is positively correlated with the elder's intention to use the community (F(1,70)=122.527, p<.000) with an R-2 of 0.636. Also, mobility in elderly houses is highly associated with elders' attitudes which also was strongly correlated with elders' intention to use the proposed communities (F(1,70)=1175.484, p<.000 with an R-2 of 0.944). To increase the rate of elders' adoption of a residential facility, this research, among the first empirical research studies integrating the theory of planned behaviour and Virtual Reality models, provides the needed insights to construction managers and engineers.

Regional and national policy documents that plan for heatwaves in the UK tend to focus on institutional emergency responses and infrastructure development. In these documents, although communities are mentioned, they are understood as passive recipients of resilience that is provided by active institutions. Meanwhile, contemporary discussion about community resilience highlights the potential for involving communities in planning for and responding to emergencies (although the concept is also the subject of critique). To improve heatwave preparation, planning and response, more effort by central and local governments is required to articulate and realize greater participation by individuals, and voluntary and community sector groups.

This paper analyses factors influencing the success of the community-driven project in selected communities surrounding the largest city of Ibadan. We collected survey data through copies of semi-structured questionnaire, backed with an interview. Factor analysis categorizes the major factors into seven groups, including social integration and commitment to the community development project, governance structure and leadership, democracy, selfless services, networking and accountability, openness in selecting professionals for development, and joint agreement. We subject the items of the factors into SWOT analysis to understand the values. Community-based organizations (CBOs) serve as potential means to address infrastructure deficit if CBOs take note of the main factors, use the opportunities that match the strengths, attempt to overcome the weaknesses to attain the opportunities, use the strength to reduce the vulnerability to the threats and prevent the weaknesses to avoid susceptibility to the threats.

Based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we theorize a model of participation intensity in communities of practice by project managers and explore the use of Web 2.0 technologies to increase this participation. Using structural equation modeling, we test the research model and find that the factors of reputation, enjoyment, and management support impact the participation intensity of project managers in communities of practice. However, we do not find support for the impact of Web 2.0 technologies on participation intensity. This study provides evidence that participation in communities of practice can result in individual benefits for the project manager, as well as in more far-reaching organizational benefits.

J	Sun, L; Stojadinovic, B; Sansavini, G				Sun, Li; Stojadinovic, Bozidar; Sansavini, Giovanni			Resilience Evaluation Framework for Integrated Civil Infrastructure-Community Systems under Seismic Hazard	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Seismic resilience; Civil infrastructure-community systems; Communities; Seismic hazard; Agent-based model	2008 WENCHUAN; PERFORMANCE; EARTHQUAKE; FAILURES; DISASTER	Seismic resilience of civil infrastructure systems is an essential property of modern communities. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework to evaluate the seismic resilience of an integrated system consisting of the community and its civil infrastructure systems is proposed. Specifically, an agent-based model of the recovery process of civil infrastructure systems is incorporated into a previously developed compositional supply/demand seismic-resilience quantification framework. The proposed model represents the behavior of the operators of civil infrastructure systems as they strive to recover their functionality in the aftermath of an earthquake as well as their mutual interactions and interactions with the community to which they provide services. A case study of the seismic resilience of a virtual system consisting of electric power supply system, transportation system, and the community (EPSS-TS-community system) is conducted using the proposed framework. A parametric investigation is carried out to examine the effect of different earthquake magnitude scenarios as well as different behaviors of the involved agents and their interaction on the seismic resilience of the EPSS-TS-community system. It was demonstrated that the proposed agent-based modeling approach is effective in representing the interactions among different participants in the recovery process. It was also revealed that timely and well-planned intervention in the recovery process can be very effective in alleviating the postearthquake lack of resilience resulting from the insufficient supply of civil infrastructure services to meet the community's demands. Therefore, the proposed framework could be employed to formulate the recovery trajectory of the intertwined sociotechnical system subjected to different earthquake scenarios. The interplay among different agents, as well as the interdependence among civil infrastructure systems, is found to profoundly shape the recovery path for this integrated EPSS-TS-community system.

This article, therefore, proposes a three-layered framework that uses multisource heterogeneous data and network methods to measure the cluster-proximity in innovation clusters, in order to understand better the combined proximity between organizations within/across network communities. First, we developed a three-layered framework to map the network-based innovation cluster by integrating patent citation, business transaction, and geographic data. Second, in the innovation cluster, we identified the network communities in knowledge, business, and geographic layers, respectively. Third, we measured the cluster proximity within/across communities by using a combined index. We selected A City's machine tool sector in China as a case. This article found that machine-tool firms/organizations have higher cluster proximity within geographic communities that are enriched mostly by business connections. In comparison, they have lower cluster proximity across geographic communities, but the proximity is enhanced both by business connections and knowledge linkages. This may imply that knowledge linkages are more important in across-community proximity, and this needs more policy attention.

J	Yu, JY; Ma, GX; Cai, SX				Yu, Jingyu; Ma, Guixia; Cai, Shaoxing			Disparities in the provision of aging-friendly communities in old and new urban neighborhoods in China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Integrated practice; Questionnaire survey; Aging-friendly community; Elders; Urban neighbourhoods	PUBLIC GREEN SPACES; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH-SERVICES; CARE; PEOPLE; URBANIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; FRAMEWORK; ACCESS; CITIES	Purpose Aging-friendly environments have been encouraged to develop at the city level, district level and community level in China. In the process of rapid urbanization, the state of aging-friendly communities in old and new neighborhoods is disparate. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate aging-friendly communities and identify the disparities in old and new neighborhoods. Design/methodology/approach A total of 1,172 elderly respondents completed the survey. Of these, 576 seniors lived in an old community developed before 2000, and 596 lived in a new community developed after 2000. In total, 17 physical environment factors and 10 social environment factors were identified. Findings The results indicated that public spaces, facilities and transportation in old neighborhoods were inferior to those in new neighborhoods. Most social environment factors in new neighborhoods achieved higher satisfaction levels than those in old neighborhoods. The satisfaction levels of aging-friendly community factors in both old and new neighborhoods were below the expectation levels of elders. Originality/value These findings have empirical significance for urban planners and policy makers, in regard to identifying disparities between old and new neighborhoods, and understanding the equitable allocation and distribution of urban resources.

A purposive sampling was performed to get stakeholders' perception comprehensively involved the government, the private sector and the community. A total of 218 samples was collected and analyzed using mean, reliability analysis, ANOVA and posthoc tests. It was found that eight attributes were considered relevant to measure the toll road project design. Meanwhile, the design performance level was considered moderate. Finally, there was no significant difference in perceptions between the government and the private sector regarding the attributes, but there was a difference in perception between the community, the government and the private sector. These findings can help the stakeholders to understand good design application from the community perspective which can be used to improve toll road design performance for delivering a better project social benefit (PSB) to the community.

Most thematic analyses of a research field are based on some form of network analysis, e.g., citations and cowords, and most of these networks are made up of cohesive, highly overlapping groups of nodes. Based on the suggestion that the "universal features" of networks are to be found in these overlapping communities, we argue that these same communities in a keyword network should reveal the key research themes in a field of study. With no traditional method with which to test our theory, we combined a cluster percolation algorithm with a Word2Vec model, and in a case study on information science, we were not only able to detect the overlapping communities in a keyword similarity network, but we also found a new perspective on the importance of overlapping communities as a way to identify a field's key research themes.

The social side of project-based organizations is a rich "humus" to build upon in developing projects. In particular, we focus on the community of practice as a place where social ties are built and maintained over time. The sharing of a common identity and knowledge among the members of the community is a premise for the development of projects.

CLARC: An Artificial Community for Modeling the Effects of Extreme Hazard Events on Interdependent Civil and Social Infrastructure Systems	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial community; Critical infrastructure; Synthetic datasets; Computer modeling; Emergency preparedness; Community resilience	NETWORK DESIGN; RESTORATION	During the development of a suite of computer-aided decision support tools for the restoration of interdependent infrastructures impacted by an extreme natural hazard event, it became apparent that the release of vulnerability data on actual infrastructure systems could raise security concerns. As a result, an artificial and customizable infrastructure dataset was developed based on experiences with creating real, but not public, data that can be used for modeling, analysis, and decision making. The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale and methodology for assembling the database for customizable artificial community (CLARC), an artificial coastal community of approximately 500,000 people and 1,065 square miles, that includes five civil infrastructure networks (electricity, water, wastewater, transportation, and communications) and social infrastructures, such as public safety, healthcare, and critical commercial services including fuel and banking that communities rely upon during an emergency as well as population and other socio-economic factors. The interdependencies that exist between the civil infrastructure systems and between civil and social infrastructures are included in the dataset and are attributes to assist with modeling and analysis. This paper discusses the dataset in detail, describes why and how it was assembled, and includes a virtual case study that uses the CLARC dataset to simulate the impacts on the civil and social infrastructure of a hypothetical Category 3 hurricane and the community's response and recovery from that event. The dataset is openly available for use by the research and practitioner communities.

Building communities: reducing energy use in tenanted commercial property	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						asset management; commercial property; communities of practice; energy management; green leases; landlords; refurbishment; research agenda; socio-legal; tenants	SUSTAINABILITY; STAKEHOLDERS; DIFFUSION; OFFICES	Reducing energy use in tenanted commercial property requires a greater understanding of 'buildings as communities'. Tenanted commercial properties represent: (1) the divergent communities that share specific buildings; and (2) the organizational communities represented by multi-site landlord and tenant companies. In any particular tenanted space the opportunity for environmental change is mediated (hindered or enabled) through the lease. This discussion draws on theoretical and practical understandings of (1) the socio-legal relationships of landlords, tenants and their advisors; (2) the real performance of engineering building services strategies to improve energy efficiency; (3) how organizational cultures affect the ability of the sector to engage with energy-efficiency strategies; and (4) the financial and economic basis of the relationship between owners and occupiers. The transformational complexity stems from: (1) the variety of commercial building stock; (2) the number of stakeholders (solicitors, investors, developers, agents, owners, tenants and facilities managers); (3) the fragmentation within the communities of practice; and (4) leasehold structures and language. An agenda is proposed for truly interdisciplinary research that brings together both the physical and the social sciences of energy use in buildings so that technological solutions are made effective by an understanding of the way that buildings are used and communities behave.

This paper describes the application and evaluation of more visual energy feedback techniques (carbon mapping, thermal imaging) at different scales, alongside traditional methods (web-based energy and environmental visualization platform, home energy reports) delivered through community workshops, home visits and the internet, across six low-carbon communities in the UK. Overall, most of the feedback approaches were able to engage and raise awareness amongst the householders. Whilst carbon mapping was felt to be aimed more at community groups and local councils by providing evidence of past and future community action, displaying carbon maps at community workshops helped to show that others were also engaged in energy action. Thermal imaging was successful in engaging individual local residents through both community workshops and home visits, especially when included in the home energy reports. This stimulated discussions on future energy savings through building fabric upgrade. However, the data-driven web-based platform had limited uptake due to online log-in requirement and information overload. Such insights are useful for those involved in scaling up the deployment of energy feedback to encourage energy demand reduction.

J	van den Ende, L; van Marrewijk, A				van den Ende, Leonore; van Marrewijk, Alfons			Teargas, taboo and transformation: A neo-institutional study of community resistance and the struggle to legitimize subway projects in Amsterdam 1960-2018	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Infrastructure project; Neo-institutional lens; Legitimacy; Community resistance; Local embeddedness	DUTCH CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; LOCAL-COMMUNITIES; POLITICS; PROTEST; GOVERNANCE; MOVEMENT; STRATEGY; CONTEXT; WORK; MYTH	The last decades have witnessed an increasing prevalence of community resistance against large-scale infrastructure projects that pose serious threats to their environment, calling for further empirical scrutiny. Hence, this paper applies a neo-institutional lens to investigate how project actors who plan and implement large-scale infrastructure projects respond to community resistance in their attempt to legitimize and embed these projects in their environment. To do so, we draw from a longitudinal study of two subway projects in Amsterdam; the East line (1965-1980) and the North-South line (1995-2018). While considered crucial for urban development, both projects encountered severe community resistance by locals protecting the historic city. This resistance, in turn, prompted 'institutional work' by project actors to socially (re)construct the projects in pursuit of legitimacy from the Amsterdam community. The twofold contribution of the paper to the field of project studies is (1) the application of a neo-institutional lens showcasing the dynamic interrelation between projects and their environment, processes of institutional transformation, and practices of institutional work; and (2) the longitudinal empirical account exhibiting the contextual dialectic of resistance and accommodation with an emphasis on shifting approaches of institutionalization, the constant struggle to acquire legitimacy, and the local embeddedness of projects.

A single high-intensity tornado can result in high casualty rates and catastrophic economic and social consequences, particularly for small- to medium-size communities. Comprehensive community resilience assessment and improvement requires the analyst to develop a model of interacting physical, social, and economic systems and to measure outcomes that result from specific decisions made. These outcomes often are in the form of metrics such as the number of people injured or the number of households and/or businesses without water, but it has been recognized that most community resilience metrics have socioeconomic characteristics. In this study, for the first time, a fully quantitative interacting model is used to examine the effect of a tornado damaging physical infrastructure (buildings and electrical power network) and the effects on the population and the local economy for a real community. Then, three residential building retrofit strategies are considered as alternatives to improve community resilience, and the metrics for the physical, economic, and social sectors are computed. An illustrative example is presented for the 2011 Joplin tornado in a new open-source Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE), with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economics model that computes household income, employment, and domestic supply before and after the tornado. Detailed demographic data was allocated to each structure to enable the calculation of resilience metrics related to population dislocation impacts from the tornado. The results of these analyses stemming from building damage estimation have a logical trend, but the substantial contribution of this work is that, for the first time, the effect of retrofit strategies for tornado loading can be quantified in terms of their effects on socioeconomic metrics.

J	Eid, MS; El-adaway, IH				Eid, Mohamed S.; El-adaway, Islam H.			Decision-Making Framework for Holistic Sustainable Disaster Recovery: Agent-Based Approach for Decreasing Vulnerabilities of the Associated Communities	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							1995 KOBE EARTHQUAKE; HURRICANE-KATRINA; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HAZARDS; INFRASTRUCTURE; INDICATORS; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; HOME	Sustainable disaster recovery involves not merely the restoration of the physical built environment, but also meeting the needs of the impacted stakeholders and decreasing the vulnerability of the host community to future hazards. Nonetheless, the available disaster recovery frameworks deal with community restoration as isolated redevelopment projects and lack the integration of the host community's overall welfare and vulnerability into the objective functions of the optimization models. This paper balances the short-term redevelopment objectives and the long-term goals of reducing the host community three-dimensional vulnerability (i.e.,social, economic, and environmental). The authors develop an innovative decision-making framework that assimilates and meets the needs of the broad community stakeholders. Through a bottom-up multiagent-based model, the authors simulate the stakeholders' decision-making processes and integrate well-established vulnerability indicators into the objective functions of the stakeholders to better guide the redevelopment strategies. Adopting the recovery processes in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, the proposed model is implemented and tested on the residential housing and economic financial recovery as well as the infrastructure development in three devastated coastal counties in Mississippi. Each action plan provided by governmental agencies had its own advantages and negative impacts on the vulnerability and/or the recovery of the impacted communities. By holistically addressing the multidimensional recovery processes using simultaneous simulation and optimization techniques, the model develops a Pareto optimal set of strategies that increases the recovery rates and decreases the three-dimensional vulnerabilities. The proposed innovative approach gives decision makers a broader understanding of the disaster recovery outcomes rather than relying on strategies that aim to return the community to pre-event conditions. As such, the proposed holistic approach will enable decision makers to identify optimal disaster recovery strategies that achieve immediate redevelopment objectives and avoid sacrificing the right of future generations to sustainability and resilience.

Findings suggest that research on stakeholder management has focused strongly on those stakeholders able to control project resources, whilst the effect on the legitimate 'secondary stakeholders', such as the local community, remains widely unexplored. Due to the unavoidable impact of major PIC on both people and places, it is suggested that seeking local community opinions in the initiation phase of the project and monitoring the megaproject impact at the local level can help to improve project performance. The output provides scholars and practitioners with future research directions and practical implications for an inclusive stakeholder management approach in construction megaprojects.

Integrating the Social Vulnerability of Host Communities and the Objective Functions of Associated Stakeholders during Disaster Recovery Processes Using Agent-Based Modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK; GAMES	Disaster recovery requires the participation of the stakeholders to repair the impacted community. Nevertheless, disaster recovery remains understudied within the context of emergency management. Various models have been developed to address disaster recovery. However, those models neither considered the stakeholders' needs and preferences, nor the vulnerability of the host community. This paper presents a decision-making framework for disaster recovery that uses a bottom-up approach to capture the needs of the impacted residents and decreases the social vulnerability of host communities. The authors developed the following research methodology: (1) use a well-established community specific social vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate the society vulnerability; (2) model the multisector stakeholders through a root-to-grass technique that captures their objectives, strategies, and learning behaviors; (3) simulate the recovery progress of the impacted community using an agent-based simulation toolkit; and (4) interpret the results to provide the decision makers with optimal recovery strategies. The restorations efforts in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in three coastal counties in Mississippi were used as the problem domain. Accordingly, the proposed model was implemented on a multiagent-based simulation toolkit with geographic information system (GIS) abilities. This research optimized the budget for the State Disaster Recovery Coordinator and the residents' insurance plans choices. As such, this study provided better social vulnerability indices than the existing conditions currently found in the areas under investigation. Further, this research provided higher disaster recovery rates within the studied host communities. For future work, other vulnerability dimensions will be simultaneously integrated into the model to provide a more accurate depiction of sustainable disaster recovery processes.

This inductive study generates insights about the nature and role of 'active leadership' (LaBrosse, 2007) in the context of a community led recovery project in Minami-sanriku, Japan, an area affected by the 2011 tsunami. Community leaders displayed 'active leadership' evidenced in 1) the effective identification of project objectives and relevant stakeholders, 2) the efficient management of stakeholder engagement and 3) the robust understanding of the socio-cultural context in which the Nagasuka Beach Recovery Project took place. This multi-disciplinary and inductive study highlights the need to train project managers (be they community leaders or otherwise) in both technical and soft leadership skills: the former ensure that Project Management methodologies are clearly understood and applied; the latter facilitate the adaptation of these methodologies to the specific socio-cultural locales in which recovery projects take place.

J	Ninan, J; Clegg, S; Mahalingam, A				Ninan, Johan; Clegg, Stewart; Mahalingam, Ashwin			Branding and governmentality for infrastructure megaprojects: The role of social media	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaprojects; Governmentality; Branding; Project Community; Social Media	PROJECTS; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; POWER; SYSTEM; WORK	This paper explores subtle strategies that megaproject teams develop in practice to manage stakeholders external to the project team. A governmentality approach is used to account for these strategies. A metro rail megaproject in India provides the case for the study. The strategies were identified through a content analysis of 640 project and non-project based Tweets posted by the metro rail organization. We augmented this dataset with the community's response through social media, as well as through semi-structured interviews that captured the project teams' responses. The findings indicate that the megaproject used various strategies: promoting the organization, giving progress updates, appealing to the community, as well as targeting of specific sections of the population. The effect of these attempts at governmentality through branding were observed in community discourses on social media platforms that echoed the strategic discourses projected by the megaproject while interviews enabled us to access the project team's responses. For the project community, the effects included a positive brand image, creating community brand advocates and building support for the project during contentious episodes. For the project team, the effects included job attraction, enhanced job perception as well as the creation of project team brand advocates. The relation between the governmentality instruments and their corresponding effects are theorized in six propositions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Participatory methods, common in ecology and environmental science, provide an opportunity for producing these fine data. However, very little is known about the validity and reliability of infrastructure data collected by volunteer members of the public. In this paper, we examine the validity and reliability of local drainage infrastructure monitoring data obtained from citizen scientists. The volunteer citizen scientists were high school students collecting data about the condition of stormwater infrastructure in their local community. The study took place in an environmental justice neighborhood in Houston with a long history of flooding and exposure to environmental hazards. The results suggest that with adequate planning, training, and organized community engagement efforts, the validity and reliability of data collected by citizen scientists can be comparable to physical measurements and data obtained from trained inspectors.

J	Lee-Kelley, L; Turner, N				Lee-Kelley, Liz; Turner, Neil			PMO managers' self-determined participation in a purposeful virtual community-of-practice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communities-of-practice; Knowledge-sharing; PMO; Action research; Motivation	PROJECT-BASED ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; OFFICE; MODEL; PERSPECTIVE; LESSONS; LEARN; CONCEPTUALIZATION; AMBIDEXTERITY	Communities-of-practice (CoPs) have received significant attention within a variety of literatures but we remain largely ignorant of the potential of purposefully-created CoPs in global organisations. In this context, the challenge is likely to be convincing 'masters' (Wenger, 1998) on the merits of joining the conversation on practice at a distance, thus making the willingness for exchange a key to the quality and longevity of the community. We posed the question "Why would busy, dispersed, knowledgeable professionals want to join and participate in a deliberately organised CoP?" Our 2-year collaborative action study allowed us to observe the CoP and its membership at close range. We conclude that autonomy, competence and belonging underscore participation, co-production and diffusion of innovative problem-solving and practice beyond the CoP. The study will inform organisations contemplating similar interventions and also serves as a basis for further investigation and theory building on organized CoPs by the research community.

J	El-Diraby, TE; Wang, B				El-Diraby, TE; Wang, B			E-society portal: Integrating urban highway construction projects into the knowledge city	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ONTOLOGIES	Community involvement is an important factor for sustainable highway construction. Information and communication technologies provide a new and more effective approach to facilitate community involvement. However, there are too many parameters with conflicting and subjective definitions related to sustainability and too many stakeholders with varying degrees of interest and sophistication. There is a need for an effective tool to communicate project impacts on sustainability to local communities. This paper presents an ontology for stakeholder management and sustainability in highway construction. An ontology is a conceptual semantic model that attempts to capture human knowledge (both explicit and tacit) in a consistent manner. Ontologies include three main elements: a taxonomy (common vocabulary presented in concept trees), set of relationships (linking concepts across trees), and axioms (limitation/constraints on the behavior of concepts). The ontology was used to develop a portal for broadcasting highway design features to local communities. By browsing through the portal, a user can learn about project elements, the impacts of each element on sustainability issues, who is sponsoring such element, and what efforts have been made to reduce any impacts of such elements on local communities.

Agent-Based Model of Hosting Communities' Perceptions of Water and Wastewater Infrastructure during the German Refugee Crisis	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Displaced persons; Water infrastructure; Wastewater infrastructure; Agent-based modeling	STAKEHOLDER IMPACT ANALYSIS; PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; POPULATION-GROWTH; DISASTER; SYSTEMS; INTERDEPENDENCY; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; ATTRIBUTES; RESOURCES	In 2016, Germany received approximately 50% of the 1.2 million asylum applications in the European Union. The applicants represented a population influx of displaced people that were accommodated primarily in urban settings, creating challenges for engineers and managers who needed to meet the new water and wastewater demands of the displaced persons without disrupting services to preexisting residents. To achieve this, local authorities and engineers had to consider temporary or permanent alterations to existing water and wastewater infrastructure-changes that could provoke opposition from a hosting community, depending on their perception of the changes. In this study, a modeling framework is proposed that allows decision makers to account for hosting communities' perceptions of alternatives for providing water and wastewater infrastructure services to displaced persons. The framework uses an agent-based model that is enabled by publicly available information, a survey deployed to German communities, and interviews with stakeholders involved in the accommodation of displaced persons in Germany. Our results indicate that alternatives used by local authorities did not always align with community-supported alternatives. To minimize such misalignments, we recommend that local authorities, early on in developing infrastructure alternatives, take into account the perceptions of hosting communities. Ultimately, the proposed framework promotes the sustainable provision of water and wastewater infrastructure to displaced persons.

Beyond Chatter: Profiling Community Discussion Networks in Urban Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Community engagement; Cocreation; Social network analysis; Social media; Infrastructure projects	SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; MODEL	The relevance of social networks in engaging communities in planning and project decision making has been established. This case study work analyzes the social and semantic networks for the Twitter accounts of four large light rail transit (LRT) projects in North America. These networks portray typical features of social networks: consistent small-world behavior, formation of stable subcommunities, and dynamic variation in topic and issues discussed with changes to the project conditions. The proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects-mainly because the cases were analyzed with an additional focus on the dynamics of social networks of participants. In early stages of the projects, these networks have a limited group of participants. As time passes and more interest is cumulated in the project, the number of nodes increases but the number of connections (between the nodes) does not increase at a similar speed. This reduces the overall density of the network and, at the same time, creates "hub" nodes. These are influential participants with an impact on the information diffusion and formation of opinions. The subcommunities that form evolve in membership, density, and topics of interest, in accordance with the project progress. Citizens migrate between subcommunities, mainly based on the central topics of discussion and, partially, the addition or migration of influential nodes. The use of the proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects because it showcases a sociosemantic approach for the analysis of stakeholders. This can help decision makers to not only understand what is on the mind of communities, but also track how such thoughts (issues) evolve over time and what the role of key players is in forming or changing the issues. A careful analysis over the project life span can help the decision makers to predict some of these trends and, accordingly, shape the project communication strategy in a more proactive fashion to meet the possible community needs. In the era of unstructured big data, this methodology can help practitioners to study the impact of decisions made or scope deviations in a project on the themes and levels of interest of local communities. Both of these two features will help to transfer public communication in construction mega-projects from a one-way outreach to a two-way interaction: try to understand/predict community issues, gather community interests and concerns, and study how community structure and views change based on the changes made to the project scope.

J	Choi, J; Deshmukh, A; Hastak, M				Choi, Juyeong; Deshmukh, Abhijeet; Hastak, Makarand			Seven-Layer Classification of Infrastructure to Improve Community Resilience to Disasters	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Critical infrastructure; Capacity building; Postdisaster resilience; Infrastructure interdependencies; Postdisaster recovery phase; Seven layers of critical infrastructure	RECOVERY; RISK; PREPAREDNESS; FACILITIES; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; STRESS; MODEL	Community resilience to natural disasters depends to a large extent on the adequacy of infrastructure services provided through multidimensional interdependent systems during postdisaster recovery. In the aftermath of a disaster, enormous and diverse community recovery needs emerge, necessitating an effective interplay of cyber-physical-social systems during emergencies and throughout the phases of short- and long-term recovery. With recognition of the important roles played by multidimensional infrastructure, considerable research and development has been undertaken in each discipline to support communities in the aftermath of disasters. These multiple domains of infrastructure systems are heterogeneous in their structure and operation but are nevertheless interrelated. Therefore, the absence of an integrated platform on which emergency personnel from different disciplines could coordinate resilience planning often hampers the smooth and effective recovery process of communities during postdisaster recovery. This study proposes a new approach for analyzing capacity needs of a wide range of critical infrastructure during postdisaster recovery, framed within seven interrelated infrastructure layers: civil, civic, social, financial, environmental, educational, and cyber/communication. This research employs node analysis to deal with the complexity of the infrastructure layer networks and visualize the interplay among them. The proposed seven-layer framework facilitates an understanding of the interdependencies within and between the infrastructure layers, and an analysis of various communities' needs specific to the phases of postdisaster recovery. Finally, the implementation and the benefits of this seven-layer conceptualization are demonstrated through case studies of past postdisaster recovery operations.

J	Zhang, ZJ				Zhang, Zhongju (John)			Feeling the Sense of Community in Social Networking Usage	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information systems (ISs) success; online communities; sense of community (SOC); social networking systems; social networking usage	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE; USER-SATISFACTION; MCLEAN MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; INTENTION; KNOWLEDGE; SUCCESS; INDEX	In recent years, social networking systems have become quite popular, and have been established for a variety of purposes. However, it is still not well understood if sense of community (SOC) contributes to an individual user's continued usage of these systems. This paper presents a theoretical model combining key constructs from the SOC framework and the information systems usage/success models to evaluate social networking usage. We surveyed users from popular social networking sites to test the validity of the research model. Our results indicate that while user satisfaction is still the most salient determinant for system usage, SOC also plays a significant role in the user's online social interaction process. Besides its direct influence on usage, SOC also indirectly influences usage through user satisfaction. In addition, we show that SOC is a multidimensional construct that should be measured using several components. We also demonstrate that the quality of the information contained in the communities has a significant impact on SOC, but system quality does not seem to influence it. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.

An empirical investigation in the UK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaprojects; Managing secondary stakeholders; Local community inclusiveness; Perception of local community; Project performance	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; MEGA-PROJECT; INFRASTRUCTURE; IDENTIFICATION; PARTICIPATION; INCLUSIVENESS; PERSPECTIVES; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES	Based on an exploratory study conducted in the UK using thematic and cluster analysis, this paper investigates how the local communities' stakeholder is perceived, defined and categorized by project managers in major public infrastructure and construction projects (MPIC), and how their involvement could improve the performance of these projects. Due to the perceived benefits shortfall of MPIC, well organized actions from 'secondary stakeholder' groups have led to delays, cost overruns, and significant damage to the organization's reputation. Stakeholder management is an essential process which aims to maximize positive inputs and minimize detrimental attitudes by taking into account the needs and requirements of all project stakeholders. However, current project stakeholder management mechanisms are reactive rather than proactive, mainly offering an instrumental perspective, which aims to make the stakeholders comply with project needs. Therefore, a broader inclusiveness of secondary stakeholders who could be harmed by the organization's strategy, such as the local communities, is required to enhance the performance of MPIC.

Although the call for papers received an international response, the special issue has a focus on cases of policy-making and outcomes in the UK. A critical review is presented addressing several questions for the international research, consultancy and policy-making communities. What can these international communities learn from the presented examples? How do variations in governance regimes and structures influence policy formulation and outcomes, particularly the reduction in policy 'gaps'? What future steps could be taken to produce more internationally oriented comparative research on policy-making and implementation regarding the built environment and urban-regional development? How can evidence and analysis be used to build theory? Do the research and consultancy communities need to improve their policy literacy? What lessons can the research community, in particular, learn from this process in advising on policy formation and implementation processes?

J	Kalutara, P; Zhang, GM; Setunge, S; Wakefield, R				Kalutara, Pushpitha; Zhang, Guomin; Setunge, Sujeeva; Wakefield, Ron			Decision-making model for sustainable management of Australian community buildings: combined approach using analytical hierarchy process and neuro-fuzzy system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Australian community buildings; sustainable management; decision-making model; AHP; NFS; sustainability index	PROJECTS; AHP	Community buildings such as childcare/ aged care centres, sports pavilions possesses a massive investment in Australian economy built up over generations. From one viewpoint, they are providing essential services to the community and another viewpoint, the delivery of those services is limited by the ongoing degradation of the structural and service components of buildings, the scarcity of resources and the lack of funding by state and federal governments. This poses a huge challenge to Australian local governments to sustainably manage community buildings accountable to them. Reaching the goal takes further away by the absence of a holistic decision-making model for sustainable management of Australian community buildings. This study approaches the problem holistically identifying the sustainable decisions to be made through triple bottom line (environment, economic and social) and functional aspects. Incorporation of the influencing factors of each aspect led to a comprehensive decision-making structure which was the base for developing an effective decision-making model. The design of the model is based on the combination of two analytical methods namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neuro Fuzzy System (NFS). The final output of the model computes the sustainability index which interprets the total sustainability impact of a given building component. This enables building asset managers to utilise the index to prioritise the maintenance tasks of all building components. The paper encapsulates the results of a case study to explain the outputs of the model and their practical significance. The study previously conducted two industry-wide questionnaire surveys to finalise the attributes of the decision-making structure and the importance of the attributes (weightings).

J	Ward, M; Poleacovschi, C; Faust, K; Svec, J				Ward, Michael; Poleacovschi, Cristina; Faust, Kasey; Svec, Joseph			Modeling Public Support for Utility Expansions in Displacement Situations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							WASTE-WATER; PLACE ATTACHMENT; REFUGEE CAMPS; TAP WATER; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; SELECTION; PROJECTS; DILEMMAS; DISASTER	In Germany in 2016, over 722,000 people applied for asylum. That is, in a single year close to three-quarters of a million people were displaced. The struggles displaced people face are numerous. For host communities trying to provide them water and wastewater services, the challenges are also numerous. To account for increased users, utility managers may need to expand the capacity of their systems temporarily, if not permanently. The financial burden of these expansions is largely shouldered by the hosting community. If a community is opposed to such expansion, it can adversely impact a project's schedule, resources, and budget. Hence, it is critical for utility managers to understand the hosting community's public support for proposed expansion plans. As such, there is a need to evaluate what factors influence public support in displacement situations. To address this need, this study uses place attachment theory to assess what personal beliefs, demographic factors, and geographic parameters are associated with public support. Enabling this study is data gathered through a survey distributed to all 16 German States in 2016 (n = 416). Multinomial logistic analysis revealed three key drivers of public support: trust in the utility provider, willingness to participate in utility decisions, and willingness to provide utilities to those who cannot pay. The findings suggest that utility managers should build trust with the host community and foster participation to increase public support. In addition, this work shows how, in displacement scenarios, public support can be explained with place attachment theory. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Doloi, H				Doloi, Hemanta			Community-Centric Model for Evaluating Social Value in Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social value creation; Public participation; Social network theory; Infrastructure projects	NETWORK ANALYSIS; AUSTRALIA; FRAMEWORK	Increasing public participation in infrastructure projects elicits the need for a rationalized approach for quantifying value creation in the societal context. Although economic and environmental viability may be relatively easy to quantify, theories for quantitative evaluation of social performance and underlying social value creation in public infrastructure projects from a community perspective remain unexplored. This paper argues that the needs and requirements of the community should be at the core in planning for infrastructure projects. The success and failure of these projects should be intrinsically linked to the social value being created for the community at large. Addressing this knowledge gap, this paper develops a community-centric framework by considering public viewpoints at the core of infrastructure planning across a range of project characteristics. Based on social network theory, four key stakeholder networksinterest, impact, communication, and satisfaction networksare investigated and the underlying network measures are then used to compute mathematically the social performance index (SPI) of the entire project. The SPI is then compared with a threshold value so that an acceptable level of social performance can be ensured while planning the project. The application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study project. The research contributes new knowledge in evaluation of public projects across planning, business, and construction management literature.

Community Sensor Network for Monitoring Road Roughness Using Smartphones	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Accelerometers; Community networks; Fuzzy logic; Global positioning system (GPS); Huffman; Road roughness; Smartphones	PHONE	Maintenance of ever-expanding road networks all over the world is a critical task and regular monitoring of the road surface is imperative for successful maintenance. Existing monitoring techniques use dedicated vehicles equipped with sensors. Limited availability of these specialized vehicles makes regular monitoring very challenging. This paper explores a novel approach of empowering the smartphone user community for monitoring roads that they use. Smartphones are used for sensing the road surface conditions from a moving vehicle. The system involves client applications on smartphones that collect accelerations as the users travel on the roads, processing of the information and communication to a central server, georeference database, and visualization of road conditions on Google maps. In this paper, the fuzzy logic-based road surface roughness classification is proposed for monitoring the road roughness. The implementation has been demonstrated in different road networks at northern region of India. The experiment demonstrates the huge potential of user community participation in maintenance of road infrastructure. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

While assessments of post-disaster reconstruction projects normally occurs within a few years of the disaster this paper is based on a study of four 'good practice' reconstruction projects, 15 years after the earthquake and seven years after the flooding disaster from the Indian states of Gujarat and Bihar respectively. This extended timeframe enabled the examination of long-term outcomes related to disaster resilience of communities. The comparison of the four case study projects through extended timeframe enabled authors to articulate critical success factors contributing to project's effectiveness. The research found that the best long-term outcomes were achieved when the agencies implementing post-disaster housing reconstruction projects: 1) adopted an 'agile' approach to project planning and implementation; 2) allocated ample time for gaining and maintaining community trust; iii) provided multiple materials, technologies and skilled labour choices to ensure hazard-safety of housing, and (iv) continued community capacity building beyond the completion of the reconstruction work. These imperatives have prompted the development of a progressive, spiral model for effective post-disaster housing reconstruction project management which is presented in this paper.

The philosophy behind frugal innovation can be applied to both products and services from different sectors, as shown by academia and managerial applications. In this article, the purpose is to examine the intellectual structure of the developing domain of frugal-innovation research in order to identify the most active and influential communities, as well as the most seminal works and the most active scholars. Therefore, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the literature on frugal innovation. The outcomes of our analysis allow us to offer an objective and scientific mapping of the development of this field. Four distinct intellectual communities have been identified: strategic challenges, inclusive development, sustainability, and industrial application. We, herein, provide insights into the commonalities between these distinct communities and into the intellectual structure of the domain, as well as indications for future studies. The results dig into the evolution of the topic and instigate further research explorations toward the industrial applications of frugal innovation, addressing whether and how this approach could deliver benefits to companies in terms of product development, industrial systems, and logistics.

J	Gibson-Graham, JK; Hill, A; Law, L				Gibson-Graham, J. K.; Hill, Ann; Law, Lisa			Re-embedding economies in ecologies: resilience building in more than human communities	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						built environment; climate change; communities; ethical behaviour; ethics; local economy; local resilience; negotiations; resilience	SYSTEMS; ANTHROPOCENE; RETHINKING; POLITICS	The modern hyper-separation of economy from ecology has severed the ties that people have with environments and species that sustain life. A first step towards strengthening resilience at a human scale involves appreciating, caring for and repairing the longstanding ecological relationships that have supported life over the millennia. The capacity to appreciate these relationships has, however, been diminished by a utilitarian positioning of natural environments by economic science. Ecologists have gone further in capturing the interdependence of economies and ecologies with the concept of socio-ecological resilience. Of concern, however, is the persistence of a vision of an economy ordered by market determinations in which there is no role for ethical negotiation between humans and with the non-human world. This paper reframes economy-ecology relations, resituating humans within ecological communities and resituating non-humans in ethical terms.

Vulnerability is as important a cause of disasters as the physical events that trigger them. Poor people's vulnerability is often increased when development goes wrong. Thus, development is a contributing factor in the occurrence and scale of disasters. At the same time, disasters, when they happen, cause serious setbacks to development. To get out of the vicious circle, more attention will have to be paid to mitigation and tackling the causes of vulnerability. Formal approaches to mitigation, initiated mainly by the public sector, have often been inefficient and at times have left people more vulnerable. A successful alternative approach, community-based disaster mitigation, can reduce vulnerability by engaging popular approaches, local knowledge and social capital, whilst addressing their weaknesses. Some examples of community-based mitigation are derived as lessons: learn from the past, build relations with communities, encourage participation, involve local builders and artisans, build local capacity, document and share lessons, and influence formal education.

Building Water and Wastewater System Resilience to Disaster Migration: Utility Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable construction; Disaster migration; Water utilities; Wastewater utilities; Resilience; Displaced persons		This paper leverages expert knowledge from leaders in water and wastewater utilities to anticipate water and wastewater infrastructure impacts in communities that host populations displaced by disasters. These experts represent knowledge from 25 utilities across the United States. While the identified infrastructure impacts of disaster migration were both positive and negative, the responding experts indicate that impacts depend greatly on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the increased demands caused by hypothetical migrant populations. With this in mind, findings demonstrate a need to include utilities in the placement of disaster migrants to minimize the impact of service on both the hosting community and disaster migrants. For the construction industry, both the speed and scale of response needed in the host communities are particular organizational and workforce challenges. More broadly, given the technical impacts of suddenly increased populations, the results of this research suggest a need for policy that can provide infrastructure funding for communities hosting displaced populations, and to enable expedited code enforcement that protects public safety while meeting the requirements of an emergency situation.

However, it has still been a challenge to identify valuable information of interest from unstructured and noisy user-generated text. The extant research trying to solve this problem is limited by the generalizability issue and the lack of topic-level investigation. In this article, we proposed an automatic hybrid model to simultaneously extract knowledge topics and knowledge structures from free text in online innovation communities. By employing a topic model, one important contribution of this article is the elimination of manual intervention and addressing of the generalizability issue faced by existing supervised approaches. Another major contribution of this article is the design of a novel solution for knowledge structure construction by combining a topic model with association analysis; this solution addresses the weakness of the traditional topic model. We evaluate the validity of the proposed hybrid model in experiments with a real-world dataset. The results show that by providing a new angle for innovative knowledge acquisition and management, this proposed method is effective in extracting meaningful innovative knowledge and in uncovering knowledge structures.

J	Palliyaguru, R; Amaratunga, D; Haigh, R				Palliyaguru, Roshani; Amaratunga, Dilanthi; Haigh, Richard			IMPACT OF INTEGRATING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION PHILOSOPHIES INTO INFRASTRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN SRI LANKA	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						disaster risk reduction; infrastructure reconstruction; infrastructure vulnerability; community vulnerability; water supply and sanitation reconstruction projects	BUILT ENVIRONMENT	Major impacts on infrastructures due to natural and man-made hazards could result in secondary and additional impacts, compounding the problem for those communities already affected by the hazard. Integration of disaster risk reduction (DRR) philosophies into infrastructure projects has been an important solution to mitigate and prevent such disaster risks, as well as for a speedy recovery after disasters. "Vulnerability reduction" is defined by the research community as an enabler which facilitates the process of DRR. However, there is a research need to identify the most beneficial DRR strategies that would result in vulnerability reduction in an effective way. As part of this main aim, this paper seeks to explore the nature of various vulnerabilities within infrastructure reconstruction projects and their respective communities and to evaluate the DRR practises within these projects. Finally the paper attempts to map the effects of integration of DRR into infrastructure reconstruction on vulnerability reduction of infrastructure reconstruction projects and the communities which benefited from such projects. This study adopts the case study approach and the paper is entirely based on data collated from semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey conducted within one case study (a water supply and sanitation reconstruction project) in Sri Lanka and expert interviews conducted in Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom. Results reveal that emergency preparedness strategies are the most important group of DRR strategies, while physical/technical strategies are also very important. However, none of the emergency preparedness strategies are satisfactorily implemented, while most of the physical/technical strategies are adequately implemented.

Eco-feedback systems are taking advantage of data streams from advanced metering infrastructure and are being widely implemented with the goal of increasing engagement in more sustainable behavior. However, the effectiveness of eco-feedback systems at an urban scale largely depends on how the information is communicated to and visualized by various communities. Advanced visualization technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), have proven to be efficient tools in information communication and visualization in diverse fields and present a promising opportunity in information representation for eco-feedback studies at scales larger than a single building. This paper examines the effectiveness of a VR-integrated community-scale eco-feedback system deployed across 54 buildings on Georgia Tech's campus by integrating 15-min increment energy consumption data into an interactive VR platform of the campus and conducting a user testing experiment on visualization characteristics, such as immersion, presence, involvement, and simulator sickness, along with system usefulness, that play a decisive role in users' preference and perceived energy-saving motivation toward the two systems. Yet, participants indicated polarized preferences for the two types of systems. This finding suggests that to increase the effectiveness of energy feedback at the urban scale as open urban energy data become more available, eco-feedback systems need to incorporate the specific preferences of the communities receiving feedback or be designed capable of displaying energy feedback that meets users' diverse preferences. In doing so, we may capitalize on the increasing data richness of energy consumption information in cities to more effectively encourage energy-saving behavior and meet the sustainability targets set by city governments.

Community disaster resilience relies on the capacity of critical infrastructure systems to maintain acceptable levels of functionality during a disruptive event and to recover promptly after the event. A proper predisaster risk mitigation planning framework can aid communities by working in advance to understand the preexisting local needs, identify the leaders, form partnerships, establish resources, and seize opportunities to increase community disaster resilience. Although numerous theoretical studies exist on developing models to support infrastructure predisaster risk mitigation, these models have not been properly incorporated into the decision-making process in existing studies. This lack of incorporation impedes the transfer of theoretical knowledge to practical policymaking. High-level predisaster infrastructure risk mitigation decisions for multiple infrastructure systems are especially in need of such an illustration due to the complexity introduced by the scale. This paper defines the interdependent infrastructure risk mitigation (IIRM) problem in a risk-informed decision-making framework and illustrates the entire decision-making process using a case study on predisaster risk mitigation planning of the interdependent critical infrastructure systems in Jamaica. This region is vulnerable to natural hazards but has received little attention in the literature.

Although attempts have been made to introduce internationally agreed models for these processes, it is clear that various countries are producing different approaches according to their cultural, institutional and policy differences. Knowledge exchange is potentially a key means of developing a shared understanding of values, meanings and practices in relation to building performance evaluation. This paper identifies cultural and institutional barriers in the European Union for international building performance communities of practice utilizing knowledge exchange, from an experiential 'real-world' perspective. The preparation of a 30-month research project to help develop building performance evaluation in Poland and an associated bilateral symposium is closely evaluated through an action research case study in terms of the stakeholders, the national contexts in which they operated and the key challenges they faced. Recommendations are then made in terms of the support needed to develop more responsive research programmes in relation to developing international knowledge exchange, and the capacity-building elements required for these international communities of practice.

A socio-technical approach is used to develop and apply a monitoring and evaluation framework. This framework comprises assessment of longitudinal energy use, in-situ monitoring and qualitative social science surveys in order to evaluate the impacts (on changing individual and household energy behaviours) and effectiveness (on achieving real savings in energy use and carbon emissions) of energy retrofits of 27 owner-occupied homes across six low carbon communities (LCCs). Results indicate that the energy retrofits have been reasonably effective in terms of reducing energy use in dwellings (75% of homes experienced reductions in gas and/or electricity use). The research also reveals wider impacts of retrofits on indoor environmental conditions and behaviours of the occupants. Such impacts, intended or otherwise, may not be always positive; however, the LCCs appear particularly successful in facilitating the households, through increased motivations, capability, awareness and knowledge relating to energy use and behaviours.

J	Yu, JY; Ma, GX; Ding, WX; Mao, JF; Wang, JF				Yu, Jingyu; Ma, Guixia; Ding, Wenxuan; Mao, Jiangfeng; Wang, Jingfeng			Structural model for the relationships between age-friendly communities and quality of life of older adults in Hefei, China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Age-friendly community; Older adults; Quality of life; Structural equation modeling		Purpose China is experiencing tremendous changes of rapid urbanization and aging society. The development of age-friendly communities (AFCs) has been encouraged for improving health and well-being of older adults. Hence, this study aimed to deepen the understanding of AFCs in China and to investigate the integrated relationships between AFCs and the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, using a large-scale questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hefei, China, to investigate the complicated relationships between the components of AFCs and the QoL of older adults. Ultimately, 1,383 valid questionnaires were collected from senior respondents aged more than 60 years. Several statistical methods, including reliability analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), were adopted to develop an integrated model for AFC components and the QoL of older adults. Findings Six AFC components and four older adults' QoL factors were identified. The SEM results revealed integrated relationships between specific AFC components and the QoL of older adults: (1) physical QoL was affected by outdoor spaces, public transportation, housing and community and health services; (2) psychological QoL was predicted by most of the AFC components except community and health services; and (3) environmental QoL and social QoL were both influenced by outdoor spaces, communication and information and community and health services. Practical implications In order to enhance the QoL of older adults, it is suggested that outdoor spaces need to be enlarged by fully using the facilities and playgrounds of middle schools and renovating the older buildings. The locations of public transportation stations are recommended to be revised to be within a 5-minute walking distance of senior residents. Improvements to the social environment of AFCs, by increasing the coverage of medical services and creating multiple approaches to recreational activities, are encouraged. Originality/value These findings have empirical significance for urban planners and policy-makers in regard to identifying major components of AFCs and understanding the effect of those components on the QoL of older adults.

The notion and social practices involving redundancy' (the ability to switch between numerous available choices beyond optimal design) are explored as an aspect of resilience theory. Practice and Social Learning theories are used as a lens through which to explore the available redundancy in housing and home environments to help prevent performance failure through unexpected circumstances or in response to varying user needs. Findings from an in depth UK housing case study show how redundancy is linked with the capacity to share resources and to learn both individually and collectively as a community. Such learning in relation to resilient low-carbon living is shown to be co-produced effectively through participatory action research. The benefits of introducing extra redundancy in housing design and community development to accommodate varied user's understanding and preferences are discussed in relation to future proofing, value and scalar issues. Recommendations include better understanding of the design, time and monetary contribution needed to implement social or technical redundancy. These costs should be evaluated in context of savings made through greater resilience achieved.

Many of these organizations' projects fail in the early stages. This study examines the effect of four factors (organizational structure, organizational culture, funding, and community participation) on the success of development projects among NGOs in Jordan. Data were collected from a sample of 181 employees from the 45 active NGOs in Jordan using a questionnaire. Results showed that respondents consider three out of the four factors are significant and affect the project success. However, community participation has been considered insignificant. The study provides several recommendations to the local authorities, NGOs and donors such as finding reliable and stable funding and involving the community in the decision-making process. Taking recommendations into consideration will increase the NGOs efficiency, performance, success and chances in remaining active and fully running.

J	Song, PJ; Phang, CW				Song, Peijian; Phang, Chee Wei			Promoting Continuance Through Shaping Members' Social Identity in Knowledge-Based Versus Support/Advocacy Virtual Communities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Continuance; information technology (IT) artifacts; knowledge sharing; social identity; support/advocacy; virtual community (VC)	SELF-CATEGORIZATION; ONLINE COMMUNITIES; INFORMATION; MODEL; ANTECEDENTS; INTENTION; IDENTIFICATION; VERIFICATION; COMMITMENT; FRAMEWORK	A fundamental issue confronting virtual community (VC) managers is how to retain the existing members and promote their continuance in the VC. Being a virtual interaction space in which members are not formally bound to stay, the extent to which members have a sense of social identity, or perceiving themselves as a part of the VC, may be a key to determine their continuance intention in the VC. However, it is important to recognize that social identity is neither a unidimensional concept nor are VCs universal in nature. In this study, we examine two variants of VCs, one focusing on knowledge sharing and another on support/advocacy, and show that different dimensions of social identity matters for the two VCs. In particular, members' sense of cognitive social identity promotes their continuance intention in knowledge based VCs, whereas it is the emotional social identity that works in support/advocacy VCs. Furthermore, the cultivation of the two dimensions of social identity requires the facilitation of different VC artifacts. Overall, our findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the role of social identity in promoting members' continuance in VCs, and underscore that a naive universal approach of cultivating social identity without considering VC type is not enough; rather, a VC-dependent strategy with differential emphasis on developing different VC artifacts could be more fruitful.

This paper proposes a new and practical methodology to capture and represent construction project knowledge by using project-based Communities of practice (Cops) approach. Using project-based CoPs concepts, project participants and engineers can get an overview of available knowledge in core project areas and take appropriate management in tacit and explicit knowledge. This study proposes a Construction Project Cops-based Knowledge Management (ConPCKM) system for use by general contractors during the construction phase. The ConPCKM is then applied in selected case study of a construction building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge. The combined results demonstrate that a ConPCKM-like system can be an effective tool for tacit knowledge management by utilizing the CoPs approach and web technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research largely focused on the negativity surrounding living in refugee camps and mostly ignored the input of refugees. This study explores the possibilities of involving refugees in architectural design and construction decisions in the camps. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a qualitative interpretive research approach and employs exploratory ethnographic methods. Participatory design (PD) principles are applied to design and construct community place projects in two refugee camps in Greece. Findings The findings demonstrate that, despite the technical and institutional challenges of employing PD approaches in refugee camps, there are observed positive impacts on the wellbeing of refugees and impacts on the hosting communities. Practical implications This paper contests the negativity surrounding refugee camps and has implications on research, practice and society as well as a positive impact on NGO organisations, policy-makers and other stakeholders involved in the governance of refugee camps. Originality/value This paper addresses a critical issue concerning how to include refugees in the design, implementation and maintenance of refugee camps to improve their well-being and fight the feeling of "otherness" for both refugees and host communities. This study extends research on refugee camps by collaborating with refugees to improve their lives within the camps. This research contributes to architectural management and construction studies by providing practical recommendations related to PD methods in new contexts.

Their replacements consume a large sum of money from country's economy which has called for a strategy for their sustainable management. For this, a comprehensive decision-making structure is an utmost requirement. The purpose of this paper is to capture their sustainable management from four aspects, i.e. environmental, economic, social and functional. Design/methodology/approach - The design process follows an extensive review of environmental and life cycle assessments and company context documents. Extracted factors are tailored to community buildings management following expert consultation. However, the resulted list of factors is extremely large, and "factor analysis" technique is used to group the factors. For this, an industry-wide questionnaire across Australian local councils is employed to solicit opinions of the list of factors. Findings - The analysis has pinpointed 18 key parameters (criteria) to represent all four aspects. This paper presents the preliminary findings of the factors and the analysis results based on the questionnaire responses. Practical implications - The final decision-making structure incorporates all these aspects and criteria. This can be used to develop a decision-making model which produces a sustainability index for building components. Asset managers can mainly use the sustainability index to prioritise their maintenance activities and eventually, to find out cost-optimisation options for them. Originality/value - Most notably, this is the first study to apply all four sustainability aspects (environmental, economic, social and functional) to develop a decision-making structure for Australian community buildings' sustainable management.

Smart Cities with Digital Twin Systems for Disaster Management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INFRASTRUCTURE; RECOVERY	Exploiting smart cities with digital twins (SCDT) requires the integration of sensing and simulation across diverse infrastructure systems into community management. Community disaster management can provide a valuable foundation for SCDT development. The current work proposes and tests a conceptual model of a SCDT for disaster management and describes two threats to SCDT development that can be mitigated by focusing development on disaster management. Information loops, as opposed to individual components, are identified as a critical future focus of SCDT development. Primary contributions include support for SCDT development for disaster management, a conceptual SCDT for disaster management model, and a discussion of issues to be addressed in the development and deployment of SCDT for disaster management.

J	Kawakubo, S; Murakami, S; Ikaga, T; Asami, Y				Kawakubo, Shun; Murakami, Shuzo; Ikaga, Toshiharu; Asami, Yasushi			Sustainability assessment of cities: SDGs and GHG emissions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						assessment system; cities; greenhouse gases (GHGs); sustainable cities; sustainability criteria; sustainable development goals (SDGs)	URBAN AGENDA; INDICATORS; CITY	The United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs), the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the UN Paris Agreement, were adopted in 2015. Involvement of not only national governments but also all other stakeholders including local governments is important to promote sustainable development and to achieve the goals. The question arises, therefore, of what methods should be used to best implement and assess sustainability issues at a local level. In this light, a new version of Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), CASBEE for Cities, is introduced for assessing the sustainability of cities and communities around the world based on SDG indicators and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The tool allows users to understand the sustainability of cities and communities based on quality (Q) and environmental load (L) perspectives. The sustainability assessments show that cities in developed countries tend to have good grades for Q, but bad grades for L, while cities in developing countries tend to have the opposite trend. This will assist cities and communities in both developed and developing countries to understand urgent problems and to identify effective solutions for sustainable development.

J	Mohsenil, H; Setunge, S; Zhang, GM; Wakefield, R				Mohsenil, Hessam; Setunge, Sujeeva; Zhang, Guomin; Wakefield, Ron			Markov Process for Deterioration Modeling and Asset Management of Community Buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Probabilistic deterioration prediction; Buildings; Markov chain; Monte Carlo; Genetic algorithm; Risk profile; Cost projection	PARAMETER-ESTIMATION	The current management process for community buildings in Australia is mainly reactive. Data collected using regular inspections are used for maintenance decision making in the period between consecutive inspections, disregarding the future degradation of the assets and the resultant levels of service. Forecasting future conditions using historic data is difficult because of the uncertainty and stochastic nature of deterioration. A major gap in knowledge is the lack of methods for predicting this highly uncertain degradation process for components of community buildings to support a strategic decision-making process. This paper presents a Markov process-based method for deterioration prediction of building components using condition data collected by the City of Kingston in Australia. Markov transition matrices for building components have been derived using a modified method combining the genetic algorithm with Monte Carlo sampling called direct absolute value difference, which offers superior accuracy. The derived matrices are validated using a new data set collected in 2011. Fourteen transition matrices for building components are proposed. The paper presents a typical decision-making method based on the Markov process. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Karvonen, A				Karvonen, Andrew			Towards systemic domestic retrofit: a social practices approach	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy efficiency; housing; retrofit; social practices; socio-technical; sustainable consumption	GRASS-ROOTS INNOVATIONS; EXISTING BUILDINGS; SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION; HOUSING STOCK; ENERGY; STRATEGIES	The UK housing stock will play an important role in achieving the 2050 national carbon reduction targets. Upgrading the energy performance of the existing housing stock is a significant challenge because retrofit activities are shaped by a wide range of fragmented policies, programmes and actors. Existing approaches to housing retrofit focus on regulations, financial incentives and information provision, but it is argued these are insufficient to realize large-scale, deep changes in energy consumption. An agenda is proposed for systemic domestic retrofit to realize radical changes in the housing stock through community-based partnerships. These programmes are based on a social practices approach that promotes social innovation. Wide-ranging energy-efficiency upgrades can be achieved through the development and realization of customized solutions to local groups of houses through facilitated engagement between occupants, housing providers, community groups, local authorities and construction professionals. Community-based domestic retrofit programmes serve to reframe the governance of household energy performance and suggest alternative routes for realizing significant reductions in energy demand through changes in the socio-technical configuration of materials, competences and images of domestic energy practices.

Design/methodology/approach Stakeholders and CFs were identified through literature review and document analysis. The Delphi method was used to screen the extracted stakeholders and CFs. The focus group methodology was applied to obtain evaluation matrices of relationships between stakeholders and CFs. A two-mode social network was formed to analyse the evaluation matrices generated. Findings Results of the analyses indicate that local governments and policymaking institutions, together with project investors, obtained high prioritisations in the stakeholders' group, whilst senior citizens and caregivers appear to rank last. For CFs, communities' environmental factors receive the most attention from stakeholders. Research limitations/implications Results of the analyses can only show similarities of the participating stakeholders' opinions on their concerns, and provide researchers and practitioners with initial ideas on analysing stakeholders and CFs at the briefing stage of promoting AFCs. For a specific project, the concerns and prioritisations would change. Diverse voices are necessary and case studies are in need. Practical implications Challenges in promoting AFCs in urban China are discussed, and a preliminary framework of the briefing stage is developed for practitioners to follow when promoting AFCs. Originality/value This study discusses which CFs should be considered priorities and what consensuses are generally reached by stakeholders. CFs are utilised to interpret stakeholders' relationships, influences and concerns on AFC projects when conducting the social network analysis (SNA).

The challenges to the infrastructure sector presented by climate change can only be met through collaboration between the climate science community, who evaluate what the future will likely look like, and the engineering community, who implement our societal response. To facilitate this process, the authors asked: what progress has been made and what needs to be done now in order to allow for the graceful convergence of these two disciplines? In late 2012, the Infrastructure and Climate Network (ICNet), a National Science Foundation-supported research collaboration network, was established to answer that question. This article presents examples of how the ICNet experience has shown the way toward a new generation of innovation and cross-disciplinary research, challenges that can be address by such collaboration, and specific guidance for partnerships and methods to effectively address complex questions requiring a cogeneration of knowledge.

This has necessitated the adoption of predictive models in interpreting outcomes in the property market in the future. Earlier studies have been oblivious of such models' outcomes as it affects any focal group, particularly the vulnerable. This present study focuses on the low-income earners found in the slum. The Ijora community in Lagos was the highlight of this study, particularly Ijora Badia and Ijora Oloye, regarded as slums according to the UNDP report. The entire fifty-two (52) local agents in the Ijora community were surveyed in cross-sectional survey research that entailed the questionnaire's issuance. The nexus of data collection, pre-processing, data analysis, algorithm application, and model evaluation resulted in retrieving rental values within the years 2010 and 2019 on two predominant residential property types of self-contain and one-bedroom flats found within the community. Three selected algorithms, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, were essentially used as classifiers but trained to predict the continuous values. These algorithms were implemented through the use of Python's SciKit-learn Library and RapidMiner. The findings revealed that though all three models gave accurate predictions, Logistic Regression was the highest with low error values. It was recommended that Logistic Regression be applied but with much data set of property values of low-income earners over much more period. This study will contribute to the Sustainable development goals(SDG) 11(Sustainable cities and communities) of the United Nations to benefit developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Implementation constraints in social enterprise and community Public Private Partnerships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public Private Partnership; Risk transfer; Project organization	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; LEAN CONSTRUCTION; OWNERSHIP	Public Private Partnership (PPP) employs private sector expertise and skill to provide public goods and services. We examine three community PPP projects to identify critical success factors of the project outcomes. Two conclusions particularly stand out: first, the project must be aligned with both the public and private parties' business and service plans, and second, appropriate management structures and procedures must be established for obtaining this alignment. The latter effect recognizes the need to implement appropriate project governance practices including management discipline and expertise. We investigate these ideas further and present specific guidelines for PPP project design and implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

An interdisciplinary group of academics and a self-assembling public of a North English town co-produced bottom-up' visions for a future local energy system by emphasizing local values, aspirations and desires around energy futures. The effects of participatory modelling are considered as part of a community visioning process on participants' social learning and social capital. This paper examines both the within-process dynamics related to models and the impact of the outside process, political use of the models by the participants. Both a numerical model (to explore local electricity generation and demand) and a physical scale model of the town were developed to explore various aspects of participants' visions. The case study shows that collaborative visioning of local energy systems can enhance social learning and social capital of communities. However, the effect of participatory modelling on these benefits is less clear. Tensions arise between inspiring' and empowering' role of visions. It is argued that the situatedness of the visioning processes needs to be recognized and integrated within broader aspects of governance and power relations.

To examine the inter-organizational networks that form to coordinate resources for infrastructure reconstruction, we employed social network analysis in 19 communities in the Philippines following Super Typhoon Haiyan, at 6 and 12 months post-disaster. To build these networks, we analysed interview, field observation and documentation data collected from non-governmental organizations, local governments and communities. A survey questionnaire was also administered to organizations working in selected communities to validate networks. Results from network analysis established that information was the most commonly shared resource by organizations, followed by financial, material and human resources. Government agencies had the highest actor centralities; however, qualitative data suggest that these roles were the result of obligatory consultations by international organizations and lacked legitimacy in practice. Findings further demonstrate that networks become more decentralized over time as actors leave and roles become more established, influenced by short-term expatriate contracts and the termination of United Nations supported cluster coordination. Findings could help organizations strengthen humanitarian response efforts by attending to resource allocation and knowledge sharing with other organizations.

This is despite the enormous untapped potential of the facilities management sector to create social value in the communities in which they operate. To address this gap in research, this paper presents an in-depth case study of an innovative social procurement initiative developed by a major Australian facilities management organisation. Integrating research in the fields of employment studies, facilities management and social value, it provides new empirical evidence of the significant affective, cognitive, behavioural and situational social value outcomes which can be generated through facilities management. These are best achieved through new hybrid partnerships between business, government, not-for-profit, community and educational organisations which create shared value, underpinned by a common interest in maximising social value for the communities involved. More research is needed into the types of attributes, skills and resources that facilitate such outcomes, the attributes of organisations most likely to be able to collaborate and the types of cross-sector partnerships which work.

This research has chosen Communities of Practice (CoPs) as the subject of discussion for an assessment model to reform organizations that undertake CoPs for collective knowledge to enhance their core competencies. Given the interrelationships between criteria, this research uses the nonadditive fuzzy integral to develop a framework for the CoPs performance assessment. The purposes of this paper are to identify the key dimensions/criteria in the CoPs, to use fuzzy logic method to analyze the relative importance of each criterion, and to rank the criteria so that proper resources can be allocated while managing the CoPs. Through interviews with experts, four strategy alternatives and 16 criteria along four dimensions are generated. A survey of the CoPs practitioners is then conducted to compare the results of each criterion. The results will not only help organizations that intend to initiate changes via the CoPs activities to decide the ranking of their appraisal criteria, but it can also assist them in guiding the behavior of their staff while effectively monitoring and improving the performances of the CoPs.

J	Turk, Z				Turk, Ziga			Construction Informatics in European research: Topics and agendas	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper presents past and future research themes in construction informatics as perceived mostly by a community of researchers active in European Information Society projects. It is based on a survey that was conducted in the fall of 2003, mostly among the participants of these projects. The research themes are structured according to a topic map of construction informatics that classifies the R&D themes into core themes and support themes. Core themes create knowledge related either to information processing activities or communication and coordination activities. The support themes address the knowledge transfer process and include identification of research needs. transfer, deployment, and impact of research. It has been found that this research community believes that a breakthrough in the themes related to e-business and e-commerce has been made. Collaboration, integration, and data management were and will continue to be the dominant themes. A growing interest was identified in knowledge-based technologies, including knowledge management. intelligent software, and intelligent interfaces. The research efforts were mostly dedicated to requirements analysis and prototyping. The community realizes that in the future, more attention should be paid to the follow-up commercialized industry deployment and the study of the impact of the developed technologies. It plans to continuously specialize in the construction-specific issues and has only few ambitions to advance state of the art computer science or informatics in general.

Spanning Cultural and Geographic Barriers with Knowledge Pipelines in Multinational Communities of Practice	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TEAMS; WORK; ORGANIZATION; DIVERSITY; NETWORKS; ROLES	Multinational construction and engineering companies are increasingly adopting communities of practice (COPs), as a means to encourage geographically dispersed and culturally diverse professionals to share knowledge on a global basis. If successful, these COPs form rich, knowledge sharing networks; they mobilize a company's global knowledge base, allowing expertise to be applied when and where it is needed with relatively little managerial oversight. Conversely, geographic and cultural silos within COPs may form due to homophily, the social tendency of individuals to connect with similar others. These silos limit knowledge flows and curb the strategic advantage of a global workforce. Through empirical analysis of social network questionnaires and semistructured interviews, the research reported in this paper analyzed network patterns within three COPs to determine if geographic and cultural silos exist, identify structural patterns that defy homophilous trends, and explore why these network-level patterns exist. The research reported in this paper found that, in the absence of intentional organizational structuring and strategic control, silos induced by homophilious behavior were standard for global communities of practice. To encourage knowledge exchange across geographic and cultural boundaries, managers can create mutual task requirements, provide opportunities for connection through integrated training and learning experiences, and encourage workforce mobility among different geographic and cultural locations.

This adaption includes the development of new professional roles that challenge established structures, roles and communities of practice. In order to better understand the unfolding of construction project practice in an increasingly changeful world new professional roles are explored as liminal roles. The studied professional roles are partnering manager, building logistic specialist and BIM coordinator. Liminality is used as framework to understand descriptions of liminal experiences when negotiating boundary interfaces in construction project practice. Findings are both theoretical and practical and suggest that new professional roles practice multi-liminal work and acknowledge tensions that pose challenges for liminal roles to act as change agents.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Review						communities of practice (CoP); complexity; narratives; organizational learning; project learning; project management	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; CAPABILITIES; EXPERIENCE; CREATION; OUTCOMES; SYSTEMS	The need to learn from one project to the next is clearly of vital importance, but is often neglected. Furthermore, there are fundamental issues within projects that inhibit such learning, such as the temporary nature of project organizations and the fundamental complexity of projects. This paper surveys the diverse literature that can help explain these factors and help projects to learn, and describes a large survey of project managers to look at what actual practice is and how successful it is perceived, as well as some empirical work. From this, a number of general conclusions are drawn as to how to create project organizations that are learning organizations.

Service-Learning Assessment: Sustainability Competencies in Construction Education	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable development; Construction management; Engineering education; Sustainability; Competencies; Assessment; Service-learning; Construction education; Construction education; Construction materials and methods		Under the umbrella of a departmental initiative termed CM Cares, faculty from Colorado State University have developed a service-learning course to teach and implement concepts related to sustainability in construction education. The course has met with significant success and received recognition from community partners, elementary to graduate students, faculty members, and department and university administration. Beyond the positive response to experiential learning and community action, this paper uses data from the second course offering to assess the course's effectiveness for teaching sustainability competencies. The writers implemented multiple techniques to collect data and assess perceived learning with regard to sustainability competencies. Techniques included surveys, reflection essays, and concept maps. Overall findings were mixed but suggest that significant learning about sustainability can occur using service-learning as a teaching technique in construction education despite (and perhaps because) students question the value of what they have learned and how to implement it. Specifically, students report increased appreciation of the challenges as well as benefits related to sustainability. The contribution of this paper is the successful application of community-based research constructs to a service-learning course case study to assess its effectiveness at developing key sustainability competencies. By documenting a successful case study, this paper supports future efforts to integrate sustainability into construction education, encourages further and similar course development, and provides a model for future service-learning assessment research.

J	Wang, YH				Wang, YH			Coordination issues in Chinese large building projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								After the year of 1990, many large-scale building projects mushroomed in China due to the increase of construction investments. From that time, many designers from the Western countries stepped into this new market to find new opportunities. Their appearance stimulated some positive changes of the local community, but also raised many concerns. The writer made a survey of seven projects in China designed by foreign design firms. Using the information from the survey, this paper evaluates the positive and negative effects of the foreign design on the Chinese construction market and the local community. According to the survey, one of the most conspicuous negative effects is the coordination issue between the foreign designers and the local project participants. This paper analyzes the different backgrounds of the Chinese and the Western construction industries as well as other factors that contribute to the coordination issue. It also evaluates and proposes some measures trying to solve this problem.

J	Shealy, T; Klotz, L				Shealy, Tripp; Klotz, Leidy			Well-Endowed Rating Systems: How Modified Defaults Can Lead to More Sustainable Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSUMER CHOICE; QUERY-THEORY; DECISIONS; PRODUCT; ACCOUNT; ANCHORS; CONSTRUCTION; UNCERTAINTY; PERSPECTIVE; VALIDATION	Rating systems are often used as design/decision tools to evaluate, grade, and reward infrastructure projects that meet sustainability criteria such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, preservation of wildlife habitat, and accessibility to community cultural resources. Embedded within any such rating system is choice architecture, which refers to the way information is presented to a decision maker. This research examines the impact on design choices of changes to defaults in the choice architecture of the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure. Currently, the default score in each category of Envision is zero points. Points are earned by improving upon industry norms. To test the impact of changing these defaults, participants (senior-level and graduate students) randomly received either the current Envision version or a modified version with a higher default score, endowing participants with points in sustainability. All participants used their randomly assigned rating system to design an outdoor community center and stream restoration brownfield site. Simply modifying the default, by endowing points, led to setting significantly higher design goals. There were no significant differences in other variables measured, including student motivation or perceptions about Envision or sustainability. These findings suggest that how choices are presented to engineers influences their decision-making process and can lead to higher sustainability goals. The construction engineering and management community can use this understanding to encourage more desired infrastructure outcomes. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Loosemore, M; Lim, BTH				Loosemore, Martin; Lim, Benson Teck Heng			Mapping corporate social responsibility strategies in the construction and engineering industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; strategy; shared value; sustainability; Australia; New Zealand	UK CONSTRUCTION; ENTERPRISES; CITIZENSHIP; DISCOURSE; PROJECT; PEOPLE; PATH	Interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is growing in response to societal and regulatory demands that construction businesses contribute positively to the environments and communities in which they build. While, CSR research in the construction and engineering industry is progressing there has been little research into whether and how firms in this industry operationalize CSR, how they incorporate CSR into their business vision, leadership and mission and strategies and what forms these strategies take. In addressing these gaps in knowledge, a survey of 104 firms from across the construction and engineering industry and its supply chain in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. The results indicate that CSR in construction and engineering firms is largely informal, unsophisticated, compliance driven and in its early stages of development. There is little strategic focus in CSR initiatives and the potential social capital derived from better strategic relationships with communities appears to be largely wasted. Conceptually, it is concluded that there is a need to adapt current models of CSR practice, developed in a permanent business context, to reflect the transitional, nomadic and project-based nature of construction. Current models of CSR are inadequate at explaining how firms operating in the construction industry need to practically adjust and adapt their CSR strategies to fit with the constantly changing political, social, cultural, environmental and economic profiles of local communities and the requirements of clients and local governments.

However, finding the right degree of openness is challenging, especially in complex open innovation ecosystems. The interdependencies and dynamics related to the choice of openness are not well-understood. This paper investigates the role of openness as a competitive mechanism. Specifically, we research how openness affects firms' interactions with user communities and how it changes the preference structure of customers. We build a longitudinal case study in the open source gaming handheld industry and trace the evolution and the dynamics of firms, user communities, and their interactions. We find that a suboptimal level of openness can pose a threat to a firm's very existence. Further, we identify repeated patterns characterizing the dynamics in the ecosystem. Based on these patterns, we propose a framework of the dynamics of openness. Our paper contributes to the literature on open innovation. We illuminate the relevance and the dynamics of openness as a dimension for competition. This paper also contributes to the literature on user innovation by showing a shift from manufacturer-based to user-based innovation over the course of the product lifecycle.

The most successful outcome for a megaproject would be achieved when it creates values fairly for stakeholder community to satisfy them. Therefore, because of the resource constraints, megaprojects should create value for stakeholders proportional to the value that they put into it. This article proposes a framework for priority setting in stakeholder engagement based on the balance of mutual value creation between the megaproject and stakeholder community. In this way, we developed an innovative and systematic approach by drawing on stakeholder theory, value creation theory, expectation disconfirmation theory, and fuzzy set theory while adopting from data envelopment analysis (DEA) concepts. This study contributes to the theory and practice of engineering management by examining stakeholder engagement to satisfy stakeholders fairly in megaprojects. Particularly, this study categorizes stakeholders based on the proportion of their salience to expectations to three main types: Modest, Fair, and Demanding. This typology will provide a road map for managers to prioritize the responses to stakeholders' expectations. Finally, we applied the proposed approach for a real case of a megaconstruction project (MCP).

A case study of a small development in northern Colorado used both life-cycle cost (LCC) and environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) to better exemplify how this goal might be attained and also provide environmental benefits. By choosing community-scale technology (CST) for wastewater treatment application, the developer obviated the need to construct 10.46km of main sewer line needed to connect to an existing centralized wastewater treatment facility. By eliminating the need for the 10.46km main sewer line, the LCC, global warming potential from greenhouse gasses, energy use, and hazardous waste creation and disposal were reduced significantly. In the future, the use of CST in redevelopment planning for shrinking cities may have additional benefits to area residents and landowners. This work is significant to decision makers in the wastewater treatment community for two reasons. First, it provides alternatives for sewer districts to consider in the design phase of new and redevelopment projects that could impact scope, first costs, and LCC, all of which flow through to the user in a fee structure. Second, it is the first study using LCC and LCA to focus on sustainability considerations of wastewater infrastructure in shrinking cities and redevelopment applications.

Despite the growing importance of nonwork-related VCs, only limited research has been conducted to examine the factors affecting their members' motivation and organizational commitment. This study investigated the critical role of leaders in motivating the members of nonwork-related VCs. The influence of the members' perceptions of two leadership styles-consideration (relationship-oriented leadership) and initiating structure (task-oriented leadership) on the members' motivation was examined. We also tested the moderating effects of the members' perceptions of three sources of power to determine how these sources could increase the leader's influence on the members. The results obtained from 92 individuals in various nonwork-related VCs showed the significant influence of the leader's consideration and initiating structure, as perceived by the members, on the members' motivation and organizational commitment. An additional finding indicated that the influence of the leader's initiating structure on the members' motivation and organizational commitment was greater than that of consideration. Furthermore, expert power had a positive moderating effect on the relationship between the leader's consideration and the members' motivation while reward power and legitimate power had negative moderating effects. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

Prior studies primarily focused on reducing risk through reinforcement of supply-side reliability. However, during or after a disaster, electricity demand is likely to vary (e.g., electricity use may increase for disaster relief supply production or decrease because of governmental energy conservation policies). This study examined the impact of demand-side responses from industrial, commercial, and residential sectors on the performance of the power grid when supply shortages occur after earthquakes. Electricity supply and demand in the context of seismic hazards were modeled based on the system dynamics approach, and the model was tested with seismic hazards that occurred in South Korea in 2016. The simulation results showed that without supply growth after seismic hazards, the blackout decreased as much as 6.7% of daily electricity use in the case region when commercial and residential sectors give positive aid for participating in mandatory or voluntary demand control, or both. This finding demonstrates the critical role of demand-side management, which can regulate electricity consumption to improve community resilience. The outcomes of this research have the potential to support governmental policymaking to determine optimal values of generation capacity expansion, load shedding, and voluntary savings to prevent supply shortages and oversupply.

J	Stenberg, AC				Stenberg, Ann-Charlotte			Green ideas travelling across organizational boundaries	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						community of action; community of practice; green building; identity construction; innovation; organizational culture; policy implementation; sense-making; travel of ideas		In the last few decades, environmental commitment has become a powerful discursive means of mobilizing actors and developing distinct organizational identity. However, the prevalent uncertainty in society concerning the interpretation and operationalization of concepts, such as `green', `sustainable', `environment' and `ecology' allows for interpretative flexibility. Accordingly, individual members or groups of members in organizations operationalize the concept green in ways that make sense to their working contexts' specific ontology, epistemology and ideology. Based on a comparative case study of three Swedish municipal housing companies, the paper examines how green ideas are translated as they travel across organizational boundaries, and how these notions become embedded within different organizational processes, and thus set external as well as internal boundaries. The underlying assumption is that the meaning of `green' shifts depending on which organization and sphere of society is in perspective. Therefore, the paper traces spatial shifts in meanings of `green' as these travel across organizational boundaries, from the local governmental authority, via the Parent company, to the three individual companies studied. Comparing the companies' official environmental statements with the organizational members' representations of green shows discrepancies in talk and action, which may have implications for the companies' internal identity as well as for the creation of an external image. Furthermore, these discrepancies are traced to different communities of action and practice, i.e. those who make strategic environmental decisions in the companies are not the same as those who possess environmental expertise.

Method for Comparative Performance Assessment and Evaluation of Consolidating Community Water Systems as a Regional Water System	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Water supply; Measurement; System analysis; Water distribution systems; Regional development	EFFICIENCY	Community water systems (CWS) are facing significant external forces for change from decreasing water-resource availability, stricter water-quality regulations, decreasing levels of federal subsidy, increasing public scrutiny, decreasing financial health, and increasing infrastructure replacement costs. (The Environment Protection Agency defines a community water system as a public water supply service that serves at least 25 people or 15 connections year round.) The combination of these external forces necessitate increasing consolidation responses by small CWS. The results of the consolidation response are significant economy of scale benefits such as the elimination of service duplication and greater buying power through bulk-rate purchasing. However, the consolidation and subsequence operations of small CWS as a regional water system (RWS) requires the development of a method for comparative performance assessment and evaluation that facilitates open and transparent decision making. (A regional water system is defined as a collection of similar CWS that operate under a single governing authority.) The goal of this paper is to propose such a method for comparative PAE for consolidating CWS that operate as a RWS. The objectives of the paper are: (1) to propose a standard efficiency metric (SEM) parameter for the performance assessment of CWS; (2) to propose a standard efficiency comparison metric (SECM) parameter for the summative evaluation of performance that permits benchmarked comparison among CWS; and (3) to demonstrate how the proposed SEM and SECM parameters promote open and transparent decision making within the RWS.

Unfortunately, the community has not embraced the value of model validation, leaving practitioners with little information on the uncertainties present in a given model and the model's predictive capability. In this study, we present a machine learning technique known as support vector regression (SVR) together with rigorous validation for modeling lateral spread displacements and outline how this information can be used for identifying gaps in the data set. We demonstrate the approach using the free face lateral displacement data. The results illustrate that the SVR has relatively better predictive capability than the commonly used empirical relationship derived using multilinear regression. Moreover, the analysis of the SVR model and its support vectors helps in identifying gaps in the data and defining the scope for future data collection.

The simulation framework is comprised of a group of independent simulators that interact through a publish-subscribe pattern for data management. The framework addresses the spatial and time-dependent interactions that arise between lifeline systems as a hazard and subsequent restoration processes unfold. The simulation results quantify how operability loss and recovery time may be underestimated if the interdependencies between lifeline systems are not properly taken into account. The effect of insufficient resources on recovery was investigated, and it was demonstrated that among the six resource allocation strategies studied, the time-varying strategies that are responsive to actual conditions on the ground had a better effect on resilience. This paper demonstrates the power of connecting simulators using the publish-subscribe method in order to account for multiscale interdependency and time-dependent effects on community resilience.

Drawing specifically upon the ideas of institutional logics and institutional work, this paper explores the tensions, ironies and contradictions of the rigour-relevance debate; and the challenges and opportunities facing construction management research (CMR) and its institutions in furthering management and organizational research agendas. In doing so, attention is directed to the complex, contested and changing nature of the knowledge base within the business and management field; as well as key differences between that community of practice and CMR.

Such decisions can significantly impact the socioeconomic recovery of displaced families and available budgets for other postdisaster activities. To address these challenges, a new holistic temporary housing planning framework is proposed to offer customized housing plans tailored to the specific social, economic, and psychological needs of displaced families while controlling expenditures. This paper presents the theoretical formulation and implementation details of the community-based housing response pool, which is a comprehensive framework that aims at (1)quantifying the specific needs and preferences of each displaced family, (2)evaluating the ability of housing alternatives to meet those needs, (3)computing temporary housing life cycle costs, and (4)optimizing housing decisions accordingly. The paper also presents an application example to demonstrate and evaluate the optimization model capabilities.

Ethnographic Theory-Building Research in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Research; Construction management; Theories	WORK; VIEW	Traditional construction research methods have enabled focused but narrow advances in our understanding of industry phenomena. While contributing new insight, these methods are often not adequate to enable understanding of the complex interactions that lead to many of the industry's pervasive social and technical problems. One means of addressing these limitations is for the construction research community to complement prevalent quantitative and case study methodologies with qualitative theory-building methodologies, specifically ethnographic studies or those based on detailed and long-term observation of project environments. This paper identifies the critical need for theory-building methods and their methodological conventions, challenges, and opportunities. Specifically, the paper focuses on data collection in ethnographic studies and analysis of that data through the use of grounded theory. Through better understanding and more widespread use of theory-building methods, the construction research community can provide a needed complement to the current prevailing methods and greatly aid the maturation of our important field.

Aside from the apparent mystery of how the Japanese advanced so quickly with the technology are such related issues of importance to policymakers and managers as: Did government contribute to or detract from the Japanese success? How did the major Japanese electron-tube producers, unlike their U,S, counterparts and dominant firms in numerous other industries undergoing a major shift in technology, successfully make the transition to the new technology? This paper explores the history of the commercialization of the transistor radio, Japan's first successful semiconductor product. The history is organized into a theoretical framework to help permit systematic comparison and analysis.

Detecting failures in conservation practice in relation to cultural significance: the case of heritage buildings in Khartoum	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						conservation; building evaluation; reuse interventions; cultural significance; heritage values; Khartoum; Sudan	MANAGEMENT; AFRICA; WORK	Heritage buildings are valuable assets to the community. Thus, they require continuous monitoring to preserve their values. But, in many cases, these values are influenced negatively due to improper interventions. Cultural heritage significance is a core value that should be preserved. Therefore, this study focuses on examining the impact of physical alterations on this value to detect the failures in conservation practice in Khartoum. Through this research, three selected cases of the colonial era are evaluated according to the cultural heritage criteria. Conservation experts of architectural, archaeological, and civil engineering backgrounds are interviewed for this evaluation. Then, the outcomes are analysed to diagnose intervention problems. They reveal that the most negatively impacted values are architectural, aesthetic, and technical. Failures are the results of legislative problems, the lack of awareness, end users' interference, the unqualified workmanship, political interests, and community exclusion. Hence, this paper provides suggestions to enhance future practice.

J	King, N; Majchrzak, A				King, N; Majchrzak, A			Concurrent engineering tools: Are the human issues being ignored?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; DESIGN; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT	Concurrent engineering (CE) tools are intended to. increase the concurrency of multidisciplinary design by integrating various enabling technologies such as computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, group decision support systems, expert systems, and communication networks. If the long term viability of CE depends on effectively developing and deploying CE tools, the assumptions about how CE design tasks are most successfully performed and the roles of tools in facilitating that work should be carefully reviewed. This paper identifies the human factors assumptions made by the CE tool development community and compares them to conclusions drawn from existing literature on the role of technologies in performing technical work. This comparison suggests that the assumptions made by the CE tool development community are likely to inhibit CE tools from successfully enabling the CE process.

A framework called LENSES (Living Environments in Natural, Social, and Economic Systems) is presented that can address the type and scale of change necessary. This framework outlines a process to help communities and project teams create places where natural, social and economic systems can mutually thrive and prosper. LENSES is both a process and a metrics tool designed to help teams establish goals and to explore effectively relationships and interconnections in order to create restorative and regenerative places. The strength of LENSES lies in its ability to help groups consider concepts and elements often missing in other frameworks and tools such as inclusivity, financial sourcing, cultural resources, regional context, education, shared authority and governance, and on-going prosperity. LENSES provides a clear path to facilitate movement toward regenerative, place-based solutions in the built environment and beyond.

J	Loosemore, M				Loosemore, Martin			Social procurement in UK construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social procurement; Social enterprise; Construction; Social value; Procurement; Community; Corporate social responsibility	AUSTRALIA; CONTEXT	Recent developments in the field of social procurement mean that in the future, firms tendering for major construction and infrastructure projects will need to demonstrate that they are not just efficient in project delivery, but also contribute positively to the communities in which they build. The emerging social enterprise sector represents a potentially innovative and sustainable opportunity to meet this new challenge but is poorly understood and grossly under-represented in the construction industry. Through interviews with twelve leaders of successful social enterprises operating in the construction industry, it is concluded that many changes are needed to traditional procurement practices to grasp this opportunity. These include unbundling work packages, reducing tender compliance burdens, changing traditional perceptions of 'value' which revolve around lowest price, incorporating social value requirements into existing subcontracts and challenging the dominant role of supply chain incumbents and ingrained negative stereotypes of the disadvantaged groups which social enterprises employ.

J	Koch, C; Bendixen, M				Koch, C; Bendixen, M			Multiple perspectives on organizing: projects between tyranny and perforation	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Rethinking Construction - Managing Projects as Complex Social Settings	JUN 24, 2004	Univ Warwick, Coventry, ENGLAND		Univ Warwick	collaboration; communities of practice; consultancy management; consulting engineering; interaction; organizational structure; project management; team integration; workplace effectiveness	KNOWLEDGE; ORGANIZATION; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT	Consulting engineering companies strive for more innovation and flexibility as a response to the contradictory demands from the organization and an unpredictable business environment. In doing so, knowledge management strategies, project organization and the redesigning of office spaces are employed. A five-year longitudinal set of ethnographic studies uses multidisciplinary perspectives to examine organizational change and development in a consulting engineering firm. The analytic approach encompasses three dimensions: the development of the firm itself, the way in which it organizes its projects and the spatial/community dimension. This enables an understanding of the multiple, often contrasting, organizing dynamics in the organization as well as diverse interests and groups found within this type of organization. It finds that it is not only the clients of the company who rule in a 'project tyranny', but also other organizing dynamics that in contrast 'perforate' the projects and maintain professional communities. The 'tyranny' of projects affects the allocation of resources and the scheduling of work can constrain organizational and other innovations. An attempt to create a new organizational grouping in the studied engineering consultancy to 'perforate' the project-based structure and improve internal interactions within the organization reveals that although spatial integration is obtained, too few resources are allocated to support the change. The implications for other consulting engineering organizations are the need for multiple organizing principles and management to bridge contradictory and competing concerns for skill development, resource alignment and innovation efforts; and a need to focus on soft management practices such as mediation, brokering and coaching.

Best practices for municipal asset management require municipalities and communities to clearly define and state their respective goals that reflect their expectations in terms of level of service. The challenge lies in the fact that asset performance from a community perspective may be quite different from that of a municipal perspective. There is need to interrelate the two perspectives and accordingly determine the optimum quantity of improvement required in the condition of a municipal asset. A complete solution should lead to the most appropriate technique for asset rehabilitation. A methodology to address these issues is proposed and illustrated that identifies and adopts: (1)a model to express asset level of service, (2)a model to measure asset condition based on performance, and (3)a fuzzy logic-based method that maps the level of service to the asset condition rating. Based on the inputs of these models, a structured method for analyzing the capacity and suitability of rehabilitation techniques is designed. Case study of a water main is presented to illustrate the concept and to quantitatively demonstrate the implementation of the methodology. This methodology will assist municipal asset managers to quantify the condition improvement required in their assets, in order to meet service goals, and to thereby make more informed decisions on the type and priority of rehabilitation.

J	Fan, C; Jiang, YC; Mostafavi, A				Fan, Chao; Jiang, Yucheng; Mostafavi, Ali			Social Sensing in Disaster City Digital Twin: Integrated Textual-Visual-Geo Framework for Situational Awareness during Built Environment Disruptions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EVENT DETECTION; MEDIA; RESILIENCE; TWITTER; INFORMATION; RISK	This paper proposed and tested an integrated textual-visual-geo framework to enhance social sensing techniques in smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Effective and efficient disaster response and recovery require reliable situational awareness regarding infrastructure disruptions and their societal impacts. Due to the rapid unfolding and evolution of events in disasters and emergencies, typical data sensing techniques (such as remote sensing and satellite images) are not sufficient to gain reliable situational awareness about disruptions that affect communities at a local scale. Social sensing enables gathering and analyzing massive user-generated data from various sources (social media, in particular) to monitor unfolding of localized events such as infrastructure disruptions and community needs. To advance social sensing methods and their integration into digital twins of cities, this study proposes an integrated framework for detecting infrastructure disruptions based on three information elements embedded in social media content: images, texts, and geo-maps. The framework consists of three main methods: a graph-based approach for detecting critical tweets, an image-ranking algorithm for selecting important images, and a kernel density estimate for estimating the geographical scales of the disruptions. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study of water release from flood control reservoirs in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The findings illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework for capturing the critical situational information and interpreting the results for situational awareness and disruption response. The proposed framework can enhance integration of social sensing elements into smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Accordingly, the proposed framework can improve the ability of community members, volunteer responders, residents, and other stakeholders in coping with built environment disruptions in disasters.

CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.

Design/methodology/approach - From a phenomenologically informed critical participatory perspective the authors focus on contradictions within the practices of community development (CD) by attending to the interplay between the dominant project form of organizing that frames those practices and the rhetoric of "development". Findings - Drawing on two CD examples, the authors illustrate and discuss the contradictions and damaging consequences of the developmentalism-projectification double-act. The position is that social good is local and contextual and draws expediently and contingently on the means through which it can be achieved by the collective action of those who co-define and co-create the social good. Social implications - The authors propose that there is a need to open the dialogue with development practitioners, funders, project managers, project workers, and the recipients and stimulate multiple participation. Originality/value - The authors believe the critical participatory approach that the authors have taken to CD project management could be both novel and useful as it refocuses attention to non-performative aspects of CD, arguing for de-naturalization of project organizing logic and encouraging emancipation from dominant epistemic inequalities. With an uncompromising focus on embedded practices, the authors hope to spur further debate on the important issue of CD and the possibilities of creating "social good".

Relatively little is however known about the exact roles played by traditional authorities, who are powerful public representatives and significantly influence the public and the stakeholder management process on PPP projects worldwide. A case study of a PPP was conducted to explore this question. Through a thematic analysis of data collected from multiple sources, four main roles of traditional authorities were identified: mediation; project monitoring; community representation; and custody management of community culture and physical resources. These roles and their associated outcomes make traditional authorities a crucial link between project executors and the public during stakeholder management. This study provides a step towards developing strategies for collaborating with traditional authorities for better stakeholder management of the public on PPP projects.

Evidence from practitioner narratives and the agile development literature is inconclusive. This empirical study of successful projects aims to answer the following question: what factors in the project and its environment are indicative of software development agility in successful projects? Members of the PRINCE2, PMI and agile communities of practice were engaged via local interviews and an international survey. The interviews, which employed the card sort technique, provided preliminary answers. Analysis of the survey data revealed that software development agility was indicated by a project environment factor (organizational culture) and a project factor (empowerment of the project team). The contents of these factors may assist practitioners to reflect on their development practices, and to negotiate change to achieve higher rates of project success. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on qualitative research within UK construction projects we examine how four different theoretical approaches (positivism, structural Marxism, interpretivism and actor-network theory) all challenge this managerial assumption. Each theoretical perspective enables a specific analysis of empirical data that critiques the notion that project failures are easily, simply, or largely, associated with the failure of project management. In so doing, our pluralist analysis reveals the social and political contextualization of performance in project management. We thus conclude by proposing that practitioner and scholarly concerns with project failure (and success), can actively contribute to attempts to reflect upon various matters of political concern as developed within the Making Projects Critical community, and by extension Critical Management Studies. Thus, we propose greater interaction between critical and mainstream project research communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Oreszczyn, T; Lowe, R				Oreszczyn, Tadj; Lowe, Robert			Challenges for energy and buildings research: objectives, methods and funding mechanisms	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						buildings; climate change; de-carbonization; energy; knowledge transfer; public policy; research policy; trends		This commentary reflects on a series of strategic questions facing the energy and buildings research community and research funding bodies in the UK. These include the problems of research capacity and funding, the need to find a new balance between competition and cooperation between research groups, and a need for a renewed focus on the empirical performance of buildings. The authors argue that conventional distinctions between research, development and the deployment of technologies are inappropriate for the built environment. A wider range of approaches to research is needed to enable researchers to engage more effectively with stakeholders throughout the research, development, and deployment process, to reduce the distinction between research and knowledge transfer, and to reduce the length of learning cycles. Without such developments, there is a risk that the energy and buildings research community will be reduced to commenting on accelerating developments in the real world and, at the same time, an increased risk that the massive investments currently being envisaged in the refurbishment and decarbonization of the built environment will underperform.

We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with a megaproject team and analysed their social media communications with the project community. The findings show three ICT practices used for managing external stakeholders: visualisation, simulation and social mediatisation. Taking a sociomateriality lens we demonstrate how these practices are used for diverse unintended uses to manage external stakeholders. Anchored in a dimensions of power framework, we discuss how these ICT practices were strategically used for persuading, framing and hegemonizing external stakeholders in megaprojects. Theoretically, we highlight the role of ICT for managing external stakeholders over the current use of improving the competitive advantage of internal stakeholders. Practically, social media is used to articulate practices in all the strategic roles, positioning it in a role as a critical ICT tool for external stakeholder management in infrastructure megaprojects.

This study examines the current usage of SM within the construction industry. It also analyzes the potential risks and rewards and the collaborative and innovative aspects of these online applications. To understand this, an SM log was developed to track activity on popular SM platforms for 10 construction organizations. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from construction organizations that were familiar with SM as a company resource. The main finding was that traditional SM platforms are being used within the daily operations of construction companies. Popular sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are being used to share industry events with the communities of followers. LinkedIn, on the other hand, is being used to develop professional networks and assist in recruitment. However, conventional forms of communication, e.g., emails and telephone calls, continue to be the preferred methods of connection with vendors and subcontractors. Uses of SM for collaborative and innovative initiatives outside the organizations' boundaries are minimal. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Drawing upon insights from theory and research on communities of practice, forms of knowledge production, processes of structuration and institutionalisation, it highlights the diversity and complexity in the field of project management practice, theory and research and harnesses these ideas to highlight the opportunities and tensions this diversity creates. In considering the implications for the institutionalisation of project management as a professional body of knowledge and academic discipline, the argument is developed that there is not only great value to be gained by pursuing these lines of enquiry further, but also that there it is important to acknowledge diversity within the field and encourage criticality in perspective.

Rethinking sustainability frameworks in neighbourhood projects: a process-based approach	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						BREEAM-C; collaboration; community participation; ecological urbanism; neighbourhood; planning; stakeholders; sustainability assessment systems		A process-based approach is used to examine the deployment of two neighbourhood-scale sustainability assessment systems and their tools in two European cities. It explores how these sustainability assessment systems and their tools are contextualized within a larger design and planning process by considering how stakeholders collaborate, how they set design problems, how they make decisions and how they propose design solutions in the early design phases. Specifically, using interviews conducted with key project actors in Malmo, Sweden, and Barcelona, Spain, this paper examines how the sustainability assessment systems in each respective case study were framed, and how this framing impacted upon the design process. A key finding is that how sustainability assessment systems are framed has just as significant an impact as the nature of the tools, especially on the processes entailed. Community participation can have a strong, positive impact on the design process and on outcomes. The case studies confirm that context and players cannot be divorced from tools.

J	Chand, AM; Loosemore, M				Chand, Anumitra Mirti; Loosemore, Martin			Hospital disaster management's understanding of built environment impacts on healthcare services during extreme weather events	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hospitals; Learning; Resilience; Disaster management; Built environment; Extreme weather events	SEISMIC RESILIENCE; FOCUS GROUPS; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which hospital disaster planners and managers understand the role of built infrastructure in delivering effective healthcare services during extreme weather events (EWEs). There is substantial evidence to indicate that many hospitals are vulnerable to EWEs. This is alarming given community reliance on hospitals during times of natural disaster and the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of EWEs. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, resilience and learning theories are combined to produce a new conceptual model which illustrates how hospital disaster managers learn about the relationship between health outcomes and built infrastructure during EWEs to build future hospital resilience. In this paper, the first part of the conceptual model, concerning the development of disaster management plans is explored and refined using a thematic content analysis of 14 Australian hospitals' disaster plans and supplementary plans. Findings - The findings indicate high variability of understanding about the role of built facilities in health outcomes during an EWE. There appears to be a widespread and highly questionable assumption in the health disaster planning community that hospital built infrastructure is highly resilient to EWEs. This means that many hospitals will not be unaware of the risks that their buildings pose in the delivery of healthcare services to the community during an EWE and how to manage those risks effectively. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical framework presented in this paper provides new insights which will enable hospital infrastructure resilience to be better integrated into health service disaster risk planning and preparedness. The findings can help hospital disaster managers learn about and adapt their built environment to changing healthcare needs during EWEs. Originality/value - By integrating learning and resilience theories in a built environment context, this paper provides new insights, both theoretical and practical, into the important role of hospital infrastructure in planning for EWEs.

J	Dunn, S; Gonzalez-Otalora, S				Dunn, Sarah; Gonzalez-Otalora, Samuel			Development of an Adaptive Solution to Increase Infrastructure System Resilience Based upon a Location-Allocation Methodology	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure system; Resilience; Geographical information system (GIS); Location-allocation; Climate change	MODEL	Infrastructure systems are critical to the normal functioning of our modern communities, enabling access to essential resources and services and also providing a platform for social and economic growth. These systems are currently being subjected to a multitude of challenges and must, therefore, adapt to ensure the needs of society can continue to be met. Perhaps the most problematic of these challenges is climate change. The high level of uncertainty within long-term climate projections means that they cannot reliably be used as a basis for informed decisions to permanently alter existing assets or change the design of infrastructure assets (through alteration to design codes, for example). Therefore, we need new tools to ensure our infrastructure systems are resilient by using adaptable approaches, which do not require accurate long-term climate scenarios to inform decisions. This paper develops a modified location-allocation modeling approach, which can provide an adaptive solution that utilizes deployable resources to increase the resilience of infrastructure systems. Specifically, this approach can be applied to indicate the optimal location to store resources so as to ensure a baseline level of service to our communities, either through the protection of critical assets (e.g., mobile flood defenses and grit storage) or the provision of a temporary service (e.g., electricity generators). The approach we have developed is based upon a modified location-allocation analysis, which determines an optimal location for one or more resource sites to provide supplies to a given set of demand points (e.g., hospitals and community centers). The novel contribution of the work is to the development of a methodology to assign a weighting to assets with only qualitative attributes within the location-allocation methodology. We use ArcGIS to undertake the analysis and apply our methodology to a real-world infrastructure case study and natural hazard threat.

J	Schiavone, F				Schiavone, Francesco			Vintage Innovation: How to Improve the Service Characteristics and Costumer Effectiveness of Products Becoming Obsolete	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communities of practice; costumer effectiveness; old technology-based products (OTBPs); service characteristics; technical efficiency; technological change	TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION; AGE	A number of studies analyzed how old technology often improves its technical performance or rate of innovation after technological change. Many authors focused on the "technical part" of old technology-based products and analyzed their improvements of performances in relation to gains in technical efficiency (more efficiency leads to more technical performance). However, such improvements could be analyzed even from consumer side. This paper adopts the Saviotti and Metcalfe theoretical framework in order to analyze such costumer-related perspective. The present conceptual paper contributes to the literature by explaining an innovative approach for the improvement of service characteristics (performance) and costumer effectiveness of products becoming obsolete after the emergence of a new competing technology. The name proposed for this approach is vintage innovation. This paper reports an illustrative case study: the vinyl emulator for turntablists disc jockeys. This approach shows that companies have to focus, paradoxically, their R&D efforts on new technology in order to improve costumer effectiveness of declining products. In particular, vintage innovation generates value for companies when users form a community of practice.

It utilizes data from the 2008 Community Innovation Survey covering 9054 sample firms from 14 European countries. Results derived from multiple-method empirical analysis indicate that investments into acquiring different knowledge sources will generate different values, depending on key contextual factors. In particular, we find that for firms following explorative innovation strategy (focused on developing new products, processes, and technologies), investments in own-generated and bought-in knowledge will improve innovation performance, whereas for those following exploitative innovation strategy (focused on refining existing products, processes and technologies), only investments in bought-in knowledge will create a positive impact on innovation performance. Additionally, firms that simultaneously pursue both exploration and exploitation (ambidextrous innovation strategy) will have maximal innovation performance by investing into all three types of knowledge sources. This study hence contributes new insights regarding the strategic choice of knowledge source.

Retrofit measures to reduce the vulnerability of residential buildings to wildfire include improvements that hinder, mitigate, or prevent damage from wildfire heat and embers to building exteriors and within the parcel limits. The objective of this study is to provide a cost model for optimal retrofit planning for residential properties by integrating multiattribute vulnerability rating systems, on-site wildfire vulnerability assessments, property characteristics, and uncertainty in homeowner preferences. Integer programming is used to find the optimal combination of retrofit activities that leads to the minimum vulnerability mitigation cost for 389 residential properties in Santa Fe, New Mexico. A cost model is derived for wildfire retrofit planning for residential properties. Although this study was conducted on a specific study area, the framework introduced in this study presents a planning tool for large-scale retrofit planning for urban or suburban buildings that can be used and adapted for other types of natural hazards and in other communities.

This research study examines the characteristics and location of demolished buildings in Finland as well as motives behind the demolition decisions. A statistical and geographical analysis was performed on a dataset of all 50818 buildings demolished in Finland between 2000 and 2012. In the Finnish context, the study shows that the amount of demolition, the size of the community, demographic development and construction activity are all interconnected. In general, the larger the community, the more it gains inhabitants and the more is built as well as demolished. The data confirm that removals from the building stock are a result of conscious deliberation. Non-residential buildings dominate the amount of demolished floor area. In addition, they are much larger and younger at the time of demolition than residential buildings, which consist primarily of detached houses. Demolitions are geographically concentrated: cities account for 76% of demolished floor area; and city cores for as much as 44%. Public policy needs to include demolition to reduce environmental impacts and improve resource efficiency.

Therefore, a methodology is needed to determine adaptation measures that are most beneficial to all members of society. In this paper, a framework is proposed for producing an adaptation strategy that minimizes conflict between stakeholders. This framework casts the process of organizing climate change adaptations as a game and defines each community member as a stakeholder, each adaptation measure as a strategy, and the minimization of loss from future climate change as a payoff. In a case study involving sea level rise in Suncheon Bay, Korea, this framework is used to generate an optimal plan for minimizing conflicts while considering the losses of the central government, local governments, and local communities. The game theoretic results from the proposed framework enable a balanced distribution of responsibilities among stakeholders to achieve infrastructure adaptation to climate change.

J	Behnisch, M; Ultsch, A				Behnisch, Martin; Ultsch, Alfred			Urban data-mining: spatiotemporal exploration of multidimensional data	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; data-mining; Geographic Information Science (GIS); spatiotemporal analysis; urban analysis		'Urban data-mining' describes a methodological approach to reveal logical or mathematical and partly complex descriptions of patterns and regularities inside a set of geospatial data. The cyclical methodology procedure is characterized by six main tasks following the initial step of data collection: data inspection, structure visualization, structure definition, structure control, operationalization, and knowledge conversion. Geovisualization and spatial analysis supplement the process of knowledge conversion and communication. The multidimensional mining approach is presented as a case study applied to 12 430 German communities to analyse multidynamic characteristics between 1994 and 2004. In particular, Emergent Self Organizing Maps (ESOM) are performed as an appropriate method for clustering and classification. Their advantage is to visualize the structure of data and later on to define a number of feasible clusters. A good evidence-base for decision-makers and the implementation of planning tools would be the spatiotemporal exploration of multidimensional data leading to specific details, explanations and abstractions in the context of dynamic community behaviour. The presented techniques are expected to be of increasing interest for the management and development of building stocks, as well as for urban and regional planning processes.

CIB's unique position within the international construction community allowed it to initiate a specific sectorial response to the international agendas raised by Brundtland, Habitat II, Rio and Kyoto. CIB's recognition of the problems in establishing both a framework for sustainable development; how change within industry occurs, along with CIB's past, current and proposed activities meant that CIB was perfectly suited to respond to sustainable development. This GIB-led project resulted in global collaboration and co-ordination to specifically address sustainable development for the construction community. Situated between the broad international agendas and more local and subsectorial agendas, CIB's Agenda 21 is a conceptual framework that serves as an intermediary and provides for comparison and co-ordination. The three principal objectives are: to create a global framework and terminology that will add value to national, regional and sub-sectorial agendas; to create an agenda for CIB activities and for co-ordinating CIB with specialist partner organizations, and to provide a source document for definition of R&D activities.

J	McKenna, A; Baunie, G				McKenna, Allen; Baunie, Georges			Complex project conceptualization and the linguistic turn; the case of a small Australian construction company	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Linguistic turn; Complex project conceptualization; Pragmatism; Strategy; Change projects; Systems thinking	STRATEGY; FUTURE	Conceptualizing complex projects, especially in the face of powerful communities of conflicting stakeholders can be messy. Doing so requires some means of coordinating the different ideas of stakeholders. The pragmatic cultural ethics summarized in the Australian 'mate-ship' argues success requires opportunity be given to all. This pragmatic philosophy provides the solution by offering all stakeholders the opportunity to be heard. After briefly reviewing pragmatism, this paper draws on the work of McKenna and Metcalfe and the linguistic turn, published in an earlier version of the International Journal of Project Management. It explains how this method can be used to help project managers conceive projects made complex by powerful communities of conflicting stakeholders. It then uses an Australian based organizational change project as an example of its application. Idea mapping is used to categorize stakeholder statements, revealing underlying linguistic concepts. It is argued that this approach provides a practical, yet philosophical and scientifically sound means of conceptualizing complex projects, and one that takes genuine advantage of the experience and knowledge of a wide range of stakeholders.

In particular, can they initiate better dialogue in order to foster stakeholder engagement in planning, building and living in low-carbon settlements? These challenges inform a municipal planning process for a new neighbourhood in Trondheim, Norway: Broset, as well as for an interdisciplinary research project exploring the role of action research in supporting the transition to low-carbon societies. The processes are described for identifying the central actors and applying the dialogue strategies in the early planning project phase. Researchers and planners collaborated to contribute to new knowledge production and practice to support the transition to low-carbon societies. The utility of the co-produced results is their potential contribution to both standards of rigour as well as the timely dissemination of research and knowledge sharing within and across research communities and to different stakeholders involved in the project. This case study provides interesting lessons about why and how other projects can consider similar action research processes as a viable approach for sustaining the transition to low-carbon economies, particularly in the early planning phase.

Utility-scale energy prices from solar installations are now comparable to all other forms of generation, and the cost of residential system installation has dropped on average by 70%, before incentives. However, the factors explaining this trend extend beyond falling prices. This paper presents a data-centric framework, grounded in machine-learning theory, to estimate solar installations as a function of social, economic, and demographic factors. By doing so, the authors seek to identify the key influencing factors of a community's adoption of renewable energy. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed data-centric framework, the state of California was selected as a case study. Results indicate that differences in population-adjusted adoption rates can be largely explained by variations in key factors such as income, race, political leaning, average electric power consumption, and solar radiation. By analyzing these differences, decision makers can devise effective incentive mechanisms to nudge homeowners toward improved access to renewable technology.

Although many recognize the valuable information attainable in this way, the evidence is likely to be disturbed, and collecting information rapidly is critical for timely disaster response. Many proposed approaches use either physical- or social-sensing data, and are not implemented in real time, and therefore cannot assess disaster impacts holistically and timely. It also is challenging to integrate multisource data with disparate data modalities and resolutions, and to accommodate large-volume, high-rate input data for real-time computations. Therefore, we propose an assessing disaster impact in real-time (ADIR) system which harnesses cutting-edge computation and geovisualization platforms. ADIR processes heterogeneous data for humans, hazards, and built environments, and outputs multiscale disaster impacts. The usefulness and effectiveness of ADIR were demonstrated in the city of Houston, which was affected by Hurricane Harvey. ADIR provides a platform for multiagent coordination during community response and recovery, which contributes to more-resilient communities by potentially reducing life and property losses.

J	Kaminsky, J; Javernick-Will, A				Kaminsky, Jessica; Javernick-Will, Amy			Theorizing the Internal Social Sustainability of Sanitation Organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sanitation; Legitimacy; Organizations; Developing communities; Decoupling; Social sustainability; Organizational issues	COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; LEGITIMACY; PROJECTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Onsite household sanitation technologies such as septic tanks or latrines serve a large percentage of the world's population. Unfortunately, they experience high failure rates after construction, with resulting environmental and public health consequences. Previous work has suggested that these failures are often a result of an inability to navigate the technology-society nexus. In other words, they represent problems of social sustainability. In order to address this urgent problem, theory is built regarding the social sustainability of infrastructure systems by leveraging established organizational theory. To do this, household level interview data is collected in four communities in rural Bangladesh. Virtually all households in this research population have constructed onsite sanitation systems, typically using their own resources. However, almost half of these systems have since fallen into disrepair, mirroring the high socially based failure rates cited globally from similar systems. Using cross-case qualitative analysis and legitimacy theory, the writers explored what differentiates those households that continue to use and maintain sanitation systems (those with socially sustainable systems) from those that do not (those with socially unsustainable systems). Households in the unsustainable group have adopted toilets ceremonially, with construction decoupled from the actual practice of maintaining and using the sanitation system. Understanding infrastructure abandonment as a form of organizational decoupling gives researchers a new way to analyze and try to solve the problem of postconstruction infrastructure abandonment. Specifically, effectiveness concerns (whether or not desired infrastructure services are actually achieved) and competing rational myths (beliefs regarding how and why things ought to be done) drive decoupling and lead to abandoned sanitation. In order to recouple sanitation structure and practice for continued use and maintenance of onsite systems, designs should consider both effectiveness and competing rational myths. For example, by requiring odor management technology for all improved sanitation infrastructure, infrastructure effectiveness is improved (by delivering odor management) and also the commonly held rational myth of miasma (odors causing illness) is addressed. Therefore it is suggested that, as researchers revise the almost expired millennium development goals, technologies without odormanagement should be removed from the definition of improved sanitation due to negative contributions to social sustainability. Further, concern with status (likely stemming from community led total sanitation development methods) appears at a similar and high rate in both the socially sustainable and socially unsustainable household groups; it does not differentiate the two groups. Finally, technical support is needed to address effectiveness concerns, share knowledge, and help households move away from ceremonial sanitation adoption and towards locally desired benefits such as improved convenience, odor management, and public health protection.

This paper addresses one specific aspect of spatial data accuracy issues, namely, linear measurement (length measurement), through a transportation case study. In the case study, an alternative to distance measurement instruments (DMI) was proposed to determine road lengths for interstate highways in North Carolina. In the proposed alternative, the road lengths were calculated by overlaying GIS roadway linework over elevation data-in this case the National Elevation Dataset, which was developed based on U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 min digital elevation models and calculating a centerline roadway slope distance. The results of this approach were collected and compared with DMI lengths to assess the accuracy of the proposed approach. Error sources were tentatively identified and control mechanisms were discussed. Computer tools and models used to model surfaces and roadway linework are emphasized in this paper. The computer algorithms used for length calculations and accuracy assessment are described. This research concluded that, by carefully controlling quality of both the roadway linework data and the elevation data, GIS programs can be written to provide accurate length measurements to the transportation community. Furthermore, instrumentation like global positioning systems, high resolution cameras, and precise odometers can be combined to create productivity enhancing automated engineering systems.

Exploring scenarios for the future of energy management in UK property	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Buildings; energy management; future planning; property sector; resilience; scenarios; uncertainty		The most appropriate responses to the energy management of buildings from now until 2050 are investigated through a process of scenario planning. A qualitative, explorative approach was undertaken to develop four 2050 scenario end-states resulting from an axis of two critical uncertainties not closely correlated: the attitudes of society towards sustainability; and the availability of energy. These scenarios were applied to the property industry through expert workshops, from which trends and themes were identified. The findings are that the property industry should prepare for a transitional period with an uncertain outlook. Therefore, it would be prudent for this industry to focus on resilient performance under a diverse set of futures, and plausible shock events, rather than optimizing for today's conditions. This could be challenging in a sector that works on relatively long time scales. Aspects that should be incorporated into property industry strategy are suggested: responding to the potential effects of climate change; understanding what drives communities and investing in buildings that are significant to the community's functions; considering transport links as key to successful property investments; adopting the latest technological innovations; and becoming more 'full service' and interdisciplinary. A need for a paradigm shift in the industries' practices was also identified.	[Parkinson, A. T.; Friedman, K. S.; Hacking, T.; Cooke, A. J.; Guthrie, P.

J	Blismas, NG; Dainty, ARJ				Blismas, NG; Dainty, ARJ			Computer-aided qualitative data analysis: panacea or paradox?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						computer-aided; data analysis; inductive; methodology; qualitative research; research methods		Following the methodological debate within the construction management research community in the 1990s, research studies adopting inductive methodologies have increased. Many such projects have adopted computer-aided qualitative data analysis in order both to facilitate the research process and to ensure methodological rigour and transparency. However, there remains a paucity of critical discourse within the construction management research literature about the impact of such approaches on the depth and rigour of the resulting analyses. This paper posits that so-called computer-aided approaches have the potential to affect detrimentally the outcomes of construction management research if researchers see such tools as a panacea for ensuring the rigour and transparency of their work. Paradoxically, computer-aided approaches often restrict rather than aid the analytical process. The paper draws upon the authors' experiences of using a leading package from which a number of considerations for the use of computers in qualitative data analysis are discussed. It is concluded that the research community would benefit from an open debate on whether computer packages really do provide a panacea to the analysis of qualitative data in applied construction management research projects or whether their use merely provides a label with which to convince sceptical positivists of the rigour of inductive research techniques.

J	Harty, C; Leiringer, R				Harty, Chris; Leiringer, Roine			The futures of construction management research	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction management; futures; institutional trends; academic fields	BUSINESS; SCIENCE; FIELD	Construction management is an internationally recognized area of research with an established and growing community of academics. It has grown from largely research consultancy activities to additionally attracting significant amounts of academic research funding and has, partially, moved away from its applied, engineering dominated origins to increasingly engage with, and contribute to, mainstream academic debates in business and management, economics and the social sciences. It has, as such, become an academic field in its own right. However, recent dynamics within both university institutions and national economies are changing the landscape of construction management research (CMR). A blurring of traditional university boundaries, reprioritization of research funding and increasing emphasis on national and international rankings have led to increased pressure on individual academics and the community they constitute. Drawing on scenario development we ask what, in the face of a turbulent environment, might the futures of CMR be? Four potential futures for CMR are outlined, depicted as four potential scenarios: convergence, retrenchment, disappearance and hybridization. These describe potential outcomes from the institutional dynamics currently at play. The intention is neither to predict the future, nor to prioritize one scenario over another, but to open a debate on the institutional pressures the field is facing, and what the outcomes might be.

Mechanisms to Initiate Knowledge-Sharing Connections in Communities of Practice	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Networks; Organizational issues	MANAGEMENT; TEAMS; WORK; VIEW	Within many construction and engineering organizations, communities of practice (CoPs) have become an important means for managing knowledge. They are employed to connect employees with technical specialists, which should reduce repeated mistakes, improve technical practice, and generate thought leadership. While organizations often implement CoPs as a means for coordinating specialist knowledge, very little is known about how professionals actually locate and connect with one another, making it difficult for organizations to employ CoPs effectively. To better understand how professionals identify and connect with colleagues, this research first conducted social network analysis to identify existing connections within three intraorganizational CoPs comprised of 1,791 members in two organizations, and then conducted and analyzed 77 interviews about dyadic connections to determine how individuals within these CoPs connected. From this analysis, four mechanisms of connection were identified, including organizational control, organizational opportunity, social networks, and non-person-centered searching. These connection mechanisms include a hybrid of social and organizational structures, reinforcing the need to strategically create and manage CoPs in project-based organizations. More specifically, these conclusions suggest that managerial control within CoPs is still an important mechanism to facilitate knowledge-sharing connections within distributed CoPs.

J	Kaminsky, J				Kaminsky, Jessica			Institutionalizing infrastructure: photo-elicitation of cultural-cognitive knowledge of development	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Developing communities; institutionalization; sustainability; visual methods	CONSTRUCTION GLOBAL EVIDENCE; SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; NATIONAL VALUES; LEGITIMACY; PHOTOGRAPHY; ACCEPTANCE; DIFFUSION; DESIGN; HEALTH; IMPACT	Infrastructure that goes unused - for example, after constructing the first water, electricity, sewers or road infrastructure in an infrastructure-poor community - is a common issue in new infrastructure development in the global south. In this case, while infrastructure has diffused, it has not become institutionalized. To better understand this problem, photo-elicitation methods are used to explore cultural-cognitive frames used by research respondents as they create and explain photograph symbols that represent change in their built environment. For example, respondents advocate for infrastructure they have reason to believe outsiders will provide as they evaluate the infrastructure against local utility in an early phase of institutionalization. Respondents also frame the research undertaking as an opportunity to actively diffuse infrastructure practices they have recently adopted themselves. By making these and other frames explicit, the photo-elicitation method reveals the elusive cultural-cognitive pillar of institutionalization and also provides insight into sources of self-reporting bias. The method also has particular advantages for research dealing with disadvantaged respondents, reduces issues of free recall bias and increases the length and depth of research interviews. Given the relative novelty of this method in construction research, its theory, advantages and limitations are discussed in some depth.

Use of remotely sensed data to support building damage assessment is a logical choice considering the difficulty of gaining ground access to the impacted areas immediately after hurricane events. However, a remote sensing based damage assessment approach is often only capable of detecting severely damaged buildings. In this study, an airborne LiDAR based approach is proposed to assess multi-level hurricane damage at the community scale. In the proposed approach, building clusters are first extracted using a density-based algorithm. A novel cluster matching algorithm is proposed to robustly match post-event and pre-event building clusters. Multiple features including roof area and volume, roof orientation, and roof shape are computed as building damage indicators. A hierarchical determination process is then employed to identify the extent of damage to each building object. The results of this study suggest that our proposed approach is capable of 1) recognizing building objects, 2) extracting damage features, and 3) characterizing the extent of damage to individual building properties.

Recent studies attribute this gap to insufficient use of energy-efficient technologies by occupants. This paper focuses on the governance of domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems in the UK during the provision stage, an overlooked area in the previous energy-efficiency studies that have mainly focused on PV adoption and practices by occupants, but only after installation. The notion of translation in Actor Network Theory (ANT) is used to analyse how a network of PV provision actants decides the system design and integration into homes, and how this in turn conditions household participation in this network. Semi-structured interviews and video tours used in four participative community and two non-participative community case studies reveal the impact of non-human actants in terms of how PV scripts and practices are formed by PV professionals. The finding also shows that the nominated procurement occupants' were the key mediators in the participative projects, while the housing developers were the key mediators in the non-participative projects.

J	Kaminsky, J				Kaminsky, Jessica			The global influence of national cultural values on construction permitting	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Culture; permitting; global projects; social sustainability; regulation	IMPACT; INFRASTRUCTURE; MANAGEMENT; INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; FRAMEWORK	This research discovers how national level culture shapes construction permitting across 62 nations. Hofstede's cultural dimensions explain variability in components of World Bank's dealing with Construction Permits index, which measures the number of required permitting procedures, the required time in days, the cost as a percentage of a standardized warehouse value, and a permitting quality index. After controlling for gross domestic product, statistically significant relationships between permitting time and Hofstede's Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity-Femininity dimensions emerged. Hofstede's Power Distance Index shared statistically significant relationships with the number of procedures required for permitting, and a limited relationship with the cost of permitting. These data provide empirical evidence that different cultural preferences lead to different construction permitting practices, and allow the construction community to better understand the culturally shaped ways in which permits govern projects. This builds the theory of social sustainability of infrastructure, which seeks to generalize ways to match construction practice to societal preferences to improve community and project outcomes. For example, policy makers may use the results presented here to shape more culturally appropriate construction permitting regulations. In another example, construction firms may use these results to navigate permitting challenges they encounter on global projects.

J	Kaminsky, J				Kaminsky, Jessica			The fourth pillar of infrastructure sustainability: tailoring civil infrastructure to social context	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Developing communities; Markov chains; qualitative methods; sanitation; sustainability	LIFE; INSPECTION; MARKOV	This research proposes technical performance over time as a fourth pillar of sustainability theory for infrastructure. It also describes a method that allows us to discover how changes in the technical pillar (operationalized as reduced breakage rates) may moderate the influence of the social pillar (operationalized as repair rates) on sanitation infrastructure outcomes. Oral histories were used to develop a history of sanitation for each of 152 poor households in four rural communities in Bangladesh that have gained access to sanitation in the past decade. Transcriptions and qualitative coding identified reported states of sanitation (for example, broken vs. functional) at three time steps. These were used to develop an initial vector and transition matrix for a Markov chain analysis. The breakage rate in this model was then adjusted to investigate the impact of improved technical durability on sanitation outcomes. For the case analysed here, we found that increasing infrastructure durability by 50% (an estimated increase of two years) increased the rate of functional sanitation system use at model convergence from 54% to 88%. Increases in durability also caused households to use private rather than shared systems. Beyond this specific case, the generalizable theory and method presented here are analytic tools that permit targeted technical accommodation of social contexts specific to individual project sites.

Identification of Social Sustainability Criteria in Building Energy Retrofit Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable development; Social sustainability; Energy retrofits; Delphi; Concept mapping	CONSTRUCTION; QUALITY; DESIGN	Building energy retrofits aim to reduce the energy consumption of existing facilities. The most significant impact of any energy retrofit project is during the operation phase of a building, when a building's users are directly impacted. This study focuses on the building operation phase by evaluating the social dimension of sustainability in energy retrofit projects. This study aimed to identify, categorize, and organize the social sustainability criteria of energy retrofit projects in existing buildings. A three-stage methodology was used that selected qualified experts in the targeted population, employed a Delphi technique to identify criteria for measuring social sustainability in energy retrofit projects, and used concept mapping to organize the identified social criteria. The study identified 19 social sustainability criteria that can be categorized in six clusters: occupants' health and comfort impact, society enhancement, cultural and community education, project stakeholder enhancement, building quality and technology enhancement, and socioeconomic growth. An empirical framework was developed for considering the impact level of social sustainability criteria in energy retrofit projects, including three levels: building, community, and society. The proposed framework can be used by practitioners who seek to consider or evaluate the social impacts of energy retrofits as well as policy makers who investigate the social aspects or social costs of energy reduction programs.

Beyond feedback: introducing the "engagement gap' in organizational energy management	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy-use behaviour; feedback; non-domestic buildings; organizational capabilities; public participation; social practices; user engagement	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; BUILDING COMMUNITIES; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; RESEARCH AGENDA; SAVE ENERGY; GOVERNANCE; BEHAVIOR; WORKPLACE; OPPORTUNITIES; TRANSITIONS	This paper discusses socio-technical relationships between people, organizations and energy in workplaces. Inspired by Sherry Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation, it explores widening energy management beyond energy managers to other employees, introducing the idea of an engagement gap' to support a move beyond unidirectional forms of engagement (e.g. feedback and nudging) to more socially interactive processes. Results are drawn from two projects researching energy practices in public authorities and retail organizations. The first project, GoodDeeds', collaboratively created an information and communication technology tool and explored participatory processes within a municipality. The second project, Working with Infrastructure, Creation of Knowledge, and Energy strategy Development (WICKED), explored energy management in retail companies. The paper uses a 4Cs' framework to articulate the influences of concerns, capacities and technical conditions within organizational communities. The results concur with previous research that energy management sits against a backdrop of competing organizational, institutional and political concerns. New data reveal discrepancies across organizations with regard to energy management capacities and technical metering conditions. The authors suggest employee engagement can be broadened by treating energy as a communal subject for discussion, negotiation and partnership. This objective moves beyond the information-deficit' approach intrinsic in the existing focus on analytics, dashboards and feedback.

J	Stollmann, J				Stollmann, Joerg			Neighbourhood resilience in mass housing: co-production via research-by-design	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						agency; built environment; collaboration; co-production; design education; housing; neighbourhood design; participation; resilience; resourcefulness; urban politics		In the debate on neighbourhood resilience, there is a demand for co-production involving inhabitants in adaptation processes. Neighbourhood resilience is discussed in terms of economic, ecological and socio-political capacities, making place-people relations a key factor. Academia-led research-by-design projects are engaging in resilience-building, but professional roles are still unclear. Architects, planners and urban designers often have limited knowledge about the specific community and the socio-economic impacts of their projects. This especially occurs in modernist mass-housing settlements within current conditions of neo-liberalization. Here, inhabitants and designers have only limited access to decision-making power and resources. More significantly, the spatial improvements might endanger major resources: the social cohesion and affordability of the neighbourhood. Using the concepts of collaboration (versus cooperation) and resourcefulness (versus resilience), this paper discusses the advantages and limits of academic design projects using two cases from the Academy of a New Gropiusstadt (AnG) in Berlin, Germany. Based on a process of community-based research-by-design, these projects activate spatial facilities and employ full-scale interventions to improve local resilience. Resourceful collaboration at the neighbourhood level demands new intermediary actors and designers as advocates with multi-scalar and transdisciplinary knowledge and abilities to assess and engage with the impacts of their co-produced design work.

Within the current resilience imperative', co-production processes involving multiple stakeholders can be a key factor for increasing cities' resilience. Co-produced resilience processes are more successful when embedded in collaborative forms of governance such as those associated with urban commons and when fulfilling needed roles with a community. Through the application of the R-Urban approach in a neighbourhood of Colombes (near Paris), the co-production of a commons-based resilience strategy is described. This involved a group of designers as initiators and a number of citizen as stakeholders of a network of civic hubs. The specific strategies involving a participatory setting, collective governance aspects and circular economies are analysed in the light of co-production theories and practices. Internal and external challenges are identified within the implementation process. The nature of conflicts and negotiations in this co-production approach are discussed, and the role of the architects/designers as agents within the process is investigated. Reflections from this example are provided on the limits and promises of this approach and the lessons learned from R-Urban for collaborative civic resilience.

J	Wallace, D; Wallace, R				Wallace, Deborah; Wallace, Rodrick			Consequences of massive housing destruction: the New York City fire epidemic	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						community stability; housing destruction; neighbourhood social structure; planned shrinkage; public health; public services; resilience; urban life; urban renewal	BIRTH-WEIGHT; TUBERCULOSIS; POPULATION; MULTILEVEL; BALTIMORE; PARASITE; VIOLENCE; STRESS; BRONX	What are the social and economic consequences of massive destruction of housing? A case study of the New York City fire epidemic of the 1970s is presented. Decision-makers regarded old neighbourhoods (with low-income families and/or racial minorities) as wastelands and developed policies such as urban renewal and reductions in public services ('planned shrinkage') which negatively impacted on the physical and social fabrics. Structural and functional continuity even after a disturbance - ecological resilience - depends on many non-disjunctive 'loose' relationships to diffuse these impacts. Systems based on 'tight' relationships amplify impacts. Families with resources relocate and reduce the community diversity and the density of loose ties. Low-income families whose homes are destroyed weaken the remaining social networks. The remnant cannot maintain social norms. This displacement leads to two possibilities: many small social networks that do not interact; or one large tight network with low diversity. The former confers pathological resilience; the latter, extreme fragility. Neither enforces social norms or generates political power. Both foster risk behaviours and hamper socialization of youth. Thus, concentrated housing destruction destroys healthy resilience and social control and support. Indirectly, it elevates the mortality rate through increased risk behaviours, high death rates among vulnerable elderly, and infectious and chronic diseases.

J	Hwang, S				Hwang, Seokyon			Sharing tacit knowledge in small-medium regional construction companies in the U.S.: the current status and the impact of organizational ecology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Tacit knowledge; knowledge sharing; organizational ecology; regional construction companies	VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; MAP	The objective of the present study is to investigate the status of tacit knowledge sharing practice and the impact of organizational ecology on the practice in small-medium regional construction companies in the U.S. This study particularly focuses on the impact of six constructs of organizational ecology identified through a synthesis of previous works. The constructs are employee's awareness and perception of tacit knowledge sharing, functional areas benefited from tacit knowledge sharing, company-wide efforts for promoting tacit knowledge sharing, organizational culture, networking and the communities of practice, and the choice of a means and ICT implementation. To accomplish the objective, this study surveyed practitioners using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, and t-test to compare three cohorts of respondents. All respondents consider tacit knowledge an important asset and are willing to share their knowledge. To improve the current practice, companies should establish formal procedures, provide more training opportunities, allow time for participation in sharing and the codification of knowledge, and invest in enhancing internal communication and collaboration for knowledge sharing. The findings of this study are expected to assist practitioners effectively in creating an organizational ecology for advanced tacit knowledge sharing in the workplace.

Data-driven decision-making requires understanding approaches, practices, and research results from many disciplines, which makes it interesting to investigate whether data science and policy analysis are moving in parallel or whether their pathways have intersected. Our investigation, from a bibliometric perspective, is driven by a comprehensive set of research questions, and we have designed an intelligent bibliometric framework that includes a series of traditional bibliometric approaches and a novelmethod of charting the evolutionary pathways of scientific innovation, which is used to identify predecessor-descendant relationships in technological topics. Our investigation reveals that data science and policy analysis have intersecting lines, and it can foresee that a cross-disciplinary direction in which policy analysis interacting with data science has become an emergent area in both communities. However, equipped with advanced data analytic techniques, data scientists are moving faster and further than policy analysts. The empirical insights derived fromour research should be beneficial to academic researchers and journal editors in related research communities, as well as policy-makers in research institutions and funding agencies.

J	Whitty, SJ; Maylor, H				Whitty, Stephen Jonathan; Maylor, Harvey			And then came Complex Project Management (revised)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complex Project Management; Competency standards; Major projects		The subject of management is renowned for its addiction to fads and fashions. Project Management is no exception. The issue of interest for this paper is the establishment of standards in the area, specifically the 'College of Complex Project Managers' and their 'competency standard for complex project managers'. Both the college and the standard have generated significant interest in the Project Management community. Whilst the need for development of the means to manage complex projects is acknowledged, a critical evaluation show significant flaws in the definition of complex in this case, the process by which the College and its standard have emerged, and the content of the standard. If Project Management is to continue to develop as a profession, it will need an evidence-based approach to the generation of knowledge and standards. The issues raised by the evaluation provide the case for a portfolio of research that extends the existing bodies of knowledge into large-scale complicated (or major) projects. We propose that it would be owned by the practitioner community, rather than focused on one organization. Research questions are proposed that would commence this stream of activity towards an intelligent synthesis of what is required to manage in both complicated and truly complex environments.

Design/methodology/approach - It employs exploratory factor analyses to investigate the interrelationships of the survey items synthesized from the literature by retaining and reorganizing the important information from the original data while redundant information is removed. Findings - The nine theoretical constructs comprising 64 items were coalesced onto five latent constructs comprising 50 items while explaining 50.914 percent of the total variance. The extracted five constructs that describe the best project management practices have been labelled risk management, organizational culture, stakeholder approach, management approach, and project leadership. Practical implications - The study results benefit both practitioners and the academic community as five broad categories of best project management practices are identified and their interdependencies are established. Project management professionals can use the latent factors as the critical factors for project success, whereas the research community can use the authors' results to build higher order structural models and to test hypotheses by linking the latent variables with project performance measures. Originality/value - The study contributes to the discourse on project management by identifying critical practices that contribute to the successful completion of projects.

The recent actions towards the development of an OWL version of the IFC schema (named ifcOWL) evidence the effort of facing the community request to specify IFC in an ontology language. This paper presents an enrichment of the EXPRESS to OWL conversion patterns with OWL class expressions that specifically capture certain constraints of the IFC standard. The presented class expressions can be used to improve the robustness of ifcOWL and support data integrity, consistency, and applicability across various scenarios of industrial application. In particular, the rules defining the relationships between non-abstract subtypes of IfcObject and corresponding subtypes of IfcTypeObject are analyzed and converted into novel class expressions. The proposed additions to the conversion pattern have been implemented into a software tool and the resulting ontology was tested against a use case to show the benefits of the new solution with respect to a basic ifcOWL The novel conversion pattern enhances usability of the ifcOWL ontology by enabling its direct instantiation, without necessarily going through the intermediate generation of a STEP physical format that is then converted into an ontology.

J	Ingirige, B				Ingirige, Bingunath			Theorizing construction industry practice within a disaster risk reduction setting: is it a panacea or an illusion?	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction education; construction industry; construction industry practice; disaster resilience; theorizing	MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; RECONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; PROJECTS; CRISIS; IMPACT; TIME	Construction industry practice is strongly influenced by the culture surrounding its operations and, with the prevailing emphasis on achieving efficiency, there is a strong focus on outcome metrics such as profitability and employee productivity. With the recent increases in natural hazard events worldwide, and the likelihood that this will worsen still further with anticipated climate changes, the industry is increasingly contributing to building resilience within disaster-affected communities. Existing industry expertise, its educational approaches and the related theoretical frameworks, however, all require adjustment if these changing needs are to be fully addressed. Most importantly, an agenda shift is required from the philosophical side and a more pragmatic approach is needed if community resilience goals and objectives are to be met, rather than the narrower focus of the current metrics-driven management system. A synthesis of the current literature is therefore presented, along with relevant case histories illustrating how such an agenda shift within a disaster management context may influence the development of appropriate theory, as well as impacting upon grass-roots educational requirements. The research concludes by discussing how the mainstreaming' of disaster management within construction industry practice could drive forward developments in theorizing expertise and educational provisions across the constituent disciplines.

J	Matto, MC				Matto, Mordecai Chrysostom			Identifying the latent shortcomings of force account projects in Tanzania: the case of construction projects in the education sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Force account; Construction projects; Shortcomings; Education sector; Tanzania		Purpose The study investigates the latent shortcomings of projects implemented under the force account approach. The study offers implications to the policymakers, practitioners and society at large for the effective and efficient application of the force account method in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted an explanatory sequential mixed method of which the quantitative data were collected first and then analysis was performed. Then, the results of quantitative data were used to plan for the collection of qualitative data. The quantitative data were collected from performance audit report while the qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Findings The study identified six (6) general latent shortcomings and twenty-one (21) detailed latent shortcomings. The general latent shortcomings were inadequate planning and designing of the project; inappropriate adhering to the procurement procedures for materials; inadequate contract supervision; lack of qualified personnel to execute and supervise the works; lack of appropriate equipment and tools; and improper recording of cost of materials, labour and overheads in the books of accounts. Research limitations/implications The research focused on the force account construction approach as applied in the Tanzania context. Practical implications The research stresses that policymakers and practitioners are required to evaluate critically the scope and application of the force account mechanism. The force account procedures should be made based on the nature, scope, magnitude and thresholds of the project. The procuring organisations should ensure that the cost-benefit analysis is undertaken before implementing the force account projects. The findings of this study can be used as inputs to the present laws, regulations and guidelines related to the force account projects. Social implications The present study has the potentials to the communities of which force account projects are undertaken. It stresses that the force account method offers employments opportunity to the social communities. Originality/value The study has identified the latent shortcomings of the projects implemented under the force account method. This topic has received attention in Tanzania and developing countries. The study can be credited for its implications to policymakers, practitioners and communities including its emphasis on conducting a cost-benefit analysis.

Mass Customizing Paratransit Services With a Ridesharing Option	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mass customization; Transportation; Organizations; Optimization; Vehicle routing; Standards organizations; Process design; Accessible transportation service; decision analysis; mass customization; service design; vehicle routing problem (VRP)	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; LARGE NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH; A-RIDE PROBLEM; HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS; DESIGN	Paratransit services for people with travel difficulties have received increasing government and community attention due to the aging population. In this paper, we examine an integrated service design approach to customize paratransit services with a ridesharing option for a dial-a-ride (DAR) service. The fundamental challenge of DAR services is a lack of commonality across other services in the process, which results in low vehicle utilization. To mass customize paratransit services systematically, we identify the common service components of different paratransit services under the design framework of product family architecture. We then formulate the community organization & x0027;s pricing and vehicle scheduling decisions with a ridesharing option for a DAR operation as a two-stage decision model. In stage one of the tactical plan, we determine user tolerance of earlier pick-up and later drop-off times, and a price discount for a shared ride. Based on the user tolerance of a longer traveling time, we optimize the vehicle scheduling of shared service orders. Our experimental results indicate that a ridesharing policy option for a DAR service providing a 20 & x0025; discount for passengers who accept a 15-min earlier pick-up time or a later drop-off time leads to 15 & x0025; more people being served.

In this article, we try to outline this development by carrying out a meta-analysis within the leading project management journals. We found that stakeholder theory is predominantly fed by articles from Anglo-American countries and applied in the construction and IT sectors. The understanding of the stakeholder notion is moved towards a more complex view. Articles from different project management areas indicate the key role of stakeholders in projects.

With limited federal, state, and local resources, it is also challenging for decision-makers to establish a meticulous plan for postdisaster transportation recovery. However, previous studies mainly dealt with the specific planning or execution part of the postdisaster recovery process and rarely considered a comprehensive set of objectives in their investigations. This paper aims to develop a new prioritization approach for rapid and optimized postdisaster recovery that evaluates recovery priorities of damaged transportation infrastructure systems and affected regions through a multiagent system using a reinforcement learning technique. The proposed model contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a new optimization framework, considering transportation network recovery, and minimizing the social impact of the current prolonged recovery process on affected communities. This new methodology is expected to help public agencies make an informed decision for distributing given resources and structurally arranging disaster recovery processes of transportation systems by simulating real-world high-dimensional disaster scenarios and optimizing their recovery plans. In particular, the proposed approach pursues to assist disaster-relevant practitioners in considering a holistic perspective for comprehensive decision-making, incorporating diverse factors of planning transportation recovery and assigning their resources according to socioeconomic factors of affected communities.

J	Wang, D; Dai, F; Ning, XP				Wang, Di; Dai, Fei; Ning, Xiaopeng			Risk Assessment of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Construction: State-of-the-Art Review	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction safety; Construction ergonomics; Work-related musculoskeletal disorders; Literature review; Wearable sensors; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Labor and personnel issues	LOW-BACK-PAIN; FLEXION-RELAXATION RESPONSE; MOTION CAPTURE; SELF-REPORT; EXPOSURE; MODEL; POSTURES; SENSOR; SPINE; VALIDATION	Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) have long been a primary cause of non-fatal injuries in construction. They involve sudden or continuous stresses on a worker's musculoskeletal system (e.g.,muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones) and may impair the ability of the worker to perform his or her job, or even cause permanent disability. Although assessing exposure to risk factors of WMSDs has proven to be feasible to alleviate the incidence rate of this injury, the field remains underdeveloped because of a lack of knowledge among construction professionals regarding the enabling techniques and their performance and limits. This paper reviews the available techniques for WMSD risk assessments, summarizes their benefits and limitations, and identifies areas in which further studies are still needed. Current techniques are categorized into self-report, observation, direct measurement, and remote sensing assessment. Particular interests are revealed in the wearable-sensor and vision-based techniques within the construction community. This review helps the industry to better understand the severity of WMSDs and the related risks in construction. This review also provides the construction research community with a holistic view on available techniques, their limitations, and the need for research in achieving automatic assessments on construction sites.

Thus, integrating the asset intervention activities is required to minimize the community disruption and maintain an acceptable level of service throughout the assets' lifecycle. This paper presents an integrated multiobjective asset management system for the road and water infrastructure that enables asset managers to trade off intervention alternatives and compare the outcomes of both conventional and integrated asset management systems. The multiobjective framework considers (1) physical state, (2) lifecycle costs, (3) user costs, and (4) replacement value. It revolves through three core models: (1) a database model that contains detailed asset inventory for the road and water networks; (2) key performance indicator (KPI) computational models for assessing the impact of the intervention plan on the predefined set of KPIs; and (3) an optimization model that relies on a combination of metaheuristics, dynamic programming, and goal optimization to schedule the intervention activities throughout the planning horizon. The system is applied to road and water networks in Kelowna, British Columbia, and the results show 33 and 50% savings in lifecycle costs and user costs, respectively. Moreover, it shows the potential ability to scale the framework to include other infrastructure such as sewer, electricity, gas, and telecom, provided that the information can be shared among these entities.

J	Boz, MA; El-adaway, IH				Boz, Mehmet A.; El-adaway, Islam H.			Managing Sustainability Assessment of Civil Infrastructure Projects Using Work, Nature, and Flow	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Management; Sustainability; Built environment	ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; CONSTRUCTION	The assessment tools available to study the sustainability of the construction processes are limited in their approach and lacking in their content. This can be attributed, for example, to various factors, including (1) differences among the actors within the construction industry; (2) fragmentation of the construction industry and those whom it serves; and (3) regionalism. This paper develops three innovative system-based benchmarks to assess civil infrastructure projects; namely, work, nature, and flow. To this end, work defines the sociobehavioral relationships among the construction products and the actors of the built environment; nature focuses on the effects of the built process on the environment through studying the interaction between the construction actors, their associated processes, and the end products within their host systems; and flow identifies the overall system changes within the community host systems and the effects of these changes on the natural environment and the socioeconomic setting that encompasses the project. Also, this paper tests and evaluates the work and nature benchmarks using two different types of civil infrastructure projects through a three-step methodology comprising survey development, data collection, and analysis. This process provides an improved understanding of the environmental, social, and economic effects of these projects from a systems perspective. Finally, the paper provides a brief overview of the future modeling and simulation activities required to assess the overall community system change using the flow benchmark.

Software ecosystems (e.g., npm) are the primary enablers of this code reuse, providing developers with a platform to share their own and use others' code. These ecosystems evolve rapidly: developers add new packages every day to solve new problems or provide alternative solutions, causing obsolete packages to decline in their importance to the community. Developers should avoid depending on packages in decline, as these packages are reused less over time and may become less frequently maintained. However, current popularity metrics (e.g., Stars, and Downloads) are not fit to provide this information to developers because their semantics do not aptly capture shifts in the community interest. In this article, we propose a scalable approach that uses the package's centrality in the ecosystem to identify packages in decline. We evaluate our approach with the npm ecosystem and show that the trends of centrality over time can correctly distinguish packages in decline with an ROC-AUC of 0.9. The approach can capture 87% of the packages in decline, on average 18 months before the trend is shown in currently used package popularity metrics. We implement this approach in a tool that can be used to augment the npms metrics and help developers avoid packages in decline when reusing packages from npm.

J	Loosemore, M; Higgon, D; Osborne, J				Loosemore, Martin; Higgon, David; Osborne, Joanne			Managing new social procurement imperatives in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Collaboration; Intermediary; Social value; Social procurement; Social innovation	SECTOR; ENTERPRISES	Purpose This paper responds to the need for more construction project management research in the emerging field of social procurement. It contributes by exploring the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and project-based intermediation in meeting new social procurement imperatives. Design/methodology/approach A thematic exploratory case study analysis is presented of seventy-three interviews undertaken with stakeholders involved in a unique project-based intermediary developed by a major Australian construction company to leverage the power of cross-sector collaboration in response to social procurement imperatives on its projects, based on semi-structured interviews with 33 disadvantaged job seekers, 40 organisational stakeholders (employment agencies; not-for-profits, Indigenous, disability and refugee support organisations; training organisations; subcontractors; government agencies and departments; community organisations) and observational and documentary data over the duration of a unique project-based intermediary called a Connectivity Centre, developed by a major Australian contractor to deliver on its emerging social procurement requirements. Findings The results show that cross-sector collaboration within the construction industry can produce highlight numerous cognitive, behavioural, health, situational and affective social impacts for the project community and shared-value benefits for the range of organisations involved. However, it is found that cross-sector collaboration through project-based intermediation in a construction context is challenging due to the fragmented and dynamic nature of construction project teams and the communities they have to engage with. Encouraging people and organisations to collaborate who operate in industries and organisations with different and sometimes competing institutional logics and objectives (even if they are linked by common values) requires a set of knowledge, competencies and relationships not recognised in current global project management competency frameworks. Originality/value This research contributes new insights to the emerging but embryonic body of research into construction social procurement by demonstrating the value of emerging theories of social procurement, social value, cross-sector collaboration and intermediation in enhancing our currently limited understanding of the complex challenges involved in responding to new social procurement requirements in the construction industry. It explores and documents the potential value of project-based intermediaries in developing and managing the new cross-sector relationships, roles, relational competencies and practices, which are required to effectively respond to and measure the impact of emerging social procurement policies in the construction industry. These findings have a potentially significant social impact by providing new insights for policymakers and the construction industry, to optimise the industry's response to emerging social procurement policies.

Despite the increasing attention on the role of the construction industry in disaster resilience, CSR reporting on resilience issues among construction practitioners has yet to be explored. The present study adopted the concept of disaster risk management and stakeholder theory and first established a CSR-resilience evaluation framework with 20 resilience issues and 46 indicators through a modified Delphi technique. Thereafter, a sample of 295 international contractors was selected from the Engineering News-Record (ENR) list from 2014 to 2018, and a systematic content analysis approach was conducted to analyze their CSR-related reports and compare the corresponding results among regions. Results indicated that Asian and Middle Eastern contractors have the highest and lowest levels, respectively, of CSR reporting on resilience issues. Clients' and governments' concerns were given the top priority by all regions, except Chinese contractors emphasized the client's and community's concerns. Asian and Chinese contractors showed a higher emphasis on the community's and employees' concerns than those of partners and suppliers, whereas the European, US/Canadian, and Middle Eastern contractors showed otherwise. The present study contributed to filling in the gap to establish a CSR-resilience indicator system for the construction industry and provided a useful reference to comprehensively understand and measure the CSR reporting on resilience issues by the construction industry.

Creating a Holistic Systems Framework for Sustainability Assessment of Civil Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The available sustainability tools and rating systems need to better incorporate the broader socioeconomic settings associated with the built environment. This paper develops, and contributes to the current body of knowledge, two innovative system-based benchmarks for sustainability assessment. On one hand, the "work" benchmark defines the behavioral relationships between the construction products and actors to study technical, social and cultural, and economic sustainability. On the other hand, the "nature" benchmark defines the interactions between construction processes and the surrounding ecosystems to study environmental, individual, and economic sustainability. The authors developed and distributed an expert survey to validate these two benchmarks. Consequently, to test these two novel concepts, the authors analyzed three different civil infrastructure projects. To this end, the authors evaluated the actors, products, and dynamics within the construction processes and their interactions. The analysis provided insights related to degrees of communication between communities and the construction industry, and highlighted occurrences of a lack of communication. The relationship between the construction industry and its customers was also investigated, and it was clear that within a single construction project, all sustainability indicators can cross boundaries and overlap. Based on the results, the authors succeeded in: (1) defining a holistic sustainability systems-based approach to studying the built environment; (2) assessing the degree of communication between the construction industry and its community host systems; and (3) evaluating the relationship between the construction industry and its customers. For future work, the authors are developing a flow benchmark to predict the overall system change through overtime simulation of human-built environment resource dynamics.

Language as a Resource in Project Management: A Case Study and a Conceptual Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication; language; legitimacy; local communities; project stakeholder	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; PUBLIC AFFAIRS; STAKEHOLDER; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRUCTION; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERSPECTIVE; LEGITIMACY; STRATEGIES; REPUTATION	This study sheds light on how project managers can use language as a resource for communicating with local communities and stakeholders alike, and protect the legitimacy of their decisions and actions. The verbal accounts produced by a senior project management team are examined in-depth. The accounts address the claims raised by residents affected by the expansion of the Heathrow airport. The context for the talk-in-interaction is one of conflicting interests: the promoter undertakes actions to mitigate the impacts of the construction works, but some residents feel frustrated that the business can grow at the expenses of their welfare. The findings reveal that managers tend to acknowledge all claims even when perceiving they lack legitimacy. The analysis of the words and phrasing in the conversational turns that form the accounts reveals three tones-caring, assertive, and apologetic-that managers use intentionally to frame linguistically the acknowledgements. The study discusses how the tones fit with the extent to which, first, managers consider that the claims are factually correct, fair, and precise as opposed to unfair, exaggerated, or opportunistic; and second, managers find technical or institutional references available for constructing the accounts. It also discusses the effects of congruence-or the lack of it-between what managers mean to say about what the project team will do, what managers actually say, how listeners interpret what was said, and what the project team actually gets done.

The social procurement practices of tier-one construction contractors in Australia	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Community; corporate social responsibility; social procurement; social value; social enterprise; third sector	ENTERPRISES	Social procurement is becoming an increasingly important requirement in the delivery of private- and public- sector construction projects across the world, yet there is relatively little research done in this area. Mobilising Furneaux and Barraket's social procurement typology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers from eight tier-one contractors in the Australian construction industry to explore and classify the types of social procurement strategies used in projects, the types of social value created and the barriers to implementation. Documentary data were collected in the form of company policies and contract requirements. Results demonstrate the conceptual merit of Furneaux and Barraket's typology in a construction industry context by highlighting different constraints on social value creation for each type of social procurement. These results also indicate that approaches to social procurement in the Australian construction industry are generally driven by a philosophy of risk mitigation rather than opportunity maximisation, and are confined to low-value and low-risk construction activities and are constrained by a lack of existing and new supply chain social-value creation capacity. Construction industry social value chains are fragile in Australia, and it is concluded that in building the sector's significant untapped capacity to deliver social value to the communities in which it builds, priority should be given to three main strategies: third sector capacity building; barrier-to-entry reduction and skills development in managing new cross-sector collaborations among public, private and third sector organisations.

Robust and coherent reconstruction planning and rapid execution play pivotal roles in ameliorating time-consuming postdisaster recovery. Reconstruction generally constitutes a considerable portion of an entire disaster recovery process that requires significant resources, including materials, workforce, funding, time, and others. To pursue maximum socioeconomic benefits, which can be one of the critical goals of the postdisaster recovery process, optimized recovery strategies should be designed by considering given federal, state, and local resources. Even though recent studies have proposed disaster recovery planning and execution models, they rarely addressed social and economic indicators required for comprehensive postdisaster recovery plans. This paper presents a new postdisaster recovery prioritization model, including social and economic factors, that evaluates priorities of damaged facilities recovery projects in affected regions through a resource allocation analysis. The primary goal of the proposed model is to optimize resource allocation and quantify and maximize socioeconomic benefits for a postdisaster reconstruction project portfolio through multicriteria decision analysis and multiobjective optimization. Also, this research study adopts a modular construction technique as a potential solution for facilitating the recovery processes, which can significantly reduce their time and cost. The proposed model is expected to provide a comprehensive decision-making process for researchers and practitioners to design a postdisaster recovery plan and arrange their available resources by considering the socioeconomic factors of affected communities.

This paper discusses the development of an interdependent network model for vulnerability assessment by combining the characteristics of community IINs and the design of the maximum flow comprehensive index (MFCI) to describe the performance of interdependent networks based on network flow theory. This study is based on the perspective of an infrastructure manager, and identifies the key nodes of interdependent networks by using the optimal attack strategy when dealing with potential external attacks (i.e., terrorism). It is assumed that attackers are sophisticated and will always choose the optimal attack strategy to maximize vulnerability and minimize the performance of interdependent networks. Because it is difficult to identify key nodes in interdependent networks, we proposed a probabilistic solution discovery algorithm (PSDA) that can accurately calculate the final failure state of interdependent networks regarding the interdependent relationships among networks and relationships inside a network. A case study was conducted to validate the proposed method: using MFCI and PSDA. Moreover, the assessment result was analyzed further with a view to improving infrastructure protection and identifying failure propagation paths. The main contributions of this paper are to propose a vulnerability assessment index system and construct a goal optimization with solving algorithm to provide decision support for the infrastructure managers.

Our main finding is that, although project professionals receive support from formal and informal sources, a compensatory mechanism is at play. When support does not come from direct line managers, project professionals are compelled to initiate informal practices, including mentoring, buddy systems, and communities of practice. Practical implications arise for organizations regarding how to ensure sufficient mechanisms are in place to compensate for lack of line management career support and to allow project professionals to access the development opportunities they need by supporting their self-initiated efforts.

The project management community accepted the proposed method as a viable alternative. However, to allow its implementation with a multiproject system, more research was necessary. Seeking to identify the key factors that influence the performance of the multiproject system applying the CCPM method, we performed a case study. Logistic regression analysis showed that applying the CCPM method in a multiproject system allows for better time estimation of activities and facilitates the allocation of critical resources.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an objective and accurate analysis of BIM knowledge using 551 published BIM-related papers and 68 documents of frontier BIM projects in China. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts the mixed method, combining the bibliometrics method with the qualitative method. Bibliometrics was used to analyze 551 BIM-related literatures from China with Citespace 5.0. Qualitative research was used to analyze 68 project documents from China with Nvivo. Finally, the analysis results are compared to obtain the final conclusion. Findings The analysis results of the collected BIM-related papers, given by bibliometrics analysis, show that the subject categories of engineering, civil engineering, and construction and building technology, and 8 key research clusters are extremely important for development of BIM knowledge. The analysis results of the collected project documents, given by qualitative analysis, indicate that visualization, aided management, intelligent construction, simulation and analysis are the hot applications of BIM practice. Originality/value Through comparison, certain research gaps between the research and practice community in China was identified, which are useful for identification of research trends and practice frontier in BIM community. This study offers useful and new insights to summarize the status quo of BIM and can be used as a reference to integrate future BIM developments.

J	Nik-Bakht, M; El-Diraby, T				Nik-Bakht, Mazdak; El-Diraby, Tamer			Project collective mind: Unlocking project discussion networks	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social network analysis; Twitter; Semantic analysis; Project management and monitoring; Stakeholder mapping; Community engagement	SOCIAL NETWORK; MANAGEMENT	A project discussion network is a space where project stakeholders form relationships among each other and share information about the project. Virtual discussion networks may refer to networks of e-mails, document exchange and social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.). As such, both social linkages and semantics of the exchanged content must be considered in analysis of such networks. The proposed framework in this study aims to analyze both the social and semantic aspects of these networks. We developed the framework through analysis of the social networks formed around Twitter accounts of infrastructure megaprojects. To assure relevance to construction research and practices, three objectives guided our analysis: relaying on a large and diversified data corpus from construction projects; testing the applicability and usage of a set of relevant algorithms to the context of construction project management; and linking the results of data analysis and algorithm evaluation to the conditions of construction projects at hand. In examining algorithms for detecting sub-communities, the Louvain fast unfolding modularity maximization was more suitable in detecting project relevant sub-groups. For assessing the relative influence of actors, PageRank algorithm performed better than centrality measures. For extracting key terms, we found that modifying the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) measure to incorporate the relative importance of the source nodes enhances the relevance of extracted terms. Obliviously, Twitter networks are only one type of project networks that can cover a limited/biased sample of participants. Their analysis should be one component of the overall project network analysis. We believe that the proposed framework has the same level of applicability to internal networks of project teams as well as non-Twitter networks.

Toward High Reliability Project Organizing in Safety-Critical Projects	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						project management; high reliability; safety-critical; complex projects	ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE; EXPEDITION; ACCIDENTS; TENSIONS; LESSONS	High reliability organizations claim to be special organizations that have consistently demonstrated safe performance in operating environments, which are simultaneously of high technical complexity, high consequence, and high tempo. This article argues that the literature on high reliability organizing, which emerged through studying day-to-day operations in the nuclear industry, air traffic control industry, and U.S. navy aircraft carriers, might hold important lessons for how the project management community can approach the management of safety-critical projectsprojects in which safety is of paramount importance. Its aim is to consider how high reliability organizing might be realized in these safety-critical projects.

The inclusion of the developing world within the sustainable development debate is argued as essential and the obstacles to achieving this are considered. Initiating a real dialogue in an equal partnership between the developed and developing worlds is a key challenge to define the process, guidelines and achieve protocols for sustainable development. Although CIB has recently commenced engaging with the developing world, much more needs to be done.

Natural hazards can cause failures in a transportation system, which can affect mobility and other economic activities in a community. Diversity is recognized as an important factor of resilience in transportation infrastructure, but empirical work linking the two is limited. In this study, the impact of transportation diversity on mobility in New York City after Hurricane Sandy is explored. Transportation diversity, defined as the availability and distribution of modes in a community, is measured by employing a recently developed approach at the zip code level using transportation system GIS data. The geotagged Twitter data of one month before and after Hurricane Sandy in New York City are used to understand mobility patterns before and after this extreme event. The primary locations of individuals are found, and their mobility patterns are subsequently determined by measuring travel distance, the radius of gyration, and mobility entropy one week and one month before and after the hurricane. Individuals are grouped in quartiles based on the transportation diversity of their primary locations, which is determined by two different methods that overcome the lack of transportation system information in call detail records and social media data. The results indicate that the distance, radius, and entropy of all individuals significantly decreased after Sandy. The comparison of the significance of change in mobility metrics by diversity quartiles revealed that one-week distance and radius metrics in low transportation diversity quartiles were changed and statistically significant. Thus, individuals with primary locations in zip codes with higher transportation diversity generally had a higher maintained distance and radius one week after the hurricane. The comparison of diversity quartiles in the one-month analysis showed that the radius of low transportation diversity quartiles was impacted more than high transportation diversity quartiles and was statistically significant. Further, the comparison of results of one week and one month after the hurricane indicated that distance, radius of gyration, and entropy improved after a month as the transportation system was recovering. The findings establish an empirical link between transportation diversity and intraurban mobility in the wake of natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and confirm that transportation diversity influences individual postdisaster mobility. In addition, the results contribute to the mobility resilience literature by deepening our understanding of the underlying drivers of changes in human mobility following extreme events. Further, the adopted approach supports pinpointing areas with low transportation diversity, which can enable more targeted infrastructure and urban resilience management.

J	Erkul, M; Yitmen, I; Celik, T				Erkul, Mehmet; Yitmen, Ibrahim; Celik, Tahir			Dynamics of stakeholder engagement in mega transport infrastructure projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Megaprojects; Stakeholder engagement; Project success	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS; MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; PERFORMANCE; MEGAPROJECTS; SUCCESS; IMPACT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the practice of stakeholder engagement as a social network dynamics for stakeholder satisfaction and project success in the lifecycle of mega transport infrastructure projects (MTIPs). Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses indicating the positive relationships between stakeholders' effective attributes, stakeholder engagement as social network dynamics and project success through stakeholders' satisfaction have been developed. Based on a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews, responses have been gathered from the representative groups and organizations on their social network dynamics for their satisfaction and project success. A hypothesized structural equation model has been tested using AMOS statistical software package. Findings The analysis highlighted the engagement of the stakeholders within the strategic intents of the project with the public needs and expectations. The model depicts the processes of building social network models based on the capturing of the project's data in relation to the stakeholders' communication and satisfaction across the key issues for success in the lifecycle of MTIP. Practical implications The model is applicable on most MTIP with a diverse stakeholder base and the underlying complexity associated with the community participation and consultation processes. The model will also support wider stakeholder engagement in the planning of MTIP with optimal operationalization and service delivery from a community perspective. Originality/value The research involves an approach for rationalizing the stakeholder engagement policies of the MTIPs by providing an empirically grounded model simultaneously linking various aspects of stakeholder effective attributes, stakeholder engagement and their relationships to stakeholder satisfaction and project success in MTIPs.

Recently electronic publication is increasingly important for the dissemination of scientific work, while evaluation of scientists and institutions remains largely based on the printed publications. In the "material world", associations, such as eCAADe have been providing a stage for getting the right people together and through annual conferences and seminars made sure that research results were heard and read. The Internet and the Web are allowing the scientists to pursue those activities on their own or through flexibly organized "virtual" associations. Electronic publications also provide a basis for efficient management of scientific knowledge-discovering related work, reduction of the duplicate efforts, establishment of virtual research teams etc. In this paper, we present the goals and initial results of an EU-project called SciX: "Open, Self Organising Repository for Scientific Information Exchange". The goal of SciX is to analyze the business processes of scientific publishing, to invent new publication models and through a series of pilots to demonstrate how this will work. In the envisioned scenarios, professional associations such as eCAADe play an important role. Their members are the potential users of SciX's platforms. authors and readers of the papers. Associations could also become the publishers and archivists of the knowledge created within their respective community. The objectives of this contribution focus on involving the eCAADe-community in the developments in SciX, on fine-shaping the goals, as well as on defining the requirements and monitoring the usability of the pilots.

However, important theories in this area are based on world views that are antithetical to the causal assumptions that support often-productive theory and practice in project management. This article outlines four entrepreneurial models of innovation, concluding with subjective innovations based on interactively defined lifestyle and ideological values rather than scientific or economic logic. Their adoption requires difficult personal and organizational admissions of failures in current practice as well as recognition that deeply rooted beliefs in causal logic are an impediment in intrinsically unpredictable environments.

The main concern was Habituation to ineffective lessons learned sharing practices. Habituation is resolved through Mutual Caring, a socially and psychologically adaptive process. Mutual Caring involves comfortable conversations, engaging/sharing, and developing self-confidence, resulting in an enhanced wisdom pool. This paper extends the emphasis on tangible knowledge-sharing mechanisms. Mutual Caring could lead to better outcomes, such as more accessible and usable knowledge, a project management wisdom pool, and criteria for improved dyadic relationships to enhance project learning.

This fictional case study presents background information along with a typical income-and-balance sheet for a small consulting firm that its owner wishes to sell. Ownership transition options, to include employee ownership (transfer to several key employees), employee stock option plans, and purchase by another company, are explored by three reviewers experienced in the field of ownership transition. These reviewers present their analysis of how much the company is worth and how to maximize profits from the selling of the company. They also provide insight into how to prepare for the sale of a company.

Yet, the logistical realities of managing these processes are fraught with difficulties. In this article, we explore the ways in which material artifacts are used in formal public engagement proceedings on urban development projects in Hong Kong. The findings show that material artifacts used-in addition to serving as boundary objects that facilitate communication across knowledge boundaries-form part of a network that directs, controls, and manages the information flow among participants. These artifacts thus play an active role in managing the divergent interests of external stakeholders on projects.

Good field supervisors and project managers foster such productivity. Over 100 participants ranging from electricians to company owners informed a modified 360 degrees assessment of field supervisors and project managers within the unionized electrical contracting community. Focus group discussions and interviews assessed the beneficial characteristics of field supervisors and project managers. Analysis of these characteristics yielded consistent themes, which became the 12 pillars of successful supervision. Based upon these pillars, effective recruitment and retention strategies for both field supervisors and project managers were developed.

However, little is known about whether and how digital boundary objects facilitate negotiations in virtual settings that feature real-time communication. This article addresses this gap by exploring the role of digital boundary objects in negotiating complex design knowledge in a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual workspace. The authors found that digital boundary objects facilitate negotiations through a three-stage process of structuring negotiation space, structuring knowledge in the structured negotiation space, and framing combinations of structured knowledge.

Often times they involve many actors, with the difficulty that they are shared across numerous parallel collaborative groups, for coordination and meeting scheduling reasons. This paper aims at facilitating collaborative decision-making process by grouping actors according to the relationships they have due to their assignment to decisions. Clusters of actors are proposed in order to provide decision makers with a temporary and complementary organization designed for making efficiently simultaneous collaborative decisions.

In project management research, public engagement is usually addressed under the umbrella of stakeholder management, which, although a useful perspective to adopt, has its limitations. In this article, a processual view is advocated, which treats public engagement as dynamic and emergent. Drawing on ethnographic data, we demonstrate how observing public engagement "in the making" helps explain the politics behind engagement efforts. This allows for conclusions to be drawn about the practice of engagement that reflects the evolving needs of stakeholders and how best to manage them.

The Mann-Whitney U Test indicated differences in perception between the two groups of respondents on the majority of the identified benefits. The study has provided an in-depth understanding of the perceived benefits of the GMP/TCC scheme, hence leading to a wider application of those alternative integrated procurement strategies in both regions for reference by the construction community at large.

Using structural holes and strength-of-tie theory, we develop a theoretical framework and a valid and reliable survey instrument. Second, we apply network and structural holes measures for understanding its association with performance. Empirical results suggest that degree centrality in a knowledge workers' professional network positively influences performance use, whereas a highly constrained professional network is detrimental to performance. The findings show that social network structure and position are important factors to consider for individual performance.

Prototype experiments and analysis were performed to test the data mining using information from a typical Taiwanese local construction procurement unit. The application of the data-mining algorithm to this construction procurement management model improves government procurement effectiveness and efficiency. By complying with this governmental procurement information system and revealing the information required by the World Trade Organization and the Government Procurement Agreement, the model has the potential to improve government procurement and industry effectiveness and efficiency. It also provides a platform for government access to the international community.

Supply chain optimization tool for purchasing decisions in B2B construction marketplaces	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						B2B; marketplace; steel reinforcement; optimization; data envelopment analysis (DEA)	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS	Current initiatives for e-commerce deployment in the construction industry are related to the establishment of business-to-business (B2B) marketplaces, which allow large communities of buyers and suppliers to meet and trade with each other. Although these efforts have included aspects of interoperability, database management and security protocols, trading mechanisms in the supply chain have not been properly evaluated. Buyers of construction materials interact with material suppliers in a marketplace environment, thus striving for the best possible spot buy offer. This paper addresses the purchase of construction materials as the last component in the supply chain. A tool for optimizing purchasing decisions in B2B construction marketplaces is presented.

Traditional prescriptive approaches, oriented around process control, are considered suboptimal in meeting this challenge. In this article, the authors present an exploratory theory-building study aiming to identify the project management approaches used by experienced practitioners to respond to rapidly changing environments. The results of 37 semistructured interviews with 31 participants across 10 industries (i.e., construction, aerospace, international community development, pharmaceutical, defense, film production, start-ups, venture capital, research, and information technology) were analyzed according to the planning styles used. Results are discussed in the light of previous research, and a model for better management in rapidly changing environments is proposed.

We offer a case-specific illustration of self-organization using network theory as an investigative lens. The findings have shown that these networks exhibit a high degree of sparseness, short path lengths, and clustering in dense functional communities around highly connected actors, thus demonstrating the small-world topology observed in diverse real-world self-organized networks. The study underlines the need for these non-contractual functions and roles to be identified and sponsored, allowing the self-organizing network the space and capacity to evolve.

This is especially relevant, as organizations face both the needs for separating work into projects and integrating knowledge created in projects into the organization. The results provided by the analysis technique of GABEK((R)) indicate that, although projects create boundaries, employees and project team leaders use formal mechanisms and develop informal practices for knowledge sharing between project teams. Furthermore, the article identifies organizational cultural characteristics enacted in these practices that can stimulate the discussion in knowledge culture research regarding the relationship of organizational cultural characteristics and (specific) knowledge processes.

J	Songer, AD; Molenaar, KR				Songer, AD; Molenaar, KR			Selecting design-build: Public and private sector owner attitudes	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Modern owners of constructed facilities are increasingly investigating a variety of alternative procurement methods. These methods include design-build, turnkey, land construction management. To effectively service this market-driven expansion of project delivery strategies in the construction community, a fundamental understanding of owner attitudes is required. This paper discusses results of research conducted to address owners' attitudes toward one specific alternative contracting method, design-build. A tremendous growth in design-build and limited existence of documented research on owner's attitudes toward design-build necessitate a focus on this particular delivery strategy. Primary design-build selection factors identified and analyzed include establishing cost, reducing cost; establishing schedule, shortening duration, reducing claims, large project size/complexity, and constructability/innovation. Additionally, a comparison of private and public owner design-build attitudes is documented.

Investigation of environmental effect of stone quarrying activities on soil and water in Akpoha and Ishiagu communities of Ebonyi state, Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Physicochemical properties and metallic ion; quarry operations; soil quality; water quality		The research investigated the effect of quarrying activities on water and soil quality in two communities of Ebonyi State of Nigeria. Water and soil pollution that has affected soil fertility necessitated this research. The two quarries are situated in Ishiagu and Akpoha in Nigeria. Water samples were collected from the surface water while borehole water was collected at the depth of 5 m. Samples for total hydrocarbon contents (THC) and heavy metal analysis were collected in a 1-L glass bottle. The samples were collected at the quarrying point, 150 m, 300 m and 450 m away from the source. The collections of these samples were executed in the month of March and September 2018. The soil samples were collected with the aid of an auger into labelled polythene bags and sterile plastic containers. The samples were taken to the laboratory in ice chambers for physicochemical analysis. The samples collected were carried out in both rainy and dry season. The soil samples for physicochemical analysis prior to analysis were air-dried and sieved using a two millimetre sieve. Analysis of variance one-way ANOVA and Post hoc test was carried out to test how independent the variables are. The result indicated that the rainwater was acidic and contains many metallic ions which is due to the presence of suspended particulate matter (PM10) released in the air. The quality of the borehole water from the analysis was less acidic and contains less metallic ion. The soil was observed to be more acidic during the rainy season as the pH values increased. Compared to the dry season, the analysis indicates that the effect is more evident at the quarrying point. The negative environmental effect is more prevalent in the older quarry due to the length of operation.	[Kalu, I. E.; Ogbonna, N.

J	Abu-Samra, S; Ahmed, M; Amador, L				Abu-Samra, Soliman; Ahmed, Mahmoud; Amador, Luis			Asset Management Framework for Integrated Municipal Infrastructure	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multiobjective; Optimization; Decision-making; Lifecycle; Infrastructure; Asset; Risk; Management; Genetic algorithms		Municipalities are experiencing high inefficiency and financial burden imposed by their underperforming aging infrastructure. One-third of Canada's municipal infrastructure is in fair, poor, and failing condition states, increasing the risk of service disruption and leaving decision-makers with no choice but to undertake immediate intervention. Furthermore, the massive number of intervention activities occurring in cities leads to detrimental social, environmental, and economic impacts on the community. Thus, coordinating municipal infrastructure maintenance is progressively becoming of paramount importance to cope with those tough challenges and reduce service disruptions, repair cost, and time. This research presents an asset management solution to ensure proper expenditure utilization while maintaining infrastructure performance. The framework revolves around three core models: (1) a central database that contains detailed asset inventory for the infrastructure systems; (2) multidimensional computational models to assess the performance of the intervention plan through the duration and cost savings as well as the asset condition state; and (3) a trilevel multiobjective goal optimization model that relies on a combination of metaheuristic rules, goal optimization, and genetic algorithms to plan the corridor interventions across the planning horizon. To demonstrate the functionality of the framework, the system was applied to a 9-km stretch of roads, water, and sewer networks from the city of Montreal. The preliminary results of the coordinated intervention scenario displayed an overall improvement of 8%, broken down to 11% improvement in the network condition state, 7% financial savings, and 6% temporal savings, as opposed to the conventional (uncoordinated) intervention scenario. Furthermore, the coordinated intervention scenario proved to be more efficient in more than 70% of the corridors under study, revealing less number of visits to the same corridor and causing less service disruption to the surrounding community, as opposed to the conventional intervention scenario.

J	Goel, A; Ganesh, LS; Kaur, A				Goel, Ashish; Ganesh, L. S.; Kaur, Arshinder			Social sustainability considerations in construction project feasibility study: a stakeholder salience perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project feasibility study; Construction; Social sustainability; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder salience	LONGITUDINAL CONTENT-ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DECISION-MAKING; IMPACT ANALYSIS; DESIGN; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; LICENSE; KEY	Purpose Past research recommends integration of social sustainability (SS) considerations in construction project feasibility study for benefitting a larger group of project stakeholders. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to this effect, especially from the developing economies. The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap through a SS-centric analysis of feasibility study reports using a stakeholder salience perspective. Design/methodology/approach Feasibility study reports for 61 projects were obtained from various government organizations in India. The SS considerations were identified in the reports using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The former was based on content analysis and the latter was conducted using "VOSviewer" text analysis software. Findings SS considerations related to occupational health and safety, workers' employment practices and proactive involvement of communities and end-users were found to be inadequately addressed in the reports. Based on occurrences of the SS considerations, project-affected community was found to be the most salient stakeholder, followed by the end-users and the construction workers. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationship between the SS considerations and the type of project as well as the type of project delivery system. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of integrating SS considerations in feasibility study of construction projects. Its results provide useful inputs to decision-makers for orienting construction projects, right from the early phases, towards benefitting the disadvantaged and weaker stakeholders irrespective of their salience attributes. In developing economies, such interventions may improve quality of lives of a large number of project stakeholders and also cultivate a positive societal image of the construction industry as a respectful, ethical and employee friendly industry.

Chaos Theory: Implications for Cost Overrun Research in Hydrocarbon Megaprojects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chaos theory; Cost overruns; Hydrocarbon projects; Megaprojects; Cost and schedule	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; OIL; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS	Cost overruns are a recurrent problem in hydrocarbon (oil and gas) megaprojects. An understanding of why and how they occur is needed if they are to be mitigated; such knowledge can provide managers with the foundations to develop techniques to reduce and contain their negative impacts on a project's performance. This paper examines the nature of cost overruns in hydrocarbon megaprojects using the theoretical lens of chaos theory. The underlying principles of chaos theory are reviewed and its research implications for examining cost overruns identified. By viewing megaprojects as chaotic or dynamic systems, the industry and research community may be better positioned to develop innovative solutions to mitigate cost overrun occurrence.

Then, we summarize several kinds of prognostic models that use monitoring information to estimate the reliability of complex systems or products. Monitoring information also facilitates operational decisions in production planning, spare parts management, reliability improvement, and prognostics and health management. Finally, we suggest some research opportunities for the reliability and operations management communities to fill the research gap between these two fields.

Some organizations choose to include project managers as part of discrete sales or solution teams, with a small corporate group overseeing the project management methodology, training, and other miscellaneous responsibilities. Other businesses and organizations choose to centralize the project managers within the organization. The purpose of this quantitative research is to determine the degree to which a centralized PMO contributes to the success of a virtual project team.

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests mixed outcomes of CRPs in terms of corporate research impact, which implies successful transfer of novel knowledge generated within CRPs to company-internal business networks to develop radically innovative products. We use the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP) and meta-analysis to analyze six CRP networks. Our findings indicate that the network's relational characteristics (tie strength) and structural characteristics (network range) are important determinants of knowledge transfer at the fuzzy front end of innovation.

The needs of industry have not been easily met by traditional approaches to the organization of research. As a result, new types of research collaboration and organizations (institutes and clubs) have emerged. There have also been attempts to develop overarching national strategies for research and encourage collaborative academic and industrial projects. The ramifications of the recent privatization of the Building Research Establishment (BRE) are explored with reference to long-term implications for research skills, training and on the international standing of the UK's building research activities.

Alterations' impacts on sustainability of low-cost housing schemes in Sri Lanka: the occupants' perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Alterations; low-cost housing schemes (LCHS); sustainability; social impacts; environmental impacts; economic impacts	CONSTRUCTION; SATISFACTION; COMMUNITIES; TSUNAMI; GREEN	The occupants of low-cost housing schemes (LCHS) make regular alterations to their units to suit their unique requirements. These alterations in LCHS adversely affect sustainable performance. This study aimed at investigating the impact on sustainability caused by frequent alterations in LCHS in Sri Lanka. This research used a mono method quantitative research approach with the positivist paradigm using a survey strategy. A pilot survey and a questionnaire survey were used to collect empirical data. Mean value and relative importance index (RII) was used as data analysis techniques. There is a positive impact on the society (0.28) and economy (0.65) from alterations. Impact on environment from alterations was negative (-0.68). They also indicate the need to develop proper guidelines for the alterations involved in LCHS in Sri Lanka.	[De Zoysa, S. H.

J	McKenna, A; Metcalfe, M				McKenna, Allen; Metcalfe, Mike			The linguistic turn in project conceptualization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pragmatism; Complex project conceptualization; Idea networking; Stakeholders' concerns	STRATEGY; COGNITION	Prior and conflicting stakeholder concerns can make projects complex. Listening to, and integrating, this concern into the project is easier said than done. However the pragmatic ethics of the Australian 'fair-go' argues long term success requires an attempt be made. This pragmatic philosophy provides a solution by explaining the relationship between community, conceptualization and agreed reasonable action. After introducing pragmatism, this paper uses an Australian based re-organization project to explain why linguistic concepts might be used to conceive projects made complex by conflicting stakeholders. The philosophy is made operational by using idea networking to reveal the concepts underpinning stakeholders' comments. This method clusters similar statements to enable exposure of these underlying concepts (themes, meta narrative), which are named. It was found that using this concept driven method provides an internally consistent means of conceptualizing projects with conflicting stakeholders' concerns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

J	Mills, E				Mills, E			Climate change, insurance and the buildings sector: technological synergisms between adaptation and mitigation	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						buildings; climate change; energy efficiency; extreme weather; insurance; risk management	ENERGY-EFFICIENCY; FIRE	Examining the intersection of risk analysis and sustainable energy strategies reveals numerous examples of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies that offer insurance loss-prevention benefits. The growing threat of climate change provides an added motivation for the risk community to understand better this area of opportunity. While analyses of climate change mitigation typically focus on the emissions-reduction characteristics of sustainable energy technologies, less often recognised are a host of synergistic ways in which these technologies also offer adaptation benefits, e.g. making buildings more resilient to natural disasters. While there is already some relevant activity, there remain various barriers to expanding these efforts significantly. Achieving successful integration of sustainable energy considerations with risk-management objectives requires a more proactive orientation, and coordination among diverse actors and industry groups.

A theoretical model and hypotheses are proposed and explored using data from a survey of 212 IT-enabled business projects. Results indicate that the people-based approach is more strongly influential on a project's success in securing business benefits. Although the plan-based approach is less influential, it does positively influence business benefit attainment and also supports the people-based approach. Thus, attaining shared understanding within the project team and aligning key documents are both important goals for a project's knowledge management strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

From this it follows that the aim of this article is to address the question of what sort of role boundary objects play in negotiations of contracts in the project business context. The beginning of the article deals with the notion of the boundary object in general. And after that follows the main content of the article - namely a study of the role of boundary objects in the context of project contract negotiations (technological delivery). The article includes three case examples, and it ends with the conclusion according to which the boundary objects (both institutionalised and non-institutionalised) may play an important role in the courses of complex project contract negotiations.

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify barriers and RL practices with regard to CDW. The parameters under question were validated by six experts, and a survey methodology was applied and evaluated using structural equation modeling. These findings contribute to the literature and organizational practice because understanding these barriers is necessary to address the barriers that negatively influence the implementation of RL in the CI.

However, most environmental data is measured by and available from meteorological and air quality research communities. This data is collected at macro and meso levels, some distance from the object studied, and raises the need to transform data in order to describe the specific, local conditions adjacent to that object. To estimate levels of degradation agents in the exposure environment, especially those close to the building or construction at local and micro levels have to be considered. This paper will show and discuss useful environmental data sources, and how to transform such data by means of available distribution models.

Using Blockchain in a Reputation-Based Model for Grouping Agents in the Internet of Things	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet of Things; Reliability; Blockchain; Proposals; Task analysis; Performance evaluation; Multi-agent systems; Blockchain; group formation; Internet of Things (IoT) device; multiagent system; reputation capital	TRUST MANAGEMENT; LOCAL TRUST; SECURITY; PRIVACY; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES; SYSTEMS	The Internet of Things (IoT) makes attractive services available to smart objects and humans. To aim this, IoT devices need high sensing, reasoning, and real-time acting capabilities that can be also obtained by promoting adaptive forms of cooperation machine-to-machine among smart objects. The convergence of IoT and multiagent systems also relies on the association between software agents with IoT devices for exploiting their social attitude of interacting and cooperating for services. However, the choice of reliable partners for cooperation can be very difficult when IoT devices migrate across different environments, where the most part of their members will be unreferenced with respect to their trustworthiness. It is well known that agents reputation can be a viable aspect to consider to form social groups; therefore, a possible solution to this problem is to form groups of agents in each IoT environment, based on their social capabilities. In this respect, the first contribution of this paper is represented by a reputation model focused on building the reputation capital of each agent. Second, an algorithm capable to form groups of agents in IoT environments on the basis of their reputation capital was designed. Finally, since in this contest, it is important to spread reliable and certified information about the device/agent reputation in a distributed environment, the third contribution is represented by the adoption of the blockchain technology to certify the reputation capital. Some experiments we have performed show that the model is capable to detect almost all the misleading agents if their percentage is under a high enough threshold, and that good results in term of group composition are obtained. Moreover, the simulations show that, by adopting our model, malicious devices always pay for services significantly more than honest ones. We argue that the individual reputation capital of devices and, consequently, the overall reputation capital of the IoT community can take benefit from the adoption of the proposed approach.

This focus has significant relevance to the construction industry where production-related research has predominantly overshadowed organizational development research. As one effort to change this emphasis, the writers present a research effort designed to study current organization learning techniques and technologies fielded by organizations both inside and outside of the construction industry. Through a series of exploratory case Studies, the writers developed a maturity model together with the Construction Industry Institute that provides construction organizations with a framework for developing a learning organization culture. The maturity model focuses on learning organization characteristics of leadership, processes and infrastructure, communication/collaboration, education, and culture at the organization, community, and individual levels. This paper introduces the results of that effort including a presentation of the learning organization maturity model, framework application, and the overall characteristics of a learning organization.

The paper explores how multidisciplinary teams interact to overcome the barriers and take advantage of their 'built in' knowledge diversity. The findings of the research suggest that successful integration of multidisciplinary knowledge can be achieved through team's boundary spanning activities and reaching to multiple professional and social communities. Three project boundaries have been identified, project action boundary, project knowledge boundary and project social boundary, which facilitate team members in articulating diverse knowledge perspectives. The findings suggest a need to reconceptualise the boundaries of multidisciplinary teams and to consider the processes of sharing diverse knowledge in a wider professional and social context.

The history of demolition is explored as a policy response to real or perceived problems. A balance between demolition and preservation is critical to preserving viable neighbourhoods and restoring vitality to these cities. Older industrial cities with shrinking job and population bases are the primary case under examination. Market factors are identified that are likely to prevent the preservation and reuse of a significant part of these cities' housing stock. More extensive demolition is likely to be an unavoidable part of these cities' future. Both demolition and preservation can be considered parts of a framework through which neighbourhood revitalization can be furthered in these cities. A framework is needed that emphasizes preserving viable communities rather than individual buildings, although still irresolvable dilemmas continue to face those cities.

J	Bakens, IW				Bakens, IW			International trends in research and technology development - A changing environment for CIB	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						trends; R&D; research infrastructure; research management; international collaboration; CIB		The way in which research and technology development in building and construction is conducted in most industrialized countries is changing dramatically. Major changes include a reduced dependence on government support for R&D, the development of a partnership between the construction industry and the research community, internationalization of construction research as a market, the subsequent impact for national research programmes, increased international collaboration between national research organizations, and the impact of electronic communication. The changing role of CIB is discussed as positive response to these challenges, which include the changing composition of CIB's membership (from East Asia and North America), increased participation by industry, more focused CIB programmes which are closely aligned to industry's priorities, and new ways of creating international teams and working methods through the use of electronic participation.

Analytic Overview of Citation Metrics in the Civil Engineering Domain with Focus on Construction Engineering and Management Specialty Area and Its Subdisciplines	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; H-INDEX; OPEN-ACCESS; SCIENCE; IMPACT; WEB; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIANTS; SCOPUS	Several data-based metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of research output, including h-index, impact factor, and others. Considerable debates have focused on whether the aforementioned metrics represent effective and efficient indications of research impact or just provide an imperfect reflection. Because the academic community is witnessing a growing trend where most of the tangible rewards are related to publications and their quality, there is a dire necessity to obtain a more realistic and holistic understanding of such evaluation indicators. As such, the goal of this paper is to investigate the parameters associated with the citation metrics used to assess the quality and impact of research publications in the broad civil engineering (CE) domain with a focus on the construction engineering and management (CEM) specialty area and its subdisciplines. To this end, the authors (1) analyzed the different CE research areas-including CEM-with respect to the number of publications, community size, and potential ties with other interdisciplinary fields; (2) studied the citation metrics of the most-cited as well as award-winning peer-reviewed publications in both CE and CEM while examining the effect of the availability of research funds as well as the nature of the research-quantitative or qualitative-on the average number of citations for most-cited publications across the different CE specialty areas; and (3) investigated the impact of multiple factors on the citation metrics. Based on a thorough survey and analysis of 67,800 journal publications, it was found that both number of publications and citation metrics for the CEM specialty area is significantly lower compared with other CE specialty areas. Along the same vein, the citations across the various CEM subdisciplines are all different, where labor and personnel (306 average citations per paper) and contracting (266 average citations per paper) are the most cited, but cost and schedule (47 average citations per paper) and legal and contractual (23 average citations per paper) are the least cited. Also, with the exception of aerospace engineering as well as engineering education and practices, CEM was the least funded, had the highest percentage of qualitative research, and the least average number of citations for funded/unfunded projects as well as qualitative/quantitative research. Further, it was revealed that award-winning papers-which supposedly represent the highest quality-are not highly cited and in fact have way below average citation numbers. Ultimately, it was found that several factors such as research community size, trendiness of research field, amount of research output, connection with other interdisciplinary fields, characteristics and attributes of coauthors, timing of checking an h-index, publication access type, and the criteria adopted by the various archiving databases collectively affect the citation metrics for papers and authors. As such, citation metrics like h-index should not be used solely to assess the quality and impact of an author but rather be utilized as a single piece of information within a more holistic and broader context. This study furnishes various parameters and considerations that should be normalized before attempting to compare citations of papers and/or authors across the CE domain.

The relational nature of social procurement policies requires construction firms to develop new collaborative partnerships with organisations from the government, not-for-profit and community sectors. The aim of this paper is to address the paucity of research into the risks and opportunities of entering into these new cross-sector partnerships from the perspectives of the stakeholders involved and how this affects collaborative potential and social value outcomes for intended beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approach This case study research is based on a unique collaborative intermediary called Connectivity Centre created by an international contractor to coordinate its social procurement strategies. The findings draw on a thematic analysis of qualitative data from focus groups with 35 stakeholders from the construction, government, not-for-profit, social enterprise, education and employment sectors. Findings Findings indicate that potentially enormous opportunities which social procurement offers are being undermined by stakeholder nervousness about policy design, stability and implementation, poor risk management, information asymmetries, perverse incentives, candidate supply constraints, scepticism, traditional recruitment practices and industry capacity constraints. While these risks can be mitigated through collaborative initiatives like Connectivity Centres, this depends on new "relational" skills, knowledge and competencies which do not currently exist in construction. In conclusion, when social procurement policy requirements are excessive and imposed top-down, with little understanding of the construction industry's compliance capacity, intended social outcomes of these policies are unlikely to be achieved. Originality/value This research draws on theories of cross-sector collaboration developed in the realm of public sector management to address the lack of research into how the new cross-sector partnerships encouraged by emerging social procurement policies work in the construction industry. Contributing to the emerging literature on cross-sector collaboration, the findings expose the many challenges of working in cross-sector partnerships in highly transitionary project-based environments like construction.

The unique features of the GBC process are that it is ad-hoc with no host organization; it is based on national teams; it is self-funding; it depends on consensus amongst the participating countries; and it uses conferences as a focusing device. Other significant features include the roles and motivations of participants; working in subgroups; and the importance of networking and personal contacts. The future of GBC will depend on the success of many of these past operating methods. GBC has provided an important model for innovation strategies with high impact. It indicates that rapid and visionary work can be achieved through a consensus basis of researchers and practitioners, without layers of management or bureaucratic strictures. Its notable success lies in linking the research and practitioning design communities' interests through the development of national case studies.

The paper builds on and develops the analysis of professionals and professionalization in the special issue, forming a bridge with other contemporary work in organization studies and the sociology of the professions. The creation of a new professionalism' that transcends existing divisions amongst building professions will present a number of challenges. Amongst these are, on the one hand, the interweaving of processes of professionalization and institutionalization and, on the other hand, the influence of practice.

By studying 203 firms and interviewing their managers, this paper demonstrates that (a) using heuristic metaphors, (b) telling process-related stories, and (c) developing a common language positively relate to firms' absorptive capacity. Remarkably, this paper also shows that telling relationship-based organizational stories is negatively associated with absorptive capacity in these firms. The discussion also shows that absorptive capacity has a positive relationship to a firm's product development efforts and a mediating effect on the relationship between organizational symbols and product innovativeness.

This phenomenon raised concerns among natural gas producers and consumers. China has abundant shale gas resources, but the development scale is small while facing problems including weak exploration and evaluation basis, overlapping royalties, complex terrestrial environment, lack of technical practices and accumulation, inadequate management and regulatory mechanisms, etc. To overcome these challenges for large-scale shale gas development, we believe that shale gas development is not only a single technical problem, but a systematic engineering demanding multidisciplinary research that will be bound to spread to humans, nature, and society. Therefore, to ensure the healthy development of China's shale gas, it is required to coordinate global and local relationships, engineering and community relations, as well as to break up the conflicts between engineering and nature, engineering and economy, along with engineering and society.

First, this study reviews the historical background and evolution of EVM implementation in government. Then, current practices for implementing EVM are discussed through examination of EVM adoption and implementation at NASA. The research shows that NASA receives substantial project management value from its implementation of EVM, promotes consistent practices across the agency, and provides effective training on leadership, scheduling, EVM, and data analysis. This study also provides recommendations to improve and broaden the applications of current EVM and project management practices to other government programs and projects. Findings of this research contribute to the management of performance of future projects and programs and encourage the project management community to review and advance the application of EVM.

These include working in a demanding, resource constrained environment; working to compressed timeframes; addressing community expectations; and protecting the local economy affected by the disaster. Following a series of major earthquakes in Canterbury New Zealand, an innovative organisational arrangement was developed in order to manage the extensive infrastructure reconstruction. This research investigated how SCIRT, the project-based alliance organisation that was created for the disaster recovery, addressed these challenges in handling the vast programme of projects. A key finding was that establishing the internal and external legitimacy of this organisation was a critical element that determined the effectiveness of the recovery work. Managing legitimacy perceptions among the multiple stakeholders is identified as a core task, and a little-recognised critical success factor, in the use of alliances for large-scale disaster-recovery projects.

We argue that the adoption of a sender/receiver approach limits the learning effectiveness in project-based organisations. Drawing upon the notion of learning as a social activity embedded in an organisational context, we develop the argument that learning from projects takes place within projects rooted in the historical, organisational and cultural context of previous and current projects. We underpin our argument with results from a multiple-case study on learning in construction organisations. We show that learning cannot be segregated from immediate practice and occurs when individuals engage in project work. Particularly the orientation towards project goals and project-overarching ambitions or trajectories can serve as contextual binder for learning in and between projects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Current Program Management training is a one size fits all approach based on Project practices and methodologies which do not integrate effectively with Project Management or cater for the largely unpredictable or high risk situation, such as a disaster. This paper reviews A practical process for assessing, planning and delivering best value outcomes for Programs and Projects. The PSA Project process which can be integrated into any Project methodology through the working Scope within an effective Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) process by engaging key stakeholder values to enable sustainable Program results.

However, on-site design work is challenging for designers, because the current design tools can hardly merge virtual three-dimensional (3D) models with real surrounding environments for visualization and interaction. To address this challenge, we designed and developed a mixed reality (MR) tool called HoloDesigner. In this paper, we describe the development process and core components of HoloDesigner. Through an on-site design application at a community park, we demonstrated its main workflow and functionalities. The results proved that HoloDesigner could successfully render on-site 3D visualization as well as real-time interactions to control 3D models in the real surrounding environment. This research offers new insights on supporting on-site design work with MR technologies and contributes to overcoming the limitations of current MR tools for on-site visualization and interaction.

In this paper, the authors have used and recommend the earned duration index (EDI), developed as part of earned duration management (EDM) in conjunction with the well-established exponential smoothing forecasting technique to predict the completion of a project. The study compares several models and provides a comparative analysis of performance of these models using variety of projects at multiple stages of completion. The research findings suggest that using EDI of earned duration management is a preferred option compared to SPI(t). In addition, when EDI is used together with exponential smoothing techniques, the results become even better. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This form of work is defined as improvisation, which describes a pragmatic approach of applying existing theories in novel ways to deliver a successful project. The combination of a solid theoretical knowledge base and improvisational practices is our approach to conceptualise a praxeology of resilient project management. A praxeological mindset is well suited to improve our current understanding of project management towards a more resilient meta-theory of project management that is able to address complexity. This paper contributes to the current debates in project management, as it develops a foundation for bridging theory and practice. Providing sound, practice-related theories stimulates fruitful debate between the various professions of the project-management community, which will help the field to further mature and grow.

Perception of Financial Institutions toward Financing PFI Projects in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION; VIABILITY; INDUSTRY; CULTURE; TAIWAN	Private finance initiative (PFI) has emerged to be a viable strategy for governments to transfer financial risks in public projects to the private sector. It does not only help tap the efficiency and finances of the private sector but it also promises to deliver better public services to the community. Despite these obvious incentives, there is still a low PFI diffusion in Hong Kong. Based on this understanding, we have undertaken this exploratory study, which is probably the first of its kind, to investigate the PFI's financial issues from the perspective of financial suppliers. This study was intended to identify factors that may affect the perception of the supplier side and to explore ways to facilitate their participation in PFI projects. The findings suggest that respondents had low level of understanding and knowledge of the PFI and they perceived that PFI public projects had an average risk and performance. To increase their involvement, several enablers are provided in this paper.	[Cheng, Eddie W.

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with highly experienced participants selected from a range of industries and disciplines in Queensland, Australia. Findings Six separate confusions on the role of steering committees were identified within that practitioner community. However, despite participants expressing various opposing views, they had actually come to the same working arrangements for their committees; all that was missing was a common conceptualisation of these working arrangements and consistent terminology. Social implications Reconciliation of terminology with actual practice and the consequent clarity of governance arrangements can facilitate building social and physical systems and infrastructure, benefitting organisations, whether public, charitable or private. Originality/value Clarity regarding committee accountability can avoid confusion, misunderstanding and their consequent waste of time, resources and money.

It represents a first case examination of the interface between a sponsor and practice-based learning phenomenon within projects. The reported findings argue for the project sponsor role to be acknowledged as dynamic and interactive and a dramatic influence on project practice-based learning. It also implies that a sponsor confronts some significant dilemmas in successfully stewarding such learning. Moreover, through such endeavour, the sponsor may also become an agent for organizational learning. The findings generated also encourage further investigations into the nexus between the sponsor and other social phenomenon within projects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Such systems must meet the boundary conditions of a given project involving deconstruction of a building and will differ in terms of waste management costs, environmental impact and nuisance to the surrounding community. Selecting the most advantageous solution, taking into account numerous standards such as sustainable development, requires a multiple-criteria analysis of such variants. The system presented in this work supports the decision-making process in terms of choosing a technological and organizational solution in the field of concrete waste management. It is based on a mathematical simulation model, which produces rating indicators for technological-organizational waste management systems. Based on a synthetic rating indicator, the decision maker is provided with a list of ranked variants to choose from. Moreover, the system analyses qualitative parameters, such as the building site area required and waste management time.

Knowledge formation and learning in the management of projects: A problem solving perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Complex problem solving; Knowledge formation; Modes of organizing and learning (MOL); Practice	INTEGRATION; COMMUNITIES	In contrast to traditional projects, which are assumed to be fully specified and then executed with little learning anticipated, complex projects cannot be fully specified at the outset and require continuous learning over their life cycles. Nevertheless, the key role of knowledge formation and learning in managing complex projects is under-developed for expanding project capability boundaries to include knowledge uncertainty and indeterminacy. Drawing inspiration from Karl Weick's enactivist ideas and an empirical study of two organizations that developed project capability for complex projects, the paper develops an integrated view of projects and project management that is grounded in problem solving learning and organizing. More specifically, a project is reconceptualized as 'a mode of organizing to accomplish a temporary undertaking' with intrinsic learning. This perspective views complex projects under knowledge uncertainty as learning organizations, with implications for project management theory and practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

In the aftermath of these disasters, emergency management agencies need to urgently develop and implement a temporary housing plan that provides displaced families with satisfactory and safe accommodations. This paper presents the computational implementation of a newly developed multiobjective optimization model to support decision-makers in emergency management agencies in optimizing large-scale temporary housing arrangements. The model is capable of simultaneously minimizing (1) postdisaster social and economic disruptions suffered by displaced families; (2) temporary housing vulnerabilities to postdisaster hazards; (3) adverse environmental impacts on host communities; and (4) public expenditures on temporary housing. The model is implemented in four main phases and it incorporates four optimization modules to enable optimizing each of the aforementioned important objectives. A large-scale temporary housing application example is presented to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the model and illustrate the performed computations in each of the implementation phases.

J	Ostwald, MJ				Ostwald, Michael J.			Ethics and the auto-generative design process	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						computer-generated design; design philosophy; design process; digital architecture; ethics		In the last decade, the rise of sophisticated software tools has enabled a growing number of designers to experiment with new processes for the creation of architectural form. Several of these processes, which are loosely grouped under the rubric 'auto-generative', rely on the computer to evolve extraordinary biomorphic or topographic forms. In the years since the rise of this approach, prominent members of the architectural community have embraced the computer-generated buildings produced in this way and praised them as being the products of an innately ethical or moral design process. This supposition is tested through a critical textual analysis of several high-profile architects' statements and is focused exclusively on accounts of the design process and not on the buildings that are produced in this way. A three-part conceptual framework is developed for the ethical analysis of a creative or constructive process. Evidence is used selectively to interrogate the claims made about this movement from a moral or an ethical standpoint.

It compares these with the visual processes in industrial design work. The comparison reveals clear parallels in the ways in which tacit and experiential knowledge is conveyed through visual representation. The study examines how straw bale building innovators in Arizona and New Mexico, US, used visual discourse to convey technical knowledge within their own building community, and how they used visual discourse in the form of historical documentation, illustrative sketches, and video footage to make a convincing case for their technique as a viable one for code officials, even though visual representations were not allowed in building standards, per se, at the time.

Quantitative and qualitative design was tested as part of an online survey conducted on 654 participants, including members of various Sino-Malagasy and non-governmental organizations. The article shows that Chinese companies that maintain corporate social responsibility practices in Madagascar achieve greater results than their competitors do. This article was established by the use of an online survey, how the company add significant value to native and international communities by implementing corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility practices were illustrated to bear a significant impact on the overall company's sustainability and economic performance. The concept of corporate social responsibility practices demonstrates an analytical innovation. This system has been used in various countries that embrace on corporate social responsibility. Therefore, this work concludes that these practices have a significant impact on the social and economic performance of Madagascar.

J	Yang, RJ				Yang, Rebecca Jing			An investigation of stakeholder analysis in urban development projects: Empirical or rationalistic perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder analysis; Urban development projects; Empiricism; Rationalism	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; MANAGEMENT; IDENTIFICATION; TYPOLOGY	The increasing research interest in multi-stakeholder analysis in urban planning reflects a growing recognition that stakeholders can and should influence the decision-making of urban development projects. Methods for identifying and prioritising stakeholders and their interests are explored in this study, and two perspectives (empiricism and rationalism) for stakeholder analysis are proposed. Two case studies, one regional renewal project and the other an infrastructure project, are presented to verify the usefulness of these two analysis perspectives. The results from the case studies show that no one method for stakeholder analysis is perfect; the selection of analytical perspective is an art with extensive considerations of 'when, what, and how' to choose methods to achieve the project objectives. Applying both empirical and rationalistic perspectives and comparing the analysis results when necessary are proposed as the best way to analyse stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

By providing new rail connections between London, Birmingham, and Manchester, this project is highly complex as it is embedded in a network of stakeholder relationships that may support or oppose the project. Data drawn from Twitter were analyzed using Social Network Analysis and inductive analysis of user profiles and content. Findings indicate that the majority of online stakeholders oppose the project and form stable clusters. Larger clusters within this network may attempt to deploy power directly in the form of a manipulation strategy, whereas smaller clusters may seek to ally themselves with more powerful groups, a pathway strategy. Overall, the methodology is a useful complement to existing methods and may provide real-time insights into the complex, evolving discussions around megaprojects.

Deployable scissor structures are well-suited for this application since they are lightweight, can be compactly packaged, and have a high volume expansion ratio. Their constitutive parts can be reused and reconfigured to facilitate rehabilitation and reconstruction. This paper presents a preliminary concept for a deployable scissor shelter, including its design, analysis, and experimental validation on a full-scale prototype. First, the conceptual design and analysis using a parametric finite element method are presented. Testing of the prototype is then employed to evaluate the deployment process, support conditions and stiffening elements. Experimental data from these studies validates results from the finite element model, suggesting that the modeling tool is effective for the design of transitional shelters. A final design is presented which meets the requirements of the European Standards. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Publishing academic research, research by scientists that is shared with the broader research community via journal publications and conference presentations, plays an important role in the development of emerging technologies. While much is known about the relationship between academic research and invention capability (e. g., patent-generation capability), the link between academic research and commercial products demands further investigation. This paper presents a longitudinal study of the link between firms' academic research activity and commercial exploration and exploitation of emerging technology knowledge. According to our findings, firms with an active program of publishing academic research are more likely to commercially explore (via pioneer products) and exploit (via greater product scope) their emerging technology investment.

The subsequent emergence of such a timber building system in Sweden is analysed in the context of the existing concrete-based construction system. The characteristics of the construction industry and its path dependency over the past century hamper the development of a timber building system. However, government policies and funding, the wood industry's interest in an enhanced market for value-added wood products, and involvement of the wood research community has helped develop such a construction system. Investments in knowledge creation, incentives for the entry of new firms, and increased prefabrication may facilitate a transition from this formative phase to a growth phase in the diffusion of timber buildings.

In order to leverage complementary resources and capabilities fully, the network actors must span traditional boundaries between communities of practice in manufacturing and service. Fields like supply chain management and business process management, as well as the literature on boundary spanning, offer little guidance for the systematic identification of boundary objects that could be used to bridge this gap. Drawing on existing works on boundary objects and service blueprinting, we design a new method for diagnosing boundary-spanning processes and identifying candidates for IT-based boundary objects that integrate manufacturing and service companies' subprocesses. The method was iteratively developed over a period of three years in a cyclic action research project with two business-to-business service networks in the mechanical and electrical engineering industries.

J	Fisher, E				Fisher, Eddie			What practitioners consider to be the skills and behaviours of an effective people project manager	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						People skills; Behaviours; Managing people		It is recognized by academics and the community of practice that the management of people plays an important role in project management. Recent people skills research expresses the need to develop a better understanding of what good people management is. This paper proposes what project management practitioners consider to be skills and behaviours of an effective people project manager. A combination of literature review, face to face interviews and focus group meetings was applied to complete the research objective. Six specific skills and associated behaviours were identified as being most important. The results suggest that project managers would benefit from adopting these skills and behaviours to strengthen their managing people skills and behaviours to improve the successful delivery of projects. The findings also suggest that some skill sets and behaviours may be more appropriate for application in certain project environments such as IT or the construction industry.

A meta-analysis of empirical evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Managing risk; Project success; Information Technology	SOFTWARE RISK; MANAGING RISKS; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; FRAMEWORK	The question whether risk management contributes to IT project success is considered relevant by people from both academic and practitioners' communities already for a long time. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence that either supports or opposes the claim that risk management contributes to IT project success. In addition, this paper also investigates the validity of the assumptions on which risk management is based. The analysis leads to remarkable conclusions. Over the last 10 years. much has become known about what causes IT projects to Fail. However, there is still very little empirical evidence that this knowledge is actually used in projects for managing risks in IT projects. This paper concludes with indicating new directions for research in the relation between risk management and project success. Key elements are stakeholder perception of risk and success and stakeholder behaviour in the risk management process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Information exchange among stakeholders is essential to enable energy sharing among buildings that form a NetZECs. However, traditional, centralised energy management usually places emphasis on the supply side and does not address data exchange among individual stakeholders. This paper proposes an information sharing strategy based on linked data for improved management of NetZEBs and NetZECs. This strategy systematically integrates stakeholders' engagement by using energy performance indicators as information carriers and linked data as engagement channels. A case study proves the advantages of the developed strategy for improving the energy balance at individual building level, building cluster level, and community level. It is found that the strategy could help achieve NetZEBs and NetZECs through empowering stakeholders' interaction and information sharing.

Supply of required quantity of water and at right time is the primary objective of water distribution network analysis. The analysis of water distribution networks can be broadly classified into design and operation problems and both problems have been the focus of many researchers over the past three decades. In the water distribution network design problems, the target is attaining the cost effective configuration that satisfies the minimum hydraulic head requirement at the demand nodes. In this paper, a new algorithm for design of water distribution network namely "heuristics-based algorithm" which completely utilizes the implicit information associated with the water distribution network to be designed has been proposed and validated with two water distribution networks. It is found that the proposed algorithm performs well for the least-cost design of water distribution networks.	[Mohan, S.; Babu, K. S.

Weighin-Motion (WIM) is efficient in avoiding structural damage and ensuring successful weight enforcement by measuring a vehicle's weight in a dynamic state. WIM additionally provides information such as traffic volume, vehicle's speed, axle spacing, equivalent single axle load (ESAL), individual axle and gross vehicle weight (GVW), which is of value to planning, design, construction, and operations of transportation infrastructures. This paper reviewed the state of practice and research in WIM with focuses on its potential, limitations, cost-effectiveness, and data usage. Discussion was made on identifying needs and challenges for further development. This review provides the research community with a holistic view of available WIM techniques, their limitations, costeffectiveness, and the need for future research on usage of the WIM data that might lead to wider adoption of WIM in transportation applications.

J	Kamari, A; Schultz, CPL; Kirkegaard, PH				Kamari, Aliakbar; Schultz, Carl Peter Leslie; Kirkegaard, Poul Henning			Constraint-based renovation design support through the renovation domain model	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Renovation domain model; Sustainable building renovation; Holistic renovation scenario; Design support framework; Rapid scenario generation	DECISION-SUPPORT; BUILDINGS; BIM	A fundamental challenge within the field of renovation is handling enormous complexity at two levels. Firstly, complexity at the level of an individual building project must be handled that consists of thousands of building elements that are amenable to renovation, and how each renovation action impacts a range of competing key performance indicators (KPIs), which are unique for every project. Secondly, complexity must be handled at the AECO-community level of knowledge about what renovation actions are available today. The aims of this paper are first to present an innovative approach for addressing these challenges through developing a Renovation Domain Model for expressing and capturing key concepts for renovation scenarios; and second to propose an innovative renovation design support framework that provides design teams with broad coverage of the design space in conjunction with limited, careful use of precise simulations for KPI evaluation. The system is empirically evaluated on a large residential building case study in Denmark.

J	Lee-Kelley, L; Blackman, D				Lee-Kelley, Liz; Blackman, Deborah			Project training evaluation: Reshaping boundary objects and assumptions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Training evaluation; Boundary objects; Appraisal; Learning	KNOWLEDGE	Training evaluation is an important component of personal development which has received insufficient attention by project managers, members of project teams and their organisations, making training a target for cut-back at times of tightening budgets. Assessing training has historically been operationally oriented, emphasising financial justification, content and quality of the training rather than the potential of improved project performance or organisational transformation. This qualitative, multi-case study demonstrates the limitations of normative boundary objects (the processes, artefacts, documents or technical language or vocabulary in common use within the project community) such as 'best practise' models and 'bodies of knowledge' as the driver and basis for training. The paper proposes using alternate boundary objects to incorporate reflective practises which can increase the utilisation of learning by embedding it in specific contexts. Study findings are of relevance to project workers by helping them think differently about the purpose and outcome of training attendance, and for managers charged with developing the project and programme talent pool within the organisation.

Therefore, many researchers have paid their attention to the carbon footprint specially on operational carbon reduction and embodied carbon reduction. This research focusses on the development of strategies for embodied carbon reduction in Sri Lankan high-rise buildings. Five expert interviews have been conducted to obtain the opinions on the applicability of the global embodied reduction strategies for Sri Lankan context. Subsequently, case study analysis was carried out for selected four ongoing high-rise buildings to ascertain the carbon reduction strategies practiced in Sri Lanka. It is revealed that, efficient selection and use of low energy and low carbon materials, materials minimization, local sourcing of materials and transportation minimization, efficient construction process, reuse and recycling of carbon intensive materials are suitable strategies for Sri Lankan context.

This legislation gives civil-rights protection to individuals with disabilities that is parallel to previous civil-rights legislation based on race, color, national origin, age, sex, and religion. ADA is composed of five titles (sections), one of which is Title III, Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities. Title III requires that persons with disabilities be provided access to goods and services within places of public accommodation and new or altered commercial facilities equal to or similar to that available to the general public. This section of ADA is of special concern to the design and construction industry because of the uncertainty in applying ADA terminology and the potentially high costs that may result from facility modification and/or legal action. Title III is unprecedented in that it is the first civil-rights law to affect both building and site design. This paper examines the provisions of Title III and identifies critical management issues as related to their potential impact on facility design and construction.

This paper aims to establish the principles for regenerative construction project management (RCPM). The regenerative approach has been assimilated into the project management concept considering construction project management requirements of the regenerative constructions, their need to be kept alive and in harmony with their location adapting changes in technology throughout their entire life. The research reveals that the RCPM requires changes in the current construction project management with respect to: the feasibility and processes; designers', project managers' and communities' roles; scope, complexity and focus of construction project management; contracts; and supply chain and material industry. The RCPM concept introduced in this paper allows the introduction of new concepts. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge as it is the first preliminary study on the RCPM concept and its principles.

Although integration in general and ID in particular have been well theorized by construction management research community, there exists no systematic mechanism in the field to help owners, architects, and managers of green project teams assess the level of integration in their projects' ID team environment in a practical manner. The key objective of the present article is therefore to use a qualitative-quantitative methodology to propose and validate an integration evaluation framework for green project teams and to statistically test the association between integration level and project success. The framework can be used by green project teams for comparison, benchmarking, or educational purposes and for integration evaluation and improvement in ID team environments. This research also provides empirical evidence to anecdotes suggesting positive link between team integration and project success in green projects.

This study developed a prediction model for proportion of buildings exposed to noise in excess of the construction noise regulation (the overexposed building ratio) as the evaluation index, to effectively manage construction noise using elastic net linear regression and polynomial interpolation. Through the conducted case study, the developed prediction model showed better prediction performance (a 35.5% average increase) than the general model. The developed prediction model was applicable to construction sites with no database and was able to predict not only the overexposed building ratio but also the number of dwellers exposed to such noise level. The prediction model can encourage construction companies and dwellers to actively participate in the management of construction noise and can provide acoustic comfort to communities.

BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						contract management; lean construction; production managment; production; project management; risk management; theory of production; theory of project		According to adherents of lean construction, project management theorists and practitioners, when drawing from the concepts and principles of economics, have neglected the management of production. The consequences of this neglect are said to include poor control ( low reliability) of handoffs between design, supply and construction specialists, and a tendency to promote adversarial relationships - reducing value delivered and increasing waste. There is increasing agreement in the construction community that these problems must be solved and that the production perspective must be integrated into project management theory and practice. But how is it best to do so? Is it a matter of supplementing existing project management theory and practice with an additional perspective, or should we start from a conceptualization of projects as temporary production systems? This paper explores the alternative of subordinating the economics-based theory of project management to the theory of production. A recent synthesis of an economics-based project management approach is critically assessed, and an alternative, production-based approach is outlined.

The search results indicated an increased research interest in the exploration of PPP CSFs since 1990. The mostly identified CSFs are risk allocation and sharing, strong private consortium, political support, community/public support and transparent procurement. It was further noticed that Australia, the U.K., China and Hong Kong have been the countries of focus for most research studies on PPP CSFs. Finally the research approaches adopted are case study, questionnaire survey and mixed methods. The findings revealed provide an overview of CSFs for PPPs in order to enhance future implementations. Moreover a checklist of CSFs for PPPs has been developed, which could be adopted for further empirical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The existing measures of remoteness require an extensive amount of population census and of road and infrastructure network data, and often are limited to narrow scopes. This paper presents a methodology to quantify remoteness using nighttime satellite imagery. The light clusters of nighttime satellite imagery are direct yet unintended consequences of human settled populations and urbanization; therefore, the absence of illuminated clusters is considered as evidence of remoteness. The proposed nighttime remoteness index (NIRI) conceptualizes the remoteness based on the distribution of nighttime lights within radii of up to 1,000 km. A predictive model was created using machine learning techniques such as multivariate adaptive regression splines and support vector machines regressions to establish a reliable and accurate link between nighttime lights and the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA). The model was used to establish NIRI for the United States and Canada, and in different years. The index was compared with the Canadian remoteness indexes published by Statistics Canada.

Managing social challenges in the nuclear decommissioning industry: A responsible approach towards better performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder management; Decommissioning; Social responsibility; Participatory decision making; NIMBY syndrome	PROJECT; MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; MEGAPROJECTS; FRAMEWORK; SCANZANO; SUCCESS; STORAGE; POLICY; WASTES	At the end of their lifecycle, several large infrastructure will have to be dismantled, presenting unfamiliar challenges. Therefore, project management will need to focus extensively on the delivery of successful decommissioning projects to meet stakeholders' expectations and funding constraints. While there is an extensive literature that investigates the techno-economic aspects of decommissioning, social aspects remain remarkably under-investigated. Even if stakeholder communication, involvement and engagement are widely believed to be key enablers for the success of a project, often the needs and preferences of local communities are neglected and a participatory-based form of dialogue averted. Consequently, decommissioning projects fail to meet their intended objectives. Focusing on the nuclear decommissioning industry, this paper addresses the literature gap concerning social responsibility. A deductive method to formulate and validate theories regarding the social challenges for decommissioning is developed through a review and analysis of salient case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although people's living quality improves and transportation needs increase, the environmental quality is destroyed with rapid economic and traffic growth. The concept of traffic assignment, an important procedure for transportation planning, should take all needs into consideration. Based on the viewpoints of all constituencies, this paper attempts to determine optimal flow patterns using three objectives-total travel time for road users, air pollution for nonusers (such as community residents), and travel distance for government-to formulate an effective multiobjective model for traffic assignment. By using multiobjective decision making and nonlinear programming techniques, a series of noninferior solutions is generated. By combining an eigenvector weighting method with pairwise comparison, we obtain a compromise solution for the flow pattern. An application case for the Taipei network system is also presented and discussed. The results show that if other nontraffic related factors are taken into account, the multiobjective traffic-assignment approach is more reasonable and suitable than conventional approaches.

This paper describes the rationale, design and potential application of a framework developed to support regenerative design and development in practice and, in particular, the transition from current green practices and discussions to those shaped by regenerative principles. Rather than present sets of specific design strategies and directives that could inhibit creative solutions, the framework is populated with provocative questions. These are considered the most effective basis for initiating a different and expanded dialogue between the design team members and with the client and users and to engage a broader range of possibilities by moving beyond the immediate building and site boundaries. Moreover, while the framework has a consistent structure, the questions change and can be adapted to different situations - from community engagement, design charrettes and team meetings to detailed design explorations.

J	Chia, B; Wang, YH; Chen, Y				Chia, Bernadette; Wang, Yuhong; Chen, Yang			Flood Resilience of Urban River Restoration Projects: Case Studies in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Resilience; River channels; Enhancement works; Biodiversity; Storms; Flooding	RIPARIAN VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES; INVASIONS; FRAMEWORK; RISK	As a flood mitigation strategy, most of Hong Kong's river channels were straightened and lined with concrete to maximize their drainage capacities, but at the cost of ecological and aesthetic values. To reclaim these and still meet engineering demands, some nature-based solutions have been introduced to revitalize the rivers. However, there are concerns about the resilience of the restored rivers under heavy rainstorms. In this paper, a framework and process for resilience analysis is proposed, based on which resilience analysis was performed on two river restoration cases from the perspectives of engineering resilience, system resilience, and complex adaptive system resilience. The analysis framework and process were found to be useful in generating technical and managerial insights into the resilience of the river restoration projects. Based on the analysis results, proactive design and adaptive operation management strategies are recommended. Although resilience analysis in this paper was performed in the context of river restoration projects, the framework and process may be applicable to other civil infrastructures.

The article starts by outlining the resilience discourse, focusing on the organizational, technological, and societal domains of resilience. It goes on to present an approach to how the risk management standard can be extended to a critical infrastructure resilience management framework. Focusing in particular on the organizational and technological resilience domains, which are considered those that can most readily be controlled by critical infrastructure operators, the article presents one of the resilience assessment techniques in some detail to operationalize the overall management framework. In so doing, the article proposes a prestandardization input for critical infrastructure resilience management, tested in an operational environment. The article concludes with five maxims for this objective: no duplicate practices; tailorability; plurality of assessment techniques; measurability; and relative ease of use.

Investigative emphasis is on RI and TG enablers and challenges (within an academic context). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative narrative data accrued from open-ended questions within a structured questionnaire survey are analysed using frequency, quantitative content analysis, and graphical methods. A model of the RI/TG interface is presented and discussed. Findings - Principal RI enablers are "facilitation" (industry engagement, time); while principal constraints include "internal factors" (the academic, the university) and "external factors" (collaboration, funding). Respective TG enablers are "resources" (competence, time, funding) and corresponding challenges include "external factors" (market forces, compliance). RI is considered a minor challenge to TG. Research limitations/implications - The study adds empirical evidence to the ongoing RI debate within the UK generally and with regard to the CMR discipline more specifically. Originality/value - RI research is relatively sparse, while the findings in regard to CMR are entirely novel.

Companies need to systematically analyze and interpret online commentaries to enhance in-house research and design activities. To this end, a framework is proposed using a design science approach to enable automatic analysis of the content of online opinions and comments in connection with specific products, using a web lexicon established for this purpose. Furthermore, this framework is applied to an automobile as a proof-of-concept. Several nicknames for the car brand studied were created by web users, some with irony and sarcasm. A few metaphorical expressions were also used to describe product features. Engineering practitioners should recognize the importance of stylized online expressions in order to have a better understanding of customer needs and expectations through the application of this framework, which incorporates an evolutionary web lexicon.

J	Guikema, S; Gardoni, P				Guikema, Seth; Gardoni, Paolo			Reliability Estimation for Networks of Reinforced Concrete Bridges	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							FRAGILITY; MODELS	Transportation networks are critical lifelines and their functionality after an earthquake is of primary importance for life safety and economic recovery of a community, yet they can be severely damaged during earthquakes. Reinforced concrete bridges are particularly vulnerable segments of these networks and have been severely damaged in past earthquakes. Past approaches for estimating traffic disruptions due to earthquakes have relied on computationally expensive simulations and have tended to overestimate postearthquake traffic volumes. This paper makes use of predictive fragility estimates to compute the conditional probability that a bridge in the network attains or exceeds a specified performance level for a given value of the ground motion intensity. The predictive fragilities incorporate the relevant sources of uncertainty inherent in the phenomenon. The focus of the paper is on network connectivity rather than traffic flow. The outcomes of the proposed approach can then be used by traffic models to accurately reflect postdisaster conditions. A block sampling-based simulation technique is used to estimate the network connectivity. This new approach provides a convenient, quick estimation of network reliability that complements computationally expensive traffic models.

J	Abraham, DM; Merkel, D				Abraham, DM; Merkel, D			Goals and procedures evaluation in decommissioning planning	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								For the past 50 years, the United States and the rest of the world have been harnessing the power of the atom to deter aggression, to power communities, to fight disease, and to fulfill other needs. Current defense-oriented laboratories and production facilities face closing and decommissioning. In fact, by the year 2030, all currently operating nuclear facilities will be closed. Decommissioning projects involve great risk and tend to be very complicated, particularly once field operations commence. However, most often, very little consideration is given to the actual field operations during decommissioning planning, and this leads to large cost and schedule overruns. This paper creates a framework to help decision makers evaluate construction-related information at each step of the decommissioning planning process. Three levels of planning, namely, project goal setting, component goal setting, and procedure evaluation are considered. Project goal setting and certain aspects of component goal setting can be completed using information from past projects. However, during procedure evaluation, detailed analysis on all project-specific characteristics is essential. The final step proposed in procedures evaluation is a detailed cost/benefit analysis.

J	Jalocha, B; Goral, A; Bogacz-Wojtanowska, E				Jalocha, Beata; Goral, Anna; Bogacz-Wojtanowska, Ewa			Projectification of a global organization - case study of the Roman Catholic Church	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project tools and techniques; Project characteristics; Project and programme management	WORLD YOUTH DAY; PROJECT; KNOWLEDGE; CONSEQUENCES; MEGAPROJECTS; LEGACIES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand projectification processes of the global organization, based on the example of the Catholic Church's activities. The Catholic Church is the oldest and the largest international organisation to be assessed also from the longue duree perspective. The Church as both a large and supranational organisation and a religious community has carried out a lot of social tasks. A part of its activity relating to the Church's basic mission is carried out in these days in the form of various projects. In this paper, the authors demonstrate that seemingly unchanging structure, such as the Catholic Church, based on a determined hierarchy, strict principles and rules of conduct, is affected by the projectification processes. Design/methodology/approach The authors chose the method of a single case study. To analyse the projectification processes in the Church, the authors focussed on flagship mega-events of WYD programme, from which the following were selected: Rome (1985), Manila (1995), Sydney (2008), Rio de Janeiro (2013) and Krakow (2016). Findings The study demonstrates that organisational projectification processes can have a real impact on the strategic changes in the global organisation. Under the influence of significant projects, organisations can change internally and also redefine their way of interacting with the stakeholders. Projectification at the same time is a change and leads to it. The research also shows that projectification of a global organisation can intensify internal learning processes. On the one hand, "projectification agents" transfer project practices to various regions of the world, and, on the other, draw on local practices. Therefore, the projectification process is not simply transplanting the project "virus" into new places, but also a process of change and adaptation to the stimuli flowing from the environment. Originality/value The particularities, the distinctiveness of the projects of the Catholic Church can be an inspiration for others realizing projects. The experience of the Catholic Church in the implementation of WYD can be valuable for organisations implementing other projects that require involvement and activation of many, diverse stakeholders, for example, charitable projects or the so-called community engagement projects implemented by large international organisations, such as the World Bank, UNICEF, the UN, the Red Cross or humanitarian projects organised by NGOs in different parts of the world.

Although, researchers have given some attention to the antecedents of successful e-marketplace participation by organizations, there has been relatively little attention given to the e-marketplace structures. In this paper, the issue of e-marketplace strategy and its relationship with e-marketplace structure is examined. A classification of e-marketplace strategies is presented. The market structures of intermediary, hierarchy, consortium, and large group ownership structures are mapped onto this classification using four case studies to explain the relationship between structure and strategy. Each structural model has a range of implications for market participants. These include the economic and service benefits from intermediaries, economic benefits, and the potential to deliver improved levels of service for hierarchies, the relational benefits from the strong network ethos of consortia, and large group ownership structures which have potential for regional community or industry sector development.

The overall goal of Green Building Challenge '98 (GBC '98) was to develop, test and demonstrate an improved method for measuring building performance across a range of environmental and energy issues and then to inform the international community of scientists, designers, builders and clients about the results. 34 case study buildings from 14 countries were used to test and demonstrate this new method. As a second-generation method for assessing building performance, the GBC '98 assessment framework builds on the first generation systems developed in a number of countries. Unique to GBC '98 is the provision of an international framework capable of being adapted to national or regional circumstances. A description of the design goals and design features of the GBC '98 assessment method and GBTool is provided. Both the process and the product have served to stimulate critical debate about the scope and role of building environmental performance assessment and the actual design of green buildings.

J	Ahern, T; Leavy, B; Byrne, PJ				Ahern, Terence; Leavy, Brian; Byrne, P. J.			Complex project management as complex problem solving: A distributed knowledge management perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complex project management; Distributed knowledge management; Bounded planning; Problem solving; Common will	ORGANIZATIONS; INTEGRATION; FIRM; TRANSFORMATION; CAPABILITIES; COMMUNITIES; TYPOLOGY; CAME	Traditional project management (PM) privileges planning and downplays the role of learning even in more complex projects. In contrast, this paper draws inspiration from two organisations that were found to have developed complex PM expertise as a form of complex problem solving (CPS), a practice with implicit learning because complex projects are unable to be completely specified in advance (Hayek, 1945). Central to this view of complex project management as a form of complex problem solving is the governance challenge of knowledge management under uncertainty. This paper proposes that the distributed coordination mechanism which both organisations evolved for this contingency can best be characterised as a 'common will of mutual interest', a self-organising process that was fostered around project goals and paced by the project life cycle (Kogut and Zander, 1992). The implications for theory, research, and practice in complex PM knowledge management are examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.	[Ahern, Terence; Leavy, Brian; Byrne, P.

J	Liu, TT; Wilkinson, S				Liu, Tingting; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Large-scale public venue development and the application of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-Private Partnerships; Exhibition and events; Venue development; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; New Zealand; Australia	INFRASTRUCTURE; PROJECTS	Large-scale venues for exhibitions and events are important public infrastructure. Developing venues have captured much of governments' attention due to the potential benefits the industry would bring to the community. However, venue development requires considerable capital and operating costs, unique standards of design and complicated operational issues. Public Private Partnerships were introduced by governments as innovative delivery models to bring forward venue projects. This paper presents comparative case studies of two PPP venue projects in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and New Zealand aiming to investigate key challenges for using PPPs in venue development and propose strategies to address the problems and assist future planning and organization for venue PPPs. The research shows that for a successful venue PPP, the following are critical features: (1) sound business case development; (2) streamlined financial arrangements; (3) robust tendering; (4) effective governance structure and partnership-based consortium; and (5) realistic risk allocation.

J	Small, EP; Bakry, I; Ayyash, L				Small, Edgar P.; Bakry, Ibrahim; Ayyash, Lu'ay			Evaluating the effect of TQM on MEP construction productivity and project delivery in Dubai	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Total Quality Management; productivity; project delivery; MEP	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; QUALITY	Management techniques, such as Total Quality Management (TQM), have been proven to provide a positive impact on construction productivity. Despite this, TQM is rarely employed on construction projects in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This paper quantitatively documents the effect of applying TQM on construction productivity in the Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) sector of construction using an active MEP subcontract. The utilized project consisted of two mirror-image sides; each managed independently using alternative managerial approaches: TQM on side A and status-quo procedures on side B. Data was collected and Earned Value analysis was used to compare the performance of both sides over the life of the subcontract. The study showed measurable benefits in terms of productivity and project progress through the implementation of TQM. Applying TQM through integrated management, better communication and involvement of all participants resulted in an increase of productivity up to 3%. Results are hoped to influence the willingness of the construction community to implement TQM and to further explore other management approaches.

J	Chen, YD; Wang, Q; Ji, WY				Chen, Yudi; Wang, Qi; Ji, Wenying			Rapid Assessment of Disaster Impacts on Highways Using Social Media	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disaster management; Highway infrastructure; Social media mining	TRANSPORTATION; CLASSIFICATION; TWEET	A timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is desired for executing evacuations, providing emergency services, and planning relief and recovery activities in disaster management. Although social media-a near-real-time and human-centered information source-has been increasingly investigated to assess disaster impacts on communities, the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still less explored due to the lack of a systematic and reliable approach. To fill this gap, this research presents a social media-based approach to assess disaster impacts on highways. Two social media-based indicators, namely, the number of impact-related tweets (NIT) and the geolocation of impact-related tweets (GIT), are designed to indicate the severity and location of disaster impacts on highways, respectively. Disaster impacts on highways during Hurricane Harvey in Houston were studied to demonstrate the developed approach. The feasibility and applicability of the research outcomes are validated through the highway high-water incidents data collected by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).

This paper aims to explore combinations of actions that external stakeholders normally pursue to influence construction projects, and to hypothesise factors affecting the use of these combinations. A theoretical framework of stakeholder strategic actions was proposed and applied, and a multiple-case study in the Vietnamese construction industry was employed. Three combinations of influence strategies were identified: communication and credibility building were employed concurrently by organised groups in projects affecting the environment; direct action and conflict escalation were exerted together by unorganised groups in cases leading to displacements of the locals; and coalition building was combined with communication by both groups irrespective of projects' impacts. The utilisation of a combination can be affected by the selection of lobbying actions and characteristics of individual strategies, and stakeholders' motives, attributes and perceptions.

Applying Actor-Network Theory as a sensemaking framework for complex organisational change programs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Actor Network Theory; Public sector; Organisational change; Project management information systems	PROJECT-MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMMUNITIES; INNOVATION; SERVICE; VIEW	The implementation of a Project Management Information System (MS) in three public sector agencies is examined using Actor Network Theory, an infrequently applied approach to project management research. Use of the PMIS focused on practitioner capability, without acting as a mechanism of project control. This is different to how a PMIS is generally portrayed in the literature, suggesting a need to rethink the Ways a PMIS can support project management. The research revealed that the PMIS software application, by itself, would have had limited impact, and similarly the practitioner researchers who developed and implemented the PMIS would, by themselves, have been less effective. Instead, the contribution, effectiveness and capability came from the stable network of association between the practitioner researchers and the PMIS; an actor network, which allowed other networks to stabilise and develop, as new users learned how to conceptualise their work through project management concepts, and developed their project management capability.

J	Kock, N; Davison, R				Kock, N; Davison, R			Can lean media support knowledge sharing? Investigating a hidden advantage of process improvement	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						action research; Brazil; collaborative technologies; electronic communication; knowledge sharing; New Zealand; process improvement	ELECTRONIC MAIL; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATION; RICHNESS; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; COMMUNITIES; GROUPWARE	Is there a positive link between the use of collaborative technologies and knowledge sharing? The body of empirical evidence compiled so far suggests a negative answer to this question. Many explanations have been proposed, the most common being that current collaborative technologies do not yet have enough sophistication, or do not yet provide enough media richness, to enable knowledge sharing. This paper presents evidence that not only suggests that this explanation is wrong, but also that simple collaborative technologies can have a positive effect on knowledge sharing in organizations. This paper shows that, when combined with appropriate social processes, collaborative technologies may foster knowledge sharing. It does so by focusing on process improvement as a group process, and showing that: 1) process improvement is a catalyst to knowledge sharing and 2) a lean communication medium, namely e-mail conferencing, has a positive impact on knowledge sharing when used to support process improvement initiatives.

Civil Engineering Grand Challenges: Opportunities for Data Sensing, Information Analysis, and Knowledge Discovery	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Civil engineering; Grand challenges; Data sensing; Information analysis; Knowledge discovery	SOIL-EROSION; COSTS	This paper presents an exploratory analysis to identify civil engineering challenges that can be addressed with further data sensing and analysis (DSA) research. An initial literature review was followed by a web-based survey to solicit expert opinions in each civil engineering subdiscipline to select challenges that can be addressed by civil engineering DSA research. A total of 10 challenges were identified and evidence of economic, environmental, and societal impacts of these challenges is presented through a review of the literature. The challenges presented in this paper are high building energy consumption, crude estimation of sea level, increased soil and coastal erosion, inadequate water quality, untapped and depleting groundwater, increasing traffic congestion, poor infrastructure resilience to disasters, poor and degrading infrastructure, need for better mining and coal ash waste disposal, and low construction site safety. The paper aims to assist the civil engineering research community in setting an agenda for data sensing and analysis research to address these challenges.

Forty-five government and industry agencies associated with water security were identified. Existing WVA methodologies were compared to the EPA's six-step WVA guidance and an expanded version of the hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) framework for the hardening of water systems, a technique previously used for assessing vulnerability of infrastructure. Neither the AWWA Water System Security Field Guide, nor the Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment Guide for Small Drinking Water Systems were in complete agreement with the EPA's WVA guidance. Inclusion of HHM risk scenarios in the assessed methodologies ranged from 64 to 95%. Fifty-nine of the 112 HHM risk scenarios were not included in at least one, and 34 risk scenarios were not included in at least two WVA methods. No method emerged as a "best practice" technique for small and medium sized water systems. Consistent standards for WVA methods are needed.

It can play a significant role for the sustained improvement of system if the cultural heritage is preserved and promoted to create awareness and economic stability through tourism and various other means. However, with the continuous increase in urbanization, cities become more vulnerable to the menace of disaster. Infrastructure resilience evaluation provides key attributes in all phases, i.e., before, during and after disaster. If these attributes are tackling correctly, then it becomes easy to foster infrastructure resilience. Cultural heritage connects the communities to the past and makes an equal contribution to the economic development. In this paper, past methodologies have been critically reviewed focusing on resilience of the infrastructure system and suggested an analytical approach to tackle the very concept of resilience through the economic dimension through cultural heritage preservation.

This paper investigates the impact of design and scope changes on the performance of VDC tasks by adopting a hybrid research methodology that depends on interviewing and survey samples of electrical contractors. Drivers of VDC cost overruns and best practices to control and recover these costs are presented. This paper provides two contributions to the body of knowledge and industry practice of the construction engineering and management community. First, the paper presents the extent and drivers of the inefficiencies and cost overruns experienced by electrical contractors in managing VDC work scopes. Second, a set of best practices is suggested to manage, plan, and control the performance of VDC tasks of electrical contractors and other specialty contractors.

This study poses the following hypotheses: The maintenance and performance of clinics can be monitored with accuracy and reliability by following key performance indicators (KPIs) based on criteria for performance and life cycle costs, and implementation of such principles can contribute both to cost savings and improved performance. A performance-based model was developed for clinic facilities by integrating eight KPIs into an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the maintenance of public clinic facilities.

Literatures and practices highlight the importance of safety knowledge to the construction safety. However, safety knowledge is not always provided in a convenient and timely manner. This paper develops a Knowledge-dynamics Integrated Map (KIM) to visualize safety knowledge flow in tunnel construction safety risk management. The KIM highlights the what, the who, and the why of knowledge flow by portraying its dynamics associated to the working processes. With the use of KIM, the safety knowledge flow barriers are identified so that knowledge flow facilitators can be designed. The KIM has been applied in Wuhan metro project as a blueprint for systematically developing effective safety knowledge management systems.

In addition, construction schedulers are frequently forced to incorporate aggressive schedule compression techniques. As already discussed by previous researchers, these schedule compression techniques have direct impacts on project productivity and quality defects. Researchers have also pointed out that schedule compression will affect safety incidents such as Occupational Safety & Health Administration recordable injuries and near misses over long project durations. However, most of the existing studies treated safety as a subcategory of project productivity and project quality, and minimal research has been done to directly quantify the effect of schedule compression on safety at the project level. Therefore, in this research, we conducted a survey and statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between schedule compression and safety in construction projects. We interviewed various members of the Houston construction community from both industrial and non-industrial roles. Statistical analysis was used to identify factors that have significant impacts on the occurrence of safety incidents at an industry specific level.

BIM models enhance the process of communicating the progress of construction to stakeholders and facilitate integrated project delivery, coordination and clash detection. However, barriers within the construction industry in Ethiopia has led to slow BIM adoption in the country. The aim of this paper is to identify perceived BIM barriers, provide a platform to quantify their importance and develop a regression model to link individual's personal/professional attributes to their perception of BIM barrier. Design/methodology/approach To address the objectives of this research, an online survey was developed to collect feedback from construction professionals in Ethiopia on 20 major adoption barriers extracted from a thorough review of literature. Relative importance index and strength of consensus metric were employed to identify the significance of barriers. This was then succeeded by performing exploratory factor analysis to determine the major constructs of BIM barriers which was then used to develop a multivariate regression model linking respondents' personal attributes to their perception of BIM barrier. Findings Results revealed the importance of project complexity and BIM maturity level in prioritizing barriers that are more relevant under various contexts. More specifically, results indicated the following study highlights: Project complexity led to higher perceived weights for lack of appropriate physical/cloud infrastructures, and a BIM standard. Higher levels of BIM maturity signified the importance of BIM internal issues such as liability, licensing and maintenance issues among other adoption barriers. Female participants tended not to consider intangibility of BIM benefits as a major barrier towards BIM adoption compared to male participants. Age of the participants turned out to be the least important factor in their prioritization of BIM perceived adoption barriers. Originality/value While many research studies have explored BIM adoption barriers in various countries around the world, none to the best of the authors' knowledge have attempted to develop a model to highlight the impact of individuals' personal/professional attributes on their perception of adoption barriers within their community which can help with prioritizing the barriers that are deemed to be more important given the characteristics of the community under study. Our result indicated the importance of BIM maturity level and project complexity in prioritizing barriers associated with BIM adoption within Ethiopia's construction industry.

Regenerative design in science and society	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; design framework; design practices; regenerative design; sustainable building; sustainable development		The Building Research & Information special issue entitled 'Regenerative Design and Development' (2012, volume 40, number 1) describes the emerging theory and practices. This commentary considers how regenerative design and development needs to engage with some broader topics of sustainability and the quest for knowledge. The papers in the special issue raise many matters, but this commentary will concentrate on three of them: (1) issues of scale, in space, time and the system level; (2) holism versus reductionism; and (3) monitoring, evaluation and intervention. Although they must be discussed individually, these topics overlap to a great degree. Challenges are posed on whether professionals and community stakeholders are empowered to intervene at appropriate scales, over sustained periods of time, to monitor operation over the longer term and, if needed, to make further interventions if the design goes awry. Although authors in the special issue question the role of reductionism in favour of a holistic view, there are merits for the use of reductionism, particularly for assisting with uncertainties or identifying constituent parts. A key challenge now will be to explore what practices and operations could provide solutions.

Using case study and network-theory based analysis in a large reclamation project, this paper investigated the key stakeholder concerns and concern interdependencies of MEPs, and how they bring major challenges confronted by stakeholders. The network analysis identifies five major challenges of the case: "applying highly advanced and complex construction technology", "mitigating project disruptions to the environment and marine ecology", "conducting public and community consultation during construction phase", "site constraints due to nearby air and marine traffic", and "meeting government standard on the quality of new materials and equipment". Recommendations are provided to alleviate these problems for future MEPs. This paper contributes to a new angle, the network perspective, of analyzing stakeholder concern interdependencies and their practical implications on MEPs. The findings provide useful insights on common pitfalls of MEPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

In the process, numerous models were separately developed, resulting in duplicate development efforts, inconsistent theoretical foundations and a lack of integration. A sharable, universal and open source database of behavioral models comprised of cooperative behaviors relevant to construction problems is proposed, namely Human Cooperative Behavioral Library (HCBL). Facilitated by a cloud environment, HCBL allows fast queries from remote modelers. HCBL is also expandable: future contributors can add or modify behavioral modules upon discovering new evidence, which will continuously improve the information. An HCBL prototype was developed with 12 cooperative behaviors modeled and coded as behavioral modules, or methods, encapsulated in a parent class called actor. To prove its usefulness, HCBL was used in an ABM model to investigate cross-functional cooperation in an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) project. Result has shown that HCBL makes the development of ABM models easier. This study sets a stepping-stone for modularizing ABM for behavioral simulation studies in construction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There is a growing body of knowledge on energy and resource efficiency, but there is a gap in how to counter barriers to enable technical and financial success. In this paper, barriers to energy efficiency adoption established from the literature are identified from 100 short-term manufacturing operations projects across 11 European plants over a three-year period. The longitudinal examination of multiple projects provides research insight absent from the literature that could be used by companies to enhance the outcomes of their improvement programs. Learning from early projects resulted in interventions to enable reduction in environmental impact and cost. The contribution of this research is the identification of enablers to sustain energy efficiency advancement of vision, objectives, operational responsibility, methods, training, people, community, equipment, and data. This paper has potential to better explain how organizational enablers mitigate barriers to environmental efficiency adoption to in turn reduce impact and to reduce cost.

Recent debate within the construction management research community has focused concerns on the appropriateness of quantitative methods for investigation into social aspects of the subject. In this paper, two contributory factors behind the historical reliance on quantitative or positivist methods are addressed: the practical difficulties in analysing large amounts of unstructured data within sensible time-scales; and wider issues concerning the perceived rigour, depth of understanding, consistency and methodological transparency of qualitative analytical techniques. An interesting new dimension to qualitative research methodologies is the use of computer software to aid the textual analysis of ethnographic data. This paper is a reflexive example of the use of a computer-aided method in the analysis of a 'Grounded Theory' study, within industrial organizations with commercial objectives, It is concluded that, whilst computer aided analysis does not provide a definitive solution to the wider acceptance of qualitative research methods in the field, it offers considerable potential for construction management research projects which are undertaken within defined time and resource constraints.

Thus, by means of normative interventions (NIs), the authorities have started investing in improving the energy behavior of households as an important factor affecting the energy consumption of buildings. In this regard, ecofeedback programs and the appointment of environmental champions (ECs) in the target community are considered practical solutions. This paper presents a novel approach, characteristic-based selection of households (CBSH), to improve the short-term and long-term effects of such NIs by focusing on characteristics of the energy behavior of households. In the simulation model, the household's energy consumption behavior and social network can be altered to study the effectiveness of different scenarios for a selection of households as ECs or ecofeedback attendants. According to the simulation results, the outcome of NIs can be promoted by using CBSH to select ecofeedback participants as well as integrating ECs with ecofeedback programs.

In the military domain, there is also an increasing interest in utilising RAS technologies. In particular, ground-based forces are frequently called upon to conduct earthmoving tasks as part of military operations, tasks which could be partially or fully aided by the employment of RAS technologies. There have been rapid developments in military construction automation using high-mobility ground-based platforms, human-machine and machine-machine interfaces, teleoperation and control systems, data transmission systems, machine perception and manipulation capabilities, as well as advances in networked robotics and cyberphysical systems. Given these developments it is timely to undertake a comprehensive overview on the topic of interest to the research community and the authority. This paper presents an overview of the RAS development for platform-centric earthworks together with an analysis of the technical feasibility, maturity, key technical challenges, and future directions for the application of RAS technologies to earthmoving tasks of interest to the army.

Establishing Success Measurements of Joint Ventures in Mega Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							STRATEGIC ALLIANCES; PERFORMANCE; INSTABILITY	Joint ventures (JVs) in the oil and gas industry will not be disappearing anytime soon; the number of JVs is expected to increase in the near future as the global demand for energy resource increases. Joint ventures need to be measured correctly to properly asses their potential for success. This paper presented a study of 11 measures with respect to their contribution in measuring the degree of success of JVs. This research was supported by a variety of academic and private studies spanning several years; the aim was to develop a model that can be used in measuring the degree of success in JVs projects. Correlations and components analysis were used to examine the relations among measures and to discover underlying patterns. As a result, sustainability and financial measures were the two extracted success measures. Then, reliability test and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to validate and findings and the relationships between measures and degree of success of JVs. The sustainability measure encompassed five factors including longevity, stability, community alignment, environmental influence, and dispute resolution. The financial measure consisted of five factors including profitability, market share, access to new markets, growth, and reputation.

LEDs degrade slowly - unlike incandescent bulbs that fail catastrophically. When the luminous intensity of LEDs falls below a pre-specified threshold, they pose danger to traffic. The long-term performance and degradation rates of LEDs have not been thoroughly studied in order to gain an understanding of their useful lives and appropriate replacement schedules. There exist many stochastic factors that affect LED degradation rates making their analysis complicated. This article provides a statistical methodology based on ordinary least-squares regression for measuring the useful life and the degradation rate of an LED signal, and presents details from a field study conducted in Missouri, U.S. Our results indicated that signal type, color, and manufacturer affect degradation, and therefore useful life should be calculated for each subgroup of LED traffic signals separately. Results of this research provide a much needed methodology for engineering managers in departments of transportation and local communities for replacing LEDs.

Improving regulatory frameworks for earthquake risk mitigation	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building regulation; buildings; disaster mitigation; disaster planning; earthquake; public policy; public safety; risk mitigation	BUILDING CODES; PERSPECTIVE; CHALLENGES; POLICY	New Zealand's devastating Canterbury earthquakes provided an opportunity to examine the efficacy of existing regulations and policies relevant to seismic strengthening of vulnerable buildings. The mixed-methods approach adopted, comprising both qualitative and quantitative approaches, revealed that some of the provisions in these regulations pose as constraints to appropriate strengthening of earthquake-prone buildings. Those provisions include the current seismic design philosophy, lack of mandatory disclosure of seismic risks and ineffective timeframes for strengthening vulnerable buildings. Recommendations arising from these research findings and implications for pre-disaster mitigation for future earthquake and Canterbury's post-disaster reconstruction suggest: (1) a reappraisal of the requirements for earthquake engineering design and construction, (2) a review and realignment of all regulatory frameworks relevant to earthquake risk mitigation, and (3) the need to develop a national programme necessary to achieve consistent mitigation efforts across the country. These recommendations are important in order to present a robust framework where New Zealand communities such as Christchurch can gradually recover after a major earthquake disaster, while planning for pre-disaster mitigation against future earthquakes.

Jordan			Knowledge Sharing and Productivity Improvement: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LEARNING-CURVE MODELS; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNITIES; MOTIVATION; DIVERSITY; EMPLOYEES	Labor productivity is a major determinant of project performance in construction. Models of labor productivity in construction tend to focus on learning curve theories that assume learning is an individual process with no transfer of knowledge among crew members. This paper seeks to extend theories of individual learning to capture the crew dynamics present on construction sites. Accordingly, this paper presents an agent-based model aimed at deriving the impacts of crew composition and project schedule on knowledge sharing and, thus, on task duration. The proposed model was calibrated using field observations of 201 interactions among 12 construction workers at a construction project in Beirut, Lebanon. The results indicate that more diverse crews witness higher levels of knowledge sharing and greater productivity gains. The results also suggest that schedules keeping all the workers busy eliminate the potential for knowledge sharing and thus only benefit from the baseline gains seen in individual learning. This work contributes to the literature by developing an agent-based model that simulates knowledge sharing in the construction industry at the worker level. The study is limited by its exclusion of multiskilled workers.	[Kiomjian, Daoud; Srour, Issam] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 1107-2020, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Srour, F.

The Emergence and Collapse of Knowledge Boundaries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Group decision-making; knowledge boundaries; network analysis; natural-language processing	DECISION-MAKING; ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; TEAMS; OBJECTS; WORK; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVE; PERCEPTION	The dynamics of knowledge transfer is an important topic for engineering managers. In this paper, we study knowledge boundaries-barriers to knowledge transfer-in groups of experts, using topic modeling, a natural language processing technique, applied to transcript data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Circulatory Systems Advisory Panel. As predicted by prior theory, we find that knowledge boundaries emerge as the group faces increasingly challenging problems. Beyond this theory, we find that knowledge boundaries cease to structure communications between communities of practice when the group's expert ability is insufficient to solve its task, such as in the presence of high novelty. We conjecture that the amount of expert knowledge that the group can collectively bring to bear is a determining factor in boundary formation. This implies that some of the factors underlying knowledge boundary formation may aid-rather than hinder-knowledge aggregation. We briefly explore this conjecture using qualitative exploration of several relevant meetings. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for organizations attempting to leverage their expertise given the state of their collective knowledge.

D.; Teo, Pauline; Morrison, John			Revisiting Quality Failure Costs in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Benchmarking; Nonconformances; Quality failures; Quality performance; Rework; Contracting	REWORK COSTS; DESIGN	Quality failure costs have been reported to range from less than 1 to over 20% of a project's original contract's value (OCV). Inconsistencies in their definition and determination have rendered such costs often being cited inappropriately to support a case for addressing poor quality in construction. Quality failure costs, which are expressed in the form of nonconformances (NCRs) costs, are derived and analyzed for 218 projects delivered by a contractor between 2006 and 2015. A total of 7,082 NCRs are categorized and quantified in accordance to their cost, and the differences among project type, procurement, and contract size are statistically examined. The analysis revealed that (1)mean NCR costs were 0.18% of OCV; (2)structural steel and concrete subcontracted works had the highest levels of NCRs; and (3)differences were found in the cost of NCRs among different procurement methods and contract sizes. The research provides the international construction community with invaluable insight into the real costs of quality failure that have been borne by a contractor. Thus, the paper makes a call to reinvigorate the need to engage with performance benchmarking so as to engender process improvement throughout the international construction industry.	[Love, Peter E.

We framed our research question as 'What are the mechanisms for, drivers of, and barriers to programme-based learning?' and investigated both within- and cross-programme learning at multiple levels. Our exploratory qualitative investigation of senior managers (primarily at the Programme Director/Delivery Director level) in a large UK-based telecommunications and network services provider revealed a number of interesting and important insights. Participants interviewed tended to call upon their own tacit knowledge and experience to understand their programmes in the first instance. Knowledge acquisition and sharing was largely through social contacts and peer-to-peer connections rather than the formal processes. Explicit organisational knowledge in this instance served mainly for reference but could be 'signposted' by trusted colleagues. Learning effects varied over the lifecycle of the programme and, in the case organisation, the enterprise programme office was not viewed as being conducive to effective learning. The findings have practical implications for understanding within- and cross-programme learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

To fill this gap, we summarize a sample of papers selected from a systematic literature review (SLR), involving research papers published from 1985 to 2019. Based on a review of this literature, we: (1) Characterize three stages within the careers of project managers, namely start-career, interaction-career, and end-career; (2) Use Selye's general adaptation syndrome (GAS) model to link stages and intra-stage periods with learning and growth opportunities for project managers. We enhance our study through a focus group of 18 senior project managers in order to obtain a richer picture of the career path landscape. Our study adds a new theoretical dimension to career path planning for project managers. It can also benefit organizations in designing their talent management structures for project managers and serve the academic community by providing valuable insights into research on the careers of project managers over time.

Teaching evaluations for construction engineering and management: Opportunity to move us forward	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						engineering education; teaching methods; students; evaluation	STUDENT-RATINGS; EDUCATION; QUALITY	Engineering education is challenged to usher in new approaches to preparing its students for their professional careers. Many blue-ribbon committees call for systematic modifications in research universities to clear the path for cross-disciplinary learning communities. In this context, the paper investigates the effect of student ratings as a measure of teaching effectiveness. One survey found that engineering sophomores perceive active student-centered teaching methods as greatly ineffective, while a second survey highlighted that lecture-based teaching underpins student rating forms used at U.S. research universities. With the goal of aligning teaching objectives, learning outcomes, and the criteria for evaluating teaching, a student rating form is presented. The scales of the multidimensional construct are based on the most up-to-date understanding of effective pedagogy, the new American Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology criteria, and a view of the future of our profession. The importance of this paper lies in its science-based proposal underlying a call for the establishment of a coalition to validate a constructive approach to further teaching performance in the field of construction engineering and management.

Hierarchical Approach for Assessing the Vulnerability of Roads and Bridges to Flooding in Massachusetts	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; INDICATORS	The current study addresses the issue of vulnerability assessment of transportation systems to climate change, with the purpose of improving current indicator-based approaches in this field. It builds upon other efforts and seeks to enhance rationality in the decision-making process by minimizing arbitrary choices. The study focuses on coastal Massachusetts, which is affected by sea level rise (SLR) and storms and, thus, requires adaptation plans that will prevent interruption of service to communities that are dependent upon the transportation system. A prior step to such planning is identifying the vulnerable parts of the system. An indicator-based approach is commonly employed for that matter, wherein various indicators are integrated to measure vulnerability. Limitations of this approach include arbitrary aggregation and weighting of indicators. These limitations are addressed by prioritizing indicators to create ordered asset lists for adaptation needs. Roads and bridges are analyzed in separate schemes, and the results are presented both in a table and a map format, visualizing the relevant features to users, with the purpose of providing a vulnerability assessment that is transparent, modifiable, and rational.

Most of the research has focused on the technological side of IT development and implementation. However, information management experts agree that managerial issues are an equally important component of successful IT strategies. Companies need to resolve many managerial issues as they decide to adopt advanced forms of IT. This paper is an initial step in the understanding of these issues. The result of a detailed literature survey in the information management and A/E/C fields, it presents the main managerial issues that experts believe a company should consider as it establishes and executes its plan for the exploitation of IT. We found that the issues fell into three main categories: planning, organizational, and development and management issues. The A/E/C industry needs to understand these issues to assess the true requirements of the IT development and implementation process. The research community, in turn, needs to be aware of the issues to plan its work more effectively and to promote proactive solutions to potential technology transfer problems.

Individuals' learning effectiveness is inevitably influenced by both individual differences and the social forces of their surrounding context. While learning can be arduous and the effects of both sets of factors need to be understood to facilitate it, prior studies have typically examined social and individual aspects separately. This study integrates individual factors from the symbolic cognition perspective with social factors from the situated cognition view in a model to explain learning effectiveness. The model was tested through a survey of individual learners working on information technology-related research projects. The findings indicate that the individual factors of knowledge sourcing initiative and learning orientation as well as the social factors of shared understanding and prosharing norms have significant influences on individuals' learning effectiveness. Further, network ties and prosharing norms interact with learning orientation and knowledge sourcing initiative, respectively, to influence learning effectiveness. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.	[Kankanhalli, A.; Tan, G. W.] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117418, Singapore; [Pee, L.

Kirk			The Pebble Projects: coordinated evidence-based case studies	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						evidence-based design; feedback; healthcare design; hospitals; innovation; post-occupancy evaluation		An ongoing US research and demonstration project, the Pebble Project, uses a transdisciplinary evidence-based design process for assessing and informing design decisions on a diverse array of new and existing healthcare facilities. The Pebble Project measures the outcomes of the innovations and shares these results with the larger healthcare community. The emphasis is on understanding the linkage between the physical environment (as one of many parameters) and health outcomes and overall performance. It provides an opportunity to assess and understand how hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue and increase effectiveness in delivering care, improve patient safety, reduce patient and family stress, and improve outcomes and improve overall healthcare quality. The combined research and innovation process provides a framework for organizing research projects and assists with the formation of an emerging health facility body of knowledge. Evaluations from completed projects suggest that the evidence-based design process is better for patients and staff in hospitals. Hospitals that have carefully considered and incorporated these value-driven evidence-based design features have benefited in terms of improved quality of care, increased satisfaction, and financial savings.

The international significance of the Pearce Report is that it provides a general methodology that differs substantially from other attempts to describe the construction industry and its contribution to sustainable development. Using capital theory, it provides a conceptual framework for relating the different dimensions of value (or wealth) as ecological (physical), economic, social and cultural capitals; it explores how these dimensions interact; and it examines the possibilities of substituting one capital for another. The Pearce Report also stresses the importance of maintaining and improving value over time in the sense of a sustainable development. This Forum discusses the theoretical framework, compares this with other approaches within the European Union, considers these aspects mainly in the field of social, human and cultural capital, and proposes additional research directions that should be tackled internationally.

Among the most important tools are stress tests, originally designed to test the risk posed by nuclear power plants. A complementary harmonized multilevel stress test for nonnuclear civil infrastructure systems against natural hazards is proposed. Each stress test level is characterized by a different scope and a different level of risk analysis complexity to suit different civil infrastructure systems, different hazards, and different risks. The stress test consists of the following phases. First, the goals and the methods for the risk analysis are defined. The test is then performed at the component and system levels, followed by a verification of the findings. A penalty system is defined to adjust the output of the risk assessment according to the limitations of the risk analysis methods used. The adjusted risk assessment results are then passed to a grading system to determine the outcome of the stress test. Finally, the risk assessment results are reported, and the stress test outcomes are communicated to stakeholders and authorities.

J	Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ				Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ			Researching the investment of information technology in construction: An examination of evaluation practices	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						appraisal techniques; evaluation; information technology; investment	SYSTEMS	The inherent worth and value of information technology (IT) employed within a business setting have been meticulously defined and subsequently examined throughout the general business community. However, within the construction industry issues surrounding the IT investment process remain largely unexplored as exhibited by recent survey work in Australia, which concludes that many construction organizations have not measured the impact of their IT investments. To address this aforementioned deficiency, a questionnaire survey was undertaken to examine the approaches used by construction organizations to evaluate and justify their IT investments. The analysis of 126 responses revealed the following key findings: different types of organization significantly (p < 0.05) differ in the amount they investment in IT; investment levels in IT were not influenced by organizational size; and the scope of purpose of ex-ante IT evaluation was considered broader than a financial control mechanism. Instead, the organizations sampled used ex-post evaluation as an opportunity for teaming and thus regenerated knowledge. Based on these findings a pragmatic ex-ante IT evaluation framework is proposed which can be used by construction organizations to ameliorate their investment decision-making process.

This has led to increased efforts by the business community to research and implement the Toyota Production System, or lean manufacturing, to address these challenges. These efforts have resulted in numerous publications on lean manufacturing, including research reports, scholarly articles, and trade magazine articles. However, the existing body of knowledge on lean manufacturing is disperse and diverse in nature with respect to the application and implementation of lean tools and practices, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to gain a real grasp of this topic. In this article, we have comprehensively organized the existing work on implementation of lean manufacturing in a more structured way, enabling engineering management practitioners to more easily identify knowledge and best practices and enabling researchers to identify gaps in the extant literature. Lastly, drawing from the organizational science literature, this article also provides important insights on lean manufacturing from the perspective of organizational learning, innovation, and \culture.

This study focuses on assisting estimators who are attempting to enhance the accuracy and reliability of engineering project cost in the pre-conceptual stage. This aim has recently garnered the attention of the transportation communities. Data from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) were utilized to develop an alternative approach that aids decision makers in terms of probability and confidence level. The proposed procedure comprises heuristic and practical simulation models that can be employed to calculate the probabilistic costs of highway bridge replacement projects. The simulation models utilize independent, correlated, and Latin Hypercube sampling approaches that incorporate major work items, roll-up work items, and project-level engineering contingencies. Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are then developed as a user-friendly chart for decision makers and these CDFs can be used to assess project risks during the pre-conceptual stage. Trial runs using these estimating procedures generate reliable pre-conceptual estimates. Additionally, these procedures can be extended to other project types along with programming techniques for developing an engineering project cost decision support system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Turk, Z				Turk, Z			Multimedia: providing students with real world experiences	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						multimedia; computer assisted learning; breakdown motivated learning; throwness		Multimedia has been quickly accepted by the engineering community. In the first part of the paper, the author provides a theoretical explanation why multimedia is popular in engineering: because it tries to provide an artificial ''being-in-the-world'' experience. This explanation is backed-up by Heidegger's philosophy and Winogard's critique of artificial intelligence (AI). Heidegger believed that humans basically act pre-reflectively, depending on the situation into which they are thrown. Such decisions are based on common sense and intuitive knowledge accumulated while ''being-in-the-world'', and particularly during breakdowns. Engineering students have few opportunities to observe breakdowns, however, information technology, particularly virtual reality and multimedia provide them. In the second part of the paper, a system to teach earthquake engineering is presented, based on the principles of breakdown-oriented learning. The system is built around a multimedia database that contains digitised photographs of damages caused by some of the recent major earthquakes. To a large extent, such multimedia tools can replace the learning from real breakdowns and complements theoretical knowledge that can be passed on using traditional means.

Through the methodology of engaged scholarship academics establish a reciprocal relationship with the project community while adhering to the standards of quality scholarship. Notwithstanding its growing popularity, in project studies we do not learn much about the practices involved in engaged scholarship, neither is the concept theoretically well developed. We argue that, to further the project studies debate, methodological reflection on the reciprocal relationship between academics and practitioners is needed. For this purpose, we provide an analytical framework containing four elements; goals, negotiation practices, reciprocity typology and outcomes of project studies. We then use this framework to analyze three engaged project studies. The paper contributes to project studies with an enhanced concept of engaged scholarship containing three types of reciprocity; generalized, balanced and negative reciprocity. Furthermore, we found that a reciprocal relationship is negotiated and changes over time. We identified four mechanisms that negatively impact the academic and practical outcomes of engaged scholarship studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Denny-Smith, G; Williams, M; Loosemore, M				Denny-Smith, George; Williams, Megan; Loosemore, Martin			Assessing the impact of social procurement policies for Indigenous people	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Australia; counterfactuals; social impact measurement; social procurement; social value; sustainable procurement	EMPLOYMENT	Governments of highly developed western nations with colonised Indigenous populations such as Australia, Canada and South Africa are increasingly turning to social procurement policies in an attempt to solve social inequities between Indigenous people and other citizens. They seek to use policies and funds attached to infrastructure development and construction to encourage private sector companies to provide training, employment and business opportunities for Indigenous people in the communities in which construction occurs. This paper outlines the rise of these policies and their origins, and critiques their connection to Indigenous people's human rights, impact measurement, evaluation and accountability mechanisms. In doing so this paper also explores benefits and potential of social procurement policies, as well as risks. Drawing on insights from an Aboriginal-developed evaluation framework,Ngaa-bi-nya, and Indigenous Standpoint Theory, this paper highlights Indigenous peoples' definitions of value and outlines their relevance to social procurement. Introducing the notion of cultural counterfactuals into social impact measurement research, it also offers a new conceptual framework to enable policymakers and practitioners to more accurately account for social procurement value and impact, including Indigenous people's notions of social value.

J	Sha, KX				Sha, Kaixun			Professionalism in China's building sector: an economic governance perspective	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; construction industry; governance; integrity; professionalism; uncertainty; China		As the third force beside markets and governments, professionalism emerged to protect the interests of civil society, and it has played a unique role in the building sector. By conceptualizing professionalism as a community-based governance structure, an economic governance perspective is adopted to examine professionalism in China's building sector. The development of professionalism in China's building sector is reviewed, and both its achievements and its weaknesses are assessed. Root-cause analysis reveals that the primary impediment to building professionalism is the imbalanced relationship between markets, governments and professionals. It is argued that the success of professionalism in China's building sector is dependent ultimately on whether the government can change its overly dominant role in the economy. To address the concern of creating an independent, vibrant professional culture that contributes to the long-term public interest, the following are recommended: separating professional associations and relevant bodies from government agencies completely; improving the administrative system for both practice qualification and market access; and increasing the proportion of non-government investments to change the imbalanced relationship between professionals and public clients.

Evaluation of Trenchless Technology Methods for Municipal Infrastructure System	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure; Trenchless technology; Deterioration; Rehabilitation; Underground structures		The deterioration of municipal underground infrastructure systems and a growing demand for utility services have increased the necessity for more efficient installation, inspection, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of underground utilities. With conventional open-cut construction methods, direct costs are greatly increased by the need to restore ground surfaces such as sidewalks, pavement, landscaping, and brick paving. Furthermore, taking social and environmental factors into account, open-cut methods have adverse impacts on the community, business, and commuters due to undesirable pollution and traffic disruptions. Trenchless technologies that are used to repair, upgrade, replace, or install underground infrastructure systems with minimum surface disruption offer a viable alternative to existing open-cut methods. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for quantitatively assessing and comparing direct, social, and environmental costs associated with municipal underground pipeline construction. It is suggested that decision makers consider combining these costs with direct capital costs so that the best alternative is selected, which in certain cases can make trenchless technology the most economical alternative. Moreover, productivity, workers' safety, and structural issues have shown that trenchless technology is a more efficient method for underground infrastructure systems.

J	Wang, G; He, QH; Meng, XH; Locatelli, G; Yu, T; Yan, X				Wang, Ge; He, Qinghua; Meng, Xianhai; Locatelli, Giorgio; Yu, Tao; Yan, Xue			Exploring the impact of megaproject environmental responsibility on organizational citizenship behaviors for the environment: A social identity perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaproject; Environmental responsibility; Organizational citizenship behaviors for the environment; Environmental commitment; Social identity theory	PLS-SEM; JOB-PERFORMANCE; SAFETY CLIMATE; POWER-PLANTS; PROJECTS; IDENTIFICATION; INITIATIVES; PERCEPTIONS; INDUSTRY; SUCCESS	The importance of organizational citizenship behaviors for the environment (OCBEs) has been clearly established in the environmental literature. However, the OCBEs construct has rarely been examined in the specific and increasingly important realm of megaproject environmental responsibility (MER). To fill this gap, this paper presents an individual-level analysis that explores the impact of project participants' perceptions of MER practices on their environmental commitment and OCBEs. The results show that project participants' perceptions of MER practices directed toward internal stakeholders (i.e., stakeholders linked by project contracts) are positively related to their OCBEs. This relationship is partially mediated by the environmental commitment of project participants. Conversely, project participants' perceptions of MER practices directed toward external stakeholders (i.e., the local community and general public) have only an insignificant impact on their OCBEs.

J	Schultz, C; Kamari, A				Schultz, Carl; Kamari, Aliakbar			Diversity in Renovation Design: Theoretical Foundations of the Renovation Domain Model	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BUILT ENVIRONMENT; DATA EXCHANGE; TOOL; INTEROPERABILITY; OPTIMIZATION; METHODOLOGY; SOFTWARE; SUPPORT	Sustainable building renovation design is a highly challenging and ever more pressing issue in the construction sector. Through rounds of dialogue and negotiation, architects along with diverse sets of stakeholders must iteratively search through a large number of potential designs while aiming to optimize a range of key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure, for example, construction cost, energy efficiency, an occupant's sense of privacy, and so on. While software tools have significant potential for supporting this process, there is a lack of standardization within the community, creating barriers for the transfer of knowledge and tools between renovation projects. We are developing the Renovation Domain Model, NovaDM, a unifying framework that enables architects to formally represent project-specific details relevant to their renovation project so that NovaDM-compliant tools can be used for design generation and evaluation. In this paper we present the theoretical foundations of NovaDM, including action trees for defining project-specific scenario spaces, constraint languages for refining action trees, and a new aspect coverage strategy for structuring and sampling the full scenario space.

J	Lansley, P				Lansley, P			Building research and the quality-of-life	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						competitiveness; elderly people; quality-of-life; research communities; research policy; universal design; user needs		The last 30 years have seen significant changes in UK national policies for building research and in their implementation. Each change has led to a new balance in the relative priorities of the needs of industry and those of the citizen. Quality-of-life issues have progressively given way to those of industrial efficiency, although more recently a concern for the long term implications of the built environment for the quality-of-life of the individual citizen, has re-emerged. An illustration is given by the EQUAL (Extend Quality Life) initiative which seeks to improve the experience of buildings and the environment of older people and of those with physical and mental impairments. Analysis of the nature of the research tasks underlying the two themes of competitiveness and quality-of-life raises questions about the future development of building research. Further issues are the future balance of priorities, the appropriateness of various approaches to prioritization and organization of research, quality and standards, and the need to broaden university courses to accommodate a better appreciation of quality-of-life issues.

Although researchers have studied some predictors of OSS project performance, there is a lack of empirical work that studies the impact of project capabilities on the performance of OSS projects. Therefore, this paper studies project capabilities as potential predictors of OSS project performance. The data, gathered from 607 OSS projects over time (in two snap-shots), were consistent with Dynamic Capability Theory (DCT). In other words, the results showed that in order to achieve higher project performance, OSS projects need to have strong capabilities in terms of proactive and efficient defect-removal as well as proactive and efficient functionality-enhancement. The implications of these results for the OSS research community are discussed, followed by recommendations for OSS practitioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Project-level AMSs have been proposed to optimize maintenance interventions in the life cycle of assets by incorporating probabilistic and complex models but at the expense of relatively high computation time. To make complex project-level AMSs computationally applicable to all assets in a network, this paper presents a methodology to replace the time-consuming simulation modules of optimization algorithms with a trained machine learning model estimating life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) results. Deep neural network (DNN) models were trained on LCCA results of more than 1.4 million semisynthesized bridges based on the US National Bridge Inventory considering different intervention actions and uncertainties about condition ratings, hazards, and costs. Our findings show that the trained DNN models can accurately estimate the complex LCCA results five order of magnitudes faster than simulation techniques. The proposed methodology helps practitioners reduce the optimization and LCCA computation times of complex AMSs to a feasible level for practical utilization.

Existing research on construction safety management mainly focuses on the safety of construction personnel within the construction site, however, what the world perceives as safety failure in the construction industry is broader. This paper seeks to understand whose safety concerns are currently ignored and aims to explore the different strategic uses of safety in the construction industry. To address these objectives, this study uses naturally occurring news article data regarding construction safety in India. The paper discusses the safety of construction personnel, the safety of the project, and the safety of externalities. It was seen that safety was used strategically for branding, for political motives, as well as for awakening the community of the importance of construction safety. This study makes a case that safety management in construction is not just the prevention of accidents, but also impression management. Thus, this article argues that safety is not a neutral and easily measurable concept, but a sociocultural concept laden with meaning.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reports a comparative safety climate survey of 415 construction personnel working in the Australian and Indonesia construction industries. Findings Surprisingly, the results show that the safety climate in Indonesia and Australia are similar and that the differences in safety performance, safety climate must be interpreted within the context of wider health and safety norms, regulations, awareness, knowledge and typical work environments to make any sense. Social implications The construction industry's poor safety record has serious implications for both individuals working in the industry, their immediate families and the communities in which they live. By improving the safety record of the industry these impacts can be reduced. Originality/value This research reveals, for the first time, the cultural and institutional complexities of comparing safety climate across different countries. The results contribute to safety climate research by highlighting the importance of cultural and institutional relativity in making international comparisons of health and safety research.

This categorization is becoming more increasingly used in project management research for example by stating that some projects are "hard", while other projects are "soft", that some project skills are "hard", while other project skills are "soft" etc. The aim is to discuss this dichotomization as an example of hierarchization a power struggle between opposites within project management research and literature and acknowledge the effects for project management research and practice of unreflective upholding of this dichotomy. We provide a critical review and discussion of stage-gate models as an example of "hard" project management approaches, and agile methods as an example of "soft" approaches to project management and acknowledge that in project management practice, it seems as if "hard" and "soft" approaches are most often combined. Hence, this dichotomy seems to be upheld by the research community while practitioners show a more holistic perspective to project management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

From opportunities to integrate international and multidisciplinary teams to the opportunity to leverage the best resources in an organization on a given project, virtual teams can transform the concept of project planning and execution. However, potential barriers exist in several areas to the successful implementation of virtual teams. The needs of increased management emphasis, social and cultural understanding, and emphasis on common goals are only a few of the nontechnical factors that can turn successful virtual teaming into virtual frustration. When combined with traditional technical challenges including compatibility of systems, security, and the selection of appropriate technologies, the line between leveraging virtual technologies for enhanced solutions and introducing additional complications into the project process is one that can be easily crossed. This paper presents the findings of research that addresses the opportunities and potential barriers to successful virtual teams in the engineering, procurement, and construction industry. Combining results from current research, industry practices, and early results from nonconstruction industries, the research findings provide an initial path to successful virtual team implementation.

While this strategy was used to implement massive federal investment in highways, transit systems, and wastewater treatment. it has restricted state and local flexibility in aligning the procurement process to achieve best value for locally funded projects. The engineering, procurement, and construction community in the United States has now recognized the limitations of a procurement process designed to support a single delivery method. Change is coming, and the transition to a new process will challenge public owners in novel, but meaningful ways. This paper focuses upon shifting from the current paradigm toward a new model that supports simultaneous use of multiple project delivery methods. The discussion and frameworks provided are the result of a variety of research efforts by the Infrastructure Systems Development Research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Studies of the history of American Infrastructure, analyses of case studies across the country, development of decision support models for capital programming, and real applications to municipal infrastructure planning provide the underpinnings for the results and conclusions presented.

We therefore address megaprojects as elaborate, temporally bracketed social systems made up of key actor groups pursuing interwoven individual and joint goals that may not always be aligned. This work illustrates the process by which goal-oriented actors, in this case international organizations, national governments, firms, and civil society, work through formal administrative structures and legal systems to create and transform their institutional contexts. Building from the findings of an extended case study of the Lyon-Turin high-speed railway megaproject, we firstly detail the overarching institutional environment that megaproject professionals build to realize success. Secondly, we categorize the variety of institutional practices that actors can use to shape global megaprojects. Thirdly, we describe the institutional shaping skills available to project managers for such cases. These findings broaden the scope of traditional project management approaches to megaprojects and provide rich detail in relation to the understanding and successful governance of megaprojects.

Three ownership types (private for profit, private not for profit, and public), and two types of supply sources (ground and surface) are compared. Statistically significant results indicating efficiency advantages of certain utility types are found, and clear trends towards certain utility types are identified. The findings indicate that public utilities are most efficient overall, followed by private not-for-profit utilities, with private for-profit utilities being least efficient. Except for a few cases of very large supply demands, utilities employing groundwater sources were generally more efficient than those using surface water sources. A brief investigation into the marginal return on information obtained from using additional measurement variables to measure utility performance is presented. Additional ranking information can be obtained by using more discrete measurement variables, but with diminishing marginal returns. This presentation of public water utility efficiency evaluation should prove useful as a tool for guiding ownership policies and water source development strategies and demonstrates the utility of publicly available data sets.

This interest also underscores the important need to assess project management maturity among industries to provide many organizations a means to benchmark their maturity relative to others. This research provides a snapshot of the current level of project management maturity-among industries based on 42 detailed components of maturity. A survey of 126 organizations reveals the median level of project management maturity is level 2 out of 5 with respect to 36 of the 42 components analyzed. Additionally, this research compares project management maturity between four major industries: professional, scientific and technical services; information; finance and insurance; and manufacturing. We conclude that with few exceptions, there is not a significant difference in project management maturity between industries. These results establish a baseline to support organizational assessments of project management maturity at a component level of analysis.

J	Gibberd, J				Gibberd, Jeremy			Measuring capability for sustainability: the Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST)	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						net-positive; built environment; sustainable buildings; sustainability indicators; sustainability; neighbourhood; building assessment systems; sustainability criteria		An alternative approach to conceptualizing and measuring the built environment is developed which forms the basis of a new assessment tool. The role of buildings is reframed to consider what capabilities for sustainability a building can provide to the inhabitants and local community. This capability to support sustainability is defined as the ability to improve the local quality of life (Human Development Index) whilst remaining below the environmental carrying capacity (environmental footprint). This approach has clear implications about the role of buildings in enabling residents and users to achieve these targets and outcomes. This shifts the focus of net-positive development toward configurations and characteristics of the built environment that are appropriate for a particular context. A Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST) is presented that defines and assesses these configurations and characteristics. Assessments can be conducted by measuring the extent to which required configurations and characteristics exist (i.e. 'the capability of the built environment to support sustainability'). BEST is compared with other green building rating tool approaches in order to review the methodology critically and to evaluate this as a means of improving built environment sustainability performance.

J	McLaren, M; Loosemore, M				McLaren, Matthew; Loosemore, Martin			Swift trust formation in multi-national disaster project management teams	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Developing country; Disasters; Multinational project teams; Response; Recovery; Swift trust	COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; NATURAL DISASTER; POSTDISASTER; LEADERSHIP; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS	In recent years there has been growing interest in how project management theory can both inform and be informed by disaster response and recovery projects. Addressing the lack of empirical research into how trust forms within such projects, this exploratory study mobilises swift trust theory to investigate the process of trust formation within a multinational disaster project management team formed in response to tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji in 2016. In-depth content analysis of qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with disaster management team members, non-participant observation of the disaster project management teams during the disaster response and analysis of disaster management documentation appear to support the predictions of swift trust theory in relation to the importance of reputation, role and interdependence in building swift trust. However, theoretical predictions around the importance of categorical assumptions, confirmation of assumptions and the leadership role of the contractor did not appear to be supported by our data. It is concluded that while swift trust theory can potentially provide valuable practical and theoretical insights into trust formation in multinational disaster project management teams, it may need to be adapted to more accurately model trust formation in a disaster project management context.

J	Dawood, T; Elwakil, E; Novoa, HM; Delgado, JFG				Dawood, Thikra; Elwakil, Emad; Mayol Novoa, Hector; Garate Delgado, Jose Fernando			Artificial intelligence for the modeling of water pipes deterioration mechanisms	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Pipe failure; Condition assessment; Water Main deterioration; Infrastructure; State-of-the-art review	NEURAL-NETWORK; LEAK DETECTION; FAILURE RATE; PREDICTION; LOCALIZATION; REPLACEMENT; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; INFERENCE; SYSTEM	Water pipes deterioration modeling has been a prevalent research topic in the last two decades due to high water break incidents and contamination rates. Failure processes are de facto very intricate to be diagnosed since there is a time lag between the failure incidence and consequences. Artificial intelligence (A.I.) techniques have gained much momentum during the last two decades, specifically for the deterioration modeling and assessment of water distribution networks. However, a comprehensive critical review on water infrastructure modeling via artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is missing in the literature. This paper aims to bridge the gap in the body of knowledge and address the aforementioned limitations. The intellectual contributions of this paper are twofold. First, a comprehensive literature review method is presented through sequential steps that systematize and synthesize the literature in a scientific way. The state-ofthe-art of AI-based deterioration modeling for urban water systems is revealed along with models' methodologies, contributions, drawbacks, comparisons, and critiques. Second, future research directions and challenges are recommended to assist the construction automation research community in setting a vibrant agenda for the upcoming years.

The purpose of this paper is to explore parallels between both streams of research and an increasing projectification of entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach The study is based upon a case study of the Berlin start-up ecosystem including the analysis of interviews (n=52), secondary documents, and field observations. Findings The paper reveals that - shaped by their institutional context - patterns of project-like organizing have become pertinent to the new venture creation process. It identifies a set of facets from the entrepreneurial ecosystems - more specifically different types of organizational actors, their occupational backgrounds, and epistemic communities - that enable and constrain the process of new venture creation in a way that is typical for project-based organizing. Originality/value This study thus elaborates on how institutional settings enforce what has been called projectification in the process of new venture creation and discuss implications for start-up ecosystems.

Given that diverse stakeholders are involved in the village development process, a comprehensive stakeholder analysis, especially understanding stakeholders' concerns and expectations, is of critical importance to project success. This paper describes a stakeholder analysis based on a typical retirement village. The main methods utilized in this research were case study and an interdisciplinary workshop comprising intensive work sessions and cross-functional review. The participants of this 2014 Brisbane workshop included four village managers from an Australian retirement village developer and eight academics from diverse disciplines from a large university. Through this workshop, 24 village stakeholders and their specific concerns and expectations were identified. Results suggest that both concerns and expectations of these stakeholders are multidimensional and vary considerably, and the concerns and expectations of different stakeholders have complex relationships. Implications for a retirement village development are also proposed. The findings of the study serve as a valuable reference for developers' understanding of stakeholder concerns and expectations, and for taking corresponding actions in the final stages of the retirement village development.

J	Palagi, S; Javernick-Will, A				Palagi, Shaye; Javernick-Will, Amy			Discrepancies between Postdisaster Relocation Policy and Implementation in the Philippines	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RECOVERY; DISASTER; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES; ISSUES; MODEL	It is common for recovery policies to be crafted following disasters, such as the relocation of exposed populations, but it is rare for policy intent to be fully realized. Although critiques center on failed outcomes, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding implementation, which encompasses the intermediary processes between policy formation and outcomes. Without an understanding of implementation, it is difficult to identify actionable opportunities for change. Using document-based classic content analysis, narrative analysis, and process mapping, this study systematically compared policy and implementation to identify discrepancies unfolding throughout typhoon-induced relocation in the Philippines. Two types of discrepancies emerged: unfulfilled, which were covered in policy but not present in implementation; and added, which were unaddressed or underaddressed in policy but added by necessity during implementation. Analysis revealed that community services and infrastructure were added discrepancies, whereas development-oriented objectives were unfulfilled discrepancies. One well-documented relocation discrepancy, water supply, was analyzed in depth using implementation analysis, revealing that delayed and, at times, disorganized project management was driven by a lack of ownership and goal clarity. Shifting strategies throughout implementation indicate a need to further investigate the implementation of risk reduction and resilience-oriented policies in postdisaster contexts.

Acting on increasing digitalisation pressures, many national and international standards, protocols, and specifications have been generated with little conceptual framing or with no theoretical underpinning. This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers - which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes - and aims to predict - information flows across an assets lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.

Unfortunately, existing models tend to underperform because they either (1) ignore relevant explanatory factors or (2) incorrectly specify system feedback and structure. Through a case study with bitumen, a construction material of prime concern for transportation agencies, this paper presents a novel multivariate cost forecasting approach that overcomes these two gaps. Specifically, based on several diagnostic tests, an autoregressive distributed lag and equivalent error-correction model is specified that correctly captures the feedback structure between bitumen and energy commodities. The study then characterizes the relative merits of the approach by introducing robust deterministic and probabilistic out-of-sample forecast measures. The proposed forecasting approach greatly outperforms conventional methods: 6-month-ahead price projections are at least 25% better across the available deterministic and probabilistic metrics. For state planning agencies, this improved forecasting model will allow decision makers to better predict capital budgeting requirements and resource-planning risks. Furthermore, the proposed performance measures will better equip the construction research community to evaluate future forecasting models. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Leak Detection of Water Supply Networks Using Error-Domain Model Falsification	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MEASUREMENT SYSTEM-DESIGN; PIPE NETWORKS; STRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; TRANSIENTS	Pressurized freshwater fluid distribution networks are key strategic infrastructure elements. On average, 20% of water is lost by way of leaks around the world. This illustrates the need for more efficient management of pressurized fluid distribution networks. This paper presents a system identification methodology known as error-domain model falsification adapted for performance assessment of water distribution networks and more specifically, to detect leak regions in these networks. In addition, a methodology to approximate the demand at nodes in water supply networks is presented and a methodology for estimating uncertainties through experimentation is described. The use of error-domain model falsification for practical use in water distribution networks shows great potential. Finally, two case studies are presented. The first case study is from the water distribution network of the city of Lausanne. An experimental campaign was carried out on this network to simulate leaks by opening hydrants. The second case study is from a water distribution network of the community of Bagnes, and a leak scenario was evaluated. These two case studies illustrate, using full-scale measurements, the potential of error-domain model falsification for the performance assessment of water distribution networks.

J	Farmer, G; Guy, S				Farmer, Graham; Guy, Simon			Making morality: sustainable architecture and the pragmatic imagination	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						built environment; design practice; ethics; intelligent practice; pragmatism; sustainable building; urban design		Environmental ethics as a discipline has directed little attention towards the built environment and even less to the process of building design. Conversely, within the professional context of architectural practice, questions of ethics and morality have hardly figured within a rapidly developing discourse of sustainability in which environmental values have tended to be downplayed in the pursuit of quantitative models of environmental innovation. The philosophy of pragmatism potentially provides a useful analytical and moral framework that links the environmental ethics of sustainability to the design, construction, and use of buildings. Pragmatism's embrace of contextual pluralism, its emphasis on experience and practice, and its high regard for the political worth of the community move the discussion away from a narrow focus on predefined and universal codes, whether ethical or technical. Sustainable design should be understood as a 'co-evolutionary' ethical practice, a socio-technical process that engages a wide range of human (and non-human) actors in the production and use of complex architectural artefacts. The aim is to encourage a deeper engagement with sustainable architectural practice, to embrace broader sociological or philosophical questions (beyond narrow 'how to' debates). By exploring sustainable architectures in the plural, new questions can be posed and fresh thinking introduced about sustainable design.

This system includes hardware, software, people, and broader community aspects. This article strictly focuses on the ontology representation of synchronous collaboration sessions with collocated collective decision-making. The model is designed by considering various 4D BIM model uses while a digital multiuser touch table facilitates the collaboration between actors. The outlined ontological model aims to improve interoperability and to move toward a knowledge-driven, smart-built environment paradigm. A knowledge engineering methodology is outlined, by virtue of which the semantics of the presented model are defined and discussed. Concepts from nearby knowledge fields, especially from the Industry Foundation Classes, are reused. Several examples on querying the knowledge base according to the project meeting requirements are outlined to demonstrate the benefits of using the model. Although 4D BIM model data can be imported by using standard formats, capturing data about the social context remains a challenge in the future.

J	Gunby, M; Damnjanovic, I; Anderson, S; Joyce, J; Nuccio, J				Gunby, Molly; Damnjanovic, Ivan; Anderson, Stuart; Joyce, Jeffrey; Nuccio, Joseph			Identifying, Communicating, and Responding to Project Value Interests	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Engineering; Project objectives; Value interests	VALUE MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION	One of the most challenging aspects of project development and execution is to identify and define project elements, components, or attributes that add value to owner organizations. In addition to typical delivery requirements such as cost and schedule, there are a number of other project-specific attributes that can increase project profitability and/or reduce risks. Often owner organizations are not fully aware of these attributes, or fail to properly communicate them to the contractors. As a result, the engineering and construction (E&C) community is unable to efficiently respond to the customer's expectations. The E&C focus becomes a wide variety of perceived client's value interests, instead of few important ones. Thus, a two-year study sponsored by the Construction Industry Institute was initiated to develop a standard work process and a tool that could assist in identifying owners' project value interests, provide a standardized form for their communication, and aid in identifying an appropriate E&C response strategy. This paper presents the four-step research approach based on industry survey data collection, discusses study results, and describes the Microsoft Excel tool that supports this process.

We analyze the transition from a very early stage of activities to the ultimate commercialization of these innovations. The focus in this context is on the initiatives undertaken by lead users in order to transform their radically new solutions into functional prototypes, and then, to convince established manufacturers of the technological and market potential of their innovations. Using a comparative case study design in the high-tech field of medical equipment technology, we find that individual lead users as surgeons launch entrepreneurial activities and bridge periods in which established medical equipment manufacturers would not risk investing in radical innovations. By doing so, lead users create the conditions usually provided in manufacturer-initiated lead user projects, including the supply of diversified knowledge, the development and coordination of a network for further development of the innovation, and initial tests of technical or market feasibility. Our findings have implications for manufacturing firms that wish to design radical innovation projects with (individual) lead users and for research on new forms of lead user cooperation and integration.

This paper reviews major initiatives in North America, Europe, and Oceania. The purpose is to characterize the emergent thinking on what constitutes transportation sustainability and how to measure it. While there is no standard definition for transportation system sustainability, it is largely being defined through impacts of the system on the economy, environment, and general social well-being; and measured by system effectiveness and efficiency, and the impacts of the system on the natural environment. Frameworks based on important causal relationships between infrastructure and the broader environment, infrastructure impacts on the economy, environment, and social well-being; and the relative influence of agencies over causal factors, are largely being used to develop and determine indicator systems for measuring sustainability in transportation systems. Process-based approaches involve community representatives and other stakeholders in planning and present opportunities to educate the public and influence collective behaviors. These frameworks can be used collectively to help agencies refine their visions as well as develop policies, planning procedures, and measurement and monitoring systems for achieving sustainable transportation systems.

However, there are various challenges in the realization of prefabricated housing (PH) from the stakeholder's perspective. Transaction costs (TCs) theory provides a particular angle that explains the invisible costs within transactions. This study aims to explore how perceptions of TCs vary for stakeholder groups and show the potential to reduce TCs in China. The distribution of TCs related to stages and stakeholders was investigated by a literature study and validated by expert interviews. Further, an existing framework of TCs was adopted to conduct a questionnaire survey for collecting perceptions of TCs from six stakeholder groups. The findings show that assembly, detailed design, and design change are the most highlighted TCs of PH. In particular, the component suppliers complained of TCs from the points of detailed design and hiring skilled labor. The local government emphasized TCs on monitoring and enforcement in assembly, architectural design, and component transportation. This research contributes to the construction management community by acknowledging stakeholders in understanding their TCs, which also inspires the policy makers to reduce significant TCs to smooth transactions for the future of China's PH market.

Sustainable Disaster Recovery Decision-Making Support Tool: Integrating Economic Vulnerability into the Objective Functions of the Associated Stakeholders	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MORAL HAZARD; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN	Natural disasters affect the built environment's infrastructure and disturb the economic sector's sustainability and welfare. This requires a disaster recovery decision support tool that capitalizes on the redevelopment opportunities to elevate societies to a more-sustainable and less-vulnerable status. As such, this paper presents an agent-based model approach that aims to meet the objectives of stakeholders while decreasing the community's economic vulnerability. Accordingly, the proposed model adopts a five-step research methodology: (1)implementing a comprehensive economic vulnerability assessment tool; (2)developing the objective functions and learning algorithms of the associated stakeholders; (3)modeling the different attributes and potential strategies of the various stakeholders; (4)creating an interdependent agent based model that simulates the aforementioned information; and (5)interpreting and analyzing the results generated from the developed model. The model is developed and tested on the post-Katrina residential housing and economic financial recovery in three Mississippi coastal counties. The model proposed an evolving optimal budget distribution that decreased the economic vulnerability and increased the residential and economic recovery. Ultimately, the holistic framework utilized in this study lays down the foundation for a new generation of interdisciplinary managerial decision-making support tools.

This is particularly the case for low carbon retrofits such as those undertaken under the UK's Retrofit for the Future (RftF) programme, with its aim to achieve an overall 80% carbon reduction by 2050. Current post-occupancy evaluation (POE) research has both theoretical and methodological limitations with implications for technical and behavioural research in the built environment. Drawing on relevant ideas and concepts from social practice theory and science and technology studies, principally prefiguration (constraints/enablement), black-boxing, heating and cooling practices, this paper demonstrates how the relationship between buildings and people could be reconceptualized as mutually constitutive and co-evolving through a process of 'interactive adaptation'. The concept of 'interactive adaptation' is explored through a novel approach to integrating physical and social data collected from a sample of dwellings selected from the RftF programme. Analysis yields insights into the influences and pathways of interactive adaptation resulting from retrofit technology and practices. The implications of these insights for policy-makers, the research community and practitioners are discussed: end-use energy demand policy needs to be informed by a socio-technical approach.

Based on the paradigm shifted from 'drawing' to 'constructing' in architectural design practice, this paper focuses on developing a new type of CAD system that automatically constructs and manages well-structured floor plans with minimum geometrical input from the designer. The paper also took advantage of the building data models developed from the prior research. The model includes hierarchical building components such as 'building', 'plan', 'space', 'ring', 'wall skeleton', 'surface', 'column', etc. The creation algorithm developed assures a semantically rich and structurally correct floor plan at any point in the design process. In particular, the floor plan constructed through the design process contains spatial information as well as other design information about the building components. Thus, the system effectively manages spatial design information in the real-time basis. Since the system implemented on the basis of the algorithm is the very first step toward a complete intelligent CAD system, research and development issues to be considered next are identified at the end of the paper.

The role of these events is explored for imparting motivation and accelerating behavioural change to the event visitors for undertaking their own low-energy retrofits. Drawing on a wide range of visitor survey datasets, these community-led and locally situated events are analyzed from a social learning perspective, focusing on the visitor experiences, and the role that open home events have as situated learning, embracing the power of storytelling. Using a Many Sets of Data' approach, data are examined from three years of Australia's largest eco open home event, and visitor survey and interview reports from seven different UK eco open home events, highlighting visitor characteristics and experiences, and post-visit levels of technology adoption and behaviour change. The research finds a consistent positive experience for attendees, most of whom are homeowners already engaged on their journey of eco-home renovation. The high degree of satisfaction from attending eco open home events, combined with the high rates of perceived learning, and the track record of post-event renovation action demonstrate that these events encourage and support engaged attendees to undertake low-energy renovations.

J	Obonyo, E				Obonyo, E.			Enhancing Intelligent Knowledge Systems Using Organization-Centered Agent Models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Intelligent knowledge systems; Multi-agent systems; Organizational abstraction	MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS	Many construction industry-specific, agent-based applications have been deployed to enhance knowledge systems. These applications are generally agent-centered multi-agent systems (ACMAS). Interaction between ACMAS agents is designed around the internal mental states of an agent and the relationship between these states and its overall behavior. Communication in this approach comprises speech acts whose meaning can be described in terms of the mental states of an agent. This interaction protocol makes it difficult for agents that have been implemented using different approaches to communicate. This paper reviews the potential for addressing this limitation through using organization-centered multi-agent systems (OCMAS) in which agent interaction is designed around macro-level concepts such as organizations, groups, communities, and roles. Although the use of organizational metaphors in agent-based application is still in its infancy, there are some emerging modeling tools that can be used to advance the existing agent-based applications into open MASs that exhibit the dynamic and flexible characteristics of open, distributed systems. The paper illustrates this potential by using a proof of concept based on decision support requirements for highway maintenance management. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000195.

In a recent special journal issue on the topic, Mantyla et al. started discussing these topics from different angles; the authors focused their contributions on offering a general overview of both topics without deeper detail. Recognizing the importance and impact of the topic, in this article we have executed a followup, more in-depth systematic literature review with additional analyses beyond what was previously provided. These new analyses offer: a grounded-theory of success and failure factors, harvesting over 500+ factors from the literature; 14 manually validated clusters of factors that provide relevant areas for success- and failure-specific measurement and risk-analysis; a quality model composed of previously unmeasured organizational structure quantities which are germane to software product, process, and community quality. We show that the topics of success and failure deserve further study as well as further automated tool support, e.g., monitoring tools and metrics able to track the factors and patterns emerging from this article. This article provides managers with risks as well as a more fine-grained analysis of the parameters that can be appraised to anticipate the risks.

Although TGR boasts one of the highest citations for a scholarly work in management, project management scholars do not cite it. Why has project management scholarship lost one of its founding classics? We investigate why TGR meets the criteria of a classic. We show that TGR's focus on societal outcomes and ideals is an improvement on conventional project management's focus on technical outputs and efficiency. Moreover, TGR contributes process theories-e.g., goal displacement and values depletion for how major projects often fail. We conjecture that project management scholars ignore TGR because it represents uncomfortable knowledge. Project management discipline is in a crisis. We call for a humanist paradigm shift.

J	Koskela, L				Koskela, Lauri			Why is management research irrelevant?	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Organization theory; economics; construction management; project management; management research; quantitative methods; operations management; irrelevance	SCIENCE; REFLECTIONS; TECHNOLOGY; ECONOMICS; FUTURE; DESIGN	At least since 1980, there has been a practically continuous, but somewhat fragmented discussion on the relevance of management research. This discussion has addressed practically all fields of management; here, besides general management, operations management, project management and construction management are examined in more detail. Although many different proposals have been made to rectify the situation, no definitive resolution has been found. In this paper, it is argued that prior analyses have not reached the root causes of the irrelevance problem. By an analysis of the recent history of management research, the following novel findings are reached. First, the root cause of the irrelevance is argued to lie in the 1959 reports on American business education, written by Pierson and Gordon & Howell. Second, while the proposed direction in the 1959 reports was deficient in several ways, the rejection of production as an integral part of organizations and management has been perhaps the most damaging feature of those reports. Third, current research on management suffers from a variety of immediate causes for irrelevance, insufficiently recognized by the scholarly community. It is suggested that reaching the root causes for irrelevance will facilitate finding suitable cures.

Dualities and dilemmas: contending with uncertainty in large-scale safety-critical projects	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Aerospace; nuclear; project management; safety; uncertainty	MANAGEMENT; TENSIONS; MODEL; RISK	Uncertainty is a fact of project life. Most decisions that are made on a safety-critical project involve uncertainty, the consequences of which may be highly significant to the safe and timely delivery of the project. Based on interviews with project management practitioners on nine large-scale civil nuclear and aerospace projects, we explore how uncertainty emerges, and how project management practitioners identify, analyse and act on it. We make three important contributions. First, we present three approaches - structural, behavioural and relational - that individuals and organizations can adopt when contending with project uncertainty. Secondly, we characterize nine dualities at play in the management of project uncertainty and thirdly, we identify key differences between how civil nuclear and aerospace project managers confront project uncertainty, which have important implications for how projects might be organized in both these industry sectors. Drawing attention to the structural, behavioural and relational approaches to project uncertainty and the tensions that manifest themselves in each approach should enable the project management community to make progress in environments of high uncertainty where situations are often complex, rapidly changing and confusing, and yet where, for reasons of safety, failure is not an option.

In principle, an approach based on the characteristics of individual commercial premises and buildings is attractive, but it poses a number of challenges, the most immediate of which is deciding precisely what to model. For a range of reasons connected with their self-contained nature, individual non-domestic buildings would ideally be selected. However, the main information sources available - digital mapping and business taxation data - are not based on buildings' and do not use the concept, thus making an automated approach problematic. At the same time, manual identification of the distinct buildings in a city is not a practical proposition because of the numbers involved. The digital mapping and business taxation data are brought together in the Local Land and Property Gazetteer (LLPG). An analysis of the relationships between the relevant elements, namely building polygons and premises attracting business taxation, allowed a unit to be defined that matches the definition of a building' in most circumstances and can be applied without the need for human intervention. This novel approach provides a firmer basis for modelling non-domestic building energy at the urban scale.

Due to the rapid development of BIM research, various stakeholders require a state-of-the-art review of the BIM research and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to provide an objective and accurate summary of BIM knowledge using 1874 published BIM-related papers. The results show that 60 key research areas, such as information systems, 3D modeling, design and sustainability and 10 key research clusters, such as architecture design studio, building information and lean construction, are extremely important for the development of BIM knowledge. The results are useful for the identification of research clusters and topics in the BIM community. More importantly, these results can help highlight how BIM-related research evolves over time, thus greatly contributing to understanding the underlying structure of BIM. This study offers useful and new insights to summarize the status quo of BIM knowledge and can be used as a dynamic platform to integrate future BIM developments.

However, the effect of sustainable infrastructure assessments on the success of construction projects has not been examined in previous studies, based on the authors' knowledge; therefore, this study examined this effect. A questionnaire was used to collect data on the importance of a range of criteria used to evaluate sustainable infrastructure assessments and construction project success. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate a structural model used to determine the effect of sustainable infrastructure assessments. The final SEM model shows the following: (1)sustainable infrastructure assessments can be described by eight criteria (i.e.,environmental impacts on surrounding areas, transport, community, energy and water, location, project management, waste management, and materials and resources); (2)construction project success can be described by six criteria (i.e.,environment, quality, safety, time, cost, and client satisfaction); and (3)sustainable infrastructure assessments directly affect construction project success (regression weight of 0.83). The results of this research inform how sustainable infrastructure assessments affect construction project success and could be used as a guideline for developing sustainable infrastructure projects.

The ability of the intelligence community, mission commanders, and front-line soldiers to understand their deployed physical environment in advance is critical in the planning and rehearsal phases of any military operation. In order to achieve various simulation capabilities such as destruction operations, route planning, and explosive-standoff distances computation among others, reconstructed 3D data needs to be properly attributed. In this paper, we introduce a model ensembling framework for segmenting a 3D photogrammetry point cloud into top-level terrain elements (i.e., ground, human-made objects, and vegetation). Preprocessing and postprocessing methods were designed to overcome the data segmentation challenges posed by photogrammetric data-quality issues. A large UAV-based photogrammetric database was created for validation purposes. The designed model ensembling framework was compared with existing point cloud segmentation algorithms, and it outperformed other algorithms and achieved the best F1-score. Because the ultimate goal of segmenting a photogrammetric-generated point cloud is to create realistic virtual environments for simulation. Qualitative results for creating virtual environments using the segmented data are also discussed in this paper.

Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels are considered to be the most economical and viable options to meet this demand. Yet, FPSO projects are prone to significant cost and schedule growth. On average, FPSOs have been reported to experience a 20% cost growth and are delayed by six months. Overruns and delays represent uncertainties for owners, contractors and financial institutions. In-depth interviews with twenty-three practitioners about their experiences with FPSO projects revealed that rework arising from design and construction errors were major contributors to cost and schedule growth. Key latent conditions contributing to rework are classified according to people, organization and project. Using retrospective sensemaking an examination of the determinant histories in a new build and conversion FPSO that experienced rework was undertaken. The sharing of experience(s) is deemed pivotal for reducing rework in future projects, particularly through the use of communities of practice that are able to stimulate situated learning to take place. A reduction in rework will not only reduce cost and schedule growth, improve operational performance and augment safety.	[Love, Peter E.

This paper generates insights into the acquisition management and production planning of a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system. The acquisition quantity of the used products is stochastic and sensitive to the acquisition price, and the uncertain quality of the acquired used products leads to a random yield in the remanufacturing process. With such a market-driven acquisition channel and a random remanufacturing yield, it is shown how the acquisition pricing, remanufacturing, and manufacturing decisions can be coordinated in order to maximize the total expected profit. Sequential and parallel remanufacturing/ manufacturing processes are considered in different cases. In each case, we use a stochastic dynamic programming to formulate and analyze the model, showing that the optimal policy is characterized by several critical values and functions. We derive conditions under which the firm should open/close the acquisition channel and utilize/discard the remanufacturing option. By comparing the two cases, we show that expediting the remanufacturing process will help the firm to better utilize the acquisition channel and the remanufacturing option, as the optimal acquisition price and remanufacturing quantity are both higher in the case of sequential processes.

Hamid; Bajegani, Esmaeil Akhondi			Stochastic Programming Model for Bidding Price Decision in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding price; Construction projects; Risk of loss; Average expected profit	STRATEGY; MARKUP; PAY	In competitive bidding, the success and/or failure of the contractors strongly depends on their submitted bid price. Hence, the bidding price decision is a strategic subject for contractors of construction projects. This paper develops a stochastic programming model for determining the optimum bidding price in construction projects. Some model parameters, such as the number of competitors and the project's cost, are estimated by analyzing historical data. Then, a mathematical model for the bidding price decision that maximizes the expected profit is proposed. To reduce the risk of suffering from a large loss, a maximum acceptable risk constraint is employed. To evaluate the model's performance, some numerical problems are examined. Moreover, sensitivity analysis of the key parameters and a robustness evaluation of the model against uncertain parameters are conducted. To evaluate the model's effectiveness in real-world situations, a case study is analyzed using the proposed approach. The numerical results indicate that the proposed approach reduces the cost estimation errors and increases the average expected profit, which validates the applicability of the model. This research contributes to the community of contractors of construction projects by providing a new approach for determining the optimum bidding price that is in greater accordance with real-world constraints.

Design/methodology/approach A new theoretical framework of stakeholder influence strategies was proposed and applied. The research design is a multi-case study, comprising four cases in the construction industry in Vietnam. Findings Seven specific strategies were found, including inputs withholding, inputs compromising, communication, direct action, coalition building, conflict escalation and credibility building. When possessing project inputs, stakeholders can affect a project directly via a withholding or compromising strategy. Communication is available to those who have basic communicating skills; however, direct action is only employed by groups that include a large number of members. Objectors must have common interests or goals with their potential allies for using coalition building. Conflict escalation is restricted to communities having distinctive characteristics which can be used to create new problems sensibly, while credibility building is used by parties possessing adequate resources and expertise. Originality/value This study is one of the first investigations on stakeholder-attributes-related requirements for utilising influence strategies in projects.

In this conceptual article, we sought to explore the dimensions of traditional authority that influence stakeholder management at the pre-construction stage, using the case of Ghana. Twenty-nine different issues related to traditional authority were identified through a systematic literature review. Then, through a narrative focus group discussion, the issues were validated, revised and condensed into 21 items. Through thematic analysis, the issues were clustered into four dimensions of traditional authority influences: power and role of traditional leadership; expectations of traditional leadership; project impacts on community resources; and impact of religious and cultural values. Through a further abstraction of the results, we identified six patterns of influence that emerge from the interaction between traditional authorities and other stakeholders, viz.: compromise; uncertainty; instability; power and role suppression; acculturation; and polarization. The findings provide a starting point for theorizing the influence of traditional authority on pre-construction stakeholder management. The findings also provide project managers with information for the development of practical strategies for managing the influence of traditional authorities to ensure an effective stakeholder management process at the pre-construction stage of infrastructure projects.

As a result, people often end up with more options than they can process to choose from and therefore may opt for choices which do not fit best to their preferences. To address these issues, recommender systems (RSs) were proposed and have gained a lot of interest from the research community and industry. However, privacy is a big concern in these systems. While decentralized recommenders can protect privacy, they lack the needed efficiency to be widely adopted. In this article, we use blockchain as the backbone of a decentralized RS, managing to equip it with a broad set of features while simultaneously, preserving user's privacy. We introduce a new architecture, based on decentralized locality sensitive hashing classification as well as a set of recommendation methods, according to how data are managed by users. Extensive experimental results illustrate the performance and efficacy of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a discussion about its benefits and opportunities provides ground for further research.

Social licenses are granted by stakeholder networks, which include community groups, among others. Project managers would benefit from approaches that can predict which groups or coalitions within the stakeholder network have sufficient influence and motivation to delay progress and that can suggest interventions to reduce that risk. We present an integration of theories and methods that has been successfully used in the extractive industries to maintain a high level of social license. We define the social license concept, noting its embeddedness in stakeholder theory and the resource dependence view of the firm, and how it has been elaborated enough to become measurable. Then we integrate it with social network analysis and methods for quantifying stakeholders' issues and concerns. Key benefits are the ability to identify minority clusters that have sufficient influence to dominate the majority and the specification of network interventions to raise the level of social license. We use an example of a proposed housing project to illustrate how the proposed approach produces practical stakeholder relations strategies for gaining and maintaining a social license to build.

The conflict occurrence process over construction projects was structured as four stages based on the paradigm model approach of grounded theory. Two types of Korean cases (the first one is linear facilities and the second one is clustered facilities) were analyzed using the proposed framework. The study examined that each infrastructure type has its own pattern during conflict occurrences, with the impact of conflict factors also varying significantly. The results showed that the procedure of deciding facility's location and its route is commonly extracted as a major factor. For linear infrastructure facilities, the validity of the public engagement process and technical alternatives to mitigate conflict were distilled as major factors. In contrast, environmental and ecological concerns in the early site selection phase, because the facility required a large amount of territory, was identified as more important for clustered infrastructure facilities. This framework is expected to be useful for conflict analysis from the early stage of public projects, according to the inherent characteristics of the given infrastructure project.

Contemporary policy documents concerning emergency shelter reveal that the scope of shelter-associated risk is much wider than simply exposure to the elements and includes a significant social dimension. However, disparity exists between implicitly accepted risks described in aid agency literature and field practice. Experience in recent disaster assistance programmes in Kosovo and Afghanistan illustrates how ill equipped the aid community is to deal with cold weather affecting transitional settlements. A review of the environmental risks associated with living in tented accommodation in cold climates reveals the difficulty of providing thermal comfort and fire safety in both heated and unheated tents. In addition, social surveys and field trials with displaced populations in Afghanistan illustrate that shelter is used, perceived and valued differently according to the ethnic and cultural background of occupants, and that these are also factors that impact on the risks they bear. Several design recommendations and guides for the use of cold climate relief tents are made, whilst acknowledging that the provision of alternative, longer-term shelter provision during the phase of emergency response is nearly always preferable.

They provide a good medium to the development of macroscopic vegetation which causes irreversible and physical damage to stone structure. Infrared thermography (IRT) measurements have been performed in laboratory scale to investigate the applicability of this non-destructive technique to an early detection of microbial biofilms on stone surface. Detecting biofilms before stone soiling is important in Cultural Heritage conservation to avoid both irreversible damage and building restoration costs. Active IRT was set up on a French limestone used in many French buildings and monuments. Samples were collected after six-months of exposure in an outdoor biofouling test during which they were colonized by microbial biofilms. They have been compared with controls with no biofilm. Experimental set-up has been carried out in dry and damp conditions to simulate different climatic conditions. First results displayed a different thermal response: stone surfaces with biofilm reached higher temperatures and they cooled down faster than row stones. Biofilm entailed a change of the stone thermal behaviour similar to a monolayer. IRT detected biofilm with a better efficiency in dry than in damp condition.

This created a natural experiment in thermal retrofit programme design. This paper uses qualitative interviews with programme organizers measured against third-party programme performance data to create a model of 14 programme steps that were common to all BBNP grantees. This model uses the experiences of programme organizers to define best-practice principles associated with each programme step. Five themes emerge from the programme steps:(1) programme design: local market features and suitable programme structures; (2) marketing and outreach: the processes of creating awareness versus personal engagement- how community-based social marketing is a key strategy in driving demand; (3) workforce engagement: the skills gaps across the supply chain; (4) financial incentives: the merits of grants versus loans- how to use them in combination; and (5) data and evaluation: best-practice techniques for both programme evaluation and enabling iterative programme adjustments. These principles create a template for an optimal' programme model for retrofit programmes with stated objectives similar to the US BBNP. The potential and limitations in extrapolating this model to UK retrofit markets are considered.

J	Gilbert, P				Gilbert, Pierre			Social stakes of urban renewal: recent French housing policy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; demolition; housing policy; neighbourhood; social capital; social mix; urban renewal; France	FORCED RESIDENTIAL RELOCATION	The social implications of urban restructuring, especially the spatial approach of urban renewal, are important indicators for the building stock, as this impacts on demolition and reconstruction. The social stakes of urban renewal reside in both its political intent and its social effects. Ongoing socio-economic difficulties have led to a shift in French public policy on disadvantaged neighbourhoods, moving from the promotion of local social and economic development to an increasing fear of concentrating local communities or 'ghettos'. Social mix has become a policy objective for these neighbourhoods, and urban renewal as the means to achieve it. Although the effects of this policy are currently hard to assess, three social stakes can nonetheless be identified, partly based on the results of ongoing research at Les Minguettes, a suburb of Lyon, France. First, contemporary urban renewal tends to erode the stock of affordable housing, without bringing noticeable improvements in housing conditions. Second, this policy weakens the inhabitants' social capital, a resource strongly locally anchored in working-class milieus. Finally, social mix tends to transform local forms of coexistence in unpredictable ways, with no guarantee of the anticipated positive cooperation between locals and newcomers.

To address this gap in knowledge, data were collected using surveys, reflective diaries, workbooks and a progress web, from 103 school pupils participating in one of the UK's largest schools-based construction industry corporate volunteering programmes. The results show that corporate volunteering programmes which partner construction industry professionals with school students in a work-related activity-based learning environment can have a significant impact on student construction industry knowledge, perceptions, career choices, aspirations and employability skills. This is particularly the case for female students and for students whose learning styles do not align with traditional classroom-based pedagogies. It is recommended that more research is needed to classify and understand the different types of volunteering programmes that operate in the construction sector across multiple cohort groups, the factors that determine success and failure and the overall impact on the students and the wider community in the long term as well as the short term. There is also a need for more research into what it means for the companies involved and for the staff who volunteer.

To investigate the causes of rework in construction projects, a total of 39 causes were first identified through a comprehensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with 13 experienced construction professionals in China. A questionnaire survey was further conducted to prioritize these causes, in which unclear project process management, poor quality of construction technology, and the use of poor construction materials rank the highest. Finally, a factor analysis revealed 11 major underlying dimensions of these causes, relating to design management, communication management, field management, project scope management, project process management, active rework, project plan changes, subcontractor management, contract management, owner capability, and the external environment. The contribution of this work lies in its examination of the underlying causes of rework perceived by construction professionals in the world's largest developing country, which is characterized by its unique economic and social systems. In particular, newly identifed causes of contract management, active rework, and scope management help expand existing knowledge of the underlying causes of rework for the global construction community.

Damage to underground services can lead to widespread disruption and significant upstream (service provider) and downstream (end user) losses, often resulting in whole communities being isolated from emergency services and losing essential utilities such as water, gas, and electricity. The ability to physically determine on site the location of underground utilities is critical to reduce risk and consequence during excavation. For these reasons, the location and efficient maintenance of buried assets are a high priority, especially for utility companies. This paper presents the development of a model for the three-dimensional (3D) location of buried assets based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and findings from laboratory and field experiments. Passive, low frequency RFID devices were used during the research. Two approaches of this model, "Method A" and "Method B," along with major experimental findings are discussed within the paper. In order to validate the applicability of each method, "real-world" field experiments were performed. The findings from this research demonstrated that applying RFID technology to locate buried assets has a great potential for facilitating the accurate 3D data of underground infrastructure.

J	Vale, LJ				Vale, Lawrence J.			The politics of resilient cities: whose resilience and whose city?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						disaster recovery; equity; resilience; resilient cities; social justice; urban planning and design; urban politics		It is vital to acknowledge the socio-political complexity of the deployment of the term resilience' and to develop a more unified set of expectations for the professions and disciplines that use it. Applied to cities, resilience is particularly problematic, yet also retains promise. Like resilience, the term city' is also subject to multiple contending definitions, depending on the scale and on whether the focus is on physical spaces or social communities. Due to cities and city-regions being organized in ways that both produce and reflect underlying socio-economic disparities, some parts are much more resilient than others and therefore vulnerability is often linked to both topography and income. Uneven resilience threatens the ability of cities as a whole to function economically, socially and politically. Resilience can only remain useful as a concept and as progressive practice if it is explicitly associated with the need to improve the life prospects of disadvantaged groups. This dimension is often lost in definitions of resilience drawn from engineering and ecology, but remains central to conceptualizations linked to social psychology. To improve the prospects of cities proactively (and reactively), there is a need to unify the insights from the multiple professions and disciplines that use resilience'.

A Marketing Perspective to Optimize Knowledge Reuse Efficiency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Codification; knowledge management (KM); knowledge reuse; personalization	MANAGEMENT; REPOSITORIES; COMMUNITIES; DIMENSIONS; RELEVANCE; ADOPTION; STRATEGY; SYSTEMS	Organizations continue to struggle with low returns on knowledge management (KM) investments. This paper's goal is to prescribe a KM strategy that maximizes organizational knowledge reuse efficiency (KRE). Knowledge reuse is defined as the totality of all knowledge transfers, from all producers to all consumers in the same organization, over all locations. Organizational inefficiencies result from individual knowledge producers and consumers having different priorities and agendas during the knowledge exchange. Furthermore, these producers' and consumers' priorities overlap with, but are not congruent with, the organization's priorities to maximize knowledge reuse efficiency. By combining a marketing perspective with a marketing consumer stages process model of knowledge reuse, we develop a contingency model which prescribes the strategy which maximizes KRE. The organizational characteristics on which the model is contingent include organization size, the number of knowledge producers, consumers, these producer and consumer costs and utilities during the knowledge transfer, and the organization's KM infrastructure costs. The prescribed approach specifies the degree to which a personalization and codification strategy should be combined to optimize KRE, contrary to some suggestions in the literature. A simulation supports that the model's prescribed strategy is not overly sensitive to its contingency variables.

PD is characterized by the development of large, multidisciplinary, and networked systems that cannot be embraced by a single group or organization. Appropriate PD management principles can circumvent many of the difficulties that arise during the PD process. In this article, the author presents an integrative literature review that includes theories, models, and tools that can be used to manage complex PD. The review is structured around three PD analysis domains: product, people, and process. The review does not identify all the publications in any one PD domain, but instead addresses critical issues that exist within each domain and at the intersection of these domains. By reviewing these representative papers and creating a critical discussion around them, the intent is to provide an overview of the available theories, models, and tools for PD practitioners, while simultaneously identifying opportunities for future research.

BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						affordable housing; communities; eco-neighbourhood; gentrification; public policy; social diversity; social housing; urban politics; France		This paper examines how policies and practices for affordable housing in Paris, especially green' housing for the poor, are being subverted to retain or attract the middle class: the greentrification' of lower-class neighbourhoods. From the 1960s onward, many middle- and working-class households have left Paris due to de-industrialization and the city's high housing costs. To bring these middle classes back, the municipality initiated a policy calling for increased social diversity, using social housing as its main policy tool. In France the provision of public housing is legally mandated, and compared with international standards, the income ceilings for gaining access to it are high. Thus, municipalities may pursue urban renovation and construct social housing for the middle class to replace substandard buildings occupied by low-income populations. The Paris municipality has established green' residential eco-districts known as eco-quartiers'. In the national eco-district programme, the neighbourhoods must meet environmental performance criteria, show potential for economic development, and provide social and functional diversity. Thus, housing location and price must fit the needs of the existing residents. However, most green' subsidized housing in Paris is for the middle class. Social diversity has become a means of redistribution: more middle class and fewer poor people.

Recent studies link the success of energy-feedback methods to the level of occupant engagement with people in their social circles and the resulting peer pressure to conform to certain social norms. Despite promising results, the literature remains limited in scope to individual rather than groups of buildings. This has limited the design of feedback initiatives leveraging social connections that exist, or that can be induced, within and between buildings. The current paper addresses the identified gap by proposing a multilayer agent-based model that serves as a test bed to simulate and optimize feedback methods applied on any building stock (e.g.,community and city). Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses show that connecting occupants of different buildings, while increasing their engagement with the feedback mechanism, can lead to energy reductions exceeding 10%. The findings confirm the role of social networks in energy-conservation diffusion, setting the stage for large-scale and socially engaging energy-conservation initiatives.

J	Rees, WE				Rees, William E.			The ecological crisis and self-delusion: implications for the building sector	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article	Conference on What if the Scientists have It Right	SEP 21-25, 2008	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Sustainable Bldg		behaviour; built environment; climate change; cognitive behaviour; cultural narratives; ecological overshoot; sustainable development		The world is on the brink of an unprecedented growth-related ecological crisis that could well undermine prospects for global civilization. Nevertheless, the global community seems 'in flight from thinking' about the implications of the threat and unwilling to contemplate the policy remedies necessary to change the course of history. Biological and cultural factors combine to inhibit clear understanding and effective corrective action. Mainstream 'solutions' - hybrid cars, green buildings, smart growth, the new urbanism - are thus rooted in denial and delusional. These approaches do not address the fundamental problem of 'overshoot', but rather attempt to maintain the growth-bound status quo through efficiency gains and related technological 'fixes'. This might actually worsen the situation. Achieving sustainability requires that such marginal reform give way to a complete rethink of society's relationship with nature. Developed societies need a new, more adaptive cultural mythology. The building sector arguably has greater material leverage in reducing the human ecological footprint than any other major industrial sector. Acceptance of the guidelines developed in this paper would revolutionize the industry and reorient it geographically. The question is: does the industry have the intellectual courage and practical momentum to assume a lead role in the sustainability campaign?

What are the challenges and potential for incorporating the concept of social sustainability into the assessment of building projects? Theoretical approaches to social sustainability are examined for the ways it is applied in practice by building industry stakeholders. A fundamental question is whether and how social sustainability can be measured, assessed and certified in the construction or renewal of housing and neighbourhoods. In addition to physical and functional indicators, it is suggested that certification systems (e.g. the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nachhaltiges Bauen - DGNB) should also reward social initiatives. A framework was developed involving 12 indicators grouped three overarching themes: social cohesion; participatory processes; and accessibility to living opportunities. A collaborative case study project involving two Danish social housing neighbourhoods examines how social sustainability indicators could be integrated into the application of certification systems such as the DGNB and whether the certification system can be improved by integrating social and organizational aspects with the existing criteria for physical and functional layout. It is found that certifications must take the housing complex or neighbourhood's relationship with the surrounding city into account, as well as its development over time and flexibility towards future needs.

While literature reviews show support for the psychological and health benefits of biophilic design, they note that the evidence base is heavily focused on the restorative efficacy of various natural elements (e.g. light, water and wood) and experiences (direct, indirect, space and place). There has been little consideration of Kellert and Calabrese's [(2015). The practice of biophilic design. Terrapin Bright LLC.] key principles of biophilic design and the holistic approach to design that has nature connection at its heart. This perspective article discusses the biophilic design principles in light of research on the psychological construct of nature connectedness. The research offers empirical support for the importance of key biophilic design principles - the need for repeated and sustained engagement with nature, for encouraging an emotional attachment to settings and places and for promoting interactions between people and nature that foster a greater sense of relationship and responsibility for human and natural communities. An evidence-based framework for the application of biophilic principles and experiences into the design process is proposed. Recommendations for optimizing the application and evaluation of biophilic design principles and practices are made, in order to support the well-being of humans and nature.

Development of metrics and an external benchmarking program for healthcare facilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Healthcare facilities; owner; external benchmarking; metrics; planning	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; SECTOR	This paper describes the development of a benchmarking program for healthcare projects. Healthcare construction projects tend to be unique due to varied healthcare facilities and offered services, thus requiring a platform to study distinct project management approaches for the healthcare industry. The idea of continuous improvement through competitive benchmarking is already well established. However, highly targeted comparisons are not possible without industry-specific metrics. The ability to measure project performance allows for credible industry norms and continuous improvement. As a first step, a comprehensive study focused on identifying specific metrics to measure healthcare capital project-performance in key areas such as cost, schedule, change, and best practice implementation was concluded with input from a team comprised of healthcare owners, contractors, and architects. In addition, space/dimensional and program-specific metrics were also identified for this external benchmarking program. This paper presents the development of a framework for different healthcare capital facility-types using absolute and relative metrics for the healthcare industry. The findings include resources for the healthcare community in the form of healthcare facility metrics and project database that enables the process of quantifying the effectiveness and efficiency of processes specific to the healthcare industry of completed and ongoing projects.

It will no longer be sufficient to understand buildings as the demand side of an energy system - the supply side will also need consideration. Currently, electricity mainly accounts for the positive side of zero-energy building energy balances. In future, energy management strategies could also include local heat trading schemes to capitalize on local energy balancing. The topic of load matching between a building's electrical and thermal needs and its distributed generation is examined. Some of the most promising solutions to manage energy supply intermittency are only available on a larger scale than individual buildings. The intermediate scale of the urban neighbourhood has the potential to address energy supply and demand structures and create high-performance buildings and settlements. The commitment to the introduction of nearly zero-carbon buildings thus introduces a need to evaluate alternative system boundaries for describing the energy balance of buildings and their impact on local energy networks at a suitable scale. The implications for the research agenda are discussed.

Recently, Talent Management (TM) was presented as an innovative approach for fostering creativity, balancing work-life commitments, enhancing motivation and reducing demotivation. However, lack of utilizing talented human capitals, which was counted as waste of resources, necessitated the integration of lean thinking principles with TM. This research aims to develop a Lean Talent Management Framework to maximize creativity in ADFs. To achieve this aim, a research strategy consisted of literature review and survey questionnaire is designed to gather data sufficiently rich to cover the research topics and investigate the perception and application of ADFs towards integrating TM in ADFs as an approach for enhancing creativity. Although only Egyptian ADFs were surveyed, other countries that share similar characteristics will benefit from the application of the framework towards maximizing creativity in ADFs.

J	Li, ZS; Li, N; Cimellaro, GP; Fang, DP				Li, Zaishang; Li, Nan; Cimellaro, Gian Paolo; Fang, Dongping			System Dynamics Modeling-Based Approach for Assessing Seismic Resilience of Hospitals: Methodology and a Case in China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							FUNCTIONALITY; COMMUNITIES; PERFORMANCE; EARTHQUAKE; FACILITIES; FRAMEWORK; BLACKOUT; LESSONS	Hospitals play a crucial role in providing badly needed medical care after earthquakes. Meanwhile, hospitals are likely to find themselves subject to earthquake impacts and may fail to function, which highlights that there is significant need for enhancing their resilience to earthquakes. Nevertheless, effective assessment of hospital seismic resilience is lacking, which makes devising and benchmarking appropriate resilience enhancement measures challenging. This study proposes a new functionality-based assessment approach of hospital resilience to earthquakes. A new indicator of hospital functionality is proposed, and a system dynamics model of hospital functionality after earthquakes (SD-HFE) is developed to simulate hospital functionality. The resilience assessment can then be conducted based on the functionality curve, which considers both the loss and the recovery of hospital functionality. Based on a case study in China, the efficacy of the proposed approach is tested. The proposed approach advances understanding of how hospital functionality evolves after an earthquake, and allows quantitative assessment of hospital seismic resilience. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the development of informed policies and effective engineering measures to enhance the seismic resilience of hospitals.

There remain many unanswered questions around the interaction of people with their environment and the technical systems that service them and, as a result, multidisciplinary research is a principal component of research funding internationally. However, relatively little published work considers the operational issues in undertaking epistemologically diverse, academic research projects. This paper makes a contribution by quantifying the operational effort involved in data collection on a large multidisciplinary project and connecting the operational issues encountered to knowledge production. It is found that the cost of the data gathering is 46,000 pound/home, and participants can give upwards of 217 hours of their time per house engaging with data-gathering activities. The rate of knowledge production is found to be approximately three publication/full-time equivalents (FTE) over the lifetime of the project and the risk to generating interdisciplinary insights is shown to be dependent on largely unforeseeable operational issues that compound the characteristic differences in the collection of the data utilized by social and technical research communities.

These new roles and decision-making contexts (increased regulative complexity, stricter control and outsourcing of wider ranges of municipal services) are examined for how they shape procurement practices for architectural and engineering services in Swedish municipalities. Based on a critical theoretical review of policy implementation and inter-professional collaboration, the purchasing practices of five Swedish municipalities are examined and compared through case study interviews to understand the relationships and practices that occur between technical and procurement staff. Resource constraints and stricter control are found to lead to a strong preference, especially among technical staff, for simplified procurement models with a high emphasis on lowest price, whilst procurement staff favour more advanced methods for quality assessment. However, differences in knowledge and professional culture between the technical staff and procurement staff have created barriers to communication and competence integration. To develop a procurement practice that rewards supplier competence, clearer guidelines and changes to procurement roles within the client organization are needed, as well as increased resources. Procurement policies need to be more closely tied to their implementation.

This field of research covers different topics across multiple disciplines and is disseminated in many journals. This has led to numerous review studies with a single discipline focus that apply mostly subjective or descriptive analyses. With the purpose of providing an integrated overview of all the disciplines that involve PPP and uncovering connections between these, this research provides an extensive PPP literature meta-review that uses objective bibliometric measures on 1970 articles from 773 journals. The methodology involves ranking journals, identifying topical trends over 1989-2018, and clustering the literature to create a PPP knowledge map with associated research domains. The findings reaffirm that PPP is not only a multi-disciplinary research area but also a self-contained meta-discipline that integrates some allied disciplines with their foundational theories. The PPP meta-discipline is largely dominated by Construction Management and Economics (CME), Public Administration and Management, and Transportation Research disciplines, and integrates emerging topics such as sustainability, governance and stakeholders management. This study contributes to the CME scholarly community as it offers the first comprehensive meta-analysis of PPP literature and helps understanding PPP under the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective.

Economic flow analysis of construction projects	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						built environment; construction costs; development; economic flows; labour; local development; local economy; localization; material flow	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; SANKEY DIAGRAM; COSTS; SUSTAINABILITY; OPPORTUNITIES; ENERGY; IMPACT; GREEN	A new approach is introduced for analysing the economic flows in a construction project that will complement the existing methods. The main focus of the new method is to trace the flow of costs in the project and identify their spatial characteristics as well as who are the final recipients. This type of analysis highlights the flow of costs of the specific project in the local economy. It can be used for decision-making purposes from the project-commissioning party. Costs were divided into six categories, namely: labour, materials, energy, office overheads, taxes and personnel, and into two levels: local and national. Three case studies of stone and reinforced concrete structures were selected and analysed to test the application of this method. The case studies showed that this method and the representation by a Sankey diagram can provide useful insights regarding both the spatialized distribution of the cost of a project and the economic flows going to direct labourversus overhead and taxes. For future projects, local authorities or developers can select the most economically suitable strategy maximizing the income of the local community.

The key global and regional footprints identifying the trends towards the sustainable water-energy nexus in future ecocities are defined. Three scales are examined: domestic (individual building), cluster (ecoblock) and regional levels. An integrated approach to urban design and the use of water resources is presented. The future hybrid (partially closed) system would reclaim clean water, nutrients and other resources, and produce additional energy. Methane- and hydrogen-based energy recovery and conversion to electricity in an integrated resource recovery processes are proposed. The triple bottom line analysis and willingness to pay can be used to determine quantitative social values of non-market commodities (i.e. ecological enhancement, sustainability, improvements in water quality and aesthetic assets, and the reduction of GHGs emissions). Urban retrofit solutions are outlined for reducing water use, creating net zero GHGs, eliminating pollution, and generating financial revenue through the recycling and recovery of resources.

Does megaproject social responsibility improve the sustainability of the construction industry?	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Management; Project management; Strategic management	ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE; PROJECTS; GOVERNANCE; COMMUNITIES; ENVIRONMENT; INTEGRATION; CORRUPTION	Purpose Since megaproject social responsibility (MSR) has received increasing attention in megaproject management and plays critical roles in megaproject practices, the purpose of this paper is to explore how MSR facilitates an improved sustainability of the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach By integrating multiple theoretical perspectives of transaction cost theory, institutionalism and attention- and resource-based views, and by using survey data of Chinese megaprojects and construction enterprises, this paper offers a theoretical elaboration of and an empirical investigation into the impacts that MSR's four dimensions exert on industrial improvement in economic sustainability and social responsibility. Findings The study's empirical results indicate that MSR has positive impacts on improving the sustainability of the construction industry, and that such positive impacts are weakened by the interactions of primary stakeholders in the megaprojects but are strengthened by the interactions of secondary stakeholders. Originality/value By analyzing the industrial outcomes of MSR, this paper extends studies on the topic beyond the current literature's focus on the antecedents of MSR, and it enriches the research on MSR stakeholders by elaborating on the contingent roles of the various stakeholders in megaproject management.

Although BIM is technically mature, its legal and contractual systems are yet to be standardized. Motivated by this need, the current study has developed a framework for legal and contractual risks within BIM. In this study, 14 significant risks were identified from 10 published taxonomies, and five standard and three custom BIM contracts were reviewed to assess their coverage and check their redressal strategies. On the basis of the triangulation of information gathered from published contracts, expert opinion, and custom manuscripts, mitigation strategies for the legal risks were proposed and formalized into a contractual framework designed for a design-bid-build delivery system. This study contributes to the body of knowledge and practice by helping the AECO community understand the current level of legal and contractual maturity of BIM, and by stimulating the technological and legal fraternities to sufficiently deliberate the contractual uncertainties in order to facilitate the uptake of BIM in the AECO industry.

The model provides the optimal infrastructure development and land-use allocation for biofuel production in a region considering socio-economic and water quality and quantity effects. The optimal development plan quantifies economic and hydrologic outputs and specifies biofuel refinery locations and capacities, refinery operations, land allocation between biofuel and food crops, optimal shipments of products and feedstock, and transportation infrastructure. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and is solved by an algorithm developed specifically to cope with the large size of the optimization problem. In addition to the development of the SoS-Biofuel model, this paper demonstrates the functionality of the model and its ability to analyze the effects of interdependency among subsystems by applying it to a watershed in Illinois. The SoS-Biofuel model is used to investigate the effects of different biofuel polices on infrastructure needs and related environmental consequences, highlighting the interdependencies inherent in the optimal development of the entire system.

Societal Impacts of a Complete Street Project in a Mixed Urban Corridor: Case Study in Pittsburgh	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								Complete streets facilitate multimodal travel by improving both transportation access and safety by emphasizing the user, not the automobile. This case study evaluates the impacts of a complete street retrofit on a mixed urban corridor in Pittsburgh. Forbes Avenue, originally a 4-lane urban arterial (two lanes in each direction, with no dedicated bike lanes), was reduced to three lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane) and two bike lanes. A quantitative before-and-after analysis was conducted using multiple data sources. Results indicate that traffic volumes decreased by 11%-31%, bicycle counts increased by 160% and 280% during the peak AM and PM hours, respectively, and average PM2.5 concentrations were reduced from 9.1 mu g/m(3) to 7.6 mu g/m(3) when compared to preretrofit conditions. During construction (August 2018-July 2019), vehicle and pedestrian safety were not adversely impacted. Additionally, no crashes were reported by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in the five months following project completion. Results from this analysis can help inform the decision-making process for transportation planners exploring complete street projects with similar community and roadway traffic characteristics.

The anticipated and achieved energy performance of an advanced, innovative building that aspired to net-positive energy performance is studied: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) building at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Selected performance failures' that became evident during operation of CIRS are studied for how they were discovered and the efforts required for their resolution: the energy systems and associated controls and monitoring. The key findings show the barriers were neither economic nor technical. Instead, the primary impediments were institutional regimes- arising from the ways that various life-cycle stages were specified, contracted and implemented. The key issues emphasize the importance of having meaningful and effective building energy monitoring capabilities, an understanding of energy system boundaries in design and analysis, crossing the gaps between different stages of a building life cycle, and feedback processes throughout design and operation. The disclosure of failure' and lessons learned is a valuable contribution to subsequent advancement for the building stakeholders and the wider professional and research communities.

Using data from the Las Vegas area, linear regression models were developed to link the occurrence of graffiti (in terms of graffiti size) to highway infrastructure locations and the presence of graffiti countermeasures. Bridges at high-profile freeways are found to experience more graffiti compared with bridges at low-profile freeways. Infrastructure located in commercial areas or low income residential communities is not found to influence the intensity of graffiti occurrence at bridges. Fencing is found to be an effective measure to prevent graffiti occurrence. Soundwalls next to high profile freeways are found to have more graffiti compared with those at low-profile freeways. Graffiti appears in clusters; graffiti locations at soundwalls may not be proportional to the length of the soundwalls. Soundwalls in residential areas tend to have more graffiti than those in commercial areas. The developed models can be used to predict the locations that are more likely to suffer from graffiti problems and the amount of graffiti to occur. Agencies can use the results of this study to develop appropriate countermeasures to combat graffiti problems. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Salvado, F; de Almeida, NM; Azevedo, AVE				Salvado, Filipa; de Almeida, Nuno Marques; Vale E Azevedo, Alvaro			Historical analysis of the economic life-cycle performance of public school buildings	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Life-cycle cost; historical analysis; economic key performance indicators; school buildings	INTEGRATED-SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VALUE RATIOS; FACILITIES; MANAGEMENT; COST; DESIGN; LCC; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Scientific community and practitioners of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector have been developing life-cycle cost (LCC) concept for the past decades. However, information on a building's economic performance throughout its life-cycle is seldom readily available or accurate. This hinders the fulfilment of recommendations of international and regional standards, procurement guidelines and regulations, and for building management (BM) professionals to fully incorporate the LCC concept into their daily practice. This paper seeks to contribute to solving these difficulties by presenting a conceptual framework that enables LCC-informed decisions in BM, together with its empirical application to a portfolio of 158 public school buildings in Portugal (constructed area of 1,437,594 m(2)). It involved the gathering, organization and treatment of historical data of school buildings originally constructed from 1942 onwards. The historical analysis is presented in the form of three types of economic life-cycle key performance indicators (time series, indexes and relative ratios). It originated a database with more than 1.4 million results that offer a profound understanding of historical economic performance of this portfolio. The results can be adapted and used to benchmark or estimate construction, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, energy consumption, water consumption and deconstruction costs of buildings throughout the world.

Older adults often form the most sedentary segment of the population. Much of this behaviour may be practised at home where this group can spend extended periods. Physical activity rates among older adults are particularly low. Even household physical activities can be beneficial for this group, while they can constitute much of an older person's total activity. Despite this context, the home's role in the active and sedentary behaviours of the older population appears critically understudied. Using interview and focus group data collected from 22 older adults (healthy volunteers, stroke survivors and people with dementia), this paper begins to address this issue. Aspects of the home that aid or impede a more active, less sedentary lifestyle are identified with three presenting particular capacity in this respect discussed: steps, space within the home, and the location and form of facilities, fixtures and fittings. The crucial role health status plays in structuring this capacity is identified. Simple design recommendations, devised to support older people to lead more active lives at home, are presented.

This study introduces a framework for assessing and improving the green-building policies concerning the effectiveness with "structural consistency" of policy instruments and the efficiency with "behavioral coherence" of interagency collaborative networks and examined it with China's green-building policies from 2002 to 2019. This framework, using content mining and social network analysis, not merely provides a comprehensive approach for assessing policy performance of green-building initiative, but also contributes to integrating, comparing, and benchmarking the sustainability-transition studies from various industries and countries. The empirical evidence from China brings novel understandings to the policy-makers of emerging markets for the structural deficiencies in information services, international collaboration, and tax incentives, the three-stage roadmap of the green-building initiative, and the importance of policy agenda. This study contributes not only to the green-building literature by offering a systematic and referential framework for assessing policy performance but also to the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) community by guiding the improvement of green-building policies in emerging markets.

Construction Management Challenges and Best Practices for Rural Transit Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction engineering; Construction management; Rural construction projects; Best practices		Rural transit projects are often small in scope but numerous and geographically dispersed. Management of these projects can be challenging because of very limited resources, unique risk factors, and a lack of construction management expertise. Without effective construction management strategies, it is unlikely that rural transit projects will be optimally planned and controlled, possibly resulting in delays, cost overruns, rework, injuries, and poor quality. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive desk scan, survey, and case studies that focused on identifying specific construction management challenges and effective practices that are unique to rural projects. We obtained responses from 33 of the 52 U.S. states' Departments of Transportation (63%) and two Canadian provinces. The survey findings were validated with interviews from representatives of seven rural case study projects. The results indicate that the primary issues facing rural transit projects include documentation issues; staffing; remote location issues; small contractor issues; communication issues; and local and environmental issues. The counter measures identified for these issues in agency interviews and described in this paper provide the first targeted resource for rural construction management practices. The research community benefits from this study with the increased understanding of the inherent difference in construction management practices between large urban and small rural construction projects.

A net-positive development increases or creates economic, social and ecological capital(s) and makes a positive contribution to ecosystem services. Designing how excess resources may be used beyond a site's boundary is a very appealing notion, but difficult to put into practice without the tools and methods to support net-positive development. The effectiveness and potential impact on community design of 'net-positive development' is questioned when its evaluation is limited to a quantitative analysis only. A broader definition of net positive is offered that equally places social dimensions alongside ecological health through 'mining' for synergies and leverage points in the early stages of a design project. An emphasis is placed on the undervalued first step in the design process of 'mining: evaluating the dormant, inherent potential'. This can be done through a process of questioning the conventional parameters of a context's predefined limits. A framework is also provided that can prove beneficial at this phase. It is posited that strong mining can provide full-spectrum change where true positive benefits, on multiple scales and for multiple stakeholder interests, are achieved.

Documentation of historical caravansaries by digital close range photogrammetry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						cultural heritage; digital photogrammetry; 3D visualization; documenting; preservation		Heritage and culture are two important components in life of societies. Monuments and monumental groups are constructions of great value because of they represent the history and memory of the communities where they are placed. Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Conservation of cultural heritage is a major issue for modem societies, both from economical and cultural viewpoints. Caravansaries are one of the cultural heritages. Caravansary means home or shelter for caravans ("caravan" meaning a group or convoy of soldiers, traders or pilgrims engaged in long distance travel). Caravansaries supported the flow of commerce, information and people across a network of trade routes of Asia, North Africa and South-Eastern Europe. There are several documentation techniques available in order to document cultural heritage. These techniques are indispensable tools for the conservation of heritage monuments. These methods and equipment commonly are used for the documentation and surveying of buildings. Digital close range photogrammetry is one of the most important methods in documenting of cultural heritage. In this study, historical Zazadin Caravansary (Khan) on Silk Road was evaluated and documented by digital close range photogrammetry. It has shown that this method is very efficient compared with traditional method in documenting cultural heritage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Yilmaz, H.

Identifying and Controlling Biases in Expert-Opinion Research: Guidelines for Variations of Delphi, Nominal Group Technique, and Focus Groups	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Expert opinions; Cognitive biases; Qualitative research controls	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COGNITIVE BIASES; EGOCENTRIC BIAS; RISK; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; JUDGMENT; INFORMATION; EXPLANATION; UNCERTAINTY	In construction engineering and management (CEM) research, conducting field studies often is infeasible because of resource constraints, limited access to sites, practicality, confounding factors, and ethical limitations. Thus, researchers rely on the collection and analysis of expert opinions as an alternative method. Delphi, the nominal group technique, and focus groups often are used to solicit opinions through different processes and controls. Controls implemented during data collection and analysis techniques such as anonymity, multiple rounds, and controlled feedback are used to decrease cognitive and social biases that threaten the validity and reliability of the results. Although there are standard processes for these methods, researchers commonly make modifications to balance research constraints with the study objectives, and it often is unclear how specific modifications promote or degrade the validity and reliability of the results. This paper comprehensively reviewed the existing literature on expert opinion-based studies and argues that seemingly innocuous changes to the traditional methodological frameworks can introduce cognitive biases. A novel conceptual decision-making framework is presented to assist the research community with the development of rigorous experimental designs and transparent interpretation of results when various permutations of key controls are included or omitted in the execution of expert-opinion studies.

Modularization Business Case Analysis Model for Industrial Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Modular and off-site construction; Prefabrication; Preassembly; Business case analysis model; Prefabrication; preassembly; modularization and off-site fabrication (PPMOF)	DECISION-MAKING	Modularization is a method of enhancing project value by exporting a portion of the site work to fabrication/assembly shops or yards. However, the construction industry has difficulties in identifying the optimum extent of modularization to maximize its benefits. Research Team 283 of the Construction Industry Institute (CII) developed a business case process to identify the optimum proportion of work hours to be shifted off-site by means of a module scope and identified modularization drivers. With the assistance of the CII's Modularization Community of Practice (MCOP), this study developed a model that provides the practitioner with specific savings in addition to finding the optimum level of work hours to be moved off-site. The researchers also collected existing business case analysis models/tools from various companies and the available literature to identify the most acceptable or best-fitting elements. These elements were integrated into the new model, which was reviewed and validated by CII MCOP. This model will be applicable to various projects where decision making for modularization is difficult because of the absence of an assigned cost/factor/productivity for different parts of a module job. This research will add to the already-existing literature and research on modular decision-making practices.

Although studies have focused on public participation, a method that can measure and improve its effectiveness is lacking. The present study addresses this knowledge gap using a game theory model and social utility equations to measure the effectiveness of public participation in PIMs. Results indicate that the institutional arrangements and social responsibility of PIMs (SR-PIMs) determine stakeholder behaviors, which influence the effectiveness of public participation. The Shanghai Maglev construction project was used as a case study to validate the proposed model and the assumptions of the current study. A conceptual model of governance framework was proposed to enhance the effectiveness of public participation in PIMs. This study contributes to the body of knowledge concerning public participation in PIMs by measuring the effectiveness of such participation and identifying a method to improve it. The policy implication of this study for the PIM global community is that the high effectiveness of public participation entails responsible behaviors among stakeholders. That is, stakeholders should perfect institutional arrangements and cultivate SR-PIMs to reduce game space and expand social effects. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Bektas, BA; Carriquiry, A; Smadi, O				Bektas, Basak Aldemir; Carriquiry, Alicia; Smadi, Omar			Using Classification Trees for Predicting National Bridge Inventory Condition Ratings	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bridge management; Commonly Recognized (CoRe) element condition data; National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings; National Bridge Inventory ( NBI) translator; Classification and regression trees (CARTs); Bridge condition	REGRESSION TREES	In bridge management practice, bridge condition is the fundamental information needed to allow decision makers to make well-informed decisions regarding preservation, rehabilitation, or replacement of a bridge or network of bridges. The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings, collected since the early 1970s, and the Commonly Recognized (CoRe) element condition data, collected since the early 1990s, are two major sources of bridge condition data in the United States. General NBI condition ratings are utilized for performance assessment, performance reporting, resource allocation, and selection of bridge projects by all levels of government. Since the early 1990s, the bridge management community has been interested in an algorithm to predict the categorical NBI condition rating classes from the more quantitative and detailed CoRe element condition data. An algorithm with sufficient predictive accuracy would make only CoRe element inspections necessary and would provide time and resource savings. This paper presents a new methodology for this purpose, using classification and regression trees (CARTs). The CART analyses were conducted with the bridge condition data provided by three state transportation agencies, using data from 2006 to 2010. The statistical results point to a more accurate prediction method than the previous algorithms described in the literature. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In such an environment, building failures can pose a serious threat. Unauthorized building works, which are constructed without prior approval and consent from the government, are responsible for certain building-related accidents. In particular, those unauthorized building works attached to the external envelopes of buildings endanger the lives not only of their occupants, but also of passers-by and they cause damage to properties themselves. An overview of the proliferation of unauthorized building works in Hong Kong is provided followed by the first known empirical study on this topic. After inspecting 323 apartment buildings in two districts, the factors affecting the proliferation of unauthorized building works were analysed. It was found that buildings with amenities incorporated into their designs generally had fewer unauthorized building works on their external envelopes. However, owners associations or property management companies did not have any influence on unauthorized building work numbers for their buildings. These findings have far-reaching implications on the formulation of government policies for building safety. The formation of statutory owners associations or the engagement of property management companies is not effective in containing the unauthorized building work problems in Hong Kong. Community education and stricter law enforcement would be more effective.

It implies that the environmental performance of buildings requires a revised definition so that it considers not only the building itself, but also its contribution beyond its own boundary, i.e. neighbourhoods. In high-density cities, outdoor spaces are culturally considered as the extension of one's living spaces. The environmental performance of neighbourhoods is particularly important to the health and wellbeing of urban inhabitants. This paper aims to define the environmental performance of neighbourhoods in high-density urban context based on the experience acquired in previous studies in Hong Kong over the last 15 years. These studies cover a wide range of environmental issues including urban climate, outdoor thermal comfort, and daylighting design in high-density cities. Subsequent development of the assessment tools for environmental performance of neighbourhoods in Hong Kong is also presented. The framework of stakeholder engagement, as an integral part of the neighbourhood assessment tool, is discussed. This paper highlights the distinctive features of the environmental performance of neighbourhoods in high-density urban context and how it influences the professional practices in Hong Kong.

The evolution of green leases: towards inter-organizational environmental governance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy performance; governance; green leases; landlord; management strategies; non-domestic buildings; offices; retail; tenants	BUILDING COMMUNITIES; ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; INTERMEDIARIES; PROGRAMS	Improving the environmental performance of non-domestic buildings is a complex and wicked' problem due to conflicting interests and incentives. This is particularly challenging in tenanted spaces, where landlord and tenant interactions are regulated through leases that traditionally ignore environmental considerations. Green leasing' is conceptualized as a form of middle-out' inter-organizational environmental governance that operates between organizations, alongside other drivers. This paper investigates how leases are evolving to become greener' in the UK and Australia, providing evidence from five varied sources on: (1) UK office and retail leases, (2) UK retail sector energy management, (3) a major UK retailer case study; (4) office leasing in Sydney, and (5) expert interviews on Australian retail leases. With some exceptions, the evidence reveals an increasing trend towards green leases in prime offices in both countries, but not in retail or sub-prime offices. Generally introduced by landlords, adopted green leases contain a variety of ambitions and levels of enforcement. As an evolving form of private-private environmental governance, green leases form a valuable framework for further tenant-landlord cooperation within properties and across portfolios. This increased cohesion could create new opportunities for polycentric governance, particularly at the interface of cities and the property industry.

Innovative process to characterize buried utilities using Ground Penetrating Radar	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ground Penetrating Radar; data filtering; buried utility protection; non-invasive utility detection; accident prevention; Translation Invariant Wavelet Packet Detection		Today's non-invasive technologies for locating buried utilities can be considered as ancient. However, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has recently received significant attention from the scientific community since it showed great promise in detecting landmines. Yet, the complexities of the underground, especially in inhabited areas, makes "seeing-through-the-earth" to find buried utilities extremely difficult. This paper presents the results of a data processing method, called Translation Invariant Wavelet Packet Detection (TIWPD), applied to filtering GPR data collected on a university campus. It first provides a brief introduction into the working principles of scanning the ground with electromagnetic radar waves that are being refracted, scattered, and reflected by buried objects of all sizes and materials. In its main section, the paper presents the results of experimental deployment of the system during a construction project that involved the extensive excavation trenches to lay chilled water pipes. The significance of this paper lies in its use of real-world GPR data to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the filtering process and its validation with the actual condition found during excavation. The encouraging results of this work should provide the basis for developing a near-real time utility detection system that can be used by laborers in the field. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These benefits can also be expressed through favourable lending and insurance conditions. However, a precondition is the integration of sustainability issues into the processes used by the financial and insurance industries for assessing property assets ( e. g. risk assessment, rating, and valuation). Thus, the valuation and property rating process itself and those involved with it have a key role. Due to new international banking capital adequacy rules ( Basel II), property rating and risk assessment systems are being further developed and implemented by a number of European banks. To some extent, these systems already contain direct or indirect approaches for integrating sustainability issues. Test- ratings reveal banks' existing methodologies, instruments, and criteria for assessing property assets ( as well as their cash flow generation) can be harnessed to express and communicate the advantages and benefits of sustainable buildings. The inclusion of sustainability- related rating criteria sends out an important signal to the property market and holds a huge potential for market transformation. However, the property- rating process should be linked more closely to and underpinned by the results of existing assessment methods and instruments developed by the sustainable building community.

J	Syn, T; Ramaprasad, A				Syn, Thant; Ramaprasad, Arkalgud			Megaprojects - symbolic and sublime: an ontological review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Review						Megaprojects; Ontology; Research	PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; RESEARCH QUESTIONS; LEADERSHIP; HISTORY; DESIGN; DAM	Purpose Megaprojects are symbolic milestones of human history. Most megaprojects are one-of-a-kind endeavors to which traditional project management principles are neither applicable nor suitable, rendering the holistic study of megaprojects especially difficult. There is no systemic framework that can help systematically assess and guide megaprojects and megaproject research. In the absence of such a framework there is a significant risk of bias in planning the projects and the topics researched. The purpose of this paper is to present an ontological framework of megaprojects and discuss how it can help analyze individual megaprojects and synthesize the corpus of megaproject research. Design/methodology/approach An ontology framework of megaproject is developed by deconstructing the symbolism and purpose of megaprojects into respective dimensions and their categories. The ontological framework is then used to map the extent literature on megaproject to identify the dominant themes and gaps in the state-of-the-research. Findings The megaproject research has predominantly focused on select stakeholders (builders, governments, and communities), translation stages (implementation and conceptualization), and sublime (mostly economic). Other aspects of megaprojects have received little or no attention. Originality/value The paper presents an ontological framework to holistically capture the symbolism and sublime of megaprojects. The framework is complete, expansive, and grounded, yet simple, parsimonious, and innovative. It is a tool for decision makers more than a formal ontology readable by machines.

In a construction context, strategic partnerships, as a particular type of hybrid organisation, have given promises of increased productivity and innovation through business models combining logics and governance structures from both the public and private sectors. Little is however known about how strategic partnerships are established and develop throughout their lifespan by combining different logics in response to institutional complexity. Drawing on a study of a public client's efforts to create cost efficient services, we analyse the formation of two strategic partnerships as emerging hybrid organisations in the intersection between a market logic, a project logic, a community logic, and an administrative logic. It is shown how different logics are mobilised in the dynamic shaping of the partnerships in response to moments of institutional complexity. On this background, we discuss how the contours of two different forms of hybrid organisation emerged, even though the partnerships initially operated and responded similarly to the institutional demands. On this basis, it is concluded that strategic partnerships can be seen as "trading zones" that follow different trajectories in coping with institutional demands, and hence the development of hybrid organisational forms.

How then to explain why construction engineering has progressively fallen out of focus in construction project management education and research? For an answer, the development of the discipline of construction management since the 1950s must be understood, a development that yielded a non-production-oriented approach to project management, one that provides the currently accepted operating system for managing the work in projects. This paper first traces the history of the development of the traditional operating system and related commercial terms and organizational practices. It argues that traditional practices rest on an assumption that careful development of a project schedule, managing the critical path, and maximizing productivity within each activity will optimize project delivery in terms of cost and duration. Subsequently, an alternative operating system, developed and proposed by the Lean Construction community, is described. In contrast to the traditional approach, lean defers detailed planning until closer to the point of action, involves those who are to do the work in designing the production system and planning how to do it, aims to maximize project performance (not the pieces), and exploits breakdowns as opportunities for learning. The history of this development will be traced in broad strokes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000276. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This paper aims to investigate the perceptions of Kenyan public and private stakeholder's concerning the CSFs to the implementation of PPPs in infrastructure and housing projects. A quantitative approach using survey-based questionnaire is adopted. CSFs identified from literature review were empirically tested by data collected using a sample survey of 27 Kenyan stakeholders. Response data was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that "acceptance and support given by the community", "project feasibility", "the laws, regulations and guidelines put in place", "available financial market" and "having a well organised and committed public agency" were the highly ranked CSFs. In contrast, "effective and enough resource allocation and management", "transparency and equity in the procurement process", and "proper and efficient training of employees" were the least ranked CSFs. These findings can be used as a road-map for the successful implementation of PPPs, provides insights on the CSFs of PPPs in infrastructure and housing projects across the Kenyan construction sector.

Organizing to Achieve Modular Architecture Across Different Products	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Architecture; collaboration; modularity; platforms; teams	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; REAL OPTIONS; DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; MASS CUSTOMIZATION; PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; COST MANAGEMENT	This study explores the relationship between organization and the development of architecture-enabled modularity within and across product lines. We examine organization structure, formal and informal team communication, and budgetary resources within a larger framework of the matrix organization found necessary for achieving a modular product line architecture spanning different products. Results were controlled for firm size and product complexity. Outcomes were assessed at the individual product level for meeting pre-development performance objectives. We found that the practice of assigning separate, dedicated architecture teams was not necessary to achieve modular architecture across different products or for achieving positive research and development (R&D) outcomes. Nor was a dedicated budget for defining modular product line architecture required for this type of R&D success. Rather, it was found that intensive collaboration and communication between individuals assigned to different product development teams, but who nonetheless were working toward a common modular architecture, was essential. These findings, when combined with longitudinal qualitative insights, showed that including a product or systems architect on specific product development teams, where such architects meet and comprise a community of practice within the organization, were strongly associated with modular architecture development and positive R&D outcomes.

This will exacerbate the already high cost incurred by utility companies and communities due to damage to distribution systems by hurricanes. Consequently, long-term investment in critical civil infrastructure systems, such as distribution systems, requires long-term planning that incorporates the potential impact of climate change. This can only be achieved through a comprehensive risk analysis framework for evaluating the impact of climate change and studying the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. This paper presents a framework for incorporating the potential impact of climate change in the reliability analysis of power distribution systems subject to hurricane hazards. The framework incorporates a time-dependent hurricane hazard model, time-dependent fragility model, system reliability evaluation, and a life cycle cost analysis for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A notional power distribution system located in the hurricane-prone state of Florida is used to demonstrate the proposed framework. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

As public-private partnership (PPP) is a proven method for supporting the financial viability of various types of infrastructure projects, governments have recently adopted PPP for eldercare facility projects. However, there are limited methods to support decisions on payment mechanisms, which is one of the fundamental factors required to make PPP contracts. This study investigated the relationships between the characteristics of eldercare facility projects and payment mechanisms [e.g., viability gap funding (VGF)]. This study applied a multivalue qualitative comparative analysis (mvQCA) with 26 case studies, which could be considered the best practice in China. Based on the analysis, the authors identified five and three configurations of project attributes for VGF (i.e., VGF user-fee) and user charge (i.e., non-VGF user-fee) mechanisms, respectively. This finding supports informed decision-making on payment mechanisms of PPP projects for healthcare facilities for the elderly. Further research in other countries is necessary to identify not only general but also culturally and politically specific configurations of attributes for different payment mechanisms.

A social construction of technology perspective is used to understand the choices underlying these multiple fuel practices. Nine participants (household energy managers, consumers and users) were purposefully selected from Soshanguve, an urban township in Pretoria, South Africa. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews and narrative analysis was used to generate findings. Stories about multiple fuel use in the household showed this practice is common and forms part of the participants' lifestyles. Social, cultural and political meanings of fuel use are identified in the narratives. Suggested interventions to optimize multiple fuel use in this context include additional technology such as solar power, collaborations with manufacturers to improve existing fuel types that are seen as potentially hazardous, and leveraging women's knowledge and position in the household to formalize education about multiple fuels. The role of government in providing subsidies for alternative energies and reviewing accessibility to electricity was also highlighted by the participants. This research demonstrates that policy-makers should actively involve consumers in household energy system decisions through deliberative dialogue with communities.

A METHOD FOR LINKING SAFETY FACTOR TO THE TARGET PROBABILITY OF FAILURE IN FIRE SAFETY ENGINEERING	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						probability of failure; safety factor; Monte Carlo simulation; fire safety engineering; uncertainty analysis	FLAWED CONCEPT; EVACUATION; DESIGN; RSET/ASET; MOVEMENT; DECISION; TIMES; MODEL; RISK	Ensuring occupants' safety in building fires is one of the most important aspects for fire safety engineering. Many uncertainties are inevitably introduced when estimating the occupant safety level, due to the high complexity of fire dynamics and the human behaviour in fires. Safety factor methods are traditionally employed to deal with such uncertainties. This kind of methods is easy to apply but leaves fire safety engineers unsure of the margin by which the design has failed. A method of linking safety factor and probability of failure in fire safety engineering is proposed in this study. An event tree is constructed to analyse potential fire scenarios that arise from the failure of fire protection systems. Considering uncertainties related to fire dynamics and evacuation, the traditional deterministic safety factor is considered as a random variable. Because there is no target probability of failure accepted by the whole fire safety engineering community, the concept of expected risk to life (ERL) is integrated to determine the target probability of failure. This method employs a Monte Carlo Simulation using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to calculate the required safety factor. A practical case study is conducted using the method proposed in this study.

Restoring industrial capacity and business continuity is crucial for the organizations' survival in the aftermath of a disaster but the process takes time while the affected region faces an unexpected surge in the demand for housing. Modeling approaches largely used in the supply chain management realm may support humanitarian logistics and policy-making by providing a testbed in which supply chain elements of the recovery process can be examined before implementing. This research presents a system dynamics model that considers the problem of housing recovery from the demand and supply perspective and provides significant insights for policymakers into how the production of permanent housing depends upon the uncertainties and feedback effects of material and labor. In order to highlight its utility, a hypothetical scenario in which a hurricane hits the U.S. Hampton Roads region, which is a major population center along the mid-Atlantic coast, has been configured by using actual data collected from both governmental and academic sources.

Multiobjective Formulation for Protection Allocation in Interdependent Infrastructure Networks Using an Attack-Diffusion Model	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Interdependent networks; Diffusion model; Multiobjective optimization; Cellular automata; Monte Carlo simulation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; INFLUENZA; FAILURES; DYNAMICS	Interdependent networks are a collection of individual networks that contain nodes that have interdependent relationships with nodes of other networks. Recognizing that many real-life networks are interdependent, approaches that were previously developed to study vulnerability in single networks are being extended to interdependent network applications (e.g.,intentional attack of selected nodes). As such, this study proposes an approach for finding the best set of protection strategies for a given set of interdependent networks exposed to random or intentional attacks through the development of a multiobjective optimization formulation. A simple diffusion model [susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)], based on cellular automata is used to describe the dynamics of the spread of the disruptive event through each individual network, and Monte Carlo simulation enables simulating the stochastic evolution of the disruption between the nodes of the interdependent networks. Several criteria considering the results of the propagation dynamics in each network or in the whole set of interdependent networks are proposed to assess the security characteristics of the network, and Pareto-optimal solutions are derived using the multiobjective evolutionary Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). An example using the topology of an Italian electric power network and the set of communities previously defined illustrates the approach. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Loosemore, M; Lim, BTH				Loosemore, Martin; Lim, Benson Teck-Heng			Intra-organisational injustice in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; People; Fairness; Human resource management; Justice; Organizations	PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose - Increasing workforce casualisation, under representation of women and other minority groups, racial discrimination, corruption and poor safety are just some of the documented examples of intra-organisational injustice in the industry. Typically these issues are problematised separately using different theoretical frameworks, yet at the most fundamental behavioural level they have a common cause which lies in the "unjust" treatment of one person by another. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the conceptual understanding of these hitherto separated but conceptually linked problems. Design/methodology/approach - A survey 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. Findings - Surprisingly despite widespread academic concerns about injustice in the construction industry, there are not significant concerns within the industry community. Contrary to much research about the poor culture of the construction industry, the results indicate that the relatively low levels of perceived injustice are institutional rather than cultural. The research also highlights the plight of middle management, which appear to consistently suffer the highest levels of injustice across all its theoretical categories. Research limitations/implications - Sample size and Australian focus. Practical implications - Informs organisational policies to reduce injustice in the construction industry. Social implications - By reducing injustice, this research will improve the fairness of business practices in the construction industry. Originality/value - Application of justice theories to conceptualise unfair construction practices.

Using an adaptation of the Cochrane Review protocol, the search and screen for relevant, rigorous research studies resulted in 37 research articles. The review focuses on six built environment characteristics: (1) barriers, supports and features that fit'; (2) spatial organization and layout; (3) environmental cues; (4) ambient qualities; (5) assistive technologies; and (6) gardens and outdoor spaces. Accessibility-oriented features dominated the studies and findings. Pathway and corridor design, and environmental cues that convey an instrumental function of a space also facilitated active living. Ambient features such as lighting quality and meaningful sounds and aromas were important facilitators to active living among residents with dementia. To strengthen the knowledge base of the field and its application in design and improvements of residential environments, future research should focus on: detailed measurement of built environment factors as well as active living; increasing use of digital technologies for such measurements; multidisciplinary research teams; and policy-driven research questions that arise with housing the growing population of older adults in a healthy manner.

These regulations significantly impact on aspirations with regard to the building design. Five case study houses recognized in awards from the Australian Institute of Architects are investigated for whether they met the aim and criteria of the relevant regulations for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reductions. Qualitative and quantitative issues surrounding their environmental performance are examined, including occupants' comfort and energy consumption. The findings suggest that the assessment processes underpinning the regulations do not correlate well with measured environmental performance, the perceptions of occupiers, and how these houses are actually designed and operated. The regulatory concept of 'meeting generic needs' fails to account for the diversity of socio-cultural understandings, the inhabitants' expectations and their behaviours. In particular, standards and regulations failed to predict adaptive comfort as well as the low-energy consumption in the five case study houses. A governance challenge is to evaluate the interaction of individual preferences, technical concerns, bio-climatic matters, and the socio-cultural context. The goals and behaviours of inhabitants must be recognized and rewarded because they benefit both the environment and the community.

J	Deal, B				Deal, B			Ecological urban dynamics: the convergence of spatial modelling and sustainability	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						ecology; environmental assessment; planning; simulation modelling; sustainability; sustainability indicators; tools; United States; urban development	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA	Planning professions have focused their attention on continued technological solutions to environmental problems despite discussions relating to the sustainability of the built human community. However, ecological sustainability involves the identification of ecologically sound alternatives to current practices, not necessarily involving technological intervention. In the urban ecosystem this means the identification of the processes of urban change. New theory, tools, and research methods in ecological systems have the potential to improve the dynamics of change in urban environments. A variety of sophisticated computational and theoretical tools exist for characterizing urban systems at a conceptual level, and for visualizing and understanding these characterizations. The theoretical underpinnings and practical application of the integrated, multi-disciplinary, ecological and engineering approach to modelling urbanland use transformation is presented. A new tool, LEAM (Land use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model), has been developed to provide researchers and professionals to address urban dynamics in greater detail at a variety of scales and interfaces. The conceptual framework of the LEAM model is provided, followed by an application of the model to a 'collar county' in the metro Chicago area. The model can visually examine the dynamic spread of human development in the county and the associated environmental impacts of the urban growth and development patterns.

J	Arduino, P; OpdenBosch, A; Macari, EJ				Arduino, P; OpdenBosch, A; Macari, EJ			Geotechnical triaxial soil testing within virtual environment	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper presents a computer-based innovative instructional approach for training potential users of the geotechnical triaxial device. The proposed approach provides the user with a tool to gain a thorough understanding of soil testing as well as the resulting soil behavior. The proposed approach is based on the concept of virtual reality environments and attempts to ''realistically'' simulate many of the essential characteristics of a real laboratory setting. The particular virtual environment being employed is referred to as the interactive visualizer (IV), which was developed by researchers at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The concept of machines, cameras, lights, and medium are described as the entities that, when properly combined, create a virtual world. In this context a geotechnical triaxial laboratory has been developed that models the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of soil specimens. Soil properties and confinements levels constitute the initial settings that are controlled by the user, followed by the shearing stages of the test that also respond to the interactive participation of the user. The mechanical response of the virtual soil specimen is displayed in a graphical format using the concept of a ''classroom'' blackboard. This initial version of the virtual laboratory has shown some very promising results. Additional planned developments will further enhance the usefulness of this application that, in turn, will benefit the geotechnical engineering educational community.

However, the operations used in performing the BV method often differ due to the various government procurement requirements. Consequently, some of the methods popular in the academic community are not easily incorporated in the BV method in some countries. To enhance the procurement process, this study aims to gain experience by applying the well-known analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight the decision criteria for selecting BV contractors of two construction projects in Taiwan. Through these two case studies, this work confirms that the AHP provides a significant benefit for considering the individual preferences of all decision-makers when weighting the criteria. However, this study finds two major potential obstacles, the legal requirements associated with using the AHP and the time it takes to implement the AHP. To overcome these obstacles, this work suggests guidelines to meet the legal requirements for implementing the AHP in the BV contractor selection, and proposes several strategies to shorten the AHP implementation time. The lessons learned here are relevant to those countries in which BV method must be performed in a transparent and strictly regulated environment.

J	Molenaar, KR; Songer, AD				Molenaar, KR; Songer, AD			Web-based decision support systems: Case study in project delivery	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SECTOR DESIGN-BUILD; CONTRACT; MODEL	The decentralized nature of the construction industry contributes to difficulties in the implementation and dissemination of project management-based decision tools. The majority of decision support systems (DSS) are contained in-house with private developers and users, or on researchers stand-alone computers and academic journals. Current World Wide Web technologies provide the appropriate means for large-scale implementation and continued development of DSS for the architectural, engineering, and construction community. This paper documents a DSS developed specifically for design/build project selection among United States public sector agencies. The system, the Design/Build Selector (DBS), is Web enabled, allowing for easy access and large-scale dissemination. Design/build project procurement is rapidly expanding throughout public sector agencies in the United States construction industry. As public agencies turn to design/build, appropriate project selection is a primary consideration affecting successful delivery. Prior to the implementation of DBS, there was no systematic or formalized method for selecting projects appropriate for design/build. Since 1997, the Web site that houses the DBS has been visited by over 4,000 people, and the DBS tool has been used on 102 projects representing over $4.8 billion in construction. This paper reports on the application and potential for Web-based DSS in civil engineering. The architecture of the program, data collection, model weighting, and output interface are explained.

The analysis of research on programmes raises questions about what type of research is produced and what its impact is on housing. The Brazilian 'My House, My Life' (Minha Casa, Minha Vida - MCMV) programme demonstrates that more of the same type of housing is produced and that the focus of most research repeats the same mistakes. Three million homes have been built and the research community has examined the programme's social, economic and environmental impacts. A total of 2477 scientific studies on MCMV are analyzed. Few studies were found to assess living conditions from a user perspective at the residential unit scale. Although improvements have occurred on some social issues, the siting of housing on the urban periphery is problematic for urban mobility, social segregation and aesthetic monotony. Also, the design model does not respond to the diverse needs of inhabitants. Opportunities are identified for actions and essential missing research on mass housing. Retrofit strategies are urgent and social cost studies should induce change to the design model. Evidence-based research is needed to support policies and design processes for affordable and quality housing solutions that value users, their needs and aspirations.	[Kowaltowski, Doris C. C.

J	Kokkonen, A; Alin, P				Kokkonen, Anne; Alin, Pauli			Practice-based learning in construction projects: a literature review	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Human behaviour; learning; practice; project; social science	SOCIAL PRACTICES; RESEARCH-PROGRAM; PRACTICE LENS; ORGANIZATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; COMMUNITIES; TIME; PARTICIPATION; PERSPECTIVES; RATIONALITY	Construction project managers often face problems when trying to change work practices. Management research addresses these problems by offering stylized and abstract models; unfortunately, they may say little about the actual work practices that managers want to change. Practice theory offers an alternative way to address practice-related managerial problems, arguing that learning is a central enabler of performing practices. While some early research on practice-based learning in construction management exists, an understanding of how this theory has been applied is lacking. To address this limitation, a systematic literature review of 15 published construction management articles was conducted, the articles being divided into five practice-related analytical categories: participation, context, meaning production, power and becoming a practitioner to identify the areas of theory discussed. Participation and context were discussed more in the published articles than meaning production, power and becoming a practitioner, which might suggest that the latter categories offer more possibilities for future research. Further, the articles were analysed through a Lakatosian research programme lens, showing that a progressive research programme exists in practice-based studies in construction management. These findings provide avenues for future construction management studies seeking to apply practice-based learning theory to understand learning in construction projects better.

J	Joslin, R; Muller, R				Joslin, Robert; Muller, Ralf			New Insights into Project Management Research: A Natural Sciences Comparative	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						transformative research; natural science comparative; methodologies; complex adaptive systems; Universal Darwinism	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; ORGANIZATIONS	In this article, a new research perspective toward project management phenomena is developed; it builds on the existing natural science theory of genotyping and phenotyping by developing a contemporary comparative model for project management research, which compares natural science molecular biology (genomics) as a way to investigate social science (specifically, project management) phenomena. The comparative maps concepts and terminology and, in doing so, explains why phenomena in genomics (study of genetics) can be compared with practices, behaviors, and established thinking in project management. To support the theory building process, the attributes of complex adaptive systems (CAS) are used to validate the constructs of the research. The comparative is then used to answer the research question by identifying two social science phenomena: lessons intentionally not learned and bricolage of competing methodology subelements, followed by a detailed explanation of the reasons for the phenomena using the attributes of the comparative. This article provides further examples of phenomena that were derived from the comparative model as well as the types of research questions where the model would provide insight. The authors believe that using a comparative model will challenge established thinking so that many aspects of project management will be seen in a new light in both the research and practitioner communities of project management.

J	Ruuska, I; Teigland, R				Ruuska, Inkeri; Teigland, Robin			Ensuring project success through collective competence and creative conflict in public-private partnerships-A case study of Bygga Villa, a Swedish triple helix e-government initiative	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership; Conflict; Project management; Collective competence; E-government; Construction; Community of practice	BOUNDARY OBJECTS; PERFORMANCE; VIEWS	This paper presents a study of one public-private partnership in e-government in Sweden, Bygga Villa, that involved 16 organizations from academia, government, and industry to develop an innovative internet portal for the private construction industry. Our research purpose was to answer (1) What are the challenges to developing collective competence in public-private partnerships? and (2) How can these challenges be overcome to achieve project success? We found that the potential for conflict due to differing goals, resource scarcity, and interdependence of tasks was the greatest challenge for Bygga Villa's ability to develop collective competence while the partnership overcame this challenge through (1) co-developing a clear project charter, (2) recruiting a project leader with strong knowledge broker skills, (3) conducting joint problem-solving tasks using boundary objects, and (4) ensuring an understanding of the "big picture" through continuous open and balanced communication. Moreover, the project was successful due to members' ability to embrace conflict and turn it into creative conflict through dialogue while ensuring a high level of project satisfaction by the partnership's individual members.

In this article, we draw on rich ethnographic data on their everyday experiences of working construction and living in Singapore, and we espouse the distinctive qualities and mission of ethnographically-informed methodologies to enact change in this space. The methods include in-depth interviews with 11 Tamil labourers, and the subsequent use of worker photo diaries, known as auto-photography, with a total of 108 photographs taken. All the participants either worked construction, were on medical leave, or were seeking compensation after workplace injury. The analysis of the interview data develops themes around precarity and discrimination on construction sites (precarity of work), and the exclusory social practices experienced by workers in their offsite world (precarity of place). Following the goals of decolonized research, our innovative methods have enabled Tamil construction workers to present their lives through their own lens. By involving migrant construction workers, we identify new sites of inquiry and knowledge in examining the inequalities and injustices they face.

However, workers still seek work environments that stimulate networking and collaboration possibilities. This has led to the growing popularity of co-working spaces. However, little is known about the specific preferences of co-working space users. The aim of this research is to analyse user preferences for co-working space characteristics. Stated choice data were collected by means of a questionnaire which was completed by 219 respondents of 25 co-working spaces in the Netherlands. A mixed-multinomial logit model was used to analyse the user preferences. Results show that the main motivations for co-workers to work in a co-working space were that they were looking for a workplace outside their home that allows them to work in an inspiring work environment where the accommodation is affordable. Accessibility and atmosphere/interior are the most important characteristics when choosing a specific co-working space. These results provide owners or managers of co-working spaces with clear insights about how to cope with co-worker preferences by offering co-working spaces with good accessibility by car and public transport, a semi-open layout and a homelike interior.

This new era of smart and sustainable urban systems is enabling transformative change in the way urban communities are interacting among themselves and with the built environment to become more sustainable and resilient to meet the demands of the growing urban population. Interoperability has been shown to be a major barrier for the seamless transfer of information between the heterogeneous landscape of the internet of things (IoT) and smart cities. In order to facilitate interoperability of these systems, this paper conducts a holistic review of principles, methods, and requirements needed to achieve interoperability of smart and sustainable urban systems. Significantly, the use of ontologies, namely the semantic web, has been shown to be the most promising method to enable interoperability. Existing ontologies and frameworks that can enable smart and sustainable urban systems in the scope of the AECO industry are presented. Finally, various challenges revealed during the qualitative review are discussed to promote research opportunities. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Nevertheless, little is known about its acceptance in the construction community. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the views of industry stakeholders on safety design in the harmonized safety regulations of South Australia. A desk study on pre- and post-harmonized WHS regulations reveals that design for safety now constitutes a major theme in practice following the harmonization process. After that, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate the use of design for safety in the construction industry. The results show that the guidelines promote safety-related design requirements without significantly increasing designers' and contractors' workload. Designers are aware of the hazards on sites and design firms are willing to embrace the guidelines if they are protected from liability. However, the extent to which contracting and procurement systems encourage safety design is uncertain. Moreover, the problem of cost hinders designers in implementing it unless the client accepts it as part of the over-arching life cycle cost structure. There is great uncertainty on whether the concept will be promoted through regulation and subsequently lead to a reduction in hazardous risks and injury rates.

Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Design for Safety: Multiple Stakeholders in the Singapore Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction design and management; Construction safety; Design for safety; Knowledge attitude practice; Labor and personnel issues	PREVENTION; PERSPECTIVES; ISSUES	This paper aims to investigate the design for safety (DfS) knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of multiple stakeholders, including architects, civil and structural (CS) engineers, mechanical and electrical (ME) engineers, developers/clients, project managers, and safety professionals, and propose potential interventions to improve the DfS implementation in the construction industry. Data were collected from 257 multiple stakeholders in Singapore using a KAP questionnaire and seven semistructured interviews with DfS professionals, architects, developers, and project managers. The results indicated that the DfS knowledge level of survey participants needs to be improved. The majority of respondents demonstrated a positive attitude towards DfS, but the average level of DfS practice was low. Statistically significant differences in DfS practice were found between developers/clients, CS engineers, and project managers. Three recommendations for improving DfS implementation were proposed: (1)enhance DfS training programs, (2)establish a DfS Community of Practice, and (3)develop DfS courses in tertiary institutions. The findings of this paper can help in the design of strategies to improve the implementation of DfS in the construction industry at the national level and the approach can be used to track the effectiveness of DfS-related interventions across time.

The intent and outcomes of this programme (in which all authors participated) are critically examined through a cross-project meta-study of the primary data, substantiated by insights from secondary sources. Given that only three (out of 45) projects met the expected CO2 target in reality, despite generous funding and professional expertise, it suggests that decarbonizing existing housing will not be particularly easy. Important lessons are found in this initiative's formulation, target setting, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and feedback mechanisms. These lessons can inform the formulation, delivery and effectiveness of future national energy retrofit programmes. Furthermore, to support the 'scaling up' of effective retrofit programmes and reduce the gap between intent and outcome, it is recommended that attention be moved from what level of CO2 reductions are to be achieved to how (delivery models) these radical reductions can be achieved and by whom (supply chain). Such alternative delivery models to the 'whole house' approach include retrofit over time, city-scale retrofit and community-based energy retrofits.

In this study, we construct the so-called inter-contractors' collaboration networks by mapping the electronic database of NQAPC for an 8-year period (2003-2010). In these networks, nodes represent contractors; two contractors are connected by an edge if they have cooperated at least one project. By using a variety of network measures, i.e., giant component, degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, we aim to descriptively investigate the structural evolution of the collaborations between contractors in the construction industry of China. As network size increases, we find a structural transition in the collaboration community size, the degree follows power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff, the average path length tends to decrease, and the clustering coefficient slightly decreases. Some explanations and a series of construction insights are discussed. The results and methodologies not only would help governors understand the social mechanisms underlie processes of construction industry, but could help contractors choose competent partners by identifying network properties.

J	Hartmann, T				Hartmann, Timo			Goal and Process Alignment during the Implementation of Decision Support Systems by Project Teams	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information technology; Implementation; Three-dimensional models; Consulting services; Construction management; Configuration; Decision support systems	INNOVATION DIFFUSION; CONSTRUCTION; POWER; TECHNOLOGY; RESISTANCE	Despite the significant amount of work in recent years to better understand the implementation of technologies in project-team settings, the research community still lacks an in-depth understanding of the social dynamics around the implementation of a new technology to support decision-making tasks at the operational project-team level. To increase this understanding, this paper presents a longitudinal case study about the implementation of a four-dimensional (4D) decision support system by a project team. This paper provides a grounded analysis of the observations from this study. The analysis shows that the implementation of the 4D system was characterized by a constant negotiation about the goals of the implementation and the process of how to best implement the 4D system. During these negotiations actors applied their technical and project task related knowledge to analyze, understand, and influence the goals and the process of the implementation. This knowledge, however, changed throughout the implementation and hence, the goals and processes of the implementation also changed frequently. On the basis of these findings, this paper suggests that construction management theory and practice should account for the possibility of shifting goals and processes during technology implementations.

J	Lutzkendorf, T				Luetzkendorf, Thomas			Assessing the environmental performance of buildings: trends, lessons and tensions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						buildings; decision process; design process; environmental indicators; environmental performance; life cycle; sustainability assessment; time	SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION; LIFE; ENERGY; GREEN; LCA; STRATEGIES; IMPACTS; CARBON	Since the 1970s, intense discussions have occurred within the research and practitioner communities on how to assess and influence the environmental performance of buildings. Many different methods, criteria and tools were developed to raise awareness, enable goal formulation, support design and decision-making processes, and evaluate a building's environmental performance. This development can be retraced through the example of the works of Raymond J. Cole, who made an important contribution to this scientific debate. The integration of environmental performance into a sustainability assessment, the ongoing development of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, and clients', financiers' and assessors' different demands for environmental performance assessment, raise additional questions and highlight the conflicting goals. Six topics are examined in relation to current developments: the further development of the classic three pillars' sustainability model; the suitability of assessment criteria and indicators; the handling of technological progress; the discounting of environmental impacts; the environmental assessment of existing buildings; and the further development of legal requirements. Time' is a key factor relating to LCA, weighing current versus future emissions, ecological value and recycling potential of existing buildings or options' for different ways to use the building in future. Recommended actions are provided for key stakeholders.

The drawbacks with these methods are inconsistency, dissatisfaction, and delayed decision process. This study proposes to use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based preference aggregation method (commonly used by the business community) to combine the individual inputs into a group decision in conjunction with a constrained particle swarm optimization technique to generate consistent results in minimal time without altering individual decision-maker inputs. The proposed approach was evaluated by computing group decision weights for selection of a contractor out of six contractors with the help of nine decision-makers based on eight criteria using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results indicated that the proposed method was able to identify the most suitable contractor in minimal time without human intervention. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Brunel's Thames Tunnel and project narratives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project histories; Narratives; Technology; Practice; Sociology of knowledge	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE; CHALLENGES; BOUNDARIES; FRAMEWORK; RELEVANCE	Looking at historical projects has much to offer our understanding of project management, for both research and practice. However, there are important challenges in how alternative narratives about such projects are reconstructed and related to each other. To explore these challenges, this paper uses the example of the Thames Tunnel project, completed under the direction of Marc Brunel in 1843, and reputed to be the first tunnel to be built under a major river. In telling the story of the project, we focus on five alternative discourses: technico-rational; practice; networks of people, things, and ideas; politics; and society. The common response to such variety is either to attempt to construct an overarching meta-narrative, or to explore the differences as a way of highlighting the localized and contingent nature of knowledge about projects, or adopt some intermediate position somewhere on the spectrum between these two extremes. Instead we seek a different route grounded in a sociology of knowledge that acknowledges simultaneous, provisional, and contested processes of division and stabilization in the ways that epistemic communities constitute knowledge through their own narratives and practices. These have implications for the stories that are told about project management and, crucially, the activities and interests that both shape and are shaped by such narratives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainable performance criteria for construction method selection in concrete buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction methods; Prefabrication; Concrete construction; Construction management; Sustainable development	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION; MANAGEMENT; WASTE	The use of prefabrication offers significant advantages, yet appropriate criteria for applicability assessments to a given building have been found to be deficient. Decisions to use prefabrication are still largely based on anecdotal evidence or simply cost-based evaluation when comparing various construction methods. Holistic criteria are needed to assist with the selection of an appropriate construction method in concrete buildings during early project stages. Following a thorough literature review and comprehensive comparisons between prefabrication and on-site construction method, a total of 33 sustainable performance criteria (SPC) based on the triple bottom line and the requirements of different project stakeholders were identified. A survey of U.S. experienced practitioners including clients/developers, engineers, contractors, and precast concrete manufacturers was conducted to capture their perceptions on the importance of the criteria. The ranking analysis of survey results shows that social awareness and environmental concerns were considered as increasingly important in construction method selections. Factor analysis reveals that these SPCs can be grouped into seven dimensions, namely, economic factors: "long-term cost," "constructability," "quality," and "first cost"; social factors: "impact on health and community," "architectural impact": and environmental factor: "environmental impact." The resultant list of SPCs provides team members a new way to select a construction method, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of built environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

P.; Yang, Guangwei			Evaluation of Compression Algorithms for 3D Pavement Image Data	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						2D; 3D pavement image data; Compression algorithms; Performance evaluation		A standard interchangeable data format was recently developed through the Transportation Pooled-Fund Study TPF-5(299) to meet different requirements and needs for two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) pavement image data storage and exchange. Considering pavement images occupy large amounts of storage space, efficient compression algorithms for both 8-bit 2D and higher-bit 3D images become one of the key components for a successful implementation of the standard. Highway agencies and industry vendors exclusively use the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) or its successor JPEG 2000 standard for 2D image compression, while the compression of 3D 16-bit images remains to be proprietary. The goal of this paper is to evaluate suitable algorithms for compressing 3D pavement images. An overview of the state-of-the-art pavement image data collection technologies was performed, and the relevant image data formats were identified. Subsequently, five compression algorithms suitable for 16-bit image data were selected based on results from a comprehensive survey of the TPF-5(299) technical community. The compressions of several representative field images were implemented and evaluated in terms of the computation efficiency and retaining of image quality. The expected benefits of this study include facilitating standard and efficient pavement image data collection and accelerating the development of consistent pavement condition evaluation.

We suggest opportunity pursuit is a project in nature and, through analytical conceptualization, we frame a newly termed and defined concept of "Opportunity Project", described as the unique, temporary and judgmental transformation of business models, with the purpose of turning opportunities from a state of possibility to that of beneficial change delivery. The perspective proposed in this paper extends literature by (1) offering a novel consistent project-oriented view capable of clarifying the underlying and explicit mechanisms activated during the entrepreneurial pursuit of opportunities, (2) posing business model transformation as a critical dimension of such perspective and (3) suggesting a four stage cycle aimed at judgmental alignment and adaptation of strategy and execution. Doing so, this paper corroborates the ongoing movement of project management from an operational discipline towards organization and strategy fields and suggests, to two so far segregated communities of entrepreneurship and project management researchers, a joint stream of interest is possible and that it has potential to disclose knowledge and support entrepreneurial action in practice.

Towards a smart campus: supporting campus decisions with Internet of Things applications	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Smart campus; Internet of Things; real estate management; use patterns; decision making	BUILDING OCCUPANCY; NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE; TRACKING; SPACE; BLUETOOTH; SENSORS; IOT; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENT	At universities worldwide, creating a 'smart campus' is gaining significance. This is a response to the increasingly dynamic use of the campus and the pressure on resources: energy, financial and human resources. The university community has become more mobile, student numbers more unpredictable and funding more uncertain. Consequently, campus strategies focus on resource efficiency and sharing space, requiring investment in management information to improve decision making. The Internet of Things (IoT) can help to provide big data about use patterns: by collecting real-time data on space utilization, users can make better use of current spaces and real estate managers can make better decisions about long-term demand. Furthermore, space utilisation data can be complemented with user feedback data and environmental variables, e.g. noise levels, luminance. In this research we identify the capabilities of existing IoT applications through a literature study. Literature also suggests that information from IoT applications is not utilized in organisational decision-making processes. Through four case studies we analyse these decision-making processes and identify the process-level requirements to make strategic decisions in campus management. Then we show how information from the IoT can be directly connected to these processes, thus providing a valuable addition of real-time data as input.

However, research on the factors affecting tacit-knowledge sharing within an integrated project team has been insufficient in the construction management field. This paper aims to identify the critical factors affecting tacit-knowledge sharing and explore the interrelationships between these factors. Based on a literature review, the authors first identify 31 factors of tacit-knowledge sharing within integrated project teams. Through a questionnaire and statistical test, this research next analyzes the factors that are significant to tacit-knowledge sharing within an integrated project team. Then, factors analysis was used to study the critical factors of tacit-knowledge sharing. Finally, the authors analyze the interrelations among the critical factors and explore how they influence tacit-knowledge sharing within the integrated project team. The findings in this research demonstrate the impacts of trust on tacit-knowledge sharing with the evolution of trust taken into account. The authors also find that two personal factors are related to trust and tacit-knowledge sharing. This paper can provide useful guidance for an integrated project team to promote tacit-knowledge sharing and ultimately improve team performance. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This paper examines if neighbourhood environments are associated with physical activity, especially walking and cycling. It analyses 608 respondent survey data from Washington State in the US and Geographic Information System-derived measures of the neighbourhood environment. Respondents reported traffic volume to be the most significant barrier, and good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling. Utilitarian destinations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores and convenience stores, were significant correlates of walking and moderate-intensity physical activities, while housing type, sports facility and transportation infrastructure were correlated with vigorous physical activities. Active people rated higher for their neighbourhood attributes including safety, visual quality, knowing neighbours, seeing many other people walking and cycling, and the availability of sports facilities, parks, and bike racks. Simple interventions such as street lighting, pavements/sidewalks, street trees, benches, bike lanes or trails, bike racks, and traffic-calming devices appeared to hold some promise in promoting physical activities in neighbourhoods. Long-term solutions should include strategies to enhance overall aesthetics, safety, accessibility, street connectivity, and social interactions among neighbours.

The aim of this research is to investigate what happens when a project team has to collaboratively innovate to address radical design challenges in a construction setting. We focus on the role of a full-scale mock-up of a facade in transforming the design intent for a building by Frank Gehry into design realization. The concept of boundary objects is used as an analytical lens via a case study methodology utilizing non-participant observation of weekly meetings and workshops over a period of 10 months covering client, consultant and contractor involvement. The research shows the role of mock-ups in radical construction settings is in tension along three delivery dimensions: performance, aesthetic and technical construction. Task completion competed with the requirements for experimentation around innovative problem solving with the how to construct it problem left unresolved. The findings suggest that co-location and synchronicity are critical conditions for collaborative and innovative problem solving in radical construction contexts. Project teams need to create open-ended 'moments' for iterating critical objects and the interactions that take place around them.

Implementing public-private partnership (PPP) policy for public construction projects in Ghana: critical success factors and policy implications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						public-private partnership; critical success factors; construction projects; case study; Ghana	WATER-SUPPLY PROJECTS; HONG-KONG; OPERATE; WORKS; MODEL; BOT	Public-private partnership (PPP) is considered an innovative procurement approach which offers good prospects for the future of the global construction industry. However, since the introduction of PPP in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI) in 2004, the factors contributing to its successful implementation have not yet been fully explored. This has made many local practitioners very reluctant to procure construction PPP projects. This paper aims to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for construction PPPs in Ghana by reviewing and analysing two successful PPP projects: the Kojokrom Market Development Project and the Asutsuare Water Treatment Plant Project. The analysis reveals five CSFs for construction PPP projects in Ghana; these are: government commitment and support, strong community support and relationship, openness and constant communication, project profitability and capable private partner. The experiences in the case studies are further compared with global experience. Practical and management implications are provided to facilitate the implementation of PPP policy in GCI. It is expected that the research outputs would inform policy makers and local practitioners on the appropriate measures to adopt when engaging in future projects. Future research should adopt empirical surveys to make objective generalization and comparison with other countries.	[Osei-Kyei, Robert; Chan, Albert P.

Parallelized Implicit Nonlinear FEA Program for Real Scale RC Structures under Cyclic Loading	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Finite-element method; Parallel processing; Earthquake engineering; Concrete; Algorithms	CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR	Parallel computing in civil engineering has been restricted to monotonic shock or blast loading with explicit algorithm which is characteristically feasible to be parallelized. In the present paper, efficient parallelization strategies for the highly demanded implicit nonlinear finite-element analysis (FEA) program for real scale reinforced concrete (RC) structures under cyclic loading are proposed. Quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art parallel strategies in terms of factorization were carried out, leading to the problem-optimized solver, which successfully embraces the penalty method and banded nature. Particularly, the penalty method employed imparts considerable smoothness to the global response, which yields practical superiority of the parallel triangular system solution over those of advanced solvers such as the parallel preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Other salient issues on parallelization are also addressed. By virtue of the parallelization, the analysis platform offers unprecedented access to physics-based mechanisms and probabilistic randomness at theentire system level and realistically reproduces global degradation and localized damage, as reflected from the application to a RC structure. Equipped with accuracy, stability and scalability, the parallel platform is believed to serve as a fertile ground for the introducing of further physical mechanisms into various research fields, as well as the earthquake engineering community.

J	Yi, H				Yi, Hwang			4D-printed parametric facade in architecture: prototyping a self-shaping skin using programmable two-way shape memory composite (TWSMC)	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Shape memory composite; SMA; SMP; 4D printing; Kinetic architecture; Material programming; Parametric architecture	KINETIC FACADE; POLYMER; DESIGN; ALLOY	Purpose This study aims to present an architectural application of 4D-printed climate-adaptive kinetic architecture and parametric facade design. Design/methodology/approach This work investigates experimental prototyping of a reversibly self-shaping facade, by integrating the parametric design approach, smart material and 4D-printing techniques. Thermo-responsive building skin modules of two-way shape memory composite (TWSMC) was designed and fabricated, combining the shape memory alloy fibers (SMFs) and 3D-printed shape memory polymer matrices (SMPMs). For geometry design, deformation of the TWSMC was simulated with a dimension-reduced mathematical model, and an optimal arrangement of three different types of TWSMC modules were designed and fabricated into a physical scale model. Findings Model-based experiments show robust workability and formal reversibility of the developed facade. Potential utility of this module for adaptive building design and construction is discussed based on the results. Findings help better understand the shape memory phenomena and presented design-inclusive technology will benefit architectural communities of smart climate-adaptive building. Originality/value Two-way reversibility of 4D-printed composites is a topic of active research in material science but has not been clearly addressed in the practical context of architectural design, due to technical barriers. This research is the first architectural presentation of the whole design procedure, simulation and fabrication of the 4D-printed and parametrically movable facade.

AEC projects are challenging to collaborate because they require those in different subgroups to address uniquely defined technical and functional contexts. The AEC industry often seeks integrated collaboration through organizational integration because the literature assumes that organizational structure determines collaboration structure. This study uses a network perspective to identify the inconsistency between the organization and collaboration networks through the data of email records from a $20 million AEC project with a typical fragmented organization. The analytical focus is on two network configurations: (1) a community structure through which subgroups are defined to attend to specific aspects of the project and then coordinated through ties between members of different teams; and (2) a core-periphery structure in which a relatively small number of members interact frequently in the core and then coordinate as each member of the core interacts with specific members of the periphery. Results provide evidence of integrated collaboration in fragmented project organization, indicating organizational integration is not a must to achieve integrative collaboration. The findings suggest implications to facilitate integrative collaboration: (1) efforts should focus on collaboration behaviors, (2) subgroups should adopt a dual-lead pattern, (3) subgroups should encourage non-high-profile members to function as cores, and (4) subgroups should ensure information sharing and prevent information overload.

J	Klitgaard, A; Gottlieb, SC; Svidt, K				Klitgaard, Anne; Gottlieb, Stefan Christoffer; Svidt, Kjeld			The researcher as audience and storyteller: challenges and opportunities of impression management in ethnographic studies	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ethnography; impression management; methods; methodology; qualitative data	ORGANIZATION; SEARCH; GENDER; TALES	The use of ethnographic methods in construction management research is increasing as a means of revealing local and often unspoken ways of knowing and achieving new insights into the enduring challenges of the industry. Impression management activities, however, challenge the ethnographic researcher. Impression management happens when observees act in a different way than they would routinely, due to the presence of an audience. In the paper, we draw on data collected as a part of a wider ethnographic study to illustrate how the relationship between observer and observees can be understood through the lens of impression management. In particular, we show how the researcher assumes a dual role as both an audience and a storyteller in ethnographic studies. The researcher can thus be seen as an audience for the observees in their attempts to present themselves as agreeable and perform accordingly in front of the researcher as well as each other. This happens in part, as the observees attribute the researcher the role as storyteller, knowing that accounts of their practice and performance may be communicated to the research community and the industry in general. While impression management complicates the relationship between the observees and the observer, and can be seen as a potential source of bias, we also suggest that it presents an opportunity for increased empirical robustness of ethnographic findings if acknowledged.

Analysis of the impact of craft labour availability on North American construction project productivity and schedule performance	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Craft skills; workforce; productivity; time; risk identification		The North American construction industry has experienced periods of craft shortages for decades. While this problem has received significant attention from researchers, less attention has been given to quantifying the impact of availability of craft labour on project performance. The primary contribution of the current work to the body of knowledge is the quantification of the relationship between craft labour availability and project performance, as measured by project productivity and schedule. Data from 97 construction projects completed in the U.S. and Canada between 2001 and 2014 were collected from two industry databases. The primary analysis shows that projects that experienced craft shortages underwent substantial and statistically lower productivity compared to projects that did not. The analysis also shows a significant growth in schedule overrun due to the craft labour shortages among the same population of projects. Further exploration by means of several regression analyses shows a statistically significant correlation between increased craft recruiting difficulty and lower project productivity and also higher schedule overruns in both project databases. The results are confirmed across both databases and serve as informative models that provide valuable insight for project management teams to perceive the risk that lack of skills poses on project productivity and time performance. Understanding the level of impact that craft shortages are having through robust statistical analyses is a first step in developing the motivation for industry leaders, communities and construction stakeholders to address this challenge.

Automated processing of large point clouds for structural health monitoring of masonry arch bridges	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						LiDAR; Point clouds; Automatic processing; Masonry arch bridges	LIMIT ANALYSIS	Laser scanning technology is gaining popularity in a wide range of applications due to the increasing accuracy and speed at which data can be collected and an increase in laser scan data processing tools. Nevertheless, manual operations for specific applications are time consuming and can require high-performance computers to produce suitable models for further operations. Thus, laser scan data are underused in the civil engineering community. New procedures that automate the data processing for specific but repetitive infrastructure typologies are required to make full use of the technology as a basic tool for infrastructure assessment and asset management. This paper presents a new method for fully automated point cloud segmentation of masonry arch bridges. The method efficiently creates segmented, spatially related and organized point clouds, which each contain the relevant geometric data for a particular component (pier, arch, spandrel wall, etc.) of the structure. The segmentation is based in the combination of a heuristic approach and image processing tools adapted to voxel structures. The proposed methodology provides the essential processed data required for structural health monitoring of masonry arch bridges based on geometric anomalies. The method was validated using a representative sample of masonry arch bridges. The results demonstrate that this tool can provide data for further structural operations without requiring neither training in laser scanning technology nor high-performance computers for such data processing.

Social capital, which represents the social networks built among displaced people, the host community, and government actors, helps displaced people access services not adequately provided by camp managers. Despite the known importance of social capital for displaced people, researchers do not fully understand how it is fostered or inhibited by the design of a refugee camp. This research thus explores the following question: which salient infrastructure components and demographic characteristics in a refugee camp foster social capital? At a Greek refugee camp, researchers distributed 68 surveys to evaluate how salient infrastructure components in the camp environment affect bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. Salient infrastructure components represent, in this study, what the displaced persons identify as the most important infrastructure components in the camp environment. Linear regression is used to identify demographics (e.g., gender, nationality, age, asylum status, family status, and marital status) and salient infrastructure components (e.g., internal lighting and kitchen utensils) that influence bonding and bridging social capital. Interestingly, the research team found that demographics and salient infrastructure components had no relationship with linking social capital. This research proposes methods for policymakers and camp managers to identify the factors that drive the formation of social capital. Once these factors are identified, camp managers will be able to make targeted changes in the camp environment that could foster the formation of social capital.

In order to analyze such extra functionality losses, the authors have developed an agent-based inoperability input-output model with a focus on damage propagation from a component level to a system level in the electricity sector. In addition, this research presents the probabilistic matrix for the quantification of correlation coefficients between two connected electricity sector components (e.g.,power generator and deliverer) and uses these coefficients to identify critical components from a perspective of the network's reliability. The developed model thus allows us to understand how a degradation of component affects the functionality of the whole electricity sector. To demonstrate the model's analytic capability, this research conducted case simulations using the data from 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The simulation results show that the impact of seismic damage in a network is generally underestimated because there is unforeseen damage propagation from the component to the system level. Moreover, the results demonstrate that demand-side efforts to conserve electricity usage and restoration priority setting in accordance with component criticality are crucial to ensure community resilience in case of disaster.

J	Padalkar, M; Gopinath, S				Padalkar, Milind; Gopinath, Saji			Are complexity and uncertainty distinct concepts in project management? A taxonomical examination from literature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Uncertainty; Complexity; Taxonomy; Research methods	FUZZY ACTIVITY TIMES; UNFORESEEABLE UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS; PROCESS ARCHITECTURE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ACTIVITY NETWORKS; RISK; ORGANIZATION; FRAMEWORK; PERT	Project management research is characterized by dominance of determinism, decision-theoretic approaches, and weak theories. The growth of research interest in non-deterministic paradigms through the lenses of complexity and uncertainty is recent, and could provide stronger theoretic explanations. However, analysis of select project management literature reveals that the constructs of complexity and uncertainty are yet to be grounded in terms of definitions and constituent variables. We argue that definitional clarity is necessary for the non-deterministic research to move forward. In this paper, we propose taxonomy of constituent terms of complexity and uncertainty based on semantic analysis of select literature and show that the two constructs are broadly confounded in their constituent terms. While our finding may appear to align with complexity theoretic concept of strong interrelationship between complexity and uncertainty, we argue that such confounding represents intermingling of varying ontological and epistemological preferences within the community of project management scholars rather than a broad adherence to the complexity theory. The paper contributes to project management literature by facilitating further research toward stronger construct definitions and theory building efforts. The paper also contributes to research methods by offering a novel methodology to elicit taxonomy of terms and to illuminate the confounding and separating terms across multiple constructs.

Towards a sustainability assessment model for affordable housing projects: the perspective of professionals in Ghana	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Affordable housing; Low-cost housing; Public housing; Sustainable housing; Criteria; Success Index; Assessment criteria; Indicators	SUCCESS CRITERIA; ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; SYSTEMS; SATISFACTION; BARRIERS; RANKING; NEEDS	Purpose This paper presents a sustainability assessment model to holistically guide sustainable construction and green retrofitting of affordable housing from the Ghanaian perspective. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive review was carried out, which yielded 16 sustainability indicators. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted among respondents in the Ghanaian housing sector. Forty-seven valid responses were received and analysed using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique. Findings A four-index model was developed that includes: Housing and Transportation (H + T) index, household-satisfaction index, efficient stakeholder-management index and quality-related index. These indices account for 25.3%, 26.3%, 23.6% and 24.9% of sustainability attainment in affordable housing, respectively. Accordingly, household-satisfaction has the greatest contribution to sustainability attainment in affordable housing. Research limitations/implications Due to challenges in obtaining responses to the questionnaire, the study was conducted with relatively small number of responses. Originality/value The model serves as a tool that could be used to objectively and comprehensively assess sustainability performance in affordable housing. Besides, it could be used as a baseline to calibrate future projects and for benchmarking success levels of comparable housing projects. Finally, the estimated indices are applicable in decision making for optimum resource allocation for sustainable low-cost housing in the Ghanaian perspective.

A recent video-based motion magnification method was developed to measure and visualize small structure motions. This new approach presents a potential for low-cost vibration measurement and mode shape identification. Pilot studies using this approach on simple rigid body structures were reported. Its validity on complex outdoor structures has not been investigated. In this study, a non-contact video-based approach for multi-point vibration measurement and mode magnification is introduced. The proposed approach can output a full-field vibration map that increases the efficiency of the current structural health monitoring (SHM) practice. The multi-point approach is developed based on the local phases which also fill the gap of the existing intensity-based multi-point vibration measurement. As an extension of the phase-based motion magnification, the multi-point measurement result is then integrated with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the magnified frequency bands at each identified structure mode for operational deflection shape (ODS) visualization. This proposed method was tested in both indoor and outdoor environments for validation. The results show that using the developed method, mode frequencies and mode shapes of multiple points in complex structures can be simultaneously measured. And vibrations in each mode can be visualized separately after magnification.

Decisions made by project managers have a significant impact on the strategic value of the asset delivered, and those decisions depend on the information feed on which they are based. This study uses theories of organizational behavior, decision-making and program management to investigate the impact of information feed used by project managers on the strategic value delivered by mega projects in the oil and gas industry. A global survey of 69 managers of mega-projects was conducted. Results showed that information feed to project managers significantly influences the strategic value created by megaprojects. Also some moderating effects of contextual factors on this relationship were found. The contextual factors that influenced project manager decision-making relate to what they perceived to be Senior Management drivers for their projects. However the hypothesized moderating influence of project manager experience on decision-making was not found-an interesting observation. It was found that the extent to which project managers feel in control should influence the scope and quality of information-feed that should be sought. Four risk areas were observed as significant to long-term value creation from megaprojects: government relations; host community relations; contract management and procurement; and the influence of multi-location execution.

J	AUGENBROE, G				AUGENBROE, G			INTEGRATED BUILDING DESIGN SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT OF PRODUCT DATA TECHNOLOGY	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Current issues in product data technology (PDT) concern integrated product and process modeling of industrial enterprises, the basic ingredients for arriving at Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). The modeling process is driven by choices on the required granularity, which are, for example, dictated by the size of the CIM modules in the system architecture. These CIM developments emphasize equally the improving of the functionality and efficiency of certain enterprise tasks by new CIM modules and interfacing the CIM modules in an integrated framework. The main goal in the latter is to remove the data disorder that exists among the set of tools that a company puts to use for different functions in the process of designing, manufacturing, and shipping a product. These are the main goals of present PDT, which is predominantly data-driven. It is thus that a coarse-grain data view of the interacting modules drives the CIM approach. One of the consequences is that fine-grained semantics remain ''hidden'' inside CIM modules as there is little or no need to ''externalize'' them for exchange with other CIM modules. It is tempting to regard the development of design tools in an integrated building design system as a standard PDT exercise. The nature of design tasks and their granularity is, however, such that this approach eventually fails. The European Community-funded COMBINE project aims at providing the next generation of integrated building design systems by building on present PDT. In doing so, choices on granularity and levels of integration are a constant concern.		AUGENBROE, G (corresponding author), TECH UNIV DELFT,FAC CIVL ENGN,POB 5048,2600 GA DELFT,NETHERLANDS.

Acknowledging the diverse and sometimes conflicting interests of the stakeholders, decision makers must identify a viable scheme that could satisfy public accountability, commercial interests, and social consideration of the government, investor, and community, respectively. However, because each decision item could have several possible values or states, it is difficult for decision makers to come up with different PPP schemes by adopting the conventional analytical methods. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian network (BN) techniques to imitate human reasoning and conduct multiobjective decision making. By establishing a decision network that connects the decision items, evaluating criteria, and the ultimate objectives (i.e.,the satisfaction of the three main stakeholders), evaluation can be conducted through the BN and the noisy-OR gate concepts. A weighted score approach is applied to combine the objectives of the three stakeholders into a single value. This enables decision makers to evaluate and compare different PPP alternatives and identify a suitable strategy that could minimize the conflict, thereby ultimately increasing the chance of success of a PPP scheme.

Targeting household energy-efficiency measures using sensitivity analysis	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; carbon model; carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; domestic; energy efficiency; energy model; housing	UK HOUSING STOCK	The Community Domestic Energy Model (CDEM) has been developed to explore potential routes to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the model is used to predict the CO2 emissions of the existing English housing stock. The average dwelling CO2 emissions are estimated as 5827 kgCO(2) per year, of which space heating accounts for 53%, water heating for 20%, cooking for 5%, and lights and appliance for 22%. Local sensitivity analysis is undertaken for dwellings of different age and type to investigate the effect on predicted emissions of uncertainty in the model's inputs. High normalized sensitivity coefficients were calculated for parameters that affect the space heating energy use. The effects of the input uncertainties were linear and superposable, so the impact of multiple uncertainties could be easily determined. The results show that the accumulated impact on national CO2 emissions of the underperformance of energy-efficiency measures could be very large. Quality control of the complete energy system in new and refurbished dwellings is essential if national CO2 targets are to be met. Quality control needs to prioritize detached dwellings because their emissions are both the greatest and the most sensitive to all energy-efficiency measures. The work demonstrates that the uncertainty in the predictions of stock models can be large; a failure to acknowledge this can lead to a false sense of their reliability.	[Firth, S. K.; Lomas, K.

These global multifirm settings have caught attention due to tensions arising from simultaneous collaboration and competition among firms as well as due to the increasing geographical complexity of the standardization process. SSOs present one form of a multifirm environment, where companies proactively and voluntarily collaborate to develop a new standard. Although a growing body of literature has tried to understand firms' underlying rationales for engaging in SSOs, we know little about firm-level characteristics influencing the propensity to enter a standard-setting organization. For this purpose, data of the Community Innovation Survey 2011 for Germany are merged with data of companies' participation at technical committees of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) between 2010 and 2013. Using these unique data, we can observe the moment when firms enter a technical committee of a formal SSO and, hence, tackle the problem of simultaneity. Our results show that the likelihood to enter a technical committee of an SSO increases for firms that introduce new products or services into the market, while absorptive capacity does not have a significant positive influence. Finally, the protection of innovations by patents further enhances the likelihood to enter a technical committee of an SSO.

Although this issue has received significant attention from researchers, less attention has been given to quantifying the impact of skilled labor availability on project performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by filling a gap in the existing literature by quantitatively modeling and elucidating the influence of skilled labor availability on construction project cost performance. Data from 97 construction projects completed in the United States and Canada were collected from two industry databases. The primary analysis shows that projects that experienced craft shortages underwent significantly higher growth in cost overruns compared with projects that did not. Further analysis on both databases returned two robust multiple regression models that demonstrate similar patterns of the risk that a skilled labor shortage poses to cost performance. By using data-combining techniques, two data sets were combined to obtain more reliable informative models. The primary benefit of this risk estimation is to enable project management teams to determine whether mitigation strategies are warranted to prevent potential shortfalls in project cost performance. Understanding the level of impact that craft shortages have on project performance can serve as a primary step in developing motivation for industry leaders, communities, and construction stakeholders to address the challenge of skilled labor shortage in construction industry.

A Structural Equation Model of Feasibility Evaluation and Project Success for Public-Private Partnerships in Hong Kong	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Critical success factors (CSFs); public-private partnerships (PPP); structural equation modeling (SEM)	FIT	A successful public-private partnership (PPP) scheme can be described as one that can lead to the delivery of high-quality end products and/or services, which can satisfy the needs of the community, achieve the intended targets/goals of the government, as well as provide a favorable financial return for the private sector involved with the project. This study aims to establish an evaluation framework for the initial feasibility evaluation of a PPP project that would satisfy all the stakeholders. The factors for evaluating the feasibility of PPP projects can be classified into five broad categories: technical; financial and economic; social; political and legal; and others. Through the structural equation modeling approach, data attained from a questionnaire survey conducted in Hong Kong was analyzed and a model was developed to examine the relationships between different evaluation factors and the overall satisfaction of stakeholders. The results indicate that technical and social aspects are critical to the feasibility of PPP projects, and therefore, are the determining factors for success. This paper should assist relevant stakeholders to improve their understanding on the relative importance of the evaluation factors, and help to establish a comprehensive framework for decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of PPP projects. The predictors for PPP project success were also determined to enrich the knowledge base and help formulate management strategies to better implement the PPP project delivery approach.	[Ng, S.

J	Marnewick, C				Marnewick, Carl			Information system project's sustainability capabality levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Information systems; Capability; South Africa; Exploratory factor analysis	IMPACT	Sustainability has been a major topic of discussion over the last couple of years. Project management is also a discipline that is starting to focus on sustainability, but the focus is more on the environmental aspect of the project itself. Information systems (IS) projects do not have such a major impact on the environment as construction and engineering projects do. There is currently little or no knowledge about sustainability within the IS domain and whether sustainability is incorporated. A structured questionnaire was adapted based on previous studies and circulated to the project management community. A total of 1099 responses were received. The responses covered all industries and for the purpose of this article, 387 IS projects (35.2% of the total projects) were analysed. The objective of the study was to determine the level of capability regarding sustainability. Determining sustainability project management capability provides insight into how project managers as well as organisations are incorporating sustainability. The analysis indicates that the focus is on the economic dimension of sustainability. The results also highlight the complete lack of integrating social and environmental sustainability into project management. The research highlights that sustainability in business or IS projects is not being considered. The second contribution is more of a philosophical nature. Exploratory factor analysis indicates that there should be five dimensions when it comes to IS project management instead of the usual three. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Empirical comparison of critical success factors for public-private partnerships in developing and developed countries A case of Ghana and Hong Kong	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Critical success factors; Ghana; Public-private partnership; Developing countries; Developed countries	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; TRANSPORT PROJECTS; PPP PROJECTS; AUSTRALIA; BOT; IMPLEMENTATION; EFFICIENCY; DELIVERY; OPERATE; CHINA	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the similarities and differences of critical success factors (CSFs) for public-private partnership (PPP) projects in developing and developed countries, using Ghana and Hong Kong as examples. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical questionnaire survey was conducted with experienced PPP practitioners in Ghana and Hong Kong. Survey responses were analysed using Kendall's concordance analysis, mean score ranking, quartile groupings analysis and Mann-Whitney U test. Findings - The results indicate that a favourable legal and regulatory framework is very critical in both jurisdictions. Further, technology transfer, technological innovation, public/community participation and coordination and government providing financial support are of low importance in both jurisdictions. The non-parametric test shows that 16 CSFs are of different importance in Ghana and Hong Kong. Specifically, CSFs related to the socio-political and economic conditions of PPP projects are very critical in Ghana, whereas CSFs directly related to the organisation and relationship of PPP projects are very critical in Hong Kong. Originality/value - The outputs of this study add to the international best practice framework for successful PPP implementation. Further, international private investors and governments who are yet to adopt the PPP concept would be considerably informed of the investment strategies to employ when engaging in PPP arrangements.

Findings - The study found out that the levels of success of projects were perceived high among the project teams. The results indicated that monitoring CSF, coordination CSF, design CSF, training CSF, and institutional environment CSF had a significant relationship with project success. However, results of the regression analysis indicated that only monitoring CSF was significant in influencing project success. Research limitations/implications - The limited sample size and optimism bias of respondents were a constraint. Furthermore, further analysis of data may be required to advance analysis. Originality/value - The study looks through the lens of project implementation teams in order to provide insights from their vantage point. The study provides insights based on the Maldivian context which will benefit similar island nation communities implementing similar projects.	[Yamin, Mohamed; Sim, Adriel K.

Design/methodology/approach A critical literature review was adopted, to gather the current knowledge surrounding SV from mainstream management sciences, construction management and lean literature. A total of 70 studies were critically reviewed. Findings The study establishes that the current level of awareness on SV is still low and there is a dearth of scholarly publications on SV especially in the construction management literature. The investigation reveals the potentials of lean approach in supporting the delivery of SV on construction projects. Social implications - This study conceptualises the community and the physical environment around where the construction project is executed as customers using lean production approach. It shows that the transformation, flow and value view supports smooth workflow, which enhances the achievement of SV objectives. This creates a new insight into how SV can be realised in construction project delivery. Originality/value This study extends the on-going debate around the need for SV in construction project delivery and contributes to construction management and lean construction literature on SV. Future studies could build on this to obtain empirical data and develop an approach/method that would support the evidencing of SV delivery on construction projects.

J	Garvin, MJ				Garvin, MJ			Strategic characterization of water system infrastructure and management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						infrastructure; water supply; subsidies; financial; water policy; water management	BENCHMARKING	The capital needs of America's water systems have received substantial, recent attention within engineering and public policy circles. Various groups contend that national water systems face a multibillion dollar annual funding gap and advocate for a considerable federal role in supplying the necessary capital to fulfill anticipated requirements. Opposition groups contest these assertions, arguing that federal subsidies will reduce the incentive for the industry to develop lasting solutions. The industry's path forward remains unsettled as this debate continues. Missing from these discussions, however, is objective evidence concerning the state of the industry. Accordingly, this paper presents a rational methodology to characterize community water systems to provide a basis for (1) understanding the state of systems within the national portfolio; and (2) guiding strategic assessment and policy development. Common indicators are deployed that rely upon widely available operating and financial data and make use of thresholds that serve as estimates of industrywide averages. The developed methodology was applied to a national cross section of large water systems. The evidence indicates that large systems are adequately positioned to handle near-term capital challenges, so a substantial federal role is unnecessary. In addition, alternatives that might improve national water provision remain largely untested, so strategies that support the exploration of these approaches are recommended. The work presented is a key step toward normalizing an industry that is decentralized and locally managed.

The success of OSS projects is highly dependent on a number of factors. These factors must be understood and managed as an OSS project progresses. Thus, project management of an OSS project has a decisive role in ensuring the success of its software. The objective of the research is to increase the understanding of the resources affecting the competitiveness of OSS projects. Herewith, the responsiveness of OSS projects to users' needs is assessed via an investigation of the defect-fixing process. A Resource-Based View of the firm (RBV) is used to build theoretical justifications for a set of hypotheses proposed in this study. Data gathered from 427 OSS projects confirmed that developers' interest in and users' contribution to the project as well as frequently updating and releasing the software affect the project's ability to gain competitive advantage through effective defect-fixing. It is also shown that OSS projects that are more popular and have a higher level of organizational communication than others are more likely to gain competitive advantage through effective defect-fixing. Finally, implications of the results for practitioners and the research community are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Design Structure Matrix Implementation on a Seismic Retrofit	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Big room; Dependence; Design; Design structure matrix; DSM; Design theory methodology; Structural engineering	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	A void exists in development of design theory methodology within the structural engineering community. This void hampers efforts to resolve performance deficiencies including cost over-runs, unplanned rework, and suboptimal design. In manufacturing, product design and production improvements have resulted from implementation of the design structure matrix (DSM) methodology. DSM offers a means to represent, analyze, and decompose complex systems in order to improve their performance. DSM use within the architecture engineering construction (AEC) industry has been sporadic and focused primarily in the U.K. Where applied, DSM has proven effective at helping AEC design teams streamline processes to address nonlinearity (nonsequential information flows) introduced by iteration and complexity in design. When a DSM reveals iteration and highly dependent work, group brainstorming, collocated design sessions, rapid feedback, set-based design, and collaborative design aids can be used to increase overall team effectiveness. This paper examines a case study where DSM-based planning software was used on a seismic retrofit project to drive process improvement in design management. DSM correctly identified iterative activities central to design and provided the following; (1) a common vocabulary to discuss rework in the context of a multidisciplinary design team; (2) a rational method to schedule team collocation and brainstorming efforts to maximize their benefit; and (3) a means to consider iterative activities (and associated hand-offs) in design work structuring.

J	Nezamdoost, A; Van Den Wymelenberg, K; Mahic, A				Nezamdoost, Amir; Van Den Wymelenberg, Kevin; Mahic, Alen			Assessing the energy and daylighting impacts of human behavior with window shades, a life-cycle comparison of manual and automated blinds	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Manual blind use; Automated blind operation; LM-83; Lightswitch; Blindswitch; Spatial daylight autonomy; Annual sunlight exposure; Life-cycle analysis	LIGHTING CONTROL; PERFORMANCE; OFFICE; BUILDINGS; SIMULATIONS; PATTERNS	Manual and automated blind controls are typically not included in energy and daylight simulation in part because there is no consensus in the research or practice communities about the way users operate manual blinds or override automated blinds. In order for blind use patterns to become part of energy and daylight simulation best practices, the range of annual energy and daylighting impacts associated with blind use must be understood. This paper addresses these aspects by comparing four leading candidates of manually-controlled blinds plus two automated blind control algorithms using a high-rise office building located in Boise, ID. This study revealed that all four current "manual" blind use algorithm choices perform relatively similarly to automated systems, and surprisingly sometimes even more efficiently. LM-83 currently has the lowest average occlusion during regularly occupied hours, followed by Lightswitch-2002, while Blindswith-A and -B have the highest average occlusion. The IES-recommended manual blind algorithm resulted even in lower average blind occlusion and lighting energy consumption than automated systems. Finally, life-cycle cost analysis was calculated. The results show that the cost savings from interior automated shading system are substantial over a 30-year time horizon, when compared with common passive manual blinds ($25 versus $7.6 Net Present Value per SF glazing area).

R.; Liu, Shen-jung; Wu, Ji-wei			Proactive problem-solver for construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Knowledge management; Problem-solving; Knowledge map		Construction is an experience-based discipline. Knowledge or experience accumulated from previous projects plays a very important role in successful performance of new works. More and more construction organizations have adopted commercial Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) to develop their own Knowledge Management (KM) functionalities. Most of the existing KMSs adopt Communities of Practice (CoPs) for knowledge sharing and exchange. Such an approach is found on the reactive problem-solver (RPS); that is, the problem raised by the questioner in the CoP has to "wait" for the "solution knower" to respond (or reply). Previous research indicated that the RPS approach may suffer in poor time and cost effectiveness. This paper proposes a Proactive Problem-Solver (PPS) approach for the problems encountered in construction engineering and management. Unlike RPS, the PPS proactively solves the problem based on lessons learned from previous projects. Should the solution be not available; the PPS dispatches the problem to the most appropriate domain experts so that the problem can be tackled timely and efficiently. A case A/E consulting firm is selected for implementation of the proposed PPS to demonstrate its applicability. It is shown that the proposed PPS improves more than 89.5% of efficiency both for timeliness and cost-saving of problem-solving. The proposed PPS demonstrates great potentials for improvement of emergent problem solving and enhancement of market competitiveness of a construction organization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shipworth, D				Shipworth, David			Forum - The stern review: implications for construction	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						climate change; construction industry; discounting; ecological economics; ethics; governance; mitigation; public policy; Stern Review		The SternReview(2006) on the economics of climate change has changed the ground onwhich arguments over climate change are fought. In making the economic case for mitigation over adaptation, Stern has sought to undermine one of the primary arguments against decisive early action - that the immediate costs outweigh the long-term benefits. While this argument is made at the global level, it is appropriate to ask what implications Stern's arguments might have at the construction sectoral level. The implications of the Stern Review for construction can be divided into three main questions. How construction would be different if Stern's economics were applied? How would construction companies act differently if Stern's ethics were adopted? How will the political response to the Stern Review change construction's policy and regulatory landscape? The impact of the Review has shifted the debate from the natural science community into the public policy domain and onto an economic rationale. There seems to have been a pronounced shift away from the debate over the science and towards the economics of mitigation versus adaptation. In this context, the academic debate over Stern's methods is irrelevant - it is his findings, authority and use of the hegemonic power of economic argument that carry the day. This is likely to be Stern's true legacy, and through this will come his greatest impact on construction.

Numerous time-cost trade-off approaches, such as mathematical, metaheuristic, and evolutionary methods, have been extensively studied in the construction community. Currently, the scheduling of a repetitive project is conducted using the traditional precedence diagramming method (PDM), which has two fundamental limitations: (1) progress is assumed to be linear from start to finish; and (2) activities in the schedule are connected each other only at the end points. This paper proposes a scheduling method that allows the use of continuous precedence relationships and piece-wise linear and nonlinear activity-time-production functions that are described by the use of singularity functions. This work further develops an adaptive multiple objective symbiotic organisms search (AMOSOS) algorithm that modifies benefit factors in the basic SOS to balance exploration and exploitation processes. Two case studies of its application are analyzed to validate the scheduling method, as well as to demonstrate the capabilities of AMOSOS in generating solutions that optimally trade-off minimizing project time with minimizing the cost of non-unit repetitive projects. The results thus obtained indicate that the proposed model is feasible and effective relative to the basic SOS algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms.

J	El Hajj, C; Montes, GM; Jawad, D				El Hajj, Claudette; Martinez Montes, German; Jawad, Dima			An overview of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa developing countries	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modeling; BIM; Barriers; Limitations; Construction industry	INNOVATION; IMPLEMENTATION	Purpose In an attempt to attain a better understanding of the research work on building information modeling (BIM) adoption, this study aims to examine the criticality of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) developing countries from the lens of the sociotechnical theory. Further, the study investigates the differences in the perceptions of various constructions players (owners, contractors and designers) to BIM barriers, as well as possible discrepancies in the perception of BIM users and non-BIM users to the significance of the perceived constraints. Design/methodology/approach To reach this aim, the study starts with a systematic evaluation and a critical review of the literature on BIM barriers. A set of 22 BIM adoption limitations was drawn from the literature which was used to design the survey. To capture a broad perception, a mixed approach was used, and data were collected through an interview study and a survey involving Architecture, Engineering and Construction professionals in the MENA construction sector. The collected data were analyzed using the mean score, standard deviation and nonparametric tests. The further principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the barriers to uncover the latent factors of BIM barriers. Findings The actors ranked the barriers as follows: lack of knowledge and BIM awareness, commercial issues and investment cost, lack of skills and BIM specialist, interoperability and lack of client demand. The examination of the PCA resulted in four underlying BIM limitation factors namely: human, technological, structural and financial. The analysis of the ranking indicated that 16 of the 22 barriers are considered critical in the MENA area. The results of the Mann-Whitney test indicated that there is a statistically significant difference in perceptions of BIM users and nonuser for seven barriers, pointing out that users care most about the financial barriers; however, nonusers are mostly concerned with structural and technological barriers. However, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there is no statistically significant difference in the perceptions of the three categories of stakeholders in ranking all BIM barriers. Practical implications The outcomes will back policymakers and construction participants with the knowledge to develop policy propositions that can positively affect BIM adoption in the construction industry. The significance of this study lies in being one of the very first explorative investigations that comparatively and empirically explored BIM adoption barriers across the whole MENA developing countries. Originality/value While several research studies have examined BIM adoption barriers in various countries, none to the best of the authors' knowledge have attempted to study the whole MENA region as one entity, and none highlighted the impact of user's roles on their perception of adoption barriers within their community. The results contribute to the discussion of the relationship among practitioners' level of involvement in BIM projects and their perception of adoption barriers which is underrepresented in extant studies. The above can assist with prioritizing the barriers that are considered to be more significant given the characteristics of the community under study. The result revealed the value of the structural and human attributes in prioritizing BIM adoption barriers within the MENA construction industry.

The perception of property as a commodity is changing to emphasize building characteristics and performance as major determinants of a property's worth and market value, thereby requiring new ways of assessing worth and value. Commercial property valuation represents a major mechanism that could allow environmental and social considerations to be more closely aligned with economic return. In particular, the rationale and initial considerations are explored for the incorporation of environmental and social issues into valuation theory and practice. A system that allows for the description, measurement and assessment of various aspects of building performance is conceptualized. Possible sustainability key performance indicators are identified and the basic principles for assessing performance along the life cycle of buildings are explained. It is argued that the environmental and building research community has a central role in determining a standardization of terminology and improving the exchange of ideas between financial and environmental research disciplines. Then, the simultaneous consideration of economic, environmental and social issues can provide a more profound knowledge about property characteristics and associated performance. This will create a more robust assessment approach and lead to greater reliability of assessment results. Finally, the opportunities afforded by the synergies between sustainable design and risk management are identified and implications for property risk assessment for lending and insurance purposes are highlighted.

Data relating to the significance of each factor were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 151 respondents. A total number of 126 valid responses were retrieved. Reductionist methodology was used to identify the statistical significance of each delay causation. Findings All 73 variables analysed in the study are significant, including communication issues amongst stakeholders, inadequate planning, safety issues, deficient technical instructions and inappropriate management approaches. Others include design and construction issues, issues with project organisational structures, political and cultural factors, environmental uncertainties and complexity in resource management. The study also found estimation errors, owner's attitude, financial issues, delay in approval processes, construction strategies and unavailability of appropriate technologies for the work as influencing factors. These findings are consistent with earlier studies on other forms of projects, but they further confirm that they are very relevant to marine projects. Originality/value Determining delay factors specific to marine construction projects assists stakeholders and project management community in developing dedicated strategies applicable in scheduling to prevent and correct obstructions caused by overruns. Since projects are different in types and sizes, delay observations cannot be generalised.

The impact of contractors' attributes on construction project success: A post construction evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; Contractor selection; Project performance	SELECTION CRITERIA	The success of construction projects is a fundamental issue for most governments, users and communities. In the literature that deals with construction project success and causes of time and cost overruns in the construction industry, there is some literature that highlights the role of the contractors in project success. While most studies rank contractors' success attribute from tendering, prequalification, and a long term historical perception perspective, this paper aims to study the impact of contractors' attributes on project success from a post construction evaluation perspective to identify what critical success factors (CSFs) that greatly impact the success of project. In an attempt to understand and investigate this impact, a questionnaire survey is used to establish construction professionals' perception of CSFs of contractors that greatly impact on the success of construction projects. Factor analysis reveals nine underlying clusters namely :(i) safety and quality; (ii) past performance; (iii) environment; (iv) management and technical aspects; (v) resource; (vi) organisation; (vii) experience; (viii) size/type of pervious projects; and (ix) finance. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models that predict the probability of project success. Factors such as turnover history, quality policy, adequacy of labour and plant resources, waste disposal, size of past projects completed, and company image are the most significant factors affecting projects success. Assuming that project success is repeatable, these findings provide clear understanding of contractors' performance and could potentially enhance existing knowledge of construction project success.

J	Walden, R; Lie, S				Walden, Roderick; Lie, Stefan			University-Industry Collaboration in Frugal Innovation Through Prototyping: The Case of a Firefighter Cooling Vest	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cooling; Technological innovation; Manufacturing; Australia; Business; Collaboration; Prototypes; Design for community services; frugal innovation; resource-constrained product design and innovation; university-based product design practice; university&#8211; industry collaboration (UIC)	TECHNOLOGY	The research presented here analyses the design and development of a firefighters cooling vest for rural Australian volunteer bush firefighting services. Bush firefighting is hazardous work due to extreme heat stress experienced by firefighters. Cooling vests therefore form a critical part in reducing the core body temperature of firefighters on duty. Given that volunteer fire fighting services have minimal funding for either the purchase of existing cooling vests or for R&D of new affordable cooling vests; resources for the project are particularly constrained. Reflective analysis of the case study against some of the key features of frugal innovation identifies that management of priority and constraint as well as prototyping during design development may be useful in achieving a good university-industry collaboration (UIC) for manufacturing small-medium enterprises (SMEs). An existing integrated parameter model is utilized to reflect the way priority and constraint is managed in conjunction with prototyping and has been adapted using frugal innovation objectives to conceptualize the case analysis. Analysis of the case, by referencing the literature on frugal innovation and ways of managing UIC projects for new product development, uncovers a complementary relationship between the two practices. The adapted version of the integrated parameter model presented can provide a reference guide for other UIC product design projects for SMEs operating within the constraints of frugal innovation, incorporating prototyping as the central method of research.

Automated Modal Parameter Estimation by Parallel Processing within Wireless Monitoring Systems	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Automation; Estimation; Monitoring; Data collection; Sensors; Structural engineering; Modal analysis	IDENTIFICATION; DAMAGE	With recent advances in low-cost wireless sensing and data acquisition technology, it has become feasible to instrument a large structure with a dense array of wireless sensors. Furthermore, analog-to-digital conversion and data processing capabilities of current wireless sensor prototypes offer the ability to efficiently distribute data processing tasks across a large network of wireless sensing nodes. For decades, the structural engineering community has been adapting input-output modal identification techniques for use in large-scale civil structures. However, unlike in mechanical or aerospace engineering, it is often difficult to excite a large civil structure in a controlled manner. Thus, additional emphasis has been placed on developing a number of output-only modal identification methods for use in structural engineering applications. In this paper, three of these output-only methods (peak picking, random decrement, and frequency domain decomposition) are modified for implementation in a distributed array of processors embedded within a network of wireless sensor prototypes. The software architecture proposed emphasizes parallel data processing and minimal communication so as to ensure scalability and power efficiency. Using the balcony of a historic theater in metropolitan Detroit as a testbed, this network of wireless sensors is allowed to collect and process acceleration response data during a set of vibration tests. The embedded algorithms proposed in this study are used to autonomously determine the balcony's modal properties with network-derived results found to be comparable to those derived from traditional offline techniques.

J	Smith, BL				Smith, BL			Software development cost estimation for infrastructure systems	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						computer software; cost estimates; infrastructure	NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL	Modem infrastructure systems, ranging from transportation to water and sewer systems, are becoming increasingly dependent on software. The role it plays in these systems is primarily to integrate and manage elements that support system operations. In other words, software has transformed what were previously considered to be largely static systems to active, dynamic systems. In general, infrastructure system software is characterized by an emphasis on the following core functions: (1) sensor management; (2) data analysis; (3) data management; and (4) equipment control interfaces. As the nature of infrastructure systems changes, the tools available to support their design and management must change as well. The construction engineering community has developed sound techniques and resources to support the estimation of costs for physical construction of infrastructure systems. However, such tools are not readily available to support the cost estimation of the software component of infrastructure system development and construction. In this research effort, a widely used software engineering cost-estimation technique, the construction cost model (COCOMO), was examined to determine if it is effective for infrastructure system application. This examination included a sample application of COCOMO to an infrastructure system software project and a critical analysis of the technique itself. The examination revealed that COCOMO is extremely sensitive to small variations in an estimator's judgment, and that the foundation of the COCOMO model is poorly suited for infrastructure system application. As a result, it is recommended that a research and development program be initiated to create specific tools to support the cost estimation of infrastructure system software development.

A challenge existed in providing accommodations within the Swedish built environment, in contrast to other housing solutions such as geographically distinct refugee camps. Regulations are one method of maintaining consistent standards of buildings, but they are effective only if they are enforced. During uncertainty, compliance decisions can be based on cognitive understanding (cognitive legitimacy). Otherwise, deterrence-based regulation is rooted in direct consequences (pragmatic legitimacy), and responsive regulation relies on normative motivation (moral legitimacy) for compliance. This study explored the normative aspect of regulatory enforcement through inspections. In 2017, 34 semistructured interviews were conducted with individuals involved with providing temporary accommodations in Sweden during 2015-2016. From these, six interviews with employees of regulatory enforcement agencies were qualitatively analyzed to discover how regulators legitimized. Findings show that regulators justified their inspections predominantly based on what is considered as a socially acceptable approach (procedural legitimacy) and what is understandable based on their personal experience (comprehensibility legitimacy). This study provides practical insight to regulators regarding the benefits for using responsive regulation during institutional responses to mass population displacement in urban communities. Findings will assist in ensuring that the quality of buildings is consistent for the general population and reduces variation in the safety provided by buildings. Additionally, this analysis contributes to the literature addressing mass population displacement and provides new knowledge of organizational legitimacy in technical applications.

Design/methodology/approach - An inductive and interpretivist methodological approach is adopted that utilises a mixed methods systematic review to map bibliometric data on the POE, associated underpinning processes and benchmarking facilities. Publication and citation metrics are produced via the software VOS-viewer to determine the extent to which POE interrelates with other fields of study (namely, digital technologies and FM). Findings - The BOK accrued illustrates that whilst POE has received comparatively scant academic attention in comparison to other fields of study, interest in the area is growing. The work also identifies that a stronger community of practice (CoP) is needed (that comprises of academics and practitioners) to ensure that a consistent approach to POE implementation is developed and that the barriers to POE implementation are addressed. Originality/value - Findings presented accentuate the need for design practitioners to reverse engineer POE implementation to inform future design vis-a-vis simply reporting upon an existing building's performance post construction. Other new theories are also introduced as a means of engendering wider academic discourse in this field of science.	[Roberts, C.

Forecasting Engineering News-Record Construction Cost Index Using Multivariate Time Series Models	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction costs; Forecasting; Bids; Construction industry; Construction cost; Forecasting; Multivariate time series; Quantitative methods	COINTEGRATION	The construction cost index (CCI), which has been published monthly in the United States by Engineering News-Record (ENR), is subject to significant variations. These variations are problematic for cost estimation, bid preparation, and investment planning. The accurate prediction of CCI can be invaluable for cost estimation and budgeting of capital projects, and can result in accurate bids. The research objective of this paper is to create appropriate multivariate time series models for forecasting CCI based on a group of explanatory variables that are identified by using Granger causality tests. The results of cointegration tests recommend vector error correction (VEC) models as the proper type of multivariate time series models to forecast CCI. Several VEC models are created and compared with existing univariate time series models for forecasting CCI. It is shown that the CCI predicted by these VEC models is more accurate than that predicted by the previously proposed univariate models (i.e.,seasonal autoregressive integrated mean-average and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing). The comparisons are based on two typical error measures: mean absolute prediction error and mean squared error. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the creation of multivariate time series models that are more accurate than the current univariate time series models for forecasting CCI. It is expected that this work will contribute to the construction engineering and management community by helping cost engineers and capital planners prepare more accurate bids, cost estimates, and budgets for capital projects.

Technical rationality theory is critical to this relationship; although it has been criticised in extant studies for its inability to define soft issues that associate with real-world scenarios. Strategy-led approach is an alternative to technical rationality. Normative studies have acknowledged the ability of strategy-led approach to project implementation as though it facilitates reflective interaction with problem-solving. This study targeted 154 organizations that won practice excellence awards of the New Zealand Institute of Building's (NZIOB) between 2001 and 2014. The awards are given to construction firms, adjudged through a rigorous competitive process as the most outstanding in the successful completion of high-profile projects in New Zealand. 40 valid responses from construction managers who completed projects that won NZIOB's practice excellence awards were analysed to evaluate the impact of strategies on project objectives. In addition, 35 critical success factors explored from literature were considered for statistical analysis. Findings from regression analyses show project strategies impacted 13 critical success factors that significantly shaped cost, time and quality outcomes of award winners' projects. Negative impact of critical success factors was reported also. The study concludes that construction managers rely on project strategies as projects became increasingly challenging; the systems approach developed from such success-driven practices will benefit both the research and practice communities as they seek ways to optimise project success.

J	Loosemore, M; Lim, BTH				Loosemore, Martin; Lim, Benson Teck Heng			Linking corporate social responsibility and organizational performance in the construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; perceptions; business performance; strategy; stakeholders	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; DISCOURSE; CITIZENSHIP	In the construction industry, the subject of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming increasingly important as communities, employees and socially conscious clients expect firms to demonstrate they are good corporate citizens. However, while CSR research in construction has accelerated in recent years, it remains fragmented and unconceptualized and there is little understanding of the relationship between CSR and organizational performance, the types of CSR strategies employed and the strategic motivations behind them. To address this deficiency in current CSR knowledge and drawing upon contemporary CSR theory, a survey of 104 professionals from across the construction supply chain in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. The results show that CSR initiatives in the construction sector are integrative, isolated, narrowly focussed (mainly on environmental activities), immature, compliance-based and operational rather than strategic. The link between CSR and economic performance increasingly espoused (and assumed) in much of the CSR literature does not appear to be accepted in practice with the main benefits being seen as relational in building corporate loyalty, brand and engagement with both internal and external stakeholders. By empirically showing that CSR in construction takes place within an integrative conceptual framework, our findings highlight the potential value of theoretical concepts such as stakeholder salience in moving this field of research forward. These approaches recognize the power that stakeholders (both internal and external) have over a business and the need to manage those relationships carefully in order to secure a licence to operate.

Work sampling is a widely used method for this task, while suffers from low efficiency as only one worker is selected for each observation. Attentional selection asymmetry can also bias its uniform object selection assumption. Existing vision-based methods are primarily oriented towards recognizing single, separated activities involving few workers or equipment. In this paper, we introduce an activity recognition method, which receives surveillance videos as input and produces diverse and continuous activity labels of individual workers in the field of view. Convolutional networks are used to recognize activities, which are encoded in spatial and temporal streams. A new fusion strategy is developed to combine the recognition results of the two streams. The experimental results show that our activity recognition method has achieved an average accuracy of 80.5%, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art of activity recognition in the computer vision community, given the severe camera motion and low resolution of site surveillance videos and the marginal inter-class difference and significant infra-class variation of workers' activities. We also demonstrate that our method can underpin the implementation of efficient and objective work sampling. The training and test datasets of the study are publicly available.

J	Han, JY; Hovav, A				Han, JinYoung; Hovav, Anat			To bridge or to bond? Diverse social connections in an IS project team	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social capital; Bonding; Bridging; IS project team; Knowledge sharing; Project performance	WEAK TIES; KNOWLEDGE; TRUST; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; INTERDEPENDENCE; COMMUNICATION; COMMUNITIES; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT	Although research has shown that knowledge sharing among project team members is crucial for project performance, achieving knowledge sharing is still challenging. This problem is especially salient in IS project teams. Such teams are temporary organizations that may not progress through the necessary team formation cycle, yet are expected to produce intangible outcomes in a limited time. In this paper, we investigate how bonding and bridging social capital influence knowledge sharing and project performance. Bonding could facilitate cohesiveness within a team and lead a team to achieve project goals. Bridging could facilitate access to various beneficial resources beyond the boundary of a project team, increasing creativity and innovation. However, bridging is costly and can obstruct project performance. Our findings suggest that team members with high bonding social capital are more likely to share their knowledge with their team. Bonding and intention to share knowledge also positively affect project performance. Conversely, bridging social capital can contribute to project performance only through the mediating effect of bonding. This research contributes to theory by empirically examining the two types of social capital and their interdependence, as predictors of knowledge sharing and subsequently project performance. Project managers should form teams composed of members with diverse social connections and consider the balance between bonding and bridging within a team to control the potential disadvantageous effects of bridging social capital.

In real cases, the imprecise and uncertain information lead to decisions made based on vagueness. Fuzzy sets theory could help decision makers (DMs) to address incomplete information. However, this article develops a new integrated multi-criteria group decision-making model based on compromise solution and linear assignment approaches with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs). IVIFSs by presenting a membership and non-membership degree for each candidate based on appraisement criteria could decrease the vagueness of selection decisions. The proposed algorithm involves a new decision process under uncertain conditions to determine the importance of criteria and DMs, separately. In this regard, no subjective or additional information is needed for this process; only the input information required is an alternative assessment matrix. In this approach, weights of criteria and DMs are specified based on novel indexes to increase the reliability of obtained results. In this respect, the criteria' weights are computed regarding entropy concepts. The basis for calculating the weight of each DM is the distance between each DM and an average of the DMs' community. Furthermore, the linear assignment model is extended to rank the candidates. A case study about the construction project selection problem (CPSP) is illustrated to indicate the application of proposed model.

The current study focussed on assessing the level of thermal stress both in and outdoors towards finding measures to reduce overheating in spaces within the Savannah climatic region of Ghana through a four-stage approach. Design/methodology/approach - A four-stage approach has been used for the study; thus, a thermal comfort analysis based on physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), overheating assessment, a subjective thermal responses/evaluation of residents and a simulation effort to improve comfort. Findings - There was an indication of "moderate cold stress to slight cold stress" on the coolest day (28th December). On the warmest day (12th April), however, the indoor environment had exceedance and severity of overheating of at least 56% and 38-degree hours. The acceptable comfort range and comfort temperatures of occupants of buildings in the study area have been determined to be 25.5-33 degrees C by the thermal sensation survey. Meanwhile, the simulation showed that a 200% increase in thermal mass, exterior wall insulation and roof extension and insulation has the potential to generate a reduction of 18% in overheated hours. Originality/value - The paper unearths the flagrant disregard for thermal comfort in an attempt of "copying blindly" architecture from Southern Ghana by the affluent within the Savannah Region. Again, data provided prove that indeed human activities have worsened the plight of inhabitants through materials as well as construction methods.

Pursuing "Fit for Purpose": An Industry Practioner's Experience With Roadmapping	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tools; Organizations; Power industry; Standards organizations; Technological innovation; Data visualization; electric utility; government; maturity model; roadmapping; university-industry collaboration	TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; SECTOR	Since 2006, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Technology Innovation (TI) Office has applied roadmapping processes to help articulate the federal wholesale electric utility's technology research agenda. The TI Office team has evolved its tools, templates, and process steps considerably over the years in response to implementation challenges, shortcomings in deliverables derived from the process, and maturation opportunities enabled by data management and visualization software. Practioners within the TI Office have sustained their commitment to roadmapping during an era of significant evolution of the practice within industry and academia. The practice came out of product manufacturing environments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Increasingly since the early 2000s, roadmapping has been applied outside this "traditional" realm, requiring trial, iteration, and customization of processes, tools, and deliverables to meet different requirements. The TI Office's use of roadmapping is one "nontraditional" variant because the agency is not in the business of generating profits by creating products in response to market demands. Instead, the TI Office has used roadmapping to communicate the agency's technology research, development, and demonstration agenda to the broader community-national laboratories, universities, manufacturers, etc.-so these external organizations can respond with proposals delivering products with the desired technology characteristics. These products, in turn, enable BPA to continue to fulfill its public service mission as an electric utility and government entity in providing safe, cost-effective, and reliable electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

This study aims to explore indirect pathways that external stakeholders normally pursue to affect construction projects and to develop a framework of stakeholder-influencing pathways. The authors adopted abductive reasoning, using a preliminary framework. Based on the framework, four process-tracing case studies in the Vietnamese construction industry were conducted for data collection and analysis. Newspapers were the main source of data, complemented by interviews and other archive data, such as press releases, petitions, blog postings, and official documents. All cases confirmed the pathway through which stakeholders induce decision-makers to exert pressure related to a project. Also, some unanticipated results were found: first, two additional pathways, comprising two or three causally ordered mediators, can be employed to affect projects; second, stakeholders tend to use multiple influence pathways in which some actors, such as governmental authorities and the public, have a high rate of occurrence; and third, a mediator can be affected by more than one successor, whereas some mediators are capable of influencing various predecessors. Accordingly, the preliminary framework was revised to match the unanticipated results. This study explores a preliminary mechanism that transmits stakeholder influences to a project via multiple causally ordered actors. It is also the first comprehensive investigation into stakeholder influence pathways in the built environment. The findings can assist managers in stakeholder prioritization and anticipating their influences on projects.

J	Fiorillo, G; Ghosn, M				Fiorillo, Graziano; Ghosn, Michel			MPI Parallel Monte Carlo Framework for the Reliability Analysis of Highway Bridges	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Parallel computing; Nonlinear finite element; Structural reliability; Monte Carlo simulation; Kernel density; Latin hypercube sampling; Bridge overstress	GIRDER BRIDGES; SHEAR; LOAD; SOFTWARE; DESIGN; BEAMS; MODEL; CODE	Current emphasis on evaluating the resilience of civil communities to various natural and man-made hazards has required expanding the scale of structural analysis problems from performing deterministic analysis of isolated components to probabilistic analyses of large networks of interconnected structural systems and infrastructures. To control the enormous computational effort that the analysis of large-scale systems requires, researchers and engineers have often resorted to considerably simplifying the behavior of such systems. The drawback of the current approach is that extremely simplified models might not adequately predict the response of structures. Given the availability of more powerful computers at increasingly cheaper cost, it is now possible to create accurate models for large-scale systems and contain the computational requirements. As a consequence, probabilistic analyses of complex nonlinear models have now become possible. This paper describes a parametric object-oriented parallel message passing interface (MPI) framework for the structural reliability analysis of bridges for the effect of overweight traffic load. The framework consists of three modules that characterize bridge member capacities, develop bridge structural system models, and perform the reliability analysis using an efficient Monte Carlo strategy. The results of the analysis show that the hybrid approach considerably reduces the number of simulations when compared to a crude Monte Carlo simulation, running a full system reliability analysis in just few seconds and preserving good accuracy on the reliability index, on the order of 4-14%.

Despite predictions of more EWEs, little is known about the process by which hospital infrastructure resilience to such events can be built. Using Gunderson and Holling's Adaptive Cycle, a new theoretical perspective based on socio-ecological resilience theory is provided to understand this process. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, observations of disaster drills and disaster planning meetings, as well as additional documentary analysis of past incident reports. The research findings were then refined and validated in a focus group meeting with respondents. The findings indicate that there are significant organizational barriers which prevent facilities managers improving the resilience of hospital facilities to future EWEs. It was found that the disaster planning process is ad hoc and non-inclusive, focused on man-made disasters and compliance driven, top-down approach, under-resourced and is driven by a general ignorance of the importance of resilient-built facilities to health care delivery during an EWE. It is concluded that to produce more resilient hospital infrastructure, there needs to be a more well-resourced, integrated and collaborative approach to disaster management planning which enables health facilities managers to play a more central role in disaster planning decisions. There also need to be better systems, technologies and training implemented to manage information about health infrastructure performance before, during and after EWEs.

J	Ho, JY; O'Sullivan, E				Ho, Jae-Yun; O'Sullivan, Eoin			Toward Integrated Innovation Roadmapping: Lessons From Multiple Functional Roadmaps Beyond Technology R&D	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; Research and development; Stakeholders; Standards organizations; Organizations; Innovation management; knowledge management; research and development management; strategic planning; technology management	KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; POLICY; UK	Originally developed for strategic planning and foresight of technological development, roadmapping techniques are increasingly being used to support strategy development for other functional activities of innovation systems (e.g., the development of skills, infrastructure, and standards). While the conventional technology roadmaps focus on innovation pathways for technology development, considering other functions as contextual factors explored in less detail, the functional roadmaps dedicated to certain innovation functions (e.g., standardization) give these functions centrality and greater granularity within the roadmapping architecture. Because different functional roadmaps are developed by different communities of stakeholders with different interests, often using different languages, it is challenging to share information and manage knowledge between them. This can result in disconnected and misaligned strategies for complementary innovation efforts which, in turn, increase the potential risks of inefficient use of resources and missed opportunities to capture greater value from technology R&D. In order to address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of integrated innovation roadmapping, which is designed to support the systematic integration and alignment of multiple functional roadmaps. It does so by exploring recent efforts by multiorganizational networks to develop complementary roadmaps for diverse innovation functions beyond just technology R&D. By identifying challenges associated with their integration and practical steps to address them, the article provides guidance on how integrated innovation roadmapping processes can be structured and organized to ensure effective knowledge management and alignment among multiple functional roadmaps.

Building information modelling (BIM) and the CDM regulations interoperability framework	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Process; Building information modelling; Design management; Construction safety	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; LIFE-CYCLE; MANAGEMENT; SAFETY; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; INNOVATION; BENEFITS; ADOPTION; SUPPORT	Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) has received wide coverage within the research, academic and industry communities over the last decade. Yet, its degree of integration with various industry standards in the architecture, engineering and construction sector varies extensively. An exploratory research approach explores the interoperability between the construction design and management (CDM) regulations and BIM. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach The research design comprised: a methodical "state-of-the-art" review of extant literature - exploring some 19 variables emerging from the literature review; detailed content analyses of the current CDM regime (CDM 2015); and conducting a "test" to map and determine the degree of interoperability between BIM and CDM. The study develops several meta-matrices and a framework for BIM and CDM interoperability. Findings New insight reveals that BIM provides a systematic approach for the discharge of CDM obligations. The framework developed is easily transferable into BIM common data environments (CDEs) and offers an expeditious discharge of CDM obligations. Research limitations/implications - Some features of the developed BIM/CDM interoperability framework invite further tests to predicate the degree of discharge of CDM obligations.

Social Semantic Approach to Support Communication in AEC	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Semantic web; Social web; Publish/subscribe systems; Communication in AEC; Information and knowledge management; Ontology; Information systems; Knowledge-based systems	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	Communication systems in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry face many challenges. This paper proposes construction information and knowledge portal (CIKP), an information and knowledge-management system that utilizes three technologies to address the challenges in information exchange and knowledge sharing. First, a semantic web that is unlike typical data-exchange standards because ontologies present human knowledge in a machine-interpretable manner. This provides for more linguistic-friendly representation of tacit/subjective knowledge, which increases the level of human-friendliness of communication systems. Second, a social web, which links people (instead of documents) to create communities of practice (CoPs) and allows people to share, reconfigure, and generate knowledge. Finally, publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems, which provide for a push-pull scenario for information exchange. In the proposed system, any knowledge item (KI) (e.g., a document, website, and blog) will be represented (tagged) with a semantic vector that describes its contents. The developer of the KI can push (share) this to his or her social network. On the other end of the spectrum, system users can build semantic profiles for their areas of expertise and/or interests. The system can pull (find) the most relevant KIs and forward them to the user. The system can also link peers with similar or complementary interest to one another to establish virtual ad hoc teams. The system was evaluated through input from two focus groups. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000130. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Micro-renewal is a relatively people-oriented model of urban transformation compared with traditional renewal modes. To improve the theoretical system of neighborhood micro-renewal from a microcosmic perspective, a comprehensive analysis of neighborhood residents' cognition is needed. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibilities and methods of applying gene theory into the study of neighborhood micro-renewal. Design/methodology/approach According to the meme theory, the research explores the genetic analysis of neighborhood micro-renewal. The cross-over studies with "gene theory" from natural science to social science are analyzed and the neighborhood micro-renewal system was constructed from the perspective of micro-participants and micro-objects. Moreover, the concept of neighborhood "micro-renewal gene" was put forward. Finally, the authors show three application scenarios of public participation with a specific neighborhood micro-renewal project. Findings The cross research on urban studies with gene theory could be divided into three scales and four research fields. The characteristics of carrying out neighborhood micro-renewal in China could be summarized as micro-participants and micro-objects. Residents' cognition could be considered as "micro-renewal gene" in refer to meme theory. The application scenarios of introducing "micro-renewal gene" into the study of neighborhood renewal are of great potentialities. Originality/value Neighborhood micro-renewal system was constructed from the perspective of micro-participants and micro-objects. Moreover, neighborhood "micro-renewal gene" was proposed and applied into the study of this system in refer to meme theory.

J	De, S				De, Subhayan			Uncertainty Quantification of Locally Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Models are often given in terms of differential equations to represent physical systems. In the presence of uncertainty, accurate prediction of the behavior of these systems using the models requires understanding the effect of uncertainty in the response. In uncertainty quantification, statistics such as mean and variance of the response of these physical systems are sought. To estimate these statistics, sampling-based methods like Monte Carlo often require many evaluations of the models' governing differential equations for multiple realizations of the uncertainty. However, for large complex engineering systems, these methods become computationally burdensome as the solution of the models' governing differential equations for such systems is expensive. In structural engineering, an otherwise linear structure often contains spatially local nonlinearities with uncertainty present in them. A standard nonlinear solver for them with sampling-based methods for uncertainty quantification incurs significant computational cost for estimating the statistics of the response. To ease this computational burden of uncertainty quantification of large-scale locally nonlinear dynamical systems, a method is proposed herein that decomposes the response into two parts: response of a deterministic nominal linear system and a corrective term. This corrective term is the response from a pseudoforce that contains the nonlinearity and uncertainty information. In this paper, neural network, a recently popular tool for universal function approximation in the scientific machine-learning community due to the advancement of computational capability as well as the availability of open-source packages, is used to estimate the pseudoforce. Since only the nonlinear and uncertain pseudoforce is modeled using the neural networks, the same network can be used to predict a different response of the system, and no new network is required to train if the statistics of a different response are sought.

Frugal Processes: An Empirical Investigation Into the Operations of Resource-Constrained Firms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; Supply chains; Systematics; Bibliographies; Companies; Databases; Economics; Base of the pyramid; bottom of the pyramid; emerging markets; frugal innovation; process innovation; small; and medium-sized enterprises; supply-chain management; sustainability; sustainable operations	OF-THE-ART; BUSINESS MODELS; MEDICAL DEVICE; INNOVATION; BASE; FRAMEWORK; PRODUCT; MARKETS; SMES	The severe resource constraints that characterize markets at the bottom of the world's economic pyramid have forced firms to innovate both their products and processes. However, discourse in frugal innovation literature on how firms can design frugal processes in response to the resource constraints they face remains relatively sparse. Based on a systematic literature review, in this article we consolidate existing work on the process echelon of frugal innovation. We outline three ways frugal processes that have been conceptualized in the literature thus far, and distill their key characteristics. Based on an exploration of the supply chains of 87 small- and medium-sized enterprises, we show how firms configure these characteristics to overcome resource constraints at each stage of their supply chain. Ultimately, we propose three archetypes of a frugal supply chain that firms can strategically adopt. Firms with the primary goal of increasing consumer access to affordable products opt for a supply-chain structure that favors traditional economies of scale, and postpone any decentralization as further downstream as possible. In contrast, firms aiming to provide consumers with greener alternatives can adopt a hyperdecentralized structure throughout their supply-chain, which is made economically viable through low-cost approaches to distributed manufacturing. Firms interested in empowering local communities should consider hybrid structures that balance the high costs of investments in local capabilities.

Public participation, which aims to reduce conflicts and enhance public understanding of renewable energy technology, has not achieved the desired effect. The failure to identify critical factors guiding public participation is the main reason for ineffective participation as well as low levels of acceptance and support. This research reviewed existing studies and identified 22 factors that may affect the effectiveness of public participation in the renewable energy field. Based on the collected empirical data, data analysis methods such as exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were adopted. Seven critical factors, which are participation skills, environmental effect, justice, economic effect, power distribution, halo effect, and local culture, were identified as driving forces for effective public participation in sustainable energy projects (SEPs). The main findings of this study reveal that those seven critical factors should be taken into account when considering effective public participation in SEPs; there exists a positive relationship between relevant policies and public participation in renewable energy technology; the technical details of SEPs and the characteristics of the project location usually affect public acceptance at the design stage; and the development of SEPs should focus on the implementation process with active guidance and transparent public participation. Prospectively, this research will generate valuable insights not only into providing a theoretical framework to guide and enhance effective and efficient public participation for policy makers, but also into facilitating a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved in SEPs.

J	Zou, QL; Chen, SR				Zou, Qiling; Chen, Suren			Resilience Modeling of Interdependent Traffic-Electric Power System Subject to Hurricanes	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Resilience; Interdependencies; Transportation network; Electric power network; Restoration; Uncertainty analysis	INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS; NETWORK; VULNERABILITY; RESTORATION; RELIABILITY; FRAMEWORK; INOPERABILITY; FAILURE; EVENTS; RISK	Highly interconnected critical infrastructure systems (CISs) are the backbone of the well-being of the modern societies. It is crucial to account for the interdependencies among CISs in assessing the community resilience. This study presents a framework for resilience assessment of an interdependent traffic-electric power system subject to hurricanes. The traffic and electric power systems are both characterized using the flow-based mathematical representation, and three types of interdependency are captured. A modeling procedure coupled with the Monte Carlo simulation is presented to assess the resilience of both systems and to integrate different improvement strategies into corresponding stages of resilience. The traffic and electric power systems in Centerville, considering three improvement strategies, are studied to demonstrate the proposed framework. The results show that interdependencies can significantly affect the resilience of both systems, leading to different and the most effective strategies for each system. While hardening hurricane-vulnerable components and adopting a better repair schedule, both improve resilience of the electric power system significantly; adopting a better repair schedule works best for the resilience of the traffic system. The equal repair mode can achieve the resilience improvement in a balanced fashion. The results also highlight the importance of repair scheduling to the resilience improvement of these two interdependent systems when the available recovery resources are limited. Due to the interdependencies, the faster the functionality of traffic system can recover, the more efficiently the repair activities can be conducted, and thus, the greater resilience of both systems can be achieved.

J	Jha, MK; Kang, MW				Jha, Manoj K.; Kang, Min Wook			GIS-Based Model for Highway Noise Analysis	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								Elevated noise levels due to vehicular traffic are cause of grave concern in residential areas. They can significantly reduce property values. Most of the highway noise literature has been focused in predicting noise levels, estimating cost of installing noise barriers, and assessing effectiveness of noise barriers in reducing the amount of noise. The Federal Highway Administration's traffic noise model (TNM) is typically used to estimate noise levels due to vehicular traffic in the vicinity of residential properties. One key problem in highway noise analysis that has received limited attention is to automatically identify highway segments along which installation of noise barriers may be warranted due to elevated noise levels. This can be made possible by integrating the geographic information system's (GIS's) spatial modeling capability and the TNM methodology. In this paper, a GIS-based model for identifying highway segments for noise barrier installation is developed that uses TNM for noise level prediction. The method can automatically detect highway segments where installation of noise barriers may be warranted. In addition, the method also calculates effective length of noise barriers to be installed. An example is performed using Maryland's GIS database to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model. The proposed model can also work with highway alignment optimization models by identifying segments with unacceptable noise levels. Noise abatement costs for those segments can be calculated and considered in the optimal search ensuring minimum noise impact to residential communities. Several enhancements to the model remain to be worked on in the future. It is recognized that the positional accuracy of GIS data may limit the practical application of the proposed approach. Additional research is needed to address this issue.

J	Anderson, K; Lee, S; Menassa, C				Anderson, Kyle; Lee, SangHyun; Menassa, Carol			Impact of Social Network Type and Structure on Modeling Normative Energy Use Behavior Interventions	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Energy consumption; Human factors; Buildings; Agent-based modeling; Energy-use intervention; Social network; Occupant behavior	ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; DECISION-MAKING; FEEDBACK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; CONSERVATION; SIMULATION; CONFIDENCE; EFFICIENCY; BUILDINGS; OCCUPANCY	Occupant behavior has a substantial impact on the total energy consumption in buildings. To reduce consumption much work has been done investigating behavioral energy-use interventions (e.g.,feedback). Being able to accurately identify effective interventions for specific buildings or communities of buildings based on local conditions has significant implications for reducing energy consumption and demand in buildings. Therefore, recently researchers have begun developing predictive models of these behavioral interventions. However, limited consideration has been given to the importance that modeling assumptions (regarding social network type and structure) have in determining impact on intervention outcome. In this paper, an integrated model that combines established social-psychological principles of social influence and cultural norm diffusion with building social network profiles is developed and tested to examine the effect of social network type and structure on interventions. The writers apply agent-based modeling to simulate the interactions of heterogeneous building occupants in their respective social networks to examine the importance of social network type and structure for two interventions, as follows: (1)installing a peer energy-use feedback system, and (2)installing a feedback system and inserting an intervening agent into the building. The results indicate that network type and structure can have a significant effect on the time required for occupant energy-use intervention outcomes to reach a state of equilibrium. Thus, when modeling and selecting behavioral interventions, expected interventions outcomes should not be assumed based solely on generalized results from other studies, but consideration must be given to specific social network properties.

J	Wang, H; Meng, XH				Wang, Hao; Meng, Xianhai			BIM-Supported Knowledge Management: Potentials and Expectations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Knowledge management (KM); Information technology (IT); Construction project	SAFETY-KNOWLEDGE; CONSTRUCTION; ONTOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; DESIGN; COMMUNICATION; COMMUNITIES; CAPTURE; REUSE	Building information modeling (BIM) is currently a prevalent term for a new way of managing the design, construction, operation, and maintenance (O&M) of a project. It is regarded as an accumulation of information about a building anchored to a model. Consequently, BIM has been widely applied to manage information in construction projects. On the other hand, knowledge integrates context, experience, rules, and capability, which is at a higher level than information. Knowledge has also been widely recognized as one of the most important factors in construction projects. Therefore, close attention should be paid to knowledge management (KM) in construction projects. Compared to traditional information technology (IT) systems, BIM is characterized by object-oriented and parameter-driven modeling. How these characteristics can improve KM is a matter that has not been fully explored. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study first explores the existing tools used for KM in construction projects. Following this, the potentials of BIM for the improvement of KM are identified and the expectations for BIM-supported KM are outlined. A total of 30 industrial experts in the UK and Ireland were interviewed as the main research method in this study. Based on the analysis of interview results, a conceptual model is developed for BIM-supported KM. The conceptual model presents the features of BIM, such as three-dimensional (3D) visualization, lifecycle management, collaborative environment, and proactive mechanism, which can improve various KM activities. This study not only reveals the role of BIM for KM, but also gives insights into an innovative way of managing knowledge in construction projects.

J	Green, SA; May, SC				Green, SA; May, SC			Re-engineering construction: going against the grain	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						casualization; enterprise culture; lean construction; neo-liberatism; private finance initiative; re-engineering	ORGANIZATIONS	An overtly critical perspective on 're-engineering construction' is presented. It is contended that re-engineering is impossible to define in terms of its substantive content and is best understood as a rhetorical label. In recent years, the language of re-engineering has heavily shaped the construction research agenda. The declared goals are to lower costs and improve value for the customer. The discourse is persuasive because it reflects the ideology of the 'enterprise culture' and the associated rhetoric of customer responsiveness. Re-engineering is especially attractive to the construction industry because it reflects and reinforces the existing dominant way of thinking. The overriding tendency is to reduce organizational complexities to a mechanistic quest for efficiency. Labour is treated as a commodity. Within this context, the objectives of re-engineering become 'common sense'. Knowledge becomes subordinate to the dominant ideology of neo-liberalism. The accepted research agenda for re-engineering construction exacerbates the industry's problems and directly contributes to the casualization of the workforce. The continued adherence to machine metaphors by the construction industry's top management has directly contributed to the 'bad attitudes' and 'adversarial culture' that they repeatedly decry. Supposedly neutral topics such as pre-assembly, partnering, supply chain management and lean thinking serve only to justify the shift towards bogus labour-only subcontracting and the associated reduction of employment rights. The continued casualization of the workforce raises real questions about the industry's future capacity to deliver high-quality construction. In order to appear 'relevant' to the needs of industry, it seems that the research community is doomed to perpetuate this regressive cycle.

J	Cao, MT; Cheng, MY; Wu, YW				Cao, Minh-Tu; Cheng, Min-Yuan; Wu, Yu-Wei			Hybrid Computational Model for Forecasting Taiwan Construction Cost Index	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multivariate adaptive regression spline; Radial basis function neural network; Artificial bee colony; Construction cost index; Cost estimate; Cost and schedule	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; BEE COLONY; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; SVM	The ability to accurately forecast future trends in the Construction Cost Index (CCI) is critical for construction cost managers to prepare accurate budgets for owners and prepare proper bids for contractors. However, CCI forecasting accuracy is affected by concurrent fluctuations in numerous factors (e.g., domestic/international economic conditions, economic indicators, and the price of energy). The main contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is the creation of a new procedure and a novel inference model, the self-adaptive structural radial basis neural network intelligence machine (SSRIM), to help cost engineers deal with the variability of CCI. In SSRIM, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) analyzes the relative importance of various potential factors of influence on CCI, with those factors identified as significant assigned as input variables in the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and used to forecast CCI values. Meanwhile, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is employed to search for the optimal parameters of RBFNN to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. A total of 122 Taiwan CCI data were used to build the proposed model, identifying SSRIM as the fittest CCI forecast model with attaining lowest values of RMSE and MAPE. It is expected that this work will contribute to the construction engineering and management global community by helping cost engineers and project managers prepare more accurate budget estimates, proper bids, and attain better-timed project execution to reduce construction costs during the operation process.

This paper examines the phenomenon as a worldwide problem, identifies its root causes, ranks them (on a local basis), and analyses them. Root-cause analysis is not merely an arbitrary expression; rather, it is a systematic, formal, well-structured methodology, used as part of the total quality-management approach. The expand-focus principles and techniques were applied in this research for assembling an initial, as wide as possible, inclusive list (pool) of 146 potential causes gathered from the international professional literature as well as from prominent local experts. Through two cycles of expand-focus, they were filtered and merged into merely 15 independent universal root causes. These were further investigated through a cross-sectional survey among 200 local construction practitioners who ranked the 15 universal root causes according to their conceived local importance and influence on cost overruns. The survey revealed that, locally, Cause number 1 is premature tender documents; Cause number 2 is too many changes in owners' requirements or definitions; and Cause number 3 is tender-winning prices are unrealistically low (suicide tendering). The unique value of this paper to the global community of construction engineering and management is twofold: (1)It identified 15 universal root causes of cost overruns, which provide a good starting point for any local investigation, and (2)offers a well-structured methodology for ranking these 15 universal root causes in accordance with the local circumstances, thereby pinpointing the vital few that may prevent locally a substantial part of the problem.

Quality Assurance Organization Selection Factors for Highway Design and Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Highway construction; Highway design; Quality management; Quality assurance; Quality control		A project quality assurance organization (QAO) assigns project quality responsibilities and relationships, both for design and construction. In the highway sector, all project quality roles and responsibilities have historically been assigned to the state highway agency (SHA), an accepted and well-understood industry practice. However, increasing use of alternative project delivery methods and reductions in SHA staffing are having an impact on traditional QAO practices. SHAs are increasingly selecting alternative QAOs, but they are making these selections in an ad hoc manner because of limited staff knowledge and experience, and a lack of guidance from the research community. Highway design and construction quality research focuses almost exclusively on inspections, observations, corporate quality, warranties, and materials testing, resulting in a gap in the research about shifts in project quality roles and responsibilities. This research extends the civil engineering quality management body of knowledge by identifying factors that influence the selection of QAOs and rating the appropriateness of the QAOs for each selection factor. Because of the complexity of the topic, scope of the decision process, and the limited project data available, structured interviews and the Delphi method were chosen to explore the selection factors. The research discovered 10 factors: project size, project complexity, project delivery method, project schedule sensitivity, availability of agency project staff, agency project staff experience, agency culture, industry ability to manage their own quality, trust between agency and industry, and amount of quality risk to shift away from the agency. The research provides the highway industry with new understanding of the effects that each selection factor has on the fundamental QAOs. This fundamental knowledge will allow SHAs to make more informed QAO selections. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Almarri, K				Almarri, Khalid			Comparative analysis of the value for money factors of PPPs between the UAE and the UK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PPP; attractive factors; public procurements; developing countries		Public private partnerships (PPP) procurement instruments have been very popular tools for developing projects around the world. This is largely due to their success in bringing quality, efficiency, innovation, funds, experience and most importantly risk sharing to the projects they are involved in. This study aims to pinpoint the value for money (VFM) factors that are needed to implement PPP mechanisms in transitional economies, where the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is taken as a case study, whose findings will be contrasted to that of a UK sample, a developed economy. Relevant data was collected through a questionnaire to establish the VFM factors for each of the two countries. In this study, data was collected from 30 participants in the UAE, and 62 participants residing in the UK. A comparative analysis between the results of both countries revealed a great deal of similarity of the significant impact of the VFM factors on the assessment of PPP. The same four factors were chosen as the most important ones by both samples out of the sixteen factors for delivering VFM outcomes. These factors were optimized risk allocation, competitive bid process, improved services to the community, and clear output specification. This study contributed to practice by highlighting to the sponsors the most important VFM factors and group of factors to consider when assessing the VFM of any potential PPP project. This study also contributed to research in the field of PPPs in the UAE and the UK. The comparative analysis between the two countries highlighted the similarities and differences in the practice and opened areas for future consideration.

The impacts of these hazards on bridges affect the operability and functional integrity of transportation networks. This study focuses on two failure modes, namely the deterioration of bridge channels in the presence of competing hurricane hazards (hurricane-induced failure of channels) and the complex interactions between the two modes of failure, to evaluate the performance of bridge channels. To achieve the aforementioned objective, competing risks models are developed for the already-mentioned failure modes using the product limit survival analysis, cause-specific hazard rates, and the cumulative incidence functions (CIF). Failure time distributions are developed for standard commonly recognized bridge channel elements using legacy inspection data for bridges, annual probabilities of occurrence of hurricanes, and damage matrices from existing hurricane records. The method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighting techniques, and inference procedures are employed to describe competing risks event data for the analysis. From the results, it is observed that bridge channels deteriorate faster in the urban areas compared with rural areas. The deterioration and hurricane failures generally yield significantly different impacts based on the log-rank chi-square outputs. Also, it was observed that the impact of hurricane Categories 3 and 2 on bridge channels were more significant (based on the hazard ratios) at the coast than noncoastal areas and also generally high for urban bridge channels compared with rural channels.

J	Ghosh, JK; Bhattacharya, D; Boccardo, P; Samadhiya, NK				Ghosh, Jayanta Kumar; Bhattacharya, Devanjan; Boccardo, Piero; Samadhiya, Narendra Kumar			Automated Geo-Spatial Hazard Warning System GEOWARNS: Italian Case Study	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automation; Spatial infrastructures; Web based; Mobile; Georeferencing; Knowledge base; Hazards; Generalization	INFORMATION-SYSTEM; LANDSLIDES	Hazard warning is an area of research that requires both hazard evaluation and warning dissemination. At present, no such system carrying out both hazard evaluation and warning communication directly to the user community exists. Thus, there has been a need to develop an automated integrated system to categorize hazard and issue warning that reaches users directly. The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated, independent, generalized, and automated geo-hazard warning system, making use of geo-spatial data under popular usage platform. Thus, in this paper, development of GEOWARNS, an automated geo-spatial hazard warning system, has been elaborated. Testing and validation of the developed system has been carried out for landslide hazard evaluation and its warning dissemination pertaining to a comprehensive case study in Italy. The functionality of GEOWARNS is modular in architecture, having input, understanding, rainfall prediction, expert, output, and warning modules. The categories of hazard zones that have been evaluated by GEOWARNS show discrepancy of 5.9% in high hazard zones, nearly approximately 1.1 and 3.8% in moderate-and low-hazard zones, respectively, in comparison with the in situ expert evaluation. Further, the message dissemination through local cellular network has been found to be immediate with a maximum time lag recorded of 50 s, a minimum of 5 s, and an average of 15 s within the acceptable limits as indicated by the authorities in the United Nations (UN). Thus, it can be concluded that an automated hazard warning system has been developed. However, other scopes are needed to develop it further. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Wang, J; Lu, WS				Wang, Jing; Lu, Weisheng			A deployment framework for BIM localization	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modeling (BIM); BIM adoption; BIM localization; Deployment framework; Diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory		Purpose Over the past two decades, building information modeling (BIM) has been promoted as one of the most disruptive innovations across the global architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) community. Nevertheless, despite its widely propagated benefits, BIM adoption in various localities is not progressing excitingly. BIM as an innovation developed from a presumed, general context may not fit well with the specific regulatory, social and cultural settings of a locality. This study aims to tackle the lukewarm local BIM adoption by developing a deployment framework for BIM localization. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon the diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory, a longitudinal case study is designed and conducted by engaging closely with a top cost consultancy company in Hong Kong for forty-one months. Findings The findings refuted the "one-size-fits-for-all" view to use a standardized BIM for international users. Rather, an organization needs to undergo a series of localization works to integrate global BIM in its specific local context. The deployment framework outlines the BIM dimensions (i.e. technology, process and protocol) and the mechanisms (i.e. configuration, coupling and reinterpretation) of BIM localization that go through the three "A"s (i.e. analysis, adaption and assimilation) process under a firm's network and contextual factors. Originality/value This study improves our understanding of sluggish BIM adoption by attributing it to the gap between general BIM development and the local, unique BIM use context. Proposing the deployment framework, the study also offers a handy tool for prospective executives to localize BIM and harness its power in their respective organizations and localities.

J	Zhang, PH; Ng, FF				Zhang, Peihua; Ng, Fung Fai			Explaining Knowledge-Sharing Intention in Construction Teams in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge sharing; Theory of planned behavior; Construction teams; Hong Kong	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; DYNAMIC THEORY; WORK; COMMUNITIES; PERCEPTIONS; MOTIVATION; EMPLOYEES; VARIABLES; EFFICACY; SMOKING	Knowledge sharing among construction team members is important for improving project performance and successful project delivery. This study aims to develop an integrative understanding of factors affecting individual knowledge-sharing intention in construction teams in Hong Kong. Based on the widely accepted theory of planned behavior (TPB), a comprehensive research model and corresponding hypotheses were developed. To test the research model and hypotheses, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from professionals working in construction companies in Hong Kong. Then the data were analyzed by the statistic technique of structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that professionals' knowledge-sharing intention is mainly determined by their attitude toward and perceived behavioral control over knowledge sharing, but weakly influenced by subjective norms regarding knowledge sharing. The research findings also reveal that professionals' attitude toward knowledge sharing is positively influenced by perceptions of knowledge self-efficacy and feedback, while it has no significant relationships with perceptions of economic reward and enhanced personal relationship. In addition, the results show that information and communication technology (ICT) support has a significant effect on professionals' perceived behavioral control over knowledge sharing. This study is one of the first to use the existing theory of social psychology to examine knowledge-sharing behavior in the construction sector. It provides a new direction for studying knowledge sharing in the construction industry. Based on the research findings, several implications are suggested for construction companies to manage professionals' knowledge-sharing behavior in construction teams. Research limitations and recommendations for future studies are also discussed. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000607. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Kim, J; Kamari, M; Lee, S; Ham, Y				Kim, Jaeyoon; Kamari, Mirsalar; Lee, Seulbi; Ham, Youngjib			Large-Scale Visual Data-Driven Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Utility Poles Regarding the Vulnerability of Power Distribution Infrastructure Systems	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Power distribution infrastructure systems; Vulnerability; Probabilistic risk assessment; Google street view; Computer vision; Machine vision; Deep learning	RELIABILITY; WIND	Inspecting and assessing existing utility poles has become increasingly important for reducing the vulnerability of power distribution infrastructure systems in disaster situations, which can enhance community resilience. Although vision-based systems have been applied to detect faults in power distribution infrastructures, little research currently exists on assessing component- and network-level failures of utility poles based on their geometric and environmental information. This paper aims to propose a new data-driven approach to support risk-informed decision-making for utility maintenance under extreme wind conditions. Large-scale open-source imagery from Google Street View is used to assess geometric properties of utility poles (i.e., leaning angle). Then the failure probability of utility poles is analyzed under varying conditions (e.g., age, leaning angle, and wind loads) in a three-dimensional virtual city model. The proposed method is tested through case studies in Texas to (1) validate an algorithm for estimating leaning angles of utility poles and (2) understand the progress of failures of leaning utility poles from a network perspective. The outcomes of the case studies demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to leverage large-scale open-source visual data to assess the vulnerability of utility pole networks that may lead to cascading failures in power distribution infrastructure systems. Based on the proposed virtual environment, the method is expected to enable practitioners to facilitate risk-informed decision-making against disaster situations, which creates an opportunity for prioritizing maintenance tasks regarding power distribution infrastructures.

J	Kim, H; Ham, Y				Kim, Hongjo; Ham, Youngjib			Increasing Reliability of Participatory Sensing for Utility Pole Condition Assessment Using Fuzzy Inference	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Aging infrastructure has become a safety issue for local communities. For example, aging and deteriorating utility poles in strong winds have a high risk of falling onto roads, adjacent houses, or vehicles, which could cause traffic jams, power outages, property damage, or casualties. To prevent such accidents, the infrastructure condition needs to be monitored on a regular basis, thereby facilitating proactive maintenance and repair. However, available monitoring resources are limited for inspecting numerous existing infrastructures in a timely manner, which hinders obtaining up-to-date records representing the current condition status. As an alternative monitoring method, participatory sensing has the potential for infrastructure inspection, leveraging the prevalence of citizens' smartphones as a ubiquitous sensing device. Nonetheless, the reliability of crowdsourced data for infrastructure monitoring and how to improve it have not been investigated fully, although participatory sensing increasingly has been adopted in many studies. Because citizens generally do not have expertise in infrastructure condition assessment, a lack of understanding of the crowdsourced data reliability prevents participatory sensing from being implemented in practice. To advance the understanding of the crowdsourced data reliability for infrastructure assessment, this study investigated the discrepancy in infrastructure assessment results by citizens and by an expert. Wood utility poles were selected as a target infrastructure. This study investigated a way to reduce the deviation between the expert's and the citizens' responses through a fuzzy inference system along with particle swarm optimization and pattern search algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed fuzzy inference system reduced the evaluation error by 21.18%. The findings of this study have the potential to fill the knowledge gap for enhancing participatory sensing in infrastructure monitoring, thereby promoting future study to enhance its applicability for citizen-driven urban resilience.

The results, however, have been a mix of failures and successes. The determinants of success and failure of such arrangements have generated much interest among stakeholders and the research community, but the combinations of factors that influence the success of public-private partnership projects are relatively less researched. This article investigates the relationships among the complex factors that influence the success of such arrangements, using urban drinking water projects in India as an example. Eighteen projects were selected for the study and 11 factors affecting the project outcome (causal conditions) were identified based on the literature review. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was conducted to understand which combinations of causal conditions potentially influence the outcome of a public-private partnership project. The analysis identified five causal solutions comprising seven to nine causal conditions each. Defining service standards in a manner that is amenable to measurement and public disclosure emerged as a necessary condition. Two causal solutions presented themselves with capacity of the public sector, and its consequent outputs, as a primary theme. Two other solutions have elements relating to appropriate project structure and baseline information as the key causal conditions. These causal solutions indicate the interrelationship between various factors that influence project performance and provide pointers for project proponents to focus on the causal conditions over which they have relatively better control, when configuring public-private partnership projects.

Design/methodology/approach The research used an exploratory approach of unstructured interviews with construction workers (bottom-up approach), and the guided group brainstorming technique with the help of experienced industry professionals (top-down approach). Findings From the unstructured interviews, five inhibiting factors were identified which discourage construction workers from undergoing training. Furthermore, to recognise the causes of the inhibiting factors, 13 possible causal attributes (PCAs) were identified from the brainstorming approach. Subsequently, these PCAs were classified into five possible causal factors (PCFs) on the basis of those concerned stakeholder(s) that are most closely involved and most responsible for fixing them. Research limitations/implications The research provides recommendations to practitioners for pragmatic and permanent resolution of each of the PCFs, which serves as a framework for the construction industry to reduce the scarcity of trained workers in the industry. Also, the results may serve as a model for the planning and successful implementation of any new skill-training programme for the construction workers in any developing economy, such as India. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature by highlighting the views of construction workers on the training establishments, which very few studies have considered in the past. Also, the research provides a detailed process of brainstorming approach, which will help the research community to appreciate its use in studies related to the construction industry.

J	Geraldi, J; Soderlund, J				Geraldi, Joana; Soderlund, Jonas			Project studies and engaged scholarship Directions towards contextualized and reflexive research on projectsProject studies and engaged scholarship Directions towards contextualized and reflexive research on projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Reflexivity; Sociology of science; Habermas; Scholarship; Interpretative ontology; Rethinking Project Management	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; RETHINKING; GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; HISTORY; ROOTS; VIEW	Purpose - In 2006, the "Rethinking Project Management Network" called for a paradigm shift in project research, and proposed five research directions. The directions inspired research and marked a milestone in the development of the field. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the past decade and to rejuvenate these research directions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose the umbrella term: "project studies" to denote the research related to projects and temporary organizing. Project studies is conceived not only as a body of research, but also as a social process embedded in research communities, and contemporary Zeitgeist. Based on Sandberg's interpretative approach to the fit between work and worker (in this case research-researcher) and Habermas' three types of human interests: technical, practical, and emancipatory, the authors develop a conceptual framework circumscribing three types of research in project studies. Findings - The conceptual framework is used to craft future research directions, in the lines proposed by Winter et al. (2006b). Research limitations/implications - The authors conclude by proposing for a sixth research direction on the practice of theorizing, and call for engaged, ambidextrous scholars, who's "job" goes beyond the writing of articles and research applications, and includes shaping discourses of project research, nurturing new project scholars, contributing to project practice and carefully considering the legacy of projects and project studies in society. Originality/value - This paper positions research as a social process, and the role of researchers as actors shaping research in project studies.

Hence new forms of organisation are needed. Collaborating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) is complex and challenges the management of projects. The ubiquitous digital information sharing among multi-disciplinary actors in BIM-based projects, activates dense inter-organisational processes. This study offers insights into collaboration with BIM, through the theoretical lens of boundaries. By analysing two projects of BIM-based collaboration in the Netherlands, the interplay between structure and agency of collaboration was discussed. The various artefacts of BIM, as boundary objects were interpreted in multiple ways by different communities of practice and this resulted in poor communication and consequently poor collaboration. The findings challenge the prevalent view of BIM as a software artefact and showed that this view only partially supports collaboration. Additionally, a structurational view (enabled by communication, conflict management, negotiation, and teamwork) as opposed to a structural view of collaboration (e.g. BIM as a software) can fully support the implementation of digital innovations. Finally, the paper revealed a 'tactical gap' in the implementation of digital between strategic and operational decision-making needs fine-tuning to ensure better collaboration in projects where digital innovations are adopted. The study concludes with propositions for supporting organisation of teams through integration of activities and the management of BIM-based collaboration in projects beyond merely structural and technological approaches, which dominate the field but from a structurational view instead.

J	Nichols, J				Nichols, John			Reverse Auction Bidding: Studying Player Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantitative methods	SUPPLY CHAIN	Reverse auction bidding is a recent development in the auctioning of goods and services. Significant controversy exists within the construction industry as to whether reversed auction bidding is akin to bid shopping. This is a serious ethical question for the engineering and construction community and one that is worthy of research. First, in the simplest terms, the practical purpose of this paper is to outline the development of a simple web-based game that allows for a controlled study of reverse auction bidding with a standard cohort of trained construction-oriented players and to outline the statistical results of the different games played between 2004 and 2016. These studies provide the pragmatic and statistical framework within a very highly structured game to consider the truth of this paper's hypothesis, which is that an economically efficient player exists in legal game play. In this paper, the legal game play must coincide with actual construction bidding methods and law. The hypothesis is shown to be true in this study of reverse auction bidding. An economically efficient bidder is someone wanted on a good bidding team; this simple game provides a quick and simple classification system and a good training tool. Second, the utility of the study, not as a bidding method in the real world, but as a training tool for bidding specialists is outlined and the statistical data shown to provide the definition for economically efficient players and nonefficient players is summarized and explained in terms of application to the real world and game theory. The ultimate objective is to create an artificially intelligent player who passes a Turing test for the game, and who maximizes the returns within the valid monetary and utility matrix models used by game players.

J	Babatunde, SO; Perera, S				Babatunde, Solomon Olusola; Perera, Srinath			Cross-sectional comparison of public-private partnerships in transport infrastructure development in Nigeria	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Nigeria; Critical success factors; Developing countries; Partnership; Procurement; Private finance	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; COST OVERRUNS; PPP PROJECTS; BOT PROJECTS; HONG-KONG; PERSPECTIVES; SECTOR; CHINA; URBAN; CSFS	Purpose - Although scientific research community has shown considerable interest in identifying critical success factors (CSFs) for public-private partnership (PPP) projects, yet effort at assessing and compare CSFs within similar PPP infrastructure projects received scant attention. The purpose of this paper is to identify, assess, and compare the CSFs in PPP transport infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted literature review and three PPP case studies including structured interviews and review of documentary reports in each case study. The outcome of literature review provided a total list of 26 identified success factors, which was used to design a case study protocol using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique. FMEA was conducted on each 26 identified success factor to assess their criticality in the three PPP case studies. Findings - The results of FMEA revealed a total of ten CSFs in the concession of the road; four CSFs in the concession of the airport; and eight CSFs in the concession of the seaport. Also, the cross-case analysis showed the three prevalent CSFs, this includes government involvement by providing guarantees, political support, and project economic viability. Practical implications - The study findings including lessons learnt in each case study would positively influence policy development towards PPP transport infrastructure projects and the manner in which partners (i.e. public and private sector) go about the development of PPP transport projects. Originality/value - This research would help PPP stakeholders to focus their attention and priorities in managing the identified CSFs in achieving long-term success in PPP transport infrastructure projects implementation.

Design/methodology/approach This paper has established an analytical framework to analyse the social sustainability of PPP projects. Using content analysis method, a single case study was carried out on the Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney, Australia. Findings The results show that there are many problems related to social sustainability in the project, due to which employees and patients were exposed to most of them. Some recommendations are provided, including to strengthen the supervision of the project, provide sufficient information, establish communication channels and stakeholder participation, improve hospital policies and procedures, and strengthen government support. Practical implications This paper can provide guidance for the stakeholders in a partnership, including the public and private sectors, to analyse the social sustainability implications, and then plan and implement hospital PPP projects to achieve social sustainability goals. Meanwhile, it can also provide important reference for the employees, patients, local community and society to assess social sustainability issues, and provide relevant inputs to inform decision-makers in the development, delivery and management of hospital projects. Originality/value The research will contribute to knowledge of social sustainability of hospital PPP projects. The proposed analytical framework can be used to analyse and assess the social sustainability of such projects from the perspective of stakeholders.

J	Han, YL; He, TZ; Chang, RD; Xue, R				Han, Yilong; He, Tianzhi; Chang, Ruidong; Xue, Rui			Development Trend and Segmentation of the US Green Building Market: Corporate Perspective on Green Contractors and Design Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Engineering news record; Green building company; Green building market	CONSTRUCTION; BARRIERS; DRIVERS; IMPACT; CHINA	In the past decade, the architecture, engineering, and construction industry has witnessed increasing growth in the green building market and continues to expect a promising future. Although companies in the industry have played a significant role in developing the green building market, scarce studies have analyzed changes in the market from the perspectives of these corporations. Also, few studies classify green building companies by characteristics. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we explored the characteristics of the US green building market from a corporate perspective, specifically investigating green contractors and design firms. We first collected data of 464 top US green building companies identified by the Engineering News-Record over the past decade and explored the development trend of the green building market, based on the green revenue generated by these companies. We found that the general growth trend in the US green building market in the past decade could be divided into three stages: a rapid-growth stage (2000-2008), a steady-growth stage (2009-2013), and a maturity and transformation stage (2014-2016). We then categorized the 464 organizations into three groups with distinct characteristics by k-means cluster analysis techniques, including mature green building companies, sector-oriented green building companies, and primary-stage green building companies. This study provides the academic and practitioner communities with a holistic understanding of the development of the US green building market from the view of burgeoning companies. Corporate-level management systems and sustainable practices of the three clusters of green building companies also provide guidance for construction companies in the various stages of transformation towards sustainability to adopt different strategies.

J	Au-Yong, CP; Chua, SJL; Ali, AS; Tucker, M				Au-Yong, Cheong Peng; Chua, Shirley Jin Lin; Ali, Azlan Shah; Tucker, Matthew			Optimising maintenance cost by prioritising maintenance of facilities services in residential buildings	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Optimization; Management; Strategic management; Residential; Questionnaire survey; Building maintenance; Maintenance priority; Facilities services; High-rise building	SUCCESS FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; CONCRETE; DESIGN; COMMUNITIES; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; CHALLENGES; DECISION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the maintenance prioritising for facilities services in high-rise residential buildings in Peninsular Malaysia. Maintenance prioritisation is becoming more prominent in the building maintenance industry due to budget constraints, poor maintenance management and to yield better maintenance performance. Design/methodology/approach Two main categories with eleven facilities services that require maintenance were identified through extensive literature review. A total of 321 returned questionnaires were analysed to distinguish the relationship between the maintenance priority and cost variance. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to validate the findings. Findings The findings revealed that five essential facilities services were significantly correlated to cost variance and a regression model which examines the probability of over-budget was developed. Meanwhile, the interviews recognised that maintenance prioritisation has impact towards maintenance cost. Research limitations/implications - This research focusses on the maintenance priorities of facilities services and their effects to maintenance cost. However, it is undeniable that the maintenance cost can be affected by other factors, contributing to a lower percentage of the total variance in the regression model. Thus, it creates research opportunity to study the factors (i.e. manpower, materials, wear and tear, etc.) affecting the variance of maintenance cost. Practical implications - This study is useful to property managers in efforts to enhance the cost performance via appropriate maintenance prioritisation. The essential facilities services should be highly prioritised compared to the value-added facilities services. Originality/value The paper signifies the importance of maintenance prioritisation. It serves as a guide to plan and execute maintenance planning in a more logical way within budget and time constraints.

J	Jalal, MP; Shoar, S				Jalal, Majid Parchami; Shoar, Shahab			A hybrid SD-DEMATEL approach to develop a ledelay model for construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; System dynamics; Causes of delay; Construction delay; DEMATEL method; Iranian construction industry	COST OVERRUNS; DELAY; MATRIX	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for complex interconnected structure of various factors interacting with delay in order to identify the most important factors influencing and influenced by delay based on their interrelations. Design/methodology/approach - Reviewing literature and interviewing with local experts selected from the Iranian construction industry, top 58 delay factors were identified and categorized into six major groups. The interrelations among these factors were, then, modeled using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The resulting causal loop diagrams obtained from SD were used subsequently for identifying the most significant factors influencing and influenced by delay through the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The impact of factors on each other was finally determined based on the opinions of 63 experts selected from the Iranian community of consultants, contractors, and clients. Findings - According to the analysis, eight out of the 58 factors were identified as the most influencing factors on delay, and nine factors were found to be the most influenced factors by delay in the field of delay analysis. The study also concluded that factors related to labors are the most important and influential factors. In addition, factors related to client were the most influencing factors and external-related factors were the least important ones. At the end, some recommendations to reduce variation of delay in the construction projects are presented as well. Originality/value - Considering the interconnected structure of the factors, the paper identifies the most important factors interacting with time delay in construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach We build on a 15-month engaged scholarship experience carried out in the Ministry of Transport of Quebec. We explain and analyze the normative assessment process, using a storytelling approach and vignettes to explore four situated learning moments. Findings This study offers a deeper understanding of how normative assessment is conducted, and how situated and collective learning occur throughout. We find that both organizational actors and researchers learn through this process and synchronize their mutual learning such that researchers actually participate in a larger organizational transformation. Research limitations/implications Like any qualitative endeavor, this research is context-specific. We offer several research avenues to extend the applicability of findings. Practical implications This article could inspire organizations and scholars to collaborate on normative assessment during organizational transformation. This approach is of particular interest in the context of a worldwide pandemic where public and private organizations all have to adapt to new sanitary, economic, technological and social realities. Social implications In a context marked by growing concern for the research-practice gap and the relevance of scholarship, our study illustrates the development of a mutually beneficial collaboration between practitioners and researchers that enhances understanding of complex organizational phenomena and issues. Originality/value This research highlights the relevance of engaged scholarship and supports normative assessment as a social process to generate mutual learning.

J	Miles, SB; Ho, CL				Miles, SB; Ho, CL			Applications and issues of GIS as tool for civil engineering modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; SOFTWARE	A tool that has proliferated within civil engineering in recent years is geographic information systems (GIS). The goal of a tool is to supplement ability and knowledge that already exists, not to serve as a replacement for that which is lacking. To secure the benefits and avoid misuse of a burgeoning tool, engineers must understand the limitations, alternatives, and context of the tool. The common benefits of using GIS as a supplement to engineering modeling are summarized. Several brief case studies of GIS modeling applications are taken from popular civil engineering literature to demonstrate the wide use and varied implementation of GIS across the discipline. Drawing from the case studies, limitations regarding traditional GIS data models and the implementation of civil engineering models within current GIS are identified and countered by discussing the direction of the next generation of GIS. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential for the misuse of GIS in the context of engineering modeling and suggests that this potential can be reduced through education and awareness. The goal, of this paper is to promote awareness of the issues related to GIS-based modeling and to assist in the formulation of questions regarding the application. of current GIS. The technology has experienced much publicity of late, with many engineers being perhaps too excited about the usefulness of current GIS. An undoubtedly beneficial side effect of this, however, is that engineers are becoming more aware of GIS and, hopefully, the associated subtleties. Civil engineers must stay informed of GIS issues and progress, but more importantly, civil engineers must inform the GIS community to direct the technology development optimally.

Philip; Stone, Andy; Davies, Michael			Exploring energy integration between new and existing developments	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						domestic energy; energy strategy; neighbourhood planning; on-site renewables; supply-and-demand model; zero carbon	UK; SYSTEMS; DEMAND	The UK government has ambitious goals to reduce national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and has targeted the new and existing built stock with measures to improve building performance and provide more local and centralized renewable energy. New dwellings are proposed to be 'net-zero carbon' by 2016, which includes proposals to offset CO2 by integrating new and existing development. To what extent can new zero-carbon communities be more readily achieved through increasing the integration between new and existing domestic developments? A methodology is presented for determining the ratio of on-site renewable energy supply to energy demand for a series of densities using a simplified model. Options that increase the proportion of existing dwellings served by a new development to balance further energy demands are presented. The practical opportunities and constraints are considered for integrating new and existing domestic development to achieve net-zero carbon. Meeting net-zero on-site annual energy requirements through on-site energy resources is possible even at high urban densities, with annual average supply/demand ratios of approximately 2.3. Also, integrating existing dwellings may offer an opportunity to improve supply/demand ratios for further CO2 reductions; low densities are shown to have annual supply/demand ratios of approximately 9.5. Although a finer temporal scale illustrates the limitations of an annual average and the variable nature of on-site energy resources; this straightforward method can act as a catalyst in achieving net-zero-carbon communities. Le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni s'est fixe des objectifs ambitieux de reduction des emissions de dioxyde de carbone (CO2) au niveau national et a decide de viser le parc bati existant et les constructions neuves par des mesures destinees a ameliorer les performances des batiments et a fournir davantage d'energies renouvelables locales et centralisees. Il est propose que les nouveaux logements soient << zero carbone net >> d'ici a 2016, ceci incluant des propositions pour compenser le CO2 par l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux. Dans quelle mesure peut-on parvenir plus facilement a de nouvelles communautes zero carbone en augmentant l'integration entre les ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux? Il est presente une methodologie permettant de determiner le rapport entre l'offre en energies renouvelables locales et la demande en energie pour une serie de densites d'habitation en utilisant un modele simplifie. Sont presentes des choix qui augmentent la part des logements existants desservis par un nouvel ensemble de logements afin d'equilibrer les demandes d'energie supplementaires. Les possibilites et les contraintes pratiques relatives a l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux pour atteindre le << zero carbone net >> sont examinees. Il est possible de repondre a des besoins energetiques annuels locaux << zero carbone net >> par des ressources energetiques locales, meme avec des densites urbaines elevees, pour des rapports annuels moyens offre/demande d'environ 2.3. De plus, le fait d'integrer les logements existants peut donner la possibilite d'ameliorer les rapports offre/demande afin de reduire encore les emissions de CO2; il est montre que des densites d'habitation faibles presentent des rapports annuels offre/demande d'environ 9.5. Bien qu'une echelle de temps plus fine illustre les limites d'une moyenne annuelle et la nature variable des ressources energetiques ocales, cette methode simple peut faire office de catalyseur pour realiser des communautes << zero carbone net >>.

J	Yang, YN; Kumaraswamy, MM; Pam, HJ; Mahesh, G				Yang, Ying Nan; Kumaraswamy, Mohan M.; Pam, Hoat Joen; Mahesh, Gangadhar			Integrated Qualitative and Quantitative Methodology to Assess Validity and Credibility of Models for Bridge Maintenance Management System Development	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bridge maintenance management; Credibility; Validation; Verification	OPTIMIZATION; VALIDATION	At the heart of a bridge maintenance management system (BMMS) is a set of performance prediction and maintenance decision-making models. If focused on quantitative methods alone, the ultimate validity of these models can only be established through implementation, thus delaying the applicability and acceptability of the models in practice. This is even more important for project management and infrastructure asset management domains, because the results and processes by which they are derived must be accepted by the academic and professional communities so that the new knowledge is quickly added, assimilated, and applied in daily practice. Given the poor state of physical infrastructure in many countries, the importance of improving asset management principles and practices is becoming critical. A comprehensive framework that integrates qualitative and quantitative methodologies for BMMS development is formulated, based on research and development of a BMMS model specific to Hong Kong that includes structured validation, verification, and credibility establishment. Integration of both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess validity and credibility of the models for BMMS development is expected to balance the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and lead to a more robust and reliable methodology with inbuilt credibility-building strategies. Finally, a qualitative case study of the validation methodology for the developed BMMS model shows potential sources of bias. These must be addressed in developing sound practices for applying these techniques so that research results can be more reliable and readily accepted in the field of bridge maintenance management.

J	Shoar, S; Chileshe, N; Payan, S				Shoar, Shahab; Chileshe, Nicholas; Payan, Shamsi			Assessment of the causes and effects of design deficiencies for large construction projects using social network analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article; Early Access						Project management; Design management; Causal factors; Social network analysis; Soft systems	SOFT SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY; CENTRALITY; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; REWORK; ERROR; MODEL; DOCUMENTATION; CAUSATION; DELAYS	Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the latent interrelationships of causes and effects of design deficiencies (DDs) and to identify the most crucial ones by considering the interactions among them. Design/methodology/approach First, through a comprehensive literature review, the most critical causes of DDs were identified. The review eventuated in a list of 22 causes and 12 effects, which were categorized into six groups. Second, through the rules of system dynamics and the interactions between the causes and effects were modeled and illustrated using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). With the aid of semi-structured interviews with 20 competent experts, the resultant CLDs were also validated. Third, the opinions of 54 experts, who were chosen from the Iranian community of clients and consultants, were solicited concerning the degree of influence which each factor (causes or effects) exerts on others. Finally, the social network analysis (SNA) approach was deployed to analyze and prioritize factors based on the gathered data from experts. Findings SNA results indicated that factors such as "design firms' staff rework" and "design firms' loss of reputation" are the most central factors affecting DDs. The model results also identified that factors such as "schedule variance", "workload" and "lack of quality control and supervision during the design phase" have the highest overall impact on DDs. In the end, some recommendations to address major factors and links were also put forward. Overall, more communications between the pair of stakeholder groups and continuous learning from project experiences are believed to be the main strategies. Originality/value It is believed that this study has provided a comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms among factors, which can assist project managers of different parties (clients, contractors and consulting firms) in taking more effective actions to ameliorate the quality of design documents.

Evolutionary Stable Strategy for Postdisaster Insurance: Game Theory Approach	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Game theory; Evolutionary stable strategy; Insurance; Disaster management	MORAL HAZARD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; REINSURANCE; LOSSES; SYSTEM	Mitigation of the financial impacts associated with natural disasters is becoming an urgent objective at both the national and international levels, as the rate and magnitude of natural disasters are continuing to increase. Using an evolutionary game theory approach, this paper aims to find an equilibrium profile of postdisaster insurance plans purchased by resident families and sold by insurance companies, as well as ex-postdisaster relief implemented by a government agency. This dynamic integrated assessment minimizes the total losses for the three aforementioned associated stakeholders, thus maximizing welfare within natural disaster host community systems. To this end, the authors determined a plausible set of actions and utility functions for the associated stakeholders. Also, they created a hypothetical sample of 1,000 resident families accounting for heterogeneous income levels, three insurance companies offering three unique insurance plans per company-each with different premium and coverage-and two different types of government compensation plans for postdisaster damage mitigation. The proposed model was implemented on the NetBeans IDE 7.4 platform using the Java programming language for a hypothetical case study. The results indicate that (1) resident families tend to prefer insurance plans with the lowest premium value and coverage; (2) insurance plans with the most comprehensive coverage experienced the least demand; and (3) the evolutionary stable strategy is an oscillating line of chosen plans and insurers as a result of the stochastic and dynamics nature of the factors associated with disaster management. Currently, the authors are working to develop the model further to better account for simultaneous actions by all stakeholders (not only resident families), population growth, changes in financial and income standards, integrating input from available natural hazard prediction software systems (e.g., HAZUS-MH), and continuous data. Ultimately, this evolutionary game theory model will be tested on post-Hurricane Katrina data representing real-life physical damage in Hancock County, Mississippi.

J	Voordijk, H; ter Huurne, R; Scholtenhuis, LO				Voordijk, Hans; ter Huurne, Ramon; Scholtenhuis, Leon Olde			Adoption and Use of Ontologies in the Utility Sector: A Technological Mediation Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ontology development; Digitalization standards; Mediation; Utility sector	INFORMATION; CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; BIM	Standardization is believed to be a driver for adoption and integration of digital practices. Beyond the standardization at the level of technology application lies potential for standardization in the higher-order formalized knowledge bases; the so-called ontologies. Ontologies need to abstract and integrate knowledge from disciplines and industry standards. From a philosophical perspective, ontologies can be seen as social constructs and part of the shared social context in which practitioners work. If they do not contain an adequate representation of a community's shared reality, they may delimit sector-wide unified digital practices. Following the interpretive approach of technological mediation, the objective of this study is to explain why the development and use of a sector-wide domain ontology in construction are not always as effective and efficient as they could potentially be. Which obstacles hamper the creation of a sector-wide domain ontology and how can these be overcome? We apply the technical mediation perspective to assess how coexisting different standards complicate the development of a shared domain ontology. Additionally, a collaborative end user-based design approach is applied to address ontology development complexities. It is shown that a digital modeling standard mediates a specific view or model of reality by amplifying certain aspects of the world at the expense of other aspects. The heterogeneity of existing standards makes it difficult to develop a shared and sector-wide domain ontology because different utility owners model different representations of the world. A collaborative user-oriented development approach is a means to elicit these differences more adequately, and to develop shared conceptualizations about the domain of the utility sector. The domain ontology serves here as mediator between the different digital standards that capture the distinctive modeled realities of utility owners.

To deal with a large variety of project data and information to support efficient and effective decision making, visualization, information modeling, and simulation (VIMS) has become critical in the development of capital facilities and infrastructures. The objective of this paper is to identify and investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges, examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future research. These research directions apply to technical issues and sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place, which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry. By incorporating the whole project lifecycle, not only project execution but also planning, operation, and maintenance, the analysis provides meaningful hints for VIMS challenges in architecture, engineering, and facility management industries.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on an earlier empirical investigation, where complex-project capability (CPC) is developed through dynamic organizational learning based on non-linear problem solving, the paper examines some of the conceptual and practical implications of this process insight. The focus here is on incomplete pre-given knowledge and emergent knowledge creation during CPC development. Findings - Using the three interrelated dimensions of project type, knowledge creation method, and organizational learning approach, the paper reinterprets Karl Popper's linear problem solving model for learning in traditional projects by introducing the concept of knowledge entropy (disorder) for learning in non-linear complex projects. The latter follows a path from "order to disorder to order" rather than from "order to order" under traditional assumptions. Research limitations/implications - By identifying a common learning process at individual, group, and organizational levels, developing CPC can be viewed as a "learning organization". This multi-level approach facilitates research into distributed organizing for emergent knowledge creation during CPC development. Practical implications - In contrast to traditional planned projects with up-front prior knowledge, complex projects are characterized by incomplete knowledge. The challenge of dealing with knowledge uncertainty in complex projects through continuous learning has practical implications for project learning, planning, knowledge management, and leadership. Originality/value - The concept of knowledge entropy (disorder) extends the learning boundaries of traditional projects, where little learning is anticipated, by including complex projects with knowledge uncertainty requiring continuous learning.

J	Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST				Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST			Stochastic time-cost optimization model incorporating fuzzy sets theory and nonreplaceable front	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; LOGIC	In a real construction project, the duration and cost of each activity could change dynamically as a result of many uncertain variables, such as weather, resource availability, productivity, etc. Managers/planners must take these uncertainties into account and provide an optimal balance of time and cost based on their own experience and knowledge. In this paper, fuzzy sets theory is applied to model the managers' behavior in predicting time and cost pertinent to a specific option within an activity. Genetic algorithms are used as a searching mechanism to establish the optimal time-cost profiles under different risk levels. In addition, the nonreplaceable front concept is proposed to assist managers in recognizing promising solutions from numerous candidates on the Pareto front. Economic analysis skills, such as the utility theory and opportunity cost, are integrated into the new model to mimic the decision making process of human experts. A simple case study is used for testing the new model developed. In comparison with the previous models, the new model provides managers with greater flexibility to analyze their decisions in a more realistic manner. The results also indicate that greater robustness may be achieved by taking some risks. This research is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers. By incorporating the concept of fuzzy sets, managers can represent the range of possible time-cost values as well as their associated degree of belief. The model presented in this paper, can, therefore, support decision makers in analyzing their time-cost optimization decision in a more flexible and realistic manner. Many novel ideas have also been incorporated in this paper to benefit the research community. Examples of these include the use of fuzzy sets theory, nonreplaceable front concept, utility theory, opportunity cost, etc. With suitable modifications, these concepts can be applied to model to other similar optimization problems in construction.

It is critical how to realize collaborative work and information sharing among such participants. The information and communication technologies (ICTs) provides a technical guarantee for solving this problem. Existing research has been achieved the partial processes digitization of construction site, but certain problems still exist: 1) information perception of the construction site is passive. 2) common collaboration and coordination problems in the construction industry have not been addressed. The emerging trends of ICTs have resulted in the integration of various computer technologies such as CPS, BIM, big data, and cloud computing into construction process, which would changes behavioral and management mode of construction sites. These new ICTs have been applied successfully in MCP, in particular, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project. A new management mode of construction sites is inspired by these case. In this paper, a new management mode of construction site for MCP has been proposed, namely, smart construction site. The ultimate goal of smart construction site is to accomplish safe, efficient and high-quality construction. This study put forward the conceptual framework for smart construction site, and have identified three key elements of smart construction site, including information support platform, collaboration work, and intelligent construction management. A case study on Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project work as an evidence to support the practicability of the proposed mode. Significant contributions of this study is to propose a new management mode for MCP in construction industry, which would enrich the body of knowledge or the construction management community. Future research should be dedicated to further explore the potential of smart construction site in MCP management.

J	Abdulla, B; Birgisson, B				Abdulla, Bahrulla; Birgisson, Bjorn			Characterization of Vulnerability of Road Networks to Random and Nonrandom Disruptions Using Network Percolation Approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Percolation; Network robustness; Random disruption; Fluvial flooding; Giant connected component	SEISMIC RESILIENCE; TRANSPORTATION; PREDICTION	This paper examines the vulnerability of road networks to two types of disruptions by modeling the percolation dynamics in road networks under different disruption scenarios. The objective of this paper is threefold: (1) to examine if the theoretical network robustness measure proposed in the literature is applicable for measuring the integrity of road networks during disruptions; (2) to unveil the impacts of network size on the overall vulnerability of road networks; and (3) to compare the performance profile of road networks to random and nonrandom types of disruptions. To that end, this study first modeled the road system in a community as a planar graph. Then, the percolation dynamic in the road network during the flood is captured by assigning different removal probabilities to nodes in the road network according to Bayes' rule that take floodplain types, node-elevation, and street-grade as inputs. In the end, an overall road network robustness measure and its temporal changes were obtained and for random and nonrandom scenarios, using road networks with different sizes. The results were compared in order to characterize the vulnerability of road networks under different scenarios. The proposed method was applied to the road network in central Houston during Hurricane Harvey. The results show that: (1) the theoretical network robustness measure is applicable to assess the road network robustness; (2) compared to the random percolation model, the probability (Bayes' rule) based percolation could lead to a greater decrease in the network robustness; and (3) the percolation profiles of the road networks with different sizes are not significantly different. The findings of this study could not only inform resilience enhancing decisions by the stakeholders but also could serve as a foundation for future vulnerability related research.

J	Tiwana, A; Bush, AA				Tiwana, A; Bush, AA			Continuance in expertise-sharing networks: A social perspective	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						expertise networks; information systems continuance; knowledge management (KM); knowledge networks; peer-to-peer; personalization Siemens ShareNet; reputation; sunk cost	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; SUNK COSTS; WEAK TIES; COMMUNITIES; COMMITMENT; TECHNOLOGY; ESCALATION; DECISION; SUPPORT; COMMUNICATION	As engineering firms, R&D groups, and technical organizations recognize the centrality of their engineers' expertise to their performance, they are widely investing in knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Contemporary KM initiatives increasingly include expertise-sharing networks that help answer questions about who knows what. These systems allow organizations to locate and leverage the specialized engineering and technical expertise that is held in the minds of dispersed individuals. However, stories of such expertise-sharing networks that languish from under-use and abandonment abound and the issue of continuance has received very little attention in prior research. In this paper, we explore this understudied issue. We develop a model of expertise-sharing network system continuance through a four-year observational study of 418 users of two such systems and then empirically test it using multiperiod data collected from 122 users of four such systems. The concept of irretrievable investments was used to guide theoretical development in the initial observational phase of the study. The study makes several unique theoretical contributions. First, it develops a model that illustrates how irretrievable postadoption investments (sunk costs) by individual users of expertise-network systems increase continuance. We empirically show that the model explains approximately half of the total variance in continuance intention. This model advances continuance beyond the traditional expectation-satisfaction model of initial adoption to more advanced postadoption stages of use and theoretically incorporates the network-specificity aspect of postadoption investments in explaining continuance. Specifically, we show that individual users': 1) reputation among peer users of a system increases continuance; 2) system-mediated relationships with other users of the system increase continuance; and 3) investments in personalization of a system initially diminish continuance. Another notable contribution is the development and validation of several new measures for expertise-sharing network constructs.

Despite such importance, various types of environmental barriers (e.g., steep slopes and uneven sidewalks) have limited their mobility. Recent wearable biosensors have shown the potential to less invasively, less laboriously, and continuously detect environmental barriers by measuring stress in older adults' daily trips. However, stress alone could not be indicative of environmental barriers because various stress stimuli (e.g., emotions and physical fatigue) are mixed up in their daily trips. To fill this gap, the authors propose and test a computational approach that spatially identifies stress resulting from environmental barriers by aggregating multiple people's physiological and location data. The proposed approach measures stress commonly sensed from multiple people in a specific location (collective stress) as an indication of environmental barriers, applying wearable biosensors, signal processing, and geocoding. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, collective stress was compared between locations with and without environmental barriers based on 2 weeks of field data collected from the daily trips of 16 subjects. As a result, the collective stress was statistically higher in the locations with environmental barriers than without. This result shows that the proposed approach is feasible to compute collective stress measures that are indicative of environmental barriers. This finding contributes to the body of knowledge by confirming the feasibility of a new computational approach that understands locational stress-inducing factors by spatially aggregating multiple people's physiological signals using wearable biosensors, signal processing, and geocoding. Given the feasibility of the proposed approach to detect environmental barriers, future studies can generate and validate a less invasive, less laborious, and continuous method to detect environmental barriers, which can facilitate mobility improvement.

J	Yasunaga, Y				Yasunaga, Yuko			Why and How ITRS Worked to Recover the Breakdown of "Scaling Law" in 2000s-Structural Frame Analysis of Si-CMOS Semiconductor Technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transistors; Manufacturing; Patents; Electric breakdown; Electronics industry; Silicon; (Dennard&apos; s) Scaling Law; ITRS (International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors); Moore&apos; s Law; planar technology; semiconductor; Si-CMOS; technology roadmap		International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is referred to as one of the most successful roadmapping attempts in high-tech industries. ITRS constantly gave orientation to industries (device/equipment/materials), academia, and governments for continuing miniaturization. The 2000s, the period of utmost attention to ITRS, is also the period of gradual "breakdown" of Dennard's Scaling Law which stipulates the "technological merits" attained by miniaturization of Si-CMOS semiconductors: 1) shrink in chip size; 2) lowered power consumption, and 3) boosted computation speed, simultaneously. The author discusses that ITRS of 2000s had worked for "recovering" the "breakdown" of the Law and that it is attributed to the highly structured nature of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies in a frame of "(manufacturing) process-device structure-function." Then, he evaluates the validity of the hypothesis by analyzing wide range of technologies newly introduced in 2000s, namely 1) variety of supplementary methods for "prolonging" the life of Argon Fluoride Laser lithography; 2) high-k dielectric membranes and metal gate for reducing gate-leak current; and 3) low-k dielectric membranes and strained-silicon transistors to boost computation speed. Thus, the author concludes that 1) ITRS at least functioned to let the consensus (among early adopters) be "established" in wide range of research community; 2) under the "gradual breakdown" of Dennard's Scaling Law in 2000s, ITRS worked to keep the Si-CMOS semiconductor's "killing-three-birds-with-one-stone" nature; and 3) the success of ITRS in 2000s is attributed to the structural frame of Si-CMOS semiconductor technologies characterized as "fixed-in-total and disruptive-in-parts."

Investment Valuation Model for Renewable Energy Systems in Buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							REAL OPTIONS; POWER-GENERATION; LEARNING-CURVE; HEALTH-CARE; PERFORMANCE; RISK; FLEXIBILITY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	Transformative technologies for producing renewable energy have promising features for substantial reductions in carbon emissions and environmental footprints of the building sector. Investments in renewable energy systems require substantial implementation costs followed by a long period of recovering the invested capital through savings in utilities bills. Favorable timing of renewable energy system implementation can reduce capital expenses and enhance returns on investments. An appropriate investment valuation method is needed to identify the appropriate time to implement any given renewable energy system and to find the values of properly scheduled investments. Real options analysis provides the ability to cope with investment timing under uncertainty. However, current real options models are theoretically limited in the context of decision making about investments in building energy improvements. In this paper, the writers address the theoretical limitations of current real options models and create a new real options model to evaluate investment options for renewable energy systems under uncertainty. This theoretically well-founded and practically useful model is tailored to the context of investment decision making for building energy improvements. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the creation of (1) a method to account for uncertainty about energy savings following the implementation of renewable energy systems in buildings; (2) a novel method to estimate the volatility of renewable energy projects subject to uncertainty; and (3) an investment valuation approach to identifying the best time to implement renewable energy systems in buildings and to determine the corresponding investment option value. It is expected that this work will contribute to the construction engineering and management global community by presenting a new class of investment assessment tools that help in making hard energy investment decisions and will therefore increase the likelihood of achieving ambitious goals for the adoption of renewable energy systems.

Recently, a growing interest has evolved in examining the benefits of BIM for project communication networks. Evidence of such interest have been accumulated based on surveys and simulated data in terms of project communication network changes; however, there is still a lack of direct and empirical evidence from the industry. This research relies on actual email logs from project managers as the primary data source for mapping project communication networks. More than 50,000 emails were collected from eight participating companies to model the communication networks of 22 projects (12 BIM projects and 10 non-BIM projects). A social network analysis (SNA) was conducted to compare the differences between the BIM and non-BIM projects. The results indicate that BIM projects have more direct connections and shorter paths among the nodes, making the interpersonal information exchange easier and faster. In addition, it was found that the higher clustering coefficients and simultaneously lower path lengths of the networks in BIM projects result in a strong small worldness, where most nodes are not neighbors, but can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops. Compared with other networks, small-world networks encourage more effective internal collaboration and intergroup information exchange. This research provides direct and real-world evidence about the properties of BIM-enabled project communication networks and helps validate previous studies built on the basis of theoretical models and simulated data. The email log data used in this research are shared with the research community to inspire future findings.

Managing the expectations of external stakeholders in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Review; Management strategy; Construction projects; Stakeholder management; Expectations; External stakeholders	PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM; MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CONFLICT-ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES; MODEL	Purpose - The consideration of external stakeholders has proven to be more critical than internal stakeholders in construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to present the diverse expectations of external stakeholder groups, i.e. governmental authorities, general public, and affected local communities, in construction projects. The practical steps to manage the expectations are also outlined. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage methodology was adopted for the review. The primary terms "stakeholder," "project participants," or "project environment" were first searched in four popularly search engines and eight top journals that publish construction research to retrieve publications. After a second-stage filtering process, the selected data were then analyzed and reviewed in line with the objectives. Findings - In total, 49 common expectations were identified and classified. The results indicate that each stakeholder group pursues expectations in line with the social, environmental, and economic sustainability objectives. For effective management, project managers (PMs) must know stakeholder opportunities and threats, fulfill social responsibilities, establish common goals, apply appropriate strategies, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - The identified expectations are only based on the selected publications. Even though the expectations have been categorized in line with the triple bottom line model, the relative importance of the expectations cannot be ascertained since there is no empirical support. Practical implications - PMs can play safe by acknowledging the stakeholder expectations and employ such strategies to curtail resulting impacts and maximize mutual benefits. The list of expectations could also be used to promote equitable value optimization in projects, enhance needs fulfillment, and facilitate the evaluation of external stakeholder satisfaction. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive checklist of construction stakeholder expectations which hitherto, is lacked in the literature. Moreover, practical steps to manage the expectations of external stakeholders have been discussed.	[Chan, Albert P.

Thus, it is likely that they operate project oversight structures such as a project management office (PMO) differently and focus on a diverse set of functions. This study is dedicated to investigating PMO functions in these two cohorts of organizations to highlight their functional contrast through a quantitative survey in the Australian construction industry. The sample includes PMO units in high-performing organizations delivering successful projects in the construction industry. A literature review was conducted to identify possible functions followed by an empirical survey to solicit expert comments on the importance of each function. The results of an independent-samples t-test revealed a significant difference in the importance of three functions including (1) benchmarking best practices, (2) project management compliance, and (3) project governance, which indicate a distinction between the underpinning role that PMOs play in the public and private sectors. Following this test, the relative importance index (RII) was calculated to compare the importance level of functions and rank them across two sets of public and private organizations. The unique value that this work contributes to the construction engineering and management global community includes (1) exploring similarities and differences of PMO practice in the public and private sectors and (2) revealing the most important PMO functions in high-performing organizations, which can be applied to enhance the chance of PMO success. The findings address a research gap in the literature and contribute to the extant body of knowledge on how to configure effective PMOs in the construction context.

Detection and Semantic Segmentation of Disaster Damage in UAV Footage	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disaster management; Preliminarily damage assessment (PDA); Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Deep learning; Semantic segmentation; Data augmentation	IMAGES	In the aftermath of large-scale disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes, preliminarily damage assessment (PDA) is carried out to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and meet the needs of affected individuals, businesses, and communities. Traditionally, site evaluation and consensus-based assessment techniques are used to estimate the extent of the damage. More recently, given their low-cost, ease of operation, and ability to be deployed ondemand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for disaster response and mitigation. However, the resulting large volume of visual data collected by and shared among first responders and volunteer groups is not used effectively because current practices of processing such data are heavily human-dependent, extremely resource-intensive, and significantly slow compared to the fast-evolving nature and progression of disaster impact. This paper contributes to the core body of knowledge by presenting a fully annotated dataset (with the object classes people, flooded area, and damaged and undamaged building roof, car, debris, vegetation, road, and boat) and a host of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for detecting and segmenting critical objects in the aerial footage of disaster sites. For best results, two CNN-based image segmentation architectures, namely, Mask-RCNN and Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), are adopted (through transfer learning), trained, validated, and tested on annotated videos to detect countable and bulk objects. The paper further introduces a targeted data augmentation technique to preserve data balance, as well as a data-driven approach to splitting highly mismatched classes for better model performance. Through these improvements, the best performing Mask-RCNN model generates pixel-level segmentations of countable objects with a 51.54% mean average precision (mAP). Additionally, the best performing PSPNet models can achieve mean intersection over union (mIoU) as high as 32.17% and accuracy as high as 77.01% on bulk objects.

J	Singh, M; Rathi, R				Singh, Mahipal; Rathi, Rajeev			Empirical Investigation of Lean Six Sigma Enablers and Barriers in Indian MSMEs by Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Lean Six Sigma; Enablers; Barriers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; FUZZY-DEMATEL; Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises; Continuous Improvement; Decision Making & Risk Management; Engineering Management Profession; Organization Development & Change	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES; MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS; SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION; HYBRID APPROACH; DEMATEL METHOD; PERFORMANCE; AHP; ENTERPRISES; SUSTAINABILITY	Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is an inclusive approach based on the concept of waste and variation reduction to achieve quality and sustainability. The successful adoption of any approach depends upon the awareness and readiness measures of a particular one. This paper contributes toward Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to adopt a comprehensive LSS approach in their existing system through the identification, analysis, and prioritization of LSS enablers and barriers. In the present study, 25 enablers and 21 barriers of LSS adoption are identified through literature review and are validated by using questionnaire-based survey. The screened enablers and barriers are further formulated into logical groups using factor analysis. These formulated groups are prioritized through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and compared the obtained results with the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (Fuzzy-DEMATEL). The result reveals that among the main group of enablers, "management-based factor" is the top-ranked followed by "training- and education-based factor" and "technology-based factor" with AHP weights 0.4008, 0.2742, and 0.1465 respectively. On the other hand, among the main groups of barriers, "training and education based factor" is at first rank trailed by "management-based factor" with AHP weights 0.4780 and 0.2915 respectively. The outcomes of current research will facilitate the MSMEs to make a favorable environment toward the LSS approach for increasing productivity and profitability dynamics. An engineering manager can use this paper to enhance social sustainability through the incorporation of LSS approach in the communities where they work. Moreover, this study provides a guiding reference for practitioners and academicians to undertake similar nature of problems into other industrial sectors.

Smart City Digital Twin-Enabled Energy Management: Toward Real-Time Urban Building Energy Benchmarking	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building energy benchmarking; Commercial buildings; Community energy-efficiency; Digital twin; Energy management; Smart city	CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE	To meet energy-reduction goals, cities are challenged with assessing building energy performance and prioritizing efficiency upgrades across existing buildings. Although current top-down building energy benchmarking approaches are useful for identifying overall efficient and poor performers across a portfolio of buildings at a city scale, they are limited in their ability to provide actionable insights regarding efficiency opportunities. Concurrently, advances in smart metering data analytics combined with new data streams available via smart metering infrastructure present the opportunity to incorporate previously undetectable temporal fluctuations into top-down building benchmarking analyses. This paper leveraged smart meter electricity data to develop daily building energy benchmarks segmented by strategic periods to quantify their variation from conventional, annual energy benchmarking strategies and investigate how such metrics can lead to near real-time energy management. The periods considered include occupied periods during the school year, unoccupied periods during the school year, occupied periods during the summer, unoccupied periods during the summer, and peak summer demand periods. Results showed that temporally segmented building energy benchmarks are distinct from a building's overall benchmark. This demonstrates that a building's overall benchmark masks periods in which a building is over- or underperforming during the day, week, or month; thus, temporally segmented energy benchmarks can provide a more specific and accurate measure for building efficiency. We discussed how these findings establish the foundation for digital twin-enabled urban energy management platforms by enabling identification of building retrofit strategies and near-real-time efficiency in the context of the performance of an entire building portfolio. Temporally segmented energy benchmarking measures generated from smart meter data streams are a critical step for integrating smart meter analytics with building energy benchmarking techniques, and for conducting smarter energy management across a large geographic scale of buildings.

This study was conducted to address a long-standing debate in the area of construction waste reduction: financially incentivizing or penalizing during construction. After a questionnaire survey, it was found that construction industry experts prefer financial-based incentive plans to levying. Accordingly, a financial-based incentive plan was developed based on guidelines elicited from comments of the respondents, content analysis, and plugging gaps of previous incentive-based plans. In this plan, the stakeholders are incentivized to save money by redung quantities of purchased materials, wasted materials, landfilled wastes, and illegally dumped wastes. The saving is to be shared among the stakeholders. To investigate the plan's usefulness, the plan was applied to a real construction project through which its serviceability was confirmed. The results of this study uncovered that incentivizing provides better results compared to penalizing in construction waste reduction. The main explanation for this observation is that incentivizing promotes ethics, is more efficient, and is more compatible with sustainable development goals. In addition, viability and on-site waste reduction via promoting professional ethics and motivating stakeholders are determined to be key factors of a successful financial-based incentive plan. In summary, this paper contributes to the construction engineering and management, built environment, and sustainable construction global communities by comparing incentive-based and penalty-based construction waste reduction schemes; providing evidence of preference for incentivizing by enumerating its advantages over penalizing; and finally, introducing professional ethics and personal motivation as two important factors in significant construction waste reduction as well as sustainable building materials management. This is accomplished by basing the design of a reward plan on motivating project stakeholders and developers that is focused on detailed net benefit calculation being applicable to construction projects regardless of their type, geographic location, and kind of construction waste they generate.

It is necessary to pay enough attention to public opinions that generally have a significant impact on megainfrastructure's performance. As the longest sea-crossing bridge in the world, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) receives extensive attention from both the industry of bridge construction and the general public. Every individual is a potential user of this megaproject. Ignorance of public opinion may inhibit the final success of the HZMB. Based on two dimensions of stage and region, this study aims to devise an analytical framework for topic modeling and sentiment analysis of the megainfrastructure in the data-rich era. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a flexible generative probabilistic model was adopted for topic extraction, and the measure of perplexity was used for determining the optimal number of topics in every stage or region. Rule-based sentiment analysis was conducted for identifying sentiment polarity and calculating sentiment intensity values of the validated data set. The results denoted that topics varied in four stages and three regions directly connected to the bridge. Positive comments occupied the largest proportion in every stage or region. According to sentiment polarity and intensity, the proposed approach for sentiment analysis had a higher ability to recognize positive comments from four stages and three regions. This study contributes to public opinion analysis of megainfrastructures within the context of sufficient social media data, which provides new opportunities for data-driven infrastructure management and governance. Management recommendations can be obtained to guide similar infrastructure's public opinion management in future.

J	Li, KY; Cheung, SO				Li, Keyao; Cheung, Sai On			Unveiling Cognitive Biases in Construction Project Dispute Resolution through the Lenses of Third-Party Neutrals	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cognitive biases; Construction project dispute resolution; Third-party neutrals; Minimizing measures	PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; DECISION-MAKING; JUDGMENT; MODEL; ACCESSIBILITY; INFORMATION; CONTRACTOR; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT	Cognitive biases would jeopardize the quality of decisions, yet people are reluctant to admit to being affected. This study explores the types of cognitive bias that may have influences on construction project dispute resolution (CPDR) decisions. Effects of cognitive biases are first operationalized as biased behaviors. Third-party neutrals, including arbitrators, adjudicators, and mediators, were asked to report their observations of disputing parties' biased practices. The use of third-party neutrals aims to improve the objectivity of the data on disputing parties' biased behaviors. Principal component factor analysis (PCFA) on the collected responses suggested four types of cognitive bias: preconception, self-affirmation, optimism, and interest-oriented biases. Among these, interest-oriented bias was found to be the most prominent. This study contributes to CPDR management by proposing bias-minimizing measures. Fuzzy-set linguistic evaluations were employed to assess the usefulness of the measures in view of the nondiscrete nature of the assessments. The findings were further validated through semistructured interviews with experienced dispute management experts. The contributions of the study include: (1) raising the awareness of the potential types of cognitive bias that would affect decisions in CPDR, (2) enhancing the role of third-party neutrals in directing disputing parties away from influences of biases, (3) reminding disputing parties not to undervalue the proposals of the counterparts, and (4) improving dispute management by suggesting a review of all options available at each round of dispute negotiation. Having experienced third-party neutrals as respondents is also a major breakthrough in the study of behaviors of disputing parties.

Evaluating the Impact of Infrastructure Interdependencies on the Emergency Services Sector and Critical Support Functions Using an Expert Opinion Survey	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Disasters; Infrastructure interdependencies; Emergency services sector (ESS); Service disruption expert judgment; Log-linear models	EXTREME EVENTS; RESILIENCE; FAILURE; SYSTEMS; VULNERABILITY; NETWORK; CONSEQUENCES; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS	The vulnerability of critical infrastructure systems and their interdependencies have long-standing implications for community recovery and resilience. Extant research on critical infrastructure interdependencies has focused primarily on the infrastructure systems themselves and has paid less attention to the impact of infrastructure breakdowns on critical services in disasters. This study aims at analyzing the impact of infrastructure interdependencies on the emergency services sector (ESS) and critical support functions using an expert opinion survey of emergency managers, city planners, utility providers, and other stakeholders from two study regions: South Florida and parts of New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), and Eastern Pennsylvania (PA). The majority of the survey respondents identified the loss of power as the most important factor affecting service delivery in their respective sector. Over 70% reported that loss of communications considerably impacted computer-aided dispatch (CAD) capabilities for the coordination of emergency services, dispatch of ambulances, and other medically equipped vehicles, as well as responders' ability to continue their work. A comparison of individual service categories by type of infrastructure disruption and region revealed that there was a similar level of agreement among the respondents regarding the importance of backup power. There is a statistically significant difference in stakeholder responses regarding lack of adequate fuel supply with the stakeholders in the NY-NJ-PA study region more concerned about fuel availability than their counterparts in South Florida. The use of log-linear models to analyze key interdependencies between the ESS and critical infrastructures reveals conditional dependencies with statistically significant associations between critical infrastructure services and coordination of emergency response, access to health services, sheltering, and postdisaster evacuation. The findings from this research have important policy implications for prioritizing infrastructure restoration and improving disaster recovery outcomes.

This paper presents a framework to incorporate nonresident external trips within a travel demand model (TDM), whether it is a four-step model or an activity-based travel framework. This paper first describes the framework components for defining an external region and a series of interlinked models that are joined in a developed simulation platform to estimate external trips. Then, generation and distribution models for external-external (EE), external-internal (EI) and also nonresident non-home-based (NR-NHB) trips are described. The models also take into account the time-of-day (TOD) component for three essential motives: (1) to achieve more consistency in the origin-destination (OD) matrix of the external trips with the OD matrix of the internal trips for route assignment; (2) omitting the need to fit the TOD curves to disaggregate trips from 24-h trip tables into respective periods; and (3) providing an opportunity to better estimate NR-NHB trips which depend on the TOD because these trips are performed far from the home location and the number of such trips may decrease as the time progresses in a day, especially after midday. Furthermore, to minimize the need for any extra data collection, the models were developed using household travel survey data and opensource land-use data. The results suggest the suitability of the data sources to model external trips. Furthermore, the TOD-related variables, including its interaction effect with other explanatory variables, were found to be significant in many models, which signifies the importance of including a TOD component in modeling external trips. Model validation also confirmed the soundness of the proposed models. The paper, therefore, is beneficial for the practitioner community to estimate external trips and incorporate them in the travel demand model estimation. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Defining relational contracting from the Wittgenstein family-resemblance philosophy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Relational contracting; Family-resemblance; Ludwig Wittgenstein; Sunflower Model		There has been an increasing interest in the concept of relational contracting (RC) in construction starting from the late 1990s. RC embraces and underpins different forms of collaborative approaches, including partnering, alliancing, joint venture and other collaborative working arrangements and better risk sharing mechanisms. By applying Nystrom's and Yeung et al.'s similar approaches to define construction partnering and construction alliancing respectively, this paper focuses on RC and family-resemblance. A significant contribution to new knowledge is believed to have been made in providing a concise and comprehensive approach in defining the similar and yet different key components of RC by using a Sunflower Model. The development of this innovative Model is based on the German philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein's family-resemblance philosophy. His idea is that a complex concept can be understood as a network of overlapping similarities. Based on the reported literature, it is concluded that there are always five core elements included in construction RC. They are "commitment", "trust", "cooperation and communication", "common goals and objective", and "win-win philosophy". In addition to these core elements, a number of different non-core elements, or called petals, can be added to constitute a specific variant of RC in construction. The contribution can be of paramount importance to both the research community and the construction industry. By using this innovative theoretical framework to define construction RC, industrial practitioners may find the Sunflower Model useful in the procurement of a construction RC project. The Sunflower Model can be applied to explain the underlying concepts and as a common starting point for discussions between a client and a contractor on how to procure a RC project, thus avoiding any misinterpretations of what a RC project is.

J	Habibi, M; Kermanshachi, S				Habibi, Mohammadreza; Kermanshachi, Sharareh			Phase-based analysis of key cost and schedule performance causes and preventive strategies: Research trends and implications	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Design; Schedule performance; Cost overruns; Delay; Estimating; Construction planning; Engineering phase; Construction phase; Procurement phase; Optimization strategies	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DELAY; MANAGEMENT; OVERRUNS; IMPACTS	Purpose It is estimated that more than half of the construction industry's projects encounter significant cost overruns and major delays, resulting in the industry having a tarnished reputation. Therefore, it is crucial to identify key project cost and schedule performance factors. However, despite the attempts of numerous researchers, their results have been inconsistent. Most of the literature has focused solely on the construction phase budget and time overruns; the engineering/design and procurement phase costs and schedule performances have been rarely studied. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this study was primarily to identify and prioritize engineering, procurement and construction key performance factors (KPFs) and to strategize ways to prevent performance delays and cost overruns. To achieve these objectives, more than 200 peer-reviewed journal papers, conference proceedings and other scholarly publications were studied and categorized based on industry type, physical location, data collection and analysis methods. Findings It was concluded that both the time required to complete engineering/construction phases and the cost of completing them can be significantly affected by design changes. The two main causes of delays and cost overruns in the procurement phase are construction material shortages and price fluctuations. Other factors affecting all phases of the project are poor economic condition, equipment and labor shortages, delays in owners' timely decision making, poor communication between stakeholders, poor site management and supervision, clients' financial issues and severe weather conditions. A list of phase-based strategies which address the issue of time/cost overruns is presented herein. Originality/value The findings of this study address the potential confusion of the industry's practitioners related to the inconsistent list of potential KPFs and their preventive measurements, and pave the way for the construction research community to conduct future performance-related studies.

J	Li, J; Kassem, M				Li, Jennifer; Kassem, Mohamad			Applications of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and Blockchain-enabled smart contracts in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Blockchain; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Construction sector; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); Smart contracts; Systematic review; Thematic analysis	INFORMATION; IOT	The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. 'Systematic reviews' of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A crossthemes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are 'supplementary' technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of 'technological systems' that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.

J	Cullen, C; Leavy, B				Cullen, Christopher; Leavy, Brian			The lived experience of project leadership in a loosely coupled transient context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project management; Project leadership; Leadership roles; Exploratory study; Loosely coupled projects	ORGANIZATIONS; INSIGHTS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the lived experience of the project leader and generate additional insight into the relationship between the social and technical aspects of the actual practice of project leadership, focussing on a particular type of project that is prevalent in practice but largely overlooked in mainstream literature. It is referred to here as a "loosely coupled transient" (LCT) project. Design/methodology/approach - Using an exploratory, inductive approach, the research investigates the lived experience of 30 project management (PM) practitioners to try to deepen the empirical and conceptual insight into the nature of the leadership challenge and what it takes to be successful in the LCT project setting. The research design includes an extra data-collection phase to allow the initial findings and their interpretation to be further validated and refined in the field. Findings - The empirical findings highlight the importance of three socio-behavioural roles: context building, culture-bridging and political brokering, in addition to the more traditional technical coordinating role, and examine their implications for future research and practice. Research limitations/implications - The findings emerging from this study are based on the insights provided by 35 exploratory interviews and while they provide the authors with useful insights into the socio-behavioural roles that practitioners consider necessary, they should now be further examined through more focussed, systematic research. Practical implications - This study points up that project leadership requires new forms of ability and intelligence described in this study as contextual, cultural and political forms of intelligence. Practitioners suggest the findings have a potential usefulness in the selection and training of future project managers. Originality/value - The study attempts to provide a fresh perspective on social phenomena that are context specific, of relevance to PM practice and of interest to the academic community. It contributes to previous PM research by furthering the analysis of actual PM practice that takes place within the project setting by giving explicit consideration to the importance of understanding the contextual, cultural and political influences on leadership in the project setting.

J	Xue, F; Lu, WS; Chen, K; Zetkulic, A				Xue, Fan; Lu, Weisheng; Chen, Ke; Zetkulic, Anna			u From Semantic Segmentation to Semantic Registration: Derivative-Free Optimization-Based Approach for Automatic Generation of Semantically Rich As-Built Building Information Models from 3D Point Clouds	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information model (BIM); As-built BIM; Semantic enrichment; Derivative-free optimization; Semantic registration	SCAN-TO-BIM; OBJECT RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHMS	Development of semantically rich as-built building information models (BIMs) presents an ongoing challenge for the global BIM and computing engineering communities. A plethora of approaches have been developed that, however, possess several common weaknesses: (1)heavy reliance on laborious manual or semiautomatic segmentation of raw data [e.g.,two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) point clouds]; (2)unsatisfactory results for complex scenes (e.g.,furniture or nonstandard indoor settings); and (3)failure to use existing resources for modeling and semantic enrichment. This paper aims to advance a novel, derivative-free optimization (DFO)-based approach that can automatically generate semantically rich as-built BIMs of complex scenes from 3D point clouds. In layman's terms, the proposed approach recognizes candidate BIM components from 3D point clouds, reassembles the components into a BIM, and registers them with semantic information from credible sources. The approach was prototyped in Autodesk Revit and tested on a noisy point cloud of office furniture scanned via a Google Tango smartphone. The results revealed that the semantically rich as-built BIM was automatically and correctly generated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.87cm in 6.44s, which outperformed the well-known iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The approach was then scaled up to a large auditorium scene consisting of 293 chairs to generate a satisfactory output BIM with a precision of 81.9% and a recall of 80.5%. The semantic registration approach also proved superior to existing segmentation approaches in that it is segmentation-free and capable of processing complex scenes and reusing known information. In addition to these methodological contributions, this approach, properly scaled up, will open new avenues for creation of building/city information models from inexpensive data sources and support profound value-added applications such as smart building or smart city developments.

Statistical Approach to Quantifying the Destructive Impact of Natural Disasters on Petroleum Infrastructures	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Natural disasters; Resilience; Petroleum infrastructures; Destructive impacts; Recovery period; System monitoring; cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart	KATRINA	The U.S. petroleum industry is significantly dependent on petroleum infrastructures located in the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico. Natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike have been serious shocks to the U.S. energy supply and energy security. The significant impact of natural disasters on the performance of the petroleum industry emphasizes the importance of analyzing the resilience of petroleum infrastructures against natural disasters. Quantifying the destructive impact of extreme events is the first step toward analyzing the resilience of infrastructure systems. However, currently available hurricane-intensity scales, such as the Saffir-Simpson classification, cannot reflect the impact of hurricanes on critical infrastructures, and there is little knowledge about measuring the magnitude of natural disasters in terms of their destructive impact on petroleum systems. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to properly quantify the effect of natural disasters, compare the disasters in terms of their destructive impact on petroleum processes, and analyze the resilience of petroleum infrastructures. The objective of this study was to develop a systematic approach to statistically quantify the destructive effect of natural disasters on petroleum infrastructures. A system-monitoring process using cumulative sum control charts combined with time-series analysis was conducted on the historical performance records of the three major components of the petroleum industry (i.e., crude oil production, import of petroleum materials, and oil refining processes) to measure the recovery period after a disaster. The reduction in the average performance of the petroleum process during the recovery period then was estimated. The primary contribution of this study to the existing body of knowledge is its development of well-defined metrics and a systematic approach to quantify the destructive impacts of natural disasters on petroleum infrastructures. The results of this study can help decision makers and the construction management community learn more about vulnerabilities in the infrastructure systems during different natural disasters and, consequently, develop different engineering management strategies to address these issues.

Identifying infrastructure vulnerabilities before hazards strike is of paramount significance as it can help minimize the adverse consequences. However, investigating the vulnerability of single infrastructure system is myopic as it neglects the interdependencies between networked infrastructure systems. Owners and operators of different infrastructure systems should collaborate to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities against various hazard types from a system-of-systems standpoint. Nonetheless, systematic high-resolution vulnerability assessment of interdependent infrastructure systems requires versatile data and computational resources. While it is cost intensive and resourceful to develop a gigantic software for assessing infrastructure vulnerability, it is possible to synchronize available toolkits like building information modeling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS) and domain-specific computational engines (DCEs) to perform interdisciplinary infrastructure vulnerability assessment. This paper proposes an integrated BIM-GIS-DCEs approach to facilitate system-of-systems-based infrastructure vulnerability assessment. The proposed approach consists of the following key components: (i) Building information elicitation from BIM model, (ii) Physics-based pre- and post-hazard infrastructure performance simulation using DCEs, and (iii) Data integration and geospatial analysis for decision making on GIS platform. In the proposed approach, BIM provides hazard-sensitive properties of building elements, and DCEs serve to simulate the infrastructure performance before and after hazard occurs based on the predetermined physics-based operating regimes. Essentially, GIS stores the data from heterogeneous sources and mediates the semantic mapping between the simulation tools of distinct infrastructure domains. The embedded geospatial analysis functions in GIS facilitate the investigation of hazard-vulnerable components within an infrastructure system and also the expected hazard impacts at the community scale. The validity of the integrated approach is demonstrated using the stormwater drainage-building-road transport nexus during urban flooding. The integration of BIM, GIS and DCEs constitutes a new modeling paradigm which is expected to provide an effective avenue to formalize the collaborative effort between different infrastructure stakeholders not to mention about its ability to intelligently generate reliable and high-resolution vulnerability assessment results.

The exact goal is typically not known from the beginning, and throughout all design stages, new decisions are made - similarly to other design industries [1]. As a result, the design must adapt and subsequent consequences follow. With working methods being predominantly document-centric, highly interrelated and rapidly changing design data in a complex network of decisions, requirements and product specifications is primarily captured in static documents. In this paper, we consider a purely data-driven approach based on semantic web technologies and an earlier proposed Ontology for Property Management (OPM). The main contribution of this work consists of extensions for OPM to account for new competency questions including the description of property reliability and the reasoning logic behind derived properties. The secondary contribution is the specification of a homogeneous way to generate parametric queries for managing an OPM-compliant AEC Knowledge Graph (AEC-KG). A software library for operating an OPM-compliant AEC-KG is further presented in the form of an OPM Query Generator (OPM-QG). The library generates SPARQL 1.1 queries to query and manipulate construction project Knowledge Graphs represented using OPM. The OPM ontology aligns with latest developments in the W3C Community Group on Linked Building Data and suggests an approach to working with design data in a distributed environment using separate graphs for explicit facts and for materialised, deduced data. Finally, we evaluate the suggested approach using an open-source software artefact developed using OPM and OPM-QG, demonstrated online with an actual building Knowledge Graph. The particular design task evaluated is performing heat loss calculations for spaces of a future building using an AEC-KG described using domain- and project specific extensions of the Building Topology Ontology (SOT) in combination with OPM. With this work, we demonstrate how a typical engineering task can be accomplished and managed in an evolving design environment, thereby providing the engineers with insights to support decision making as changes occur. The application uses a strict division between the client viewer and the actual data model holding design logic, and can easily be extended to support other design tasks.

As an important issue in the construction industry, safety management issues have been researched from different perspectives. Although previous studies make knowledge contributions to the safety management research of construction industry, there are still huge obstacles to distinguish the comprehensive knowledge map of safety management research in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach This study applies three scientometric analysis methods, collaboration network analysis, co-occurrence network analysis and cocitation network analysis, to the safety management research of construction industry. 5,406 articles were retrieved from the core collection database of the Web of Science. CiteSpace was used for constructing a comprehensive analysis framework to analyze and visualize the safety management research of construction industry. According to integrating the analysis results, a knowledge map for the safety management research of construction industry can be constructed. Findings The analysis results revealed the academic communities, key research topics and knowledge body of safety management research in the construction industry. The evolution paths of safety management research in the construction industry were divided into three development stages: "construction safety management", "multi-objective safety management" and "comprehensive safety management". Five research directions were predicted on the future safety management research of construction industry, including (1) comprehensive assessment indicators system; (2) intelligent safety management; (3) cross-organization collaboration of safety management; (4) multilevel safety behavior perception and (5) comparative analysis of safety climate. Originality/value The findings can reveal the overall status of safety management research in the construction industry and represent a high-quality knowledge body of safety management research in the construction industry that accurately reflects the comprehensive knowledge map on the safety management research of construction industry. The findings also predict important highlights and future research directions of safety management research in the construction industry, which will help researchers in the safety management research of construction industry for future collaboration and work.

Therefore the erection of lunar and Martian structures, suitable for permanent human presence is increasingly discussed by the scientific community. Various concepts have been proposed for creation of lunar and Martian permanent bases. Tech-niques ranging from 3D printing of concrete, through utilization of natural caves to inflatable pressurized tensile structures are considered. In authors' opinion a fast, accurate and remote measuring technique will be necessary for successful completion of majority of extra-terrestrial construction tasks. The terrestrial laser scanning tech-nique should be used for the lunar and Martian construction projects. To assess the suitability of terrestrial laser scanning techniques which are going to be used on the Moon and Mars, initial measurements should be con-ducted on Earth. Unfortunately extra-terrestrial soils are not available for general research. The only feasible solution is to use lunar and Martian soil simulants to practice construction technologies, techniques and stra-tegies. The main aim of this research programme is radiometric and geometric analysis of TLS point clouds collected during the measurement of lunar and Martian soil simulants targets. The conducted research pro-gramme was focused on the analysis of a laser beam dispersion and absorption in soil simulants. It should be noted that the dispersion and absorption of a laser beam for the scanned surface is a key factor in TLS remote measurements. The advantages and limitations of TLS technique for possible lunar and Martian applications was discussed. Areas of subsequent research were pointed out. In the first section the brief state-of-the-art was given in context of the conducted research programme. Subsequently, in section two used specimens and equipment was described. The third section of the paper was dedicated to present the conducted research programme. The achieved results were shown in section four in the form of tables and graphs. Finally, in section five the dis-cussion was carried out and followed by a list of drawn conclusions. It was proved that TLS technique can be used to effectively scan LSS and MSS, thus scanning on the Moon and Mars is enabled.

To ensure that the acquired point clouds are suitable to any given application, data collection must guarantee that all scanning targets are acquired with the specified data quality, and within time limits. Efficiency of data collection is important to reduce jobsite activity disruptions. Effective and efficient laser scanning data collection can be achieved through a prior planning optimisation process, which can be called Planning for Scanning (P4S). In the construction domain, the P4S problem has attracted increasing interest from the research community and a number of approaches have been proposed. This manuscript presents a systematic review of prior P4S works in the AEC domain and presents a categorisation of point cloud data quality criteria. The review starts with the identification and grouping in three categories of the point cloud data quality criteria that are commonly considered as constraints to the P4S problem. The three categories of data quality criteria include 1) completeness, 2) accuracy and spatial resolution, and 3) ?registrability?. The prior P4S works are then reviewed in a structured way by contrasting them in the way they formulate the P4S optimisation problem: the type of inputs they assume (model and possible scanning locations), the constraints they consider, and the algorithm they utilise to solve the optimisation problem. This work makes two contributions: (1) it identifies gaps in knowledge that require further research such as the need to establish a fully automated scan plan which provides the optimum coverage in construction domain specifically for indoor construction; and (2) it provides a framework ? principally a set of criteria ? for others to compare new P4S methods against the existing state of the art in the field. This will not only be valuable for young researchers who want to start research in solving the P4S problem, but also for the ones already working in the domain to rethink the problem from different perspectives.

J	Cheng, Z; Ke, YJ; Yang, ZS; Cai, JM; Wang, HM				Cheng, Zhe; Ke, Yongjian; Yang, Zhenshan; Cai, Jianming; Wang, Huanming			Diversification or convergence An international comparison of PPP policy and management between the UK, India, and China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnership (PPP); International comparative; Policy evaluation; Project finance; Management; Globalization	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; PROJECTS; MONEY; INFRASTRUCTURE; FINANCE; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; DYNAMICS; SECTOR; COST	Purpose As an innovation model for infrastructure and public service delivery, public-private partnership (PPP) has been widely adopted around the world. The knowledge spillover effect and policy diffusion mechanism have played an important role in promoting the development of PPP in the context of globalization. A comparative evaluation of the policy and management of PPP in different countries will help to understand the development of PPP, provide decision-making reference for PPP policy embedded with specific national conditions of each country, and also contribute to the global PPP knowledge body. Design/methodology/approach Based on the principle of comparability and representativeness, this study selected three countries, namely, China, India, and the United Kingdom for comparative analysis. This study first introduced the policy process and key institutions of PPP in three countries. Secondly, a comparative analysis of the development characteristics and application of PPP was conducted based on the official database of three countries. Finally, the differences, influencing factors and development trends of international PPP development were analyzed based on the comparative research results, and suggestions for PPP policy and management were put forward. Findings The research results indicate the development fluctuation and unbalanced spatial distribution of PPPs are a common phenomenon in the three countries. The UK has a significant impact on the policy and development of PPP in other countries. However, under the combined influence of factors such as economic, urbanization, political regime and social culture, there are significant differences in the PPP institution, application, and project characteristics in various countries. Due to international exchanges and knowledge spillovers, as well as the promotion of intermediaries, the development of PPP worldwide tends to converge. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to systematically compare and analyze the global PPP difference and development trend based on PPP project databases of different countries. Different from previous PPP comparative research based on perception data, the project data-based comparative analysis in this study is helpful to understand the characteristics, interrelations, and trends of global PPP development and enrich the existing PPP knowledge body. This study also proposes that it is possible to establish a global PPP knowledge community in the context of globalization and global production network.

In the past two decades, the AEC community has examined different approaches, including virtual and augmented reality, to improve communication, visualization, and coordination among different project participants; yet these approaches are slowly being adopted by the industry. Such technological advancements have the potential to improve and revolutionize the current approaches in design (e.g., by involving end-user feedback to ensure higher performing building operations and end-user satisfaction), in construction (e.g., by improving safety through virtual training), and in operations (e.g., by visualizing real-time sensor data to improve diagnostics). The authors' research vision builds upon the value of using immersive virtual environments (IVEs) during the design, construction, and operation phases of AEC projects. IVEs could provide a sense of presence found in physical mock-ups and make evaluation of an increased set of potential design alternatives possible in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Yet, in order to use IVEs during the design, construction, and operation phases of buildings, it is important to ensure that the data collected and analyzed in such environments represent physical environments. To test whether IVEs are adequate representations of physical environments and to measure user performance in such environments, this paper presents results from an experiment that investigates user performance on a set of everyday office-related activities (e.g., reading text and identifying objects in an office environment) and benchmarks the participants' performance in a similar physical environment. Sense of presence is also measured within an IVE through a set of questionnaires. By analyzing the experimental data from 112 participants, the authors concluded that the participants perform similarly in an NE setting as they do in the benchmarked physical environment for all of the measured tasks. The questionnaire data show that the participants felt a strong sense of presence within an NE. Based on the experimental data, the authors thus demonstrate that an NE can be an effective tool in the design phase of AEC projects in order to acquire end-user performance feedback, which might lead to higher performing infrastructure design and end-user satisfaction.

K.; Garcia de Soto, Borja			Assessment of the cybersecurity vulnerability of construction networks	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction network; CVSS; Cybersecurity; Risk management; Security score; Vulnerability assessment; Vulnerability metrics	RISKS	Purpose The aim of this study is o examine the advantages and disadvantages of different existing scoring systems in the cybersecurity domain and their applicability to the AEC industry and to systematically apply a scoring system to determine scores for some of the most significant construction participants. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a methodology that uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to calculate scores and the likelihood of occurrence based on communication frequencies to ultimately determine risk categories for different paths in a construction network. As a proof of concept, the proposed methodology is implemented in a construction network from a real project found in the literature. Findings Results show that the proposed methodology could provide valuable information to assist project participants to assess the overall cybersecurity vulnerability of construction and assist during the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this information to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its vulnerability, which will lead to the overall improvement of the security of the construction network. Research limitations/implications It has to be noted that the scoring systems, the scores and categories adopted in the study need not necessarily be an exact representation of all the construction participants or networks. Therefore, caution should be exercised to avoid generalizing the results of this study. Practical implications The proposed methodology can provide valuable information and assist project participants to assess the overall cyber-vulnerability of construction projects and support the vulnerability-management processes. For example, a project owner can use this approach to get a better understanding of what to do to limit its cyber-vulnerability exposure, which will ultimately lead to the overall improvement of the construction network's security. This study will also help raise more awareness about the cybersecurity implications of the digitalization and automation of the AEC industry among practitioners and construction researchers. Social implications Given the amount of digitized services and tools used in the AEC industry, cybersecurity is increasingly becoming critical for society in general. In some cases, (e.g. critical infrastructure) incidents could have significant economic and societal or public safety implications. Therefore, proper consideration and action from the AEC research community and industry are needed. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure and assess the cybersecurity of individual participants and the construction network as a whole by using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System.

The concept of sustainability rose to prominence in the late 1980s and became a central issue in world politics, when the construction industry began to generate the first sustainable building assessment systems with more or less equally weighted environmental, economic, and social aspects for office buildings over their life cycles. On the other hand, resilience is usually connected to the occurrence of extreme events during the life cycle of structures and infrastructures. In the last decade, it has been used to minimize specifically direct and indirect losses from hazards through enhanced resistance and robustness to extreme events, as well as more effective recovery strategies. A detailed comparison of the studies dealing with either infrastructure sustainability or resilience presented in this paper leads to the conclusion that they have a vast number of similarities and common characteristics. For instance, they both combine structural analyses with social and economic aspects; they both rely on techniques for the life-cycle analysis and decision making; they both are in an early stage, where the academic world is trying to find the best way to promote the application of the scientific results among professional engineers and the industry. Indeed, both approaches try to optimize a system, such as a civil infrastructure system, with respect to structural design, utilized material, maintenance plans, management strategies, and impacts on the society. However, for the most part, researchers and practitioners focusing on either resilience or sustainability operate without a mutual consideration of the findings, which leads to a severe inefficiency. Therefore, this paper suggests that resilience and sustainability are complementary and should be used in an integrated perspective. In particular, the proposed approach is rooted in the well-established framework of risk assessment. The impact of the infrastructure and its service states on the society in normal operational conditions (assessed by sustainability analysis) and after exceptional events (assessed by resilience analysis) should be weighted by the associated probabilities of occurrence and combined in a global impact assessment. The proposed perspective and assessment technique is applicable to various types of civil infrastructure systems, but the case of transportation networks and bridge systems is emphasized herein. A numerical application dealing with the comparative analysis of two possible bridge layouts is presented to exemplify the approach. The results show that both resilience and sustainability analyses assess a relevant amount of the impact of the bridge on the community where it is built, so neither one can be neglected.

J	Gu, N; London, K				Gu, Ning; London, Kerry			Understanding and facilitating BIM adoption in the AEC industry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Information Modelling; Industry adoption; Focused group interviews; Collaborative BIM Decision Framework		Building Information Modelling (BIM) is one of the important areas in current Virtual Reality (VR) research. VR research considers not only the technological development, a very important part of the research also concerns the application of the technologies and their adoption by the practices. This paper firstly presents an analysis of the current state of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and a reassessment of its role and potential contribution in the near future. The paper analyses the readiness of the industry with respect to the (1) product, (2) processes and (3) people, to position BIM adoption in terms of current status and expectations across disciplines. The findings indicate that there were both technical and non-technical issues that need consideration. The evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of adoption and therefore the need for a specific tool to facilitate BIM adoption. The study revealed that even the market leaders who are early technology adopters in the Australian industry in many cases have varying degrees of practical experiential knowledge of BIM and hence at times different understandings and different levels of confidence regarding the future diffusion of BIM technology throughout the industry. There have been numerous factors affecting BIM adoption, which can be grouped into two main areas: technical tool functional requirements and needs, and non-technical strategic issues. There are varying levels of adoption and understanding within countries - from discipline to discipline and client to client. There are also varying levels of adoption from country to country and although many researchers and practitioners espouse collaborative working environments there are still challenges to be met in many parts of the world, particularly, in relation to a fully integrated collaborative multidisciplinary mode of operation. The challenges for the research community lie not only in addressing the technical solutions or addressing human centred issues but it is also in creating the enabling environment of a decision framework, which integrates both the technical and non-technical challenges. The need for guidance on where to start, what tools are available and how to work through the legal, procurement and cultural challenges was evidenced in the exploratory study. Therefore the Collaborative BIM Decision Framework has been initiated to facilitate the BIM adoption in the AEC industry, based upon these industry concerns, which consists of four interrelated key elements. The findings are drawn from a major research project funded by the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI), with a focus on the Australian context.

Low-cost internet of things (IoT) for monitoring and optimising mining small-scale trucks and surface mining shovels	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); Fleet information system (FIS); Fleet management systems (FMS); Mining equipment; Material handling	INDUSTRY 4.0; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; TECHNOLOGY	This paper discusses the design and deployment of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) in medium-scale open pit mines to optimise the performance of their mining small-scale trucks and surface mining shovels. Low-cost IoT can be implemented in medium-scale operations to automate the collection of process management information that is currently measured manually, replicating part of the results delivered by commercial Fleet Management Systems (FMSs) such as the calculations of the number of truck cycles per shift, the shovel loading time, truck and shovel positioning, tonnes moved per day, truck speed and average fleet efficiency. The process of developing mining benches can also be monitored. By monitoring these tasks, FMSs in the mining industry allow mine operators to maximise productivity, reduce the number of equipment required to accomplish production targets, minimise material re-handling, supply the plant as planned and meet ore blending objectives for better metallurgical recoveries. In the case of large-scale mines, these mining operations are prepared to invest in the high cost of a typical FMS (of the order of $100,000/ month depending on fleet size) because they enable mine operators to ensure that their capital-intensive fleets operate at peak productivity, generating maximum return on investment. By contrast, many medium-scale mines cannot afford the installation and ongoing costs associated with a commercial FMS. Medium-scale mines typically have low capitalization, rented mining fleet and are run on a day-to-day basis, with staff being employed or laid off on an almost continuous basis. The emergence of low-cost IoT promises widespread and access to sensors and data that can be used for operational decision-making. This paper presents a trial of a low-cost, under $100, IoT-based Fleet Information System (FIS). The system does not attempt to replicate the functionality of a full FMS but delivers key management information to the mine operators while having low capital and running costs and no requirement for IT or technical skills for installation or maintenance. In a test case in Chile, the FIS was used to inform operational management changes that resulted in a reduction of loading time, optimisation of mining truck routes and truck speed control for better safety without an increase in the mining cost. The low cost of the solution allows medium-scale mines access to tools that can enable them to mirror the performance improvements of their bigger competitors. For medium-scale mines, that means longer life-of-mine, more local employment and a longer positive impact in the community.

J	Brown, J; Loosemore, M				Brown, Jeremy; Loosemore, Martin			Behavioural factors influencing corrupt action in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Culture; Ethics; Organizational culture; Industry; Management; Corrupt action	DESIRES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore behavioural factors which are perceived to influence corrupt action in the Australian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draw on Rabl and Kuhlmann's Model of a corrupt action and the results of face-to-face interviews with 23 people working in the Australian construction industry. Findings - The results suggest that corruption is ambiguously defined yet perceived to be very common and primarily associated with personal gain rather than breaking the law. The main forms of corruption were identified as kickbacks, fraud and bribery and this behaviour is perceived to be driven by high goal feasibility, by conducive attitudes and supportive subjective norms and by high perceived behavioural control over being caught. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a relatively small sample of 23 respondents and the use of snowball sampling may have meant that the respondents would tend to present a particular view of the industry. It is also important to point out that this research took place within a highly politicised environment coinciding the with launch of the third Royal Commission into corruption in the construction industry and is based on the respondent's perceptions of corruption rather than incontrovertible evidence of corruption in practice. Nevertheless, given the care the authors took to avoid these biases, it does provide a useful window in the incidence and types of corruption in construction and the behavioural factors that might influence it. Practical implications - In terms of tackling corruption, it is recommended that greater attention be given to exploring the culture of the industry which appears to normalise corrupt behaviour and to the hidden informal "institutions" which appear to be undermining the many formal policies and procedures which have been put in place to tackle corruption in the construction industry. Social implications - The global construction industry has been identified by Transparency International as the most bribery-prone of 19 industries it rated. The cost is huge with scarce resources being diverted from much needed urban regeneration, community concerns about development being ignored, individual human rights being abused, productivity and efficiency being compromised and important environments, cultures and heritage being destroyed. In Australia, concerns about corruption in the construction industry have led to an unprecedented three Royal Commissions which have argued that there is a culture which encourages, accepts and rewards this behaviour. Originality/value - By using Rabl and Kuhlmann's Theory of a corrupt action this paper throws new light on how corruption is defined by members of the construction industry. The findings suggest that while formal technical and procedural solutions to corruption are important in addressing corruption they are likely to be undermined by strong cultures and informal institutions which dictate the "rules of the game" on the ground. There is a clear need to better understand how these informal institutions work to constrain formal rules devised to bring about reform.

J	Hernandez, P; Kenny, P				Hernandez, Patxi; Kenny, Paul			Integrating occupant preference and life cycle energy evaluation: a simplified method	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						comfort; embodied energy; energy analysis; housing; life cycle; low-energy houses; occupant behaviour	THERMAL COMFORT; NATURAL VENTILATION; CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; BUILDINGS; CLIMATE	Building energy evaluation and assessment methods have evolved over the last decades towards sophisticated tools, which can support designers in minimizing building energy use. However, the majority of building energy performance evaluation methods and tools generally do not include a life cycle perspective, choosing to ignore the use of resources associated with the additional materials and systems employed to reduce the energy use of buildings in operation. Considerations of 'acceptable' or 'expected' levels of comfort or occupant preferences are also frequently ignored outside the research community. This paper describes a simple methodology which integrates life cycle energy analysis and comfort expectations with building energy evaluation. It discusses the potential contribution of the occupants' preferences not only in the energy use of buildings in operation, but also the embodied energy associated with equipment and systems. The method is demonstrated in a case study considering a house in a maritime climate with the options of either mechanical or natural ventilation, and some differences in thermal and ventilation preferences. In the study it is observed that as 'zero heating' demand is approached, the embodied energy of materials and systems becomes significant. The differences in occupants' expected temperature and ventilation levels can be important issues to consider when selecting heating and ventilation systems for minimum life cycle energy use. Les methodes d'evaluation energetique des batiments ont evolue au cours des dernieres decennies vers des outils evolues, qui peuvent aider les concepteurs a reduire au minimum l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments. Cependant, la majorite des methodes et des outils d'evaluation de la performance energetique des batiments n'integre generalement pas la perspective du cycle de vie, preferant ignorer l'utilisation des ressources associees aux materiaux et aux systemes complementaires employes pour reduire l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments en service. La prise en compte de niveaux de confort << acceptables >> ou << conformes aux attentes >> ou des preferences des occupants est egalement frequemment ignoree en dehors de la communaute des chercheurs. Cet article decrit une methodologie simple qui integre l'analyse energetique du cycle de vie et les attentes en matiere de confort a l'evaluation energetique des batiments. Il discute de la contribution potentielle des preferences des occupants, non seulement s'agissant de l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments en service, mais egalement de l'energie grise liee aux materiaux et aux systemes. Une demonstration de cette methode est apportee par une etude de cas qui examine une maison sous un climat maritime offrant le choix d'une aeration mecanique ou naturelle et soumise a un certain nombre de differences concernant les preferences thermiques et d'aeration. Il est observe dans cette etude que, lorsque l'exigence d'un cout de << chauffage zero >> doit etre satisfaite, l'energie intrinseque des materiaux et des systemes devient importante. Les differences relatives aux attentes des occupants concernant les niveaux de temperature et d'aeration peuvent etre des points importants a prendre en compte lors de la selection des systemes de chauffage et d'aeration pour pouvoir obtenir une utilisation minimale d'energie au cours du cycle de vie.

J	Rashed, A; Mutis, I				Rashed, Ahmed; Mutis, Ivan			Trends of integrated project delivery implementations viewed from an emerging innovation framework	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Integrated project delivery; Science mapping; Technology innovation systems	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COLLABORATION; DESIGN; SCIENCE; IPD; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose Research into integrated project delivery (IPD) has attracted increased attention over the past 2 decades, and a significant number of IPD studies have been published more recently. The purpose of the study is to explore the state of IPD to reveal innovative areas of focus. Design/methodology/approach The research presented puts forward a science mapping and bibliometrics methods to study systematic analysis of IPD scientific output published between 2006 and 2020. It uses a framework from emerging literature relating to innovation to incorporate a perspective of the process of innovation for the analysis of IPD. The adapted framework from the literature on innovation, called the Technology Innovation System (TIS), has functions that reveal novelty in the existing structures of IPD. The framework uses the analysis of scientific output from science mapping and bibliometric study techniques, using the ScienceDirect (SD) and Web of Science (WoS) databases as sources. The framework analyzes factors involved in the development and diffusion of the IPD approach and charts new knowledge development on IPD. Findings From the analysis, future implementation of IPD will converge on cases of collaboration, as a systemic feature, among participating stakeholder teams. A significant and robust effect resulted from collaboration and integration as major mechanisms influence opportunities, problems and solutions within construction firms using IPD, marking a future trend. Reports further substantiate the importance and focus on collaboration and integration between IPD practitioners. With the same dynamic and gradual prominence, building information modeling (BIM) and new technology applications demonstrated the importance of the development and diffusion of IPD in the form of, for example, digital government initiatives. It is expected that the trend for IDS and resource mobilization functions will continue to grow - clear evidence of the benefits of the IPD approach in the construction sector. New evidence for gaining cognitive and normative legitimacy emerged. The expansion of new avenues for further legitimation is expected to enable growth. Research limitations/implications Beyond the innovative approach of viewing IPD from the emerging innovation framework, the research presented fully contributes to IPD literature, providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art status and a quantitative analysis of IPD scientific output, thereby illuminating promising work areas for future research into IPD. The main limitation is related to the dynamic process of indexing of IPD literature in the WoS and SD - although many new research publications are added in the discipline, only a part of them have been indexed in the WoS and SD core database. Practical implications The study revealed key evolving trends within the field, including instructive findings and implications concerning possible deficiencies. Based on factors from network visualizations and quantitative evaluation from major influential articles, journals and authors, future critical IPD implementation focus will be on BIM and sustainability concepts - centerpiece concepts for the evolving line of IPD growth and development in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. Social implications This study fills the gap created in a shortage of studies mapping out the most critical contributions in journals, authors and research perspectives related to IPD. It presents a framework that can be used as an objective procedure to evaluate the topic. It is expected that the study will serve as a cornerstone for researchers in this field, as it provides a bibliometric analysis and presents trends using an analytical framework of innovation. Originality/value The research presented is a keystone in the foundation of the literature review on this topic. The research draws on an existing framework for innovation - the TIS, developed from innovation studies using a robust theoretical framework to enable further analysis of IPD. This approach is one of a kind, using the results of scientometric analysis to study the scientific landscape and knowledge output of IPD in the AEC community. Science-mapping bibliometric analysis was conducted to shed light on IPD trends and explain factors that back or support the development and diffusion of IPD, including shaping and enabling evolution and growth. The framework helps to shed light on the interaction of socio-technical structures (i.e. stakeholders, technologies and rules) embedded in the industry, which helped create, direct and advance IPD in the project delivery system.
