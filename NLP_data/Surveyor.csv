H.; Liu, Rui; Xia, Bo			The use of building information modelling by quantity surveyors in facilities management roles	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantity surveyors; BIM; Facilities management	BIM	Purpose Adoption of building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM) provides an information platform to store and exchange asset data. Quantity Surveyors, with cost management expertise, are increasingly involved in FM roles in the operation phase. However, no study has been conducted on how BIM may assist Quantity Surveyors when contracted in FM roles. This study aims to identify the potential benefits and challenges of using BIM by Quantity Surveyors in FM roles. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with eight professionals from an international built and natural asset design and management company and its FM business partner in Australia. Findings Lack of complete and accurate data was the main issue faced by Quantity Surveyors in FM. The benefits of BIM in FM were digitizing and storing asset information and developing a cost database that would be useful for Quantity Surveyors, whereas challenges included keeping model data up to date, cost, industry resistance to change and contractors' lack of model use. Originality/value This study contributes to revealing the niche adoption of BIM by Quantity Surveyors in FM and identifying the issues faced by Quantity Surveyors in FM roles using BIM. It contributes to the knowledge of BIM adoption in post-construction. Findings will be useful to develop strategies for adopting BIM in FM and supporting Quantity Surveyors' roles in FM.

Using basic skills required of procurement officers, this study examined the ability of quantity surveyors to function as procurement officers. Data were collected through questionnaires administered on quantity surveyors and procurement managers. The importance of identified skills was examined using Mean item score; Spearman's rank correlation was employed to test relationships while Mann-Whitney test was used to examine the difference in opinions of respondents. The most important skills required for procurement officers are technical and tactical skills. Although, the level of exhibition of these skills by quantity surveyors is a little above average, their performance is low in comparison with the level of importance of the skills. The identified skills are not significantly exhibited by quantity surveyors and their areas of strength are inversely proportional to the importance of the skills. However, for quantity surveyors to function as procurement managers, identified basic skills are major requirements. It is therefore essential for these skills to be incorporated into various Continuous Programme Development of the quantity surveyors' regulatory bodies to improve their procurement skills.

Design/methodology/approach - Organizational commitment and propensity to trust is linked through the framework of social exchange. Quantitative approach with questionnaire survey is employed to investigate whether propensity to trust would enhance organizational commitment. Questionnaires are sent to the quantity surveyors who are professional members of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and are working in the Hong Kong construction industry. In total, 71 valid responses are obtained for data analysis. Findings - Contrary to prediction, propensity to trust does not show significant relationship with both affective and continuance commitment. The two propensity to trust scales show different results on the relationship with normative commitment (NC). When working relationship is taken into consideration, quantity surveyor's propensity to trust the partner who has the worst working relationship has significant and positive impact on the surveyor's NC level; whilst quantity surveyor's propensity to trust the partner who has the best working relationship does not has significant positive impact on the surveyor's NC level. Practical implications - To improve propensity to trust among quantity surveyors, consultant companies should provide professional-related training programme to quantity surveyors as to explore their potential. The provision of training programs would also help quantity surveyors feel that they are supported by the organization, which would improve their commitment to the organization. Originality/value - This is the first study to apply the social exchange theory to study organizational commitment within the quantity surveying profession and construction industry, which provides a new point for understanding the concept amongst the profession and industry.

Competencies of the quantity surveyor in performing for sustainable construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Quantity surveying competencies; quantity surveyor; sustainable construction; techniques	SYSTEMS	Sustainable construction has become a feasible solution for overcoming various social, economic and environmental issues faced by the construction industry. Because of the vital role quantity surveyors play in construction, involvement in sustainable construction has become essential. However, there is a literature gap and an industry need to identify how quantity surveying inputs can contribute to sustainable construction. This study, therefore, aimed to identify the significance of quantity surveying competencies in sustainable construction in Sri Lanka. A literature review was first carried out followed by interviews and a questionnaire survey. The findings revealed that construction technology and environmental services; computer literacy; ethics and professional practice; leadership and management; and measurement and costing as areas in sustainable construction which are significant to quantity surveyors, and therefore, competencies in these areas need to be developed. The research ranked sustainable approaches and sustainable techniques based on the significance of their associated quantity surveying inputs. The research recommends construction technology and environmental services; computer literacy; ethics and professional practice; leadership and management; and measurement and costing as areas in which competencies of quantity surveyors need to be given consideration in sustainable approaches and sustainable techniques. Quantity surveyors possessing these competencies will enhance sustainable construction.	[Chamikara, P. B. S.; Perera, B. A. K. S.; Rodrigo, M. N.

Studies indicated that the estimation of contingency sum is associated with challenges, where some contractors consider contingency as part of their profit and this has resulted in disputes amongst consultants and contractors. Researches in developing economies (Ghana) have focused on the generic determination of cost contingency with little on the perspective of quantity surveyors who are the main players in the determination of contingency. The aim of this study was to identify the main triggers influencing the determination of contingency sum for building works from the perspective of Ghanaian quantity surveyors. Through literature, triggers were analyzed and ranked with relative importance index, also, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to measure the degree of agreement amongst public and private quantity surveyors. Though all the categories were relevant, economic, exogenous and technical were paramount. Taxation was among the least influential triggers. This study provides information for players in building sector on triggers that require attention and also help them establish their own cost data, which will assist Quantity Surveyors and policy makers in their budgetary preparation for future projects.

J	Adafin, J; Rotimi, JOB; Wilkinson, S				Adafin, Johnson; Rotimi, James O. B.; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Risk impact assessments in project budget development: quantity surveyors' perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Elemental cost plan; final tender sum; New Zealand; quantity surveyor; traditional building procurement; variability	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS; ACCURACY; MANAGEMENT	One aspect of construction project budgeting requiring attention is the inaccuracy of early estimates during design development. Accuracy of estimates is important to project owners and their financiers. However, inconsistent risk information makes this difficult to achieve. Proper risk analysis could offer a partial solution by reducing the variance between design-stage elemental cost plans (ECPs) and final tender sums (FTS) of construction projects. This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between ECPs and FTS. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant during design development. Data for the study were sourced from 62 practicing quantity surveyors (QS) through an online questionnaire survey. Survey responses were analysed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk measure and Spearman's correlation. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software facilitated the analysis, and top ten risk factors were found important for practicing quantity surveyors in New Zealand (NZ). The identified risk factors were responsible for the variability observed. The values obtained from the analysis would enable greater accuracy in the forecast of FTS by quantity surveyors. As a main contribution, the study creates awareness of the risk factors that should be given considerable attention by consultants at project outset, to guard against wide variation between the design-stage ECPs and FTS. This knowledge could assist quantity surveyors to pro-actively manage their client's fund. In addition, these findings can assist in the development of a predictive model that construction industry practitioners in NZ could use for reliable estimation of FTS from the design-stage ECP.

J	Amuda-Yusuf, G; Mohamed, SF				Amuda-Yusuf, Ganiyu; Mohamed, Sarajul Fikri			Essential features of a building services standard method of measurement in Malaysia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Malaysia; Standards; Construction management; Cost estimates; Building services; Quantity surveying	COST ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; PROJECTS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the need to develop building service standard method of measurement (BSSMM) that would provide a home ground advantage and a framework for managing the cost of building services by quantity surveyors. Design/methodology/approach - A review of previous research on the rules of measurement was carried out. This exercise provides the basis for questionnaire design which was administered to quantity surveyors in Malaysia construction industry. Findings - The results indicated the need to develop BSSMM. In total, 23 variables were identified as essential features of such standard method of measurement. These variables were grouped into three categories and a priority ranking of them was carried out. The analysis revealed a strong agreement among quantity surveyors on the priority ranking of the essential features of the BSSMM. Research limitations/implications - Although, the research would assist industry stakeholders in developing BSSMM that reflects local and international best practices, there is need to further investigate how the rules of the BSSMM could be aligned with construction industry classification systems. Practical implications - The availability of information and computer technology (ICT) tools has transformed the traditional practices in the industry and offered values to quantity surveyors, but if quantity surveyors' tools cannot be consolidated and incorporated into emerging ICT applications, then QS collaboration will be difficult, and the requirements for electronic data exchange will be impractical. Therefore, this type of standard method of measurement will facilitate cross-referencing and coordination between BoQ and other documents such as drawings, specifications and tender produced by other project participants and thereby lay efficient foundation for effective collaboration of quantity surveyors in BIM model. In addition, the BSSMM will not only comply with local industry practices, it will also be internationally compatible. Originality/value - Adoption of a structured format based on BSSMM to present building services cost information is essential in view of the increase in the value and complexity of building services in modern buildings. However, there is need to enhance quantity surveyors' knowledge in the technology and cost management of building services so as to ensure the reliability of cost advice provided to clients. This goal would be partly achieved through education and training of Quantity Surveyors/Cost Consultants in the interpretation and use of the rules of an SMM.

The Building Control Surveyor reviews designs and on-site construction in order to evaluate, and ultimately certify, compliance with the regulations, but little research has been carried out to investigate the role of these professionals in promoting sustainable construction. A qualitative study was conducted, comprising semi-structured interviews with 21 building control surveyors and 4 key informants from professional bodies in England. The building surveyors initially positioned their power as wholly derived from the regulations, thus constraining their contribution on sustainability to regulation enforcement. However, this stood in contradiction to their recognition of being valued and influential members of the project team. Descriptions of day-to-day activities included sharing common goals with the team, providing guidance based on their knowledge and experience, and developing collaborative relationships. Based on theories of power, these practices may be seen as processes of power. The primary conclusion is that building control surveyors are indeed powerful in the project team, and, with greater recognition of the varied forms of power available to them above and beyond regulatory certification, they could extend their influence in daily working interactions to promote more sustainable construction.

In spite of all these outcomes, numerous factors lead to the success or failure of mentoring program in the organizations. This paper aimed to evaluate the factors that affect the mentoring of professionals in construction firms with focus on quantity surveyors. Data was collected by administering questionnaires to the quantity surveyors in quantity surveying firms. The data collected was analyzed using mean item score, standard deviation, and Kruskal Wallis test. The results revealed that educational background, availability of supportive learning environment, mentors' attitudes, mentees' attitudes, past experience of mentor and mentee are the major factors affecting mentoring of quantity surveyors. The study recommended that top management QS firms should ensure the availability of supportive learning environment for mentoring to thrive in their firms, as the study found that supportive learning environment impacts on successful mentoring program. The study also recommended correct and appropriate matching of mentor and mentee to avoid attitudes that can inhibit the smooth run of the mentoring program in QS firms.

Nevertheless, in developing countries, the concept is still evolving and as such the pricing of sustainable construction materials remained a challenging area for practitioners. Hence, this study was initiated with the aim of identifying factors influencing the pricing of sustainable construction materials based on the perspective of quantity surveyors. Through a mixed research method, an in-depth literature review and an interview were conducted leading to the development of questionnaire which was administered to professional quantity surveyors. Data generated from the field survey was subjected to Ranking analysis. The major factors influencing the pricing of sustainable construction materials are whole life value for economic factors, non-toxic/less toxic material for environmental factors as well as health and safety measures for social factor. The findings provide a valuable reference and insight to professionals in the construction industry especially, quantity surveyors in the deepening of their understanding of the major factors that influence the pricing of sustainable construction materials. This study expands the body of knowledge about the influences economic, environmental and social factors have on the pricing of sustainable construction materials.

J	Wao, JO; Flood, I				Wao, Joel Ochieng; Flood, Ian			The role of quantity surveyors in the international construction arena	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction competencies; cost engineer; estimator; international construction project; quantity surveying		The quantity surveying profession is unpopular in some countries, such as the USA. However, in the international construction arena, quantity surveyors have renowned construction competencies and are widely involved in construction projects. They have different names in different countries e.g. cost engineer, building economist, cost manager, or construction accountant. In spite of the different names, they have significant skills that have evolved to meet the increasing and changing needs of clients, especially in the international construction arena. This research investigated the roles of quantity surveyors and the complexities they may find in international construction. A literature review and survey questionnaire were used to investigate the roles, complexities, and the level of competition from other construction professionals. The results showed that quantity surveyors had many roles in construction, with a majority of them acting as representatives of clients in construction projects. Also, they experienced varied complexities and faced competition from other construction professionals. It is noteworthy that they had procedures to safeguard the survival of the profession and had room for future expansion and diversification of their roles in international construction. The research provides useful information for those professionals and clients wishing to take part in international construction.

A study conducted in Africa revealed that most quantity surveyors (QSs) do not have job satisfaction for want of leisure time. Unlike the case of other professionals, there are hardly any studies done on the work life balance (WLB) of QSs despite their significant contribution to the construction industry. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the WLB of QSs working in Sri Lanka. A literature survey was first conducted and its findings were validated using 12 expert interviews through which additional information specific to QSs was also gathered. The findings of a questionnaire survey conducted subsequently among 115 professionals were ranked using Factorial ANOVA. WLB of QSs is found to depend on their gender and experience and deadlines is found to be its most influencing factor. Stress is one significant consequence of poor WLB. Yoga and meditation are found to minimize stress and other consequences of poor WLB. Factors affecting WLB can have a high impact on the technical and business cultures of organizations.

To be competent is to have the ability to apply the set of related knowledge, skills and abilities to perform a task effectively. This paper examines the competency requirements for quantity surveyors (QSs) in the face of changing and increasing client needs. Design/methodology/approach Based on a detailed meta-analysis of the literature, 12 basic/core and 16 evolving competencies are identified. Primary data were gathered through a field survey involving practicing QSs from client, consultant and contractor organisations, and university students undertaking QS programmes in Malaysia. The data obtained were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical tools. Findings The significance of the basic/core and evolving competencies are presented. Overall, the most important contemporary skills are cost planning, valuation of works, measurement/quantification and contract documentation. The evolved roles require expertise in communication and negotiation, ethics and professional conduct and value management. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates there are misaligned expectations of the proficiency levels needed to provide contemporary and future services between practitioners in client/consultant organisations, contractors and new generation students. Originality/value The findings provide guidance on the education, training and practice of quantity surveying to deal with emerging challenges in the dynamic built environments in Malaysia and beyond.

J	Ling, YY; Boo, JHS				Ling, YY; Boo, JHS			Improving the accuracy of approximate estimates of building projects	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						approximate estimating; cost planning; pre-bid forecasting; procurement; quantity surveyors; Singapore		This paper investigates the level of estimating accuracy in Singapore between 1992 and 1998. It compares the actual estimating accuracy against practitioners' expectations, and past studies. Forty-two sets of project data were obtained from six Singapore based quantity surveying firms. The estimating accuracy was found to be 1.09. This level of accuracy is below the expectation of 41 quantity surveyors (QS) who were surveyed. There is therefore a need to increase estimating accuracy further. Results also showed that there is no significant difference in estimating accuracy between this study and a previous study by Gunner and Skitmore (1999a). The implication of this finding is that longitudinally, there is no improvement in estimating accuracy over time. Moreover, for future studies on estimating accuracy, researchers can rely on cost data sets that are relatively dated, and from one source. Thirteen possible methods to improve estimating accuracy were tested in the fieldwork. It was found that the more important methods relate to having good quality and sufficient quantity of design information to prepare estimates.

The professional responsibilities and obligations of members toward their peers, their clients and the general public are usually delineated within these codes of conduct. An overview of business and professional ethics within construction is provided and the ethical issues facing South African construction professions are summarized. Specifically, this paper addresses ethical issues with regard to the breach of professional responsibilities and obligations to clients and the general public, as evidenced from a questionnaire survey of architects, contractors, quantity surveyors and consulting engineers. The survey findings indicate that, notwithstanding noticeable breaches, the professions take their responsibilities and obligations seriously, and regard a balance between their obligations to clients and the general public as paramount. Breaches in professional responsibilities include conflicts of interest and the divulging of confidential and proprietary information to a third party; both professionals and clients are guilty of such breaches.

J	Azman, MA; Abdul-Samad, Z; Ismail, S				Azman, Mohd Azrai; Abdul-Samad, Zulkiflee; Ismail, Suraya			The accuracy of preliminary cost estimates in Public Works Department (PWD) of Peninsular Malaysia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public construction; Budget cost estimate; Quantity Surveyors; Tendering; Malaysia	PROJECTS	This paper presents the accuracy of preliminary cost estimates prepared by Public Works Department (PWD), which is the largest public construction management in Malaysia. It attempts to understand the Quantity Surveyors' (QS) estimation accuracy in relation to public projects. This study analyses 83 projects of estimates and tender bids. The analysis includes three (3) estimating targets i.e. lowest bid, accepted bid and mean of the bids. To broaden the study, 344 QS involved in the procurement answered the questionnaires. Linear multiple regression analysis on project characteristics shows that project size, number of bidders, location and type of schools affect the bias. Contract period affects the consistency. The use of mean of the bids is the best-fit target to explain the bias in terms of adjusted R-2. The accuracy may improve if sufficient design information is available, proper cost planning and improving the application of historical cost data. As an alternative, the phenomenon of overestimation is resulted from government directive instruction, which could challenge the rational of accurate estimate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

These economy influences are perceived to have a significant contribution to tender price indices prediction. The growing phenomena have, therefore, become a topical issue among researchers and practitioners in recent times. The aim of this paper is to identify economic indicators that deserve constant attention during the prediction of tender price indices in the building industry. Using a mix of research methods such as literature review, interview and questionnaire survey, based on 23 economic indicators from literature, a questionnaire was developed to elicit the opinions of quantity surveyors on the relative significance of each economic indicator regarding tender price indices prediction. Hence, this study found five significant economic indicators from the perspective of quantity surveyors that it would have influence tender price indices prediction in the Ghanaian building Industry. These include composite consumer price index, producer price index, currency exchange rate, gross domestic product and interest rate. This suggests the need for critical examination of the extent of economic contributions and its influence when pricing building contracts. The findings of this paper can be applicable to other developing countries that share similar economic characteristics of Ghana.

Using a quantitative research approach based on the analysis of project data, this study provides statistical evidence to reinforce this view point various researchers have embraced over the years. The study investigates the current practice and the levels of accuracy attainable with the cost estimation practices for electrical installations currently deployed in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Cost data from one hundred and sixty-one Bills of Quantities are collated and statistically analyzed. The outcome of the research shows that an average of 65.83% of bills prepared by quantity surveyors for electrical installations, sampled within a six-year period, were computed using provisional sums while a percentage relative to 34.17% were measured in detail. The findings further showed statistically significant association between the method of estimating and level of accuracy. With significant disparity in the levels of accuracy of provisional sums allowed for electrical installations in bill of quantities (24.35%) compared to estimates generated through detailed measurement (9.77%). The study outcomes reinforced the need for systematic cost breakdown and financial management of electrical works in the procurement of buildings.

Using an online survey, opinions were sought from architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. The contribution of this work lies in its examination of the work stress experienced by construction professionals in a developing country characterized by economic hardship and social problems, such as inequality and crime. Most respondents experience high levels of stress at work. Architects, more than engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers; and female, more than male professionals feel stressed. The extent to which professionals are able to control their job situations does not appear to have a major influence on stress. Tight deadlines and long working hours probably play a bigger role. All the professions would appreciate having more time to do a better job. Survey respondents do not expect managers and colleagues to consistently make their work easier, but do believe that they can be relied on in times of difficulty. Appropriate stress management should be implemented within the construction industry, and further research undertaken to explore the relationships between stress and type of work undertaken, and the effectiveness of stress management procedures.

The study focussed on careers such as architects, civil engineers, facility managers, project managers and quantity surveyors. Findings - It was found that quantity surveyors and civil engineers value internship the most and are more likely to hire those who interned with them. Project managers also value internships but to a lesser extent. Facility managers and architects value internship the least and are also least likely to offer positions to their ex-interns. It is not conclusive whether internships are absolutely necessary to increase undergraduates' employability upon their graduation. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to only five professions and focused on the perceptions of professionals and not the interns or academic supervisors. Practical implications - Recommendations are made to improve internship programmes in the BE sector. These include making internships compulsory for students who intend to pursue civil engineering and quantity surveying careers and extending the duration of internships to six months. Originality/value - The views of professionals in the BE sector are uncovered. Tertiary institutions can use the findings to improve their internship programmes and their students' employability upon graduation.	[Lian, Jonathan K.

Workplace stress leads to psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects. Sufferers adopt different coping mechanisms in attempts to mitigate their condition. Using an online survey, opinions were sought from architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. The contribution of the research reported in this paper lies in its examination of the work stress experienced by construction professionals in a developing country characterized by economic hardship and social problems, such as inequality and crime. Most respondents experience high levels of stress at work. Architects (more than engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers) and female (more than male) professionals feel stressed. Psychological effects of workplace stress include the feeling of not being appreciated by others for a job well-done, feeling dissatisfied with one's own performance at work, and feeling tense at work. Physiological effects include disturbances to usual sleep patterns, difficulty in relaxing after hours, and difficulty in concentrating. Sociological effects include a strain on family life, social activities, and social relationships. A wide range of positive coping mechanisms (or countermeasures) is reported, including physical exercise in addition to intellectual and cultural activities. From a negative-coping perspective, consumption of alcohol is widespread, with more than one-third of respondents consuming 3-9 units/week. One in six respondents report smoking of up to 40 cigarettes/day, whereas use of narcotics (such as marijuana, cocaine, mandrax, ecstasy, heroin, and methamphetamine) at least once in the previous 12months is reported by 1 in 20. A duty-of-care ethos suggests that appropriate and carefully targeted stress-management strategies should be implemented by organizations within the construction industry. Further research is recommended to explore the effectiveness of organizational and personal stress-management interventions.

In the UK, quantity surveyors (or cost consultants) have a perception that more energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings cost between 5% and 15% more to build from the outset. This common assumption is not backed up by recent research and should be questioned. Construction professionals need to be informed of the whole life cost and environmental impact of buildings so that they can encourage key stakeholders to make more sustainable choices. These emerging issues together with practical tools are considered with case studies from recent projects.

The supply of QS professional services is largely dependent on the price level of services and the willingness of clients to pay. The pricing of professional QS consultancy services has been confronted with a myriad of pricing challenges due to rapid changes in the business environment; the pervasive influence of information technology; and the complexity of clients' expectation. It is therefore necessary for QS consultancy firms to develop strategic competences for the pricing of their services. In addition, numerous studies have not given the pricing the pricing of professional services the requisite attention. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategic competences for pricing professional QS services. Design/methodology/approach The study was positioned within the positivist tradition. As a result, the quantitative approach was adopted using a survey questionnaire to collect data from QS consultants. The sample size of the study was 79 professional quantity surveyors chosen by using simple random sampling technique from a population of 372 registered professional QS of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors. Using the (2) test and factor analysis, the study established relationship between strategic competences and pricing of QS services. Findings The study found that strategic competences for pricing QS professional services is significantly related to the managerial and professional competence of QS consultants. The strategic competences of QS consultants identified by this study include business management, services cost management; and production capabilities. Practical implications This study provides an empirical basis for QS consultancy firms to focus on strategic direction of their contractual arrangement with clients. Practically, resource configuration and on strategic competences for professional service pricing would create price leadership. Originality/value The study advances the pricing knowledge within the QS practice by demonstrating the nexus between strategic competences and the pricing of QS professional services which hitherto this study have not been effectively investigated.

Conventional point-wise surveying methods, however, tend to be time consuming, labour-intensive and may pose a risk to the surveyors. Instead, unmanned aerial vehicles in combination with structure-from-motion photogrammetry are now capable of high-accuracy contactless surveys. This study hence investigates road structure deformations identifiable by drone surveys from 40, 50 and 60 m flight altitudes. The surveys were georeferenced in 21 different ground control point configurations using integrated georeferencing. Comparisons between the resulting models and terrestrial laser scanning ground truth yielded the optimal configurations. The determined deformation estimates by using the optimal georeferencing configurations were validated using high-precise levelling results, which yielded the best deformation residual RMSE estimate of 0.29 cm for the 50 m altitude survey. These tests demonstrated that the proposed method can be employed for quick and contactless quantification of magnitude of built environment deformations.

J	Hui, LD; Park, MW; Brilakis, I				Hui, Linda; Park, Man-Woo; Brilakis, Ioannis			Automated Brick Counting for Facade Construction Progress Estimation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bricks; Automation; Imaging techniques; Computer aided vision systems; Information technology; Remote sensing		Construction progress is predominantly measured with manual site surveys. These surveys are labor-intensive, on-site manual investigations. The generated survey reports are subjective and approximate because they are based on the surveyors' individual experiences. This paper presents a novel method that can automatically count the number of bricks on a facade for reducing the cost and increasing the reliability of progress surveys. The method uses video data taken from a user's mobile phone to detect bricks on a facade in each video frame by using color thresholding, edge detection, and filtering of rectangular shapes and sizes. Then, it compares the difference between consecutive frames to add counts when new bricks appear and to avoid double counting. The proposed method was implemented and tested on on-site videos of red brick facades, and resulted in 99.8% precision and 98.7% recall. The results demonstrate the suitability of this method for progress monitoring of brick facade construction. (c) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The research is based on responses to a web-based questionnaire. Members of various professions, including civil engineers, architects, building services engineers, and quantity surveyors, were invited to complete the questionnaire. The responses reveal important trends in the breadth and size of project teams at the same time as new pressures are emerging regarding team integration and efficiency. The findings suggest that while CSCW systems may improve project management (e.g., via project documentation) and the exchange of information between team members, it has yet to significantly support those activities that characterize integrated collaborative working between disparate specialists. The authors conclude by combining the findings with a wider discussion of the application of CSCW to design activity-appealing for CSCW to go beyond multidisciplinary working to achieve interdisciplinary working.

This paper focuses on defining the error model of point positions obtained through a "station-orientation" procedure of direct georeferencing. The original error model presented by the authors relevant in this field is partly altered. All modifications are explained in detail within the paper and the reported model is statistically verified based on the carefully conducted experiment using Leica ScanStation P20 scanner. The obtained values of the uncertainty measures of direct georeferencing Which are of a few millimetre magnitude prove that this procedure can be efficiently used for planning and carrying out even more demanding surveying tasks, including those during monitoring and maintenance of constructed facilities. Additionally, traversing capabilities of terrestrial laser scanners tightly connected with direct georeferencing should contribute to mass introduction of laser scanning into the construction industry thanks to its similarities to the highly automated procedures of polar surveying and traversing which are traditionally employed among surveyors.

Rethinking Partnering among Quantity-Surveying Firms in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Partnering; Benefits; Barriers; Quantity-surveying firms; Nigeria; Organizational issues	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION; COLLABORATION	This paper explores the benefits and barriers to partnering in quantity-surveying (QS) firms in Nigeria, and suggests projects and professional services best served by this practice. A mixed research design informs the identification of related concepts from extant literature and data collection from 132 registered members of the Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS) which were analyzed using statistical tools. The commitment of top management is found to be a key barrier to QS firm partnering. The facilitation of knowledge exchange and inclusivity is the most significant benefit. In this paper, feasibility studies, expert advice, and lifecycle costing are key services of QS firms that would benefit from partnering, and research findings also favor engineering projects as core projects in which QS firms should utilize partnering. This study presents project stakeholders with practical and efficient strategies to facilitate the implementation of partnering arrangements to execute construction projects and has considerable implications for the quantity-surveying practice because it recommends professional services and projects with greater viability for the partnering arrangement.

The aim is to segregate the principal facade. The paper also introduces a novel means to quantify the resulting openings through repetitive application of Delaunay triangulation. The Gridded-RANSAC method begins with a grid concept to organize the inherently unorganized data set followed by a non-traditional, local deployment of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method, then a more traditional global application of RANSAC, and finally a local neighbourhood similarity check. When applied to historic, 19th and 20th century facades in Dublin Ireland, three classes were defined: principal facade, recessed sections (normally openings) and protruded parts (mostly balconies, cornices and capitols). When compared to drawings from an independent licensed surveyor, the Gridded-RANSAC approach has a typical accuracy of better than 90% overall and in excess of 98% accuracy for complicated individual features. The superiority of the technique is demonstrated against four prominent segmentation techniques and through the application of the output files as geometry input for computational solid models without intermediary software.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to focus on this issue in the Malaysian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - This paper targeted professional project consultants, who are identified as architects, engineers, and quantity surveyors, as the internal construction stakeholders. The personal-OV and the level of OC of the stakeholders were evaluated through a questionnaire survey. To achieve the research objective, comparative and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Findings - The results generated by the analyses indicated a high level of value conflicts in the construction organizations which significantly and negatively affected commitment of the internal stakeholders. Originality/value - Value conflicts in construction organizations are the agenda of this paper while not many empirical studies have been conducted on this issue in Malaysia. This paper through investigating the potential effect of value conflicts on the stakeholders' commitment reveals the importance of interaction between personal and OV in construction organizations which contributes to the extant literature of organizational behaviour as to the construction literature.

To demonstrate the benefits of using HCC (sometimes referred to as "mixed" construction) within the industry, it is essential that transparent criteria to assess this structural frame type against alternatives be determined, defined, and evaluated. Following a thorough review of literature in the building performance domain, a survey of U.K. experienced practitioners including clients, engineers, architects, quantity surveyors, and main contractors was conducted to obtain their perceptions regarding the importance of structural frame performance criteria (SFPC). A factor analysis of SFPC revealed seven dimensions, interpreted as "physical form and space," "construction process," "long-term sustainability..... establishing confidence," "building impact..... physical appearance," and "client satisfaction." These dimensions should improve the decision making process when selecting an appropriate structural frame during early project stages by providing a simple list of performance criteria to be considered. Although these SFPC and dimensions were originally developed to ensure that the benefits of using HCC were apparent during the frame selection process, they are equally applicable to all frame choice comparisons. As such, they may provide a valuable tool for ensuring added value and client satisfaction.

(Cassini, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor, and Deep Space 1), we identified a number of management features that seem to have contributed to the success of the early FBC projects. These features generally involve simplification, standardization, and the use of commercially available components and talents. We also pointed out that most of these features had potential downsides, and we expressed some concerns about the long-term viability of some of these features. The recent failures bf two Mars missions have also shown the limitations of this mode of operations. Therefore, in the future, some of these features may have to be revisited to account better for risks and uncertainties. In this paper, we describe these management factors, some of the challenges that remain, and a set of recommendations based on our observations, many of which apply to other industries subjected to similar constraints.

J	SKITMORE, RM; STRADLING, SG; TUOHY, AP				SKITMORE, RM; STRADLING, SG; TUOHY, AP			HUMAN EFFECTS IN EARLY-STAGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT PRICE FORECASTING	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper describes a postal survey of UK quantity surveyors to relate human factors, such as experience and personality, to conceptual estimating expertise. Composite variables were derived by factor analysis and examined against estimates of average national prices for several types of building. It is shown that expertise is very much of a project specific nature and does not extend in a simplistic way to projects outside the defined domain and that estimators must exercise of great caution when undertaking work even slightly outside their regular activities. Different building types demand different emphasis and special attention is drawn to the complexity of the project, the degree of services content, and particular sub-market conditions. The easiest projects to estimate appear to be industrial (factories) and residential (houses) with offices being the hardest, probably due to the wider variety of design and quality options in the latter. Knowledge and care are identified as the most crucial attributes of good estimators. A few myths are also dispelled. Geographical location, for instance, was found not to be a major issue. Similarly, there was no evidence of any ''X'' factor whereby individuals can claim any mystical inborn talent. The indications are that good estimators have exactly the same attributes as good gamblers-they do their research selectively and thoroughly, think carefully, and concentrate on what they know best.

However, the dearth of primary research material is partly attributed to the lack of a suitable methodology with which to study projects. Social network analysis (SNA) is proposed as an analytical tool to explore coalition governance. Primary data are presented for three European case studies employing quite different approaches to the use of financial incentives in project governance. The case studies investigate pain share/gain share arrangements implemented under a prime contracting procurement approach; an unusual use of activity-related penalties in the French system of procurement; and the use of guaranteed maximum price supplements within a UK standard form of (without contractor's design) building contract. The use of SNA enables the observation of a number of transaction sets and the formulation of a framework for the quantification of construction project governance. The first case study demonstrates the decentralization of client-orientated financial management, from consultant quantity surveyor to a number of multidisciplinary cluster leaders. The second case study illustrates the importance of incentive contiguity in effective project governance. The third case study uses SNA to demonstrate the way in which financial governance could be transformed through the transference of client-orientated financial management from the client and their professional adviser to the main contractor.

J	Ndekugri, I; Braimah, N; Gameson, R				Ndekugri, Issaka; Braimah, Nuhu; Gameson, Rod			Delay analysis within construction contracting organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SYSTEM; CLAIM	Delayed completion of a construction project is often caused by a complex interaction of a combination of events, some of which are the contractor's risks and others are the project owner's. The apportionment of the liability to give effect to the risk allocation has therefore been a matter of great controversy. Many delay analysis methodologies have been developed over the years for performing this task. This paper reports on an empirical study into the current practice in the use of these methodologies in the United Kingdom, as part of a wider study aimed at developing a framework for improving delay claims analysis. The part of the study reported here was based on a questionnaire survey of key informants. The issues investigated include the categories of staff within contracting organizations who contribute to delay claims analyses, the awareness, use and reliability of existing delay analysis methods and the obstacles to their use in practice. The main findings of the study are that: (1) the preparation of delay claims often requires input from commercial managers (quantity surveyors), schedulers, site managers, external claim consultants and estimators; (2) commercial managers have the greatest involvement; (3) claims analyzed using the as-built versus as-planned and the impacted as-planned techniques are often successful although there is considerable literature on the shortcomings of these techniques; and (4) the main obstacles to the use of the methods relates to deficiencies in project records and scheduling practice.

Cost estimation of structural skeleton using an interactive automation algorithm: A conceptual approach	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						cost estimation; Industry Alliance for Interoperability; Industry Foundation Class; interactive; automation; structural; bid construction; B.o.Q; skeleton		This paper addresses a new concept for generating bills of quantities (B.o.Qs) using AutoCAD drawings for a building project, which demonstrates the application of Industry Foundation Class (IFC), developed by International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). The procedure considers types of materials and the structural shapes of the AutoCAD drawings to compute the cost of the structural skeleton elements using interactive automation. The main concept focuses on using layer computation of the AutoCAD drawing after converting it into a drawing inter-exchangeable file format (DXF). Once the coordinates are detected, it is easier to determine the area and volume for any structural shape, including circles and polygons. The extracting method is a new technique for structural engineers and quantity surveyors to estimate required material for beam, columns, slabs and foundations. The algorithm extracts and recognizes the layers and objects from a two dimensional DXF drawing along with the coordinates information. The results obtained using this technique are more accurate and reliable than manual procedures or any other traditional techniques. In this paper, an automated and interactive procedure for B.o.Q computation is demonstrated. The process involves a user-friendly interface, dynamic linking to the structural drawings and tracking of B.o.Q modifications at the same time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bowen, P; Zhang, RP; Edwards, P				Bowen, Paul; Peihua Zhang, Rita; Edwards, Peter			An investigation of work-related strain effects and coping mechanisms among South African construction professionals	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction professionals; workplace stress; strain effects; counter-measures		Construction is a demanding work environment. Many construction professionals experience workplace stress, leading to physiological, psychological and sociological strain effects. They adopt a variety of coping mechanisms to manage these effects. A purposive sample of 36 construction professionals (architects, project managers, construction managers, civil engineers and quantity surveyors) in Cape Town, South Africa, were surveyed regarding their perceptions of workplace strain effects and stress counter measures. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests were used for data analysis. The findings show that the highest-ranked strain effects in terms of impact were (in descending order): "frustration", "fatigue", "strain on personal relationships", "strain on professional relationships", and "anger/irritability". Male professionals identified greater fatigue and frustration effects than females; while females felt a greater lack of self-confidence. The highest-ranked coping mechanisms in terms of impact were "travel", "non-competitive sporting activity", "music", "increased caffeine intake", and "walking". Males preferred more intensive physical activities than did females. Architects experienced anxiety more frequently than other professional groups. This study confirms important strain effects experienced by construction professionals and highlights the nature and effectiveness of counter measures. Limitations of the study include its exploratory nature and small sample size. Future research should establish the associations between strain effects and coping measures, in terms of how construction organizations can better support wellbeing among their professional employees.

The relationship between job demands, job control, workplace support, and experiences of stress in the South African construction context is investigated, using hierarchical regression, factor analysis and structural equation modeling to explore the strength of thirteen factor relationships with perceived stress. Data were gathered from an on-line questionnaire survey response sample of 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers. Predictors displaying a significant relationship with occupational stress are the presence of work life imbalance, the need to 'prove' oneself, hours worked per week, working to tight deadlines, and support from line managers in difficult situations at work. Existing theories of occupational stress are confirmed but not completely supported. The construction industry should give attention to how the need to work long hours is justified. Organizations should look to improving managerial and collegial support for construction professionals, but be careful in engaging in socializing and project team-building activities. Further research will need to focus more deeply on construction-specific job demand factors; explore why women professionals appear to experience more stress than men; and aim to develop reliable early-warning detection techniques for construction professionals.

Knowing what factors contribute to or ameliorate workplace stress, and their interrelationships, are important. Data from 350 cases that reflect self-perceived stress experiences were collected via an online questionnaire survey of architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. These data were used to conduct logistic regression modeling to explore the relationship between perceived stress at work, workplace demands, job control, and workplace support. The strength of the relationship of 13 factors with perceived stress was modeled. Although all the cataloged factors contribute to a predictive likelihood of high workplace stress, the strongest predictive factor is the perceived presence of work-life imbalance. The perceived need to work long hours is overwhelmingly mediated through imbalance experienced between work and life/family commitments. A perceived need to prove oneself at work also strongly mediates this relationship, whereas the extent of support received from colleagues in difficult situations may serve as a strong moderator. An amended model of occupational stress is proposed that distinguishes between mediating and moderating factors, providing possible target areas for organizations wishing to address employee stress issues. The contribution of this work lies in its examination of the work stress experienced by construction professionals in a developing country that is characterized by economic hardship and social problems.

J	Leung, MY; Chan, YS; Yu, JY				Leung, Mei-yung; Chan, Yee-Shan; Yu, Jingyu			Integrated Model for the Stressors and Stresses of Construction Project Managers in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							A-BEHAVIOR; WORK; UK	Construction projects involve multistakeholders (e.g., architects, structural engineers, surveyors, contractors, suppliers, etc.) completing a large number of unpredictable tasks in a complex process within a limited period of time. Construction project managers (C-PMs) are the key persons in achieving project success throughout the construction process, as they are responsible for planning the construction program, organizing human resources, controlling operations and the budget, and forecasting probable difficulties. Hence, C-PMs always encounter a great deal of stress in construction projects. Apart from the subjective feelings experienced by individual C-PMs, C-PMs may also feel objective stress due to the deviation between their actual abilities and their expected abilities on tasks or projects. To understand the integrated relationships between the various stressors and stresses of C-PMs, a survey was conducted of 108 C-PMs in Hong Kong. This paper attempts to investigate the causal relationships between stressors and stresses (both subjective and objective). The study reveals seven stressors of C-PMs in the industry. Based on the results of a correlation coefficient, an optimized stressor-stress structural equation model is established. Four critical stressors were found to have significant impact on both the subjective and the objective stresses of C-PMs, including work overload, poor interpersonal relationships, poor work environment, and poor nonwork environment. A number of recommendations were made for both construction companies and individual C-PMs in their offices and at home in order to optimize their work performance in the real world.

This study aims to identify different types of psychological disorders in construction projects and to develop a fuzzy mapping to determine the impact of psychological disorders in the context of time, cost, and quality in construction management. Through a questionnaire survey assisted by pair-wise comparison among experienced construction personnel, the six most common psychological disorders, including depression, generalized anxiety disorders (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), substance use disorders (SUD), acrophobia, and claustrophobia, were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-square (PLS) tests, and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP), and followed by visualization. Although various stressors such as work overload, role ambiguity and conflict, unpaid overtime, restrictive career progression, and the diverse range of personalities are common in construction management, different roles and positions are subjected to different levels of stress, which from high to low are project manager, civil engineer, architect, contractor, quantity surveyor, and mechanical and electrical (M& E) engineer. This research developed fuzzy mapping of psychological disorders in the context of project performance, which is useful for project management teams to reveal and tackle mental health problems in early stages.(C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

As a response to the excessive uncertainty, standard contracts for construction projects demand that contractors indemnify all works associated with a project and the people involved in it through having insurance cover. Even though the consensus that insurance as a primary means of managing risk has expanded significantly, few contractors have adopted it in developing countries. This study set out to evaluate the factors influencing insurance use as a risk response tool for contractors alongside its efficiency in the construction industry. Quantitative research method was adopted to achieve the aim of the study in which a close-ended questionnaire was developed. Respondents were chosen using a purposive sampling technique and they include Architects, Construction Managers, Project Managers, Quantity Surveyors, Engineers and Insurance professionals within Gauteng province. Retrieved data was analysed using descriptive statistics, One-Sample T-test, and exploratory factor analysis. Findings revealed that factors influencing insurance use as risk response tool by contractors can be categorised into project characteristics, financial stability influence, organisational objective influence, insurer's influence, and insured participants and legal requirement influence. It was also established that insurance is efficient in managing external risks. Based on these findings, it was concluded that project characteristics play a major role in the decision to employ insurance as a tool for managing risk. It was recommended that construction team players and stakeholders should encourage the use of the different insurance covers for construction projects.

Few construction projects are being executed using modular building components in developing countries. This study is aimed at assessing the challenges to the implementation of the modular method of construction (MMC) with a focus on developing countries using two major states in Nigeria as a case study. A quantitative research approach was adopted with the design of a questionnaire survey. The study engaged construction professionals such as Quantity Surveyors, Architects, Engineers, Builders and Project Managers in Nigeria. Data retrieved were analysed using percentile, mean item score, Kruskal-Wallis H-Test as well as exploratory factor analysis. The findings showed that construction practitioners are faced with the challenge of finding a compromise between the cost of the project and the value obtainable by using MMC. The challenges were further classified into construction industry practices, client concerns and site characteristics. Practically, the study revealed the need for the proper enlightenment of both construction practitioners and clients with regards to the inherent value of the MMC. This involves the inclusion of MMC requirements in the client's information requirement for the construction project, the tender pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ), and the contractor's technical method statement for the construction project. Theoretically, the study serves as a good foundation for future research seeking to explore the use of MMC in developing countries. The study will assist construction organisations as well as the industry at large in shaping their policies to accommodate the use of innovative methods of construction by understanding the challenges that might hinder its effective implementation.

To achieve this aim, the study adopts a mixed methods approach which commenced with a review of extant literature in order to produce an exhaustive hypothetical list of process-related factors influencing project reputation. This review resulted in the identification of 29 process-related factors which was operationalised into a questionnaire survey. After an essential pilot study was conducted, the survey was distributed to a wide audience of construction practitioners in order to elicit their experiential opinion on process-related factors influencing project reputation of construction organisations. The responses from the survey were subjected to statistical processes, which include Reliability Analysis, Relative Importance Index (RII), Kruskal-Wallis and Multiple Regression Analysis. After establishing 25 statistically reliable process-related factors influencing project reputation via reliability analysis, the study further revealed an impressive general agreement of 88% of the process-related factors. Multiple regression analysis was subsequently conducted to unravel the key drivers influencing project reputation of construction organisations. This analysis revealed six key factors which include:successful completion of project without adverse environmental issues;competent project manager;friendly culture generated within project;competent project participants;successful completion of project without health and safety issuesandregular client consultation. This research finding will provide a benchmark for construction organisations to develop project reputation which will invariably impact organisational reputation. In addition, the findings of this study will allow project stakeholders to prioritise 'few' critical issues that will unquestionably impact their project reputation during the implementation of the project plan.

In order to avoid the selection of an incapable contractor, the capabilities of contractors must be assessed prior to tendering through pre-qualification. However, the pre-qualification process is characterized by partiality and ambiguity. In view of this, numerous models have been developed to solve the pre-qualification problems. Prior to the development of such models, it is very important to assess how the pre-qualification criteria impact project success criteria so as to aid in the selection of pre-qualification criteria while considering the project and client's objectives. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to ascertain the relationship between contractors' pre-qualification criteria and project success criteria. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized explanatory research design in testing 35 hypotheses. The views of 121 practising quantity surveyors were solicited using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling to validate the hypothesis. Findings In all, 13 of the 35 hypotheses were not supported. The findings indicated a clear relationship between contractors' pre-qualification and project success. Practical implications Therefore, it is evident that the practice of lowest evaluate bidder is not adequate for providing a satisfactory project outcome. It is, therefore, suggested that more emphasis should be placed on contractor's technical abilities, health and safety and management capabilities as they have proven to have a significant correlation with the project success. Originality/value This study provides insights to the how various pre-qualification criteria can impact the project success criteria and further contributes to the symbiotic that exist in the literature on pre-qualification and project success.

Defining social value in the public procurement process for works	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Social value; Public procurement process; Procurement of works; Construction industry; Ghana	POLICY TOOL; CRITERIA	Purpose Though the Public Procurement Act of Ghana makes room for specific socio-economic policies (environmental, social, economic and other policies which are intended to promote social and economic impact), there is no explicit definition and provision for social value as an evaluation criterion, culminating in the absence of a definition in the Act. This paper elicits the conception and understanding of social value from stakeholders in the Ghanaian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative method that relied on a semi-structured interview of 30 participants purposively drawn from Western, Western North and Central regions of Ghana. An inductive thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying repetitions, exploring similarities and differences, noting linguistic connectors, and a framework were employed to analyse the data. Findings The study established no single definition or explanation for social value in the construction industry in Ghana. However, it was revealed from the study that the concept of social value could be defined from the functional perspective of the definer, particularly from the perspective of a Procurement Officer, Works Engineer, and a Quantity Surveyor. A new insight from the study that differs from the body of literature is that participants equated benefits derived from physically constructed projects as social value. Social implications The study has implication for public administration and practice regarding the decision-making process in the construction industry in Ghana. It provides a vital awakening on social value as a criterion in evaluating construction works procurement in Ghana. The ability of participants to equate the benefits derived from executed construction projects as social value creates a new perspective on understanding the meaning of social value in the procurement of works construction. Originality/value The study contributes to the state-of-the-art and ongoing discourse on the concept of social value globally. The findings create an important catalyst for social value research in the Ghanaian construction industry.

J	Bowen, P; Govender, R; Edwards, P				Bowen, Paul; Govender, Rajen; Edwards, Peter			Structural Equation Modeling of Occupational Stress in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Occupational stress; Construction professionals; Structural equation modeling; Personnel management; Labor and personnel issues	JOB DEMANDS; WORKPLACE STRESS; MENTAL-HEALTH; STRAIN; EXPERIENCES; HARASSMENT; PROFESSIONALS; PREDICTORS; CIGARETTE; MANAGERS	Construction professionals can experience high levels of occupational stress, leading to psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects and with sufferers adopting different coping mechanisms to mitigate their condition. An online opinion survey gathered data, including self-assessments of stress, from 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers in South Africa. Based on correlation and regression analysis of the response data, an integrated conceptual trial model of occupational stress was proposed. This model, comprising demographic factors, job demand, control and support factors, harassment and discrimination at work, organizational climate, and psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects, posited substance use as the terminal consequence of job stress. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the conceptual model. The results indicate that (1) the terminal consequence of occupational stress is not substance use but rather psychological, physiological, and sociological strain effects; (2) organizational climate is largely determined by gender, job demand, and control and support factors; (3) age, gender, level of job control, and organizational climate are significant predictors of discrimination; (4) psychological strain is significantly predicted by age, job demand, and job control factors, and by organizational climate; (5) sociological strain is determined by age, job demands, discrimination, and psychological strain; and (6) age, and sociological and psychological strain effects, behave as significant predictors of physiological stress effects. As mitigation strategies for occupational stress, employers should first target primary prevention measures by conducting regular reviews of work scheduling requirements and workload allocations. They should empower employees with greater job control, and foster a more supportive work environment. Secondary measures to address organizational impacts would include undertaking employee stress appraisals and holding stress management workshops. The workplace needs of female construction professionals need particular attention. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main facade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.

A purposively selected sample of thirty-six construction professionals (comprising architects, project managers, construction managers, engineers and quantity surveyors) based in Cape Town, South Africa, were surveyed regarding their perceptions about, and experiences of, workplace stress. The purpose was to identify and rank job demand, job control and job support factors and to analyse these by gender and professional grouping, both in terms of how respondents perceived them, as well as in terms of how frequently they had experienced them. The main finding was that respondents' perceptions about the importance of job demand, job control and job support factors were largely consistent with their own experience of these factors. Distinguishing between perceptions and experience of stressors and moderators of stress was, however, considered valuable because the fact that differences were found indicates the need for precision in the design of scales. The highest ranked factors were, respectively, 'critical time constraints', 'volume of work' and 'adequate compensation (salary)'. Women and men ranked items differently, as did the various professional groups. The main conclusions were that the construction project environment is a time-pressured, complex, environment in which work-life balance is negatively affected, particularly for women. Control over the type, flow and volume of work were perceived to be the main moderators of stress, whilst salary and career path opportunities were perceived to be the main job support moderators of stress. The applicability of using the job demand-control-support framework was confirmed given that the main stressors, control and support moderators were found to be to be largely consistent with the findings of previous studies. Future research taking a gendered approach should anticipate issues important to female respondents and should consider the benefits of qualitative methods. The design of research focusing on construction professionals should consider using the project team as the unit of analysis to ensure that the influence of the interconnectedness of participants' roles is taken into account.

J	Rajeh, M; Tookey, JE; Rotimi, JOB				Rajeh, Mohammed; Tookey, John E.; Rotimi, James Olabode Bamidele			Estimating transaction costs in the New Zealand construction procurement A structural equation modelling methodology	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						New Zealand; Construction management; Estimating; Procurement systems; Structural equation modelling; Transaction costs	ECONOMICS; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; INDUSTRY; PROJECTS	Purpose - Within construction procurement, transaction cost economics offers a mechanism to understand "unseen" costs associated with the pre- and post-contract work. Pre-contract, these include costs related to information gathering and procurement. Post-contract they include activities of contract administration and enforcement. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the magnitude of transaction costs (TCs) for different procurement systems used in construction projects in New Zealand. Specifically estimating the relative values of TCs for Traditional and Design-Build delivery systems for the purpose of comparison. Design/methodology/approach - This study develops a conceptual model for the relationship between procurement systems and TC. The model was operationalized and developed into a questionnaire. A cross-sectional sample approach was deployed, involving pilot and survey questionnaires, and results verification through "real world" cases. Data were sought from construction professionals in management, design and operations (i.e. project managers, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, and procurement officers). TCs were measured using time-spent conducting procurement-related activities as a surrogate for cost. Professionals evaluate their time-spent in procurement activities using a Likert scale 1-5, comparing the Traditional and Design-Build delivery systems. Data were triangulated with "real world" cases to test and explain the developed model. The test included validity and reliability, path analysis, regression analysis, factor analysis, and structural equation modelling (SEM). The primary analytical technique used was SEM to yield information on goodness-of-fit, model development and comparison, and confirmatory strategies. SPSS Amos 21 statistical software was used for data analysis and model development. Findings - The results suggest that procurement systems have indirect impact on TCs. The relationship between procurement systemand TCs is fully mediated by costs of information, procurement, administration, and enforcement. Applying the developed models (the Traditional and Design-Build) to "real world" cases, it was found that TCs in the Traditional system amounts to 18.5 percent of the annual salary cost of a project manager (as an indicator quantum), while in the Design-Build system, it amounts to 14.5 percent of the annual salary cost of a project manager. TCs were calculated using regression equations based on factor loadings in the Traditional and Design-Build models. Practical implications - This study applies new theoretical model for the link between procurement system and TCs, investigating and empirically demonstrating the influence of procurement system on TCs in construction. It also offers a new plausible explanation for the factors influencing TCs in procurement. The study emphasizes "in-house" TCs from the perspective of the professionals. The findings have practical implications on construction business practice due to their robust empirical nature and theoretical framework, which might enhance the performance of the construction industry. Originality/value - This study contributes to the procurement selection in construction, by introducing a new conceptual model for the link between procurement system and TCs. It has extended the current practices for procurement selection by estimating TCs for the Traditional and Design-Build systems for comparison.

The need for an effective 4IR leadership has placed new demands on organisations to develop and select leaders to effectively lead the organisations in the 4IR era. Hence, it becomes important to understand the attributes for an effective 4IR leadership. This study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. The hypothesised relationships from the framework were tested using a survey of 416 senior construction executives across the nine provinces of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the study objectives, an online survey was sent to construction firms across the nine provinces of South Africa. "Construction", for the purpose of this study comprised building and civil engineering firms listed on the construction industry development board (cidb) register of contractors in South Africa. The target group was the upper echelon executives, i.e. Chairman, CEOs, managing directors and chief operating officers, and the survey was directed to contact e-mail of the study samples. The professional service providers (architects, consultants and surveyors) were not part of the survey sample. The database of the organisational leaders was obtained from the cidb. The online survey was created on the 23rd of August 2019 and closed on the 23rd of April 2020, thereby making the duration of the survey eight months. The total number of respondents at the time of closure of the survey was four hundred and sixteen (416). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of the results. Findings This study validates the effective 4IR leadership framework as proposed by Alade and Windapo (2019) by empirically examining relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership. The findings from this study have shown that effective 4IR leadership is positively associated with leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Hence, an effective 4IR leader must spread the knowledge and understanding of the 4IR opportunities and threats in the organisations. The leader must ensure that the executives in the construction organisation become change conversant and ensure that the employees acquire 4IR skills. Multiple leadership intelligence is essential to effective 4IR leadership. These multiple intelligence are the ability to adapt knowledge and skills to different situations, ability to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, a high level of understanding, ability to process and analyse information and ability to utilise knowledge from many disciplinary boundaries. Research limitations/implications This study is focused on construction business organisations in South Africa. As such, similar studies on 4IR leadership effectiveness can be carried out in other countries and across other organisations. Future studies should also consider using a case study approach specifically focused on organisations with high implementations of 4IR technologies. Interacting with the leaders of such organisations and their employees will give a broader perspective in understanding the reasons of their effectiveness. Practical implications The leadership of construction organisations must partner with the academia, industry players and team members in their efforts to implement 4IR in their organisations. Also, the existence of a positive association between leadership traits and effective 4IR leadership implies that to ensure a 4IR-driven work process in construction organisations, the leadership must embrace disruption and quickly respond to change. Further, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that appropriate leadership styles are required for effective 4IR leadership. The appropriate leadership style for effective 4IR leadership requires the leadership of construction organisations to delegate some of the 4IR function. The 4IR function must be performed based on the challenges that are associated with 4IR. The positive correlation between leadership intelligence and leadership styles makes it possible to conclude that the competencies of leadership of construction organisations in a 4IR-driven change depend on the level of leadership intelligence of the executives of construction organisations. It is evident that 4IR will change the business environment; hence, leadership intelligence is required to adapt construction organisations to the change dynamics. This study has provided information on what 4IR leadership entails in construction organisations. The study has contributed a framework for ensuring effective and smooth flow 4IR implementation in construction organisations through a purposeful leadership that combines leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Social implications This research will be useful to government agencies and board members of construction organisations, in appointing leaders to see the construction industry and organisations perform better in the 4IR era. Young individuals who are also aspiring to take on leadership role in the industry will benefit from this study. Originality/value This study is a new and original research that seeks to investigate the need for an effective 4IR leadership in construction business organisations. Construction as an industry is usually criticised for her slow response to change. Since leadership is required to drive the change agenda, this study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised.
