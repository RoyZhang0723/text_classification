J	FLEISCHER, M; LIKER, JK				FLEISCHER, M; LIKER, JK			THE HIDDEN PROFESSIONALS - PRODUCT DESIGNERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON DESIGN QUALITY	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							COMPUTER-AIDED-DESIGN; CAD CAM	The management of designers and the design process controls a crucial element in the efficiency and effectiveness of product realization. U.S. companies typically distinguish the role of "design engineer," treated as a professional, from that of "designer," treated as a worker who creates the detailed design. This paper discusses the roles of designers in the development engineering phase of product development, and examines the effects of designer communication, job design, organization climate, and CAD system quality on design quality. A survey of designers and design engineers at ten manufacturing sites was conducted. Communication with downstream processes, task significance, and job commitment were associated with greater achievement of manufacturability objectives. Communication with downstream processes and within the design core team were associated with achievement of strength objectives. Job commitment was a significant predictor of achievement of cost objectives. CAD system quality was not associated with any of the outcome measures. These results suggest that managers of development engineering organizations should treat designers more as professionals and less as workers. They should also redesign the jobs of both designers and design engineers to insure that the designers have greater responsibility and authority for linking with external groups.

J	Gasparski, WW				Gasparski, WW			Designer's responsibility: methodological and ethical dimensions	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Design E-ducation - Connecting the Real and the Virtual (eCAADe 2002)	2002	WARSAW, POLAND			designer; methodological; ethical; responsibility		A designer is one who designs, where "to design"-from Latin designare-means "to mark out". Those who design professionally are professional designers who "see and seek value in new designs". Seeing and seeking might be done in two ways: narrower or broader. According to the approach characteristic for design-methodological reductionism, those things that are designed are considered the designed objects. In this approach, the designer's task is limited to artifacts narrowly understood. Systemic design methodology describes that "what is designed" in terms of an object of design. In the domain of designing, like in any kind of human professional activity, two types of moral dimensions are identified: endo- and egzomorality. The first deals with the moral code of design activity, the second with social responsibility of what is done by professional designers. Both define elements of designer's accountability: first, in respect of truth and honesty in relation to the designer's product-a design, second, in respect to societal benefit and not harm, both in respect to relevancy of what is designed for practical use. Once, producing and teaching good science is the main tasks of scholars, those among the scholars who are involved in design science are responsible not only for producing good design science but also for educating designers as reflective practitioners conscious of what every designer should know about objects of design and ethics related to the profession.

To do so, however, designers require knowledge about safety hazards on site and the opportunity to examine their designs early in projects. Through a set of studies virtual reality tools were used to examine the potential for collaborative dialogue between designers and builders to provide a forum for learning and proactive change of a design to make a project safer to build. In the tests, participants viewed proposed designs using virtual reality to examine various alternative design and construction scenarios. The study shows that consultation and dialogue with an experienced construction professional are highly beneficial for designers to appreciate the implications of designs on safety, and that designers are more willing to adapt design details than to change aesthetic aspects of their designs.

J	Karna, S; Junnonen, JM				Karna, Sami; Junnonen, Juha-Matti			Designers' performance evaluation in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Customer satisfaction; Performance measures; Design management; Critical success factors; Project participants satisfaction	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SATISFACTION; QUALITY	Purpose - In a construction project, "participants' satisfaction" is one of the main dimensions used for measuring the successfulness of a project. Designers perform a major role in attaining the project goals and managing project complexity during production. The purpose of this paper is to examine the designers' performance as evaluated by the main participants: the client, the project consultant/manager and the main contractor, and to identify the main success factors of designer performance using the participants' evaluation. The study also aims to examine how the economic size of a project affects the project participants' assessment of the designer's performance. It is assumed that as the size of a project increases, so does the complexity of the project, which will affect the scope of work and demands on the designers' operational performance for the specific project level. Design/methodology/approach - The Finnish project evaluation and benchmark database was used in this study as empirical data. The quantitative data consists of surveys on the project level and are based on a multi-dimensional standard evaluation wherein the main participants evaluate each other's performances. The client, project consultant and main contractor evaluated the designer's performance. The data of the study consisted of a total of 892 evaluations. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the differences between the project participants' assessments based upon the different economic sizes of the projects. Findings - Contractors were satisfied with the designers' performance in small projects, whereas the client and the project consultant/manager rated the designers' performance most successful in large projects. This result may be due to small projects are typically simple and less complex, in which case design solutions are generally well-defined. Nonetheless, the participants' level of satisfaction follows the same factors. The main problems in the designers' performance were related to the design content: the flawlessness and comprehensiveness, as well as the compatibility and consistency of designs. These factors were emphasized particularly in the client's low satisfaction of the designer's performance. However, project participants were satisfied with the collaboration with designers; however, room for improvement could be found in internal communication and collaboration within the design teams. The findings illustrated that the assessment of the success rate of a project was party-specific, which was clearly affected by the size of the project, as large projects appeared to be more complex than smaller ones. Practical implications - The findings suggested that there is a need to develop project-specific practices in managing multidisciplinary design teams. Additionally, particularly in large projects, designers should focus more on solving problems and design requirements occurring at the construction site. However, this should be implemented in such a way that this does not interfere with the design activities conducted with the client and project management. While client satisfaction is low in the small projects, designers should focus more on customer-oriented methods to serve client needs better. Originality/value - In construction project management studies, there is a need to measure the importance that various participants assign to different success factors. Since project success factors depend on project type, a more project-specific approach is suggested to identify the main parameters for measuring project success. This study provides a holistic approach of the designers' performance, which contributes to the theory of project success and designers' performance improvement.

Nonetheless, previous studies indicated that the issue of competencies to perform and sustain such practices over time is of a significant concern. This study aims to explore the key attributes of designers' competencies for PtD practices in construction. Design/methodology/approach By using the Scopus database, a total of 86 papers related to PtD in construction published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed and analysed using the well-established systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. Findings The review indicates that in order to be competent in PtD implementation, designers need to be equipped with tacit and explicit knowledge, technical and soft skills and experience related to PtD. Furthermore, the review identifies attributes of these competencies. Additionally, a framework that links key PtD elements/principles with the PtD competencies is presented. Practical implications The findings would enable contribution to the industry by providing the necessary references for design organisations to improve their designers' PtD competencies and hence, be able to meet their responsibility under relevant occupational safety and health (OSH) legislative framework. Originality/value This study extends the PtD literature in the construction context by providing deeper insights into the conceptualisation of relationship between competent designers and PtD elements. The novelty also lies in the consolidation of PtD competency attributes for designers in construction that could act as a reference for any future developments related to PtD competency assessment for designers.

The efficiency of the interaction process may be decreased due to the limited experience of clients, such as the limited capacity in understanding drawings or reviewing design solutions. A User Pre-Occupancy Evaluation Method (UPOEM) was developed to enhance the designer-client communication by applying building information modeling, user activity simulation, and requirement management techniques. A case study is used to apply the UPOEM to verify the practical implementation in a real project and from which a comparative experimental study and questionnaire survey were conducted. The findings indicate that the UPOEM can help generate more suggestions for improving design solution during designer-client communication compared with traditional approach. It can also enhance the clients' understanding of the future built environment as well as their willingness in collaborative working with designers at the early design stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous methods have been developed to take conjoint data and produce optimal or near-optimal product designs. But conjoint analysis, while significantly contributing to the product design process, still has the limitation of designing a product based only on input from the consumer. Under certain circumstances, designer preferences are an important source of expertise that needs to supplement consumer preferences in the product design problem, This research proposes a unique way of designing products using the distinct and parallel opinions from both the consumer and the designer, a concept we call designer-moderated product design. This paper 1) makes a case for using designer as well as consumer preferences; 2) formulates a share-of-choices model for designer-moderated product designs; 3) develops and evaluates a heuristic to solve the problem using genetic algorithm techniques; and 3) presents a real application of the model and the heuristic.

J	Zhang, LM; Wen, M; Ashuri, B				Zhang, Limao; Wen, Ming; Ashuri, Baabak			BIM Log Mining: Measuring Design Productivity	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Log data; Process mining; Productivity measurement; Pattern discovery	CONSTRUCTION; PATTERNS; SYSTEM	There has been a long debate on how to measure design productivity. Compared to construction productivity, design productivity is much more difficult to measure because design is an iterative and innovative process. Today, with rapid extension of building information modeling (BIM) applications, tremendous volumes of design logs have been generated by design software systems, such as Autodesk Revit. A systematic approach composed of a detailed step-by-step procedure is developed to deeply mine design logs in order to monitor and measure the productivity of the design process. A pattern retrieval algorithm is proposed to identify the most frequent design sequential patterns in building design projects. A novel metric for measuring design productivity based on the discovered sequential patterns is put forward. A large data set of design logs, provided by a large international design firm, is used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that: (1) typically, each designer executes specific commands more than any other commands; for instance, it is shown for a designer that the accumulative frequency of three commands can reach up to 56.15% of the entire number of commands executed by the designer; (2) a particular sequential pattern of design commands (\" pick lines -> \"trim/extend two lines or walls to make a corner -> \"finish sketch") has been executed 2,219 times, accounting for 46.75% of instances associated with the top five discovered sequential patterns of design commands; (3) the identified sequential patterns can be used as a project control mean to detect outlier performers that may require additional attention from project leaders; and (4) productivity performance within the discovered sequential patterns varies significantly among different designers; for instance, one of the designers (designer #6 in the case study) is identified as the most productive designer in executing both Patterns I and II, whereas another designer (Designer #1) is found to be the most productive designer in executing both Patterns III and IV. It is also uncovered that designers, on average, spend less time running the most observed sequential patterns of design commands as they gain more experience. This research contributes: (1) to the body of knowledge by providing a novel approach to monitoring, measuring, and analyzing design productivity; and (2) to the state of practice by providing new insights into what additional design process information can be retrieved from Revit journal files.

J	Zhang, LY; Sun, H				Zhang, Lianying; Sun, Hui			The impacts of ethical climate on knowledge contribution loafing among designers in engineering design firms: mediated effect of knowledge leadership	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ethical climate; Knowledge contribution loafing; Knowledge leadership; Engineering design firms	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; ORIENTED LEADERSHIP; TRUST; JUSTICE; ARCHITECTS; RETENTION; BEHAVIOR; TEAMS; GOALS; POWER	Purpose Knowledge contribution loafing as one of the major obstacles to knowledge sharing among designers in engineering design firms impedes better achievement of engineering design. The purpose of this paper is to examine different types of ethical climate impacts on knowledge contribution loafing among designers through the mediating effect of knowledge leadership. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a quantitative research design, data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 352 designers in engineering design firms. The data were analyzed using the partial-least squares structural equation modeling approach to test hypotheses. Findings Ethical climate is an important factor to affect knowledge contribution loafing among designers, and three types of ethical climate (self-interest, social responsibility and law/professional codes) have different degrees of influence on knowledge contribution loafing. In addition, knowledge leadership can alleviate knowledge contribution loafing, and it is a mediator between ethical climate and knowledge contribution loafing. Practical implications Engineering design firms should cultivate and strengthen the role of social responsibility, law/professional codes and knowledge leadership and reduce the influence of self-interest to mitigate the negative of knowledge contribution loafing among designers. Originality/value By identifying ethical climate as a novel influence factor for knowledge contribution loafing, this research further highlights the role of different types of ethical climate in an engineering design context. Moreover, it delves deeply into the issue around different types of ethical climate affect knowledge contribution loafing among designers through the role of knowledge leadership. This broadens the understanding of how ethical climate affects knowledge contribution loafing among designers in the engineering design organizations and enriches knowledge management literatures in engineering design industry.

J	Ibrahim, R; Rahimian, FP				Ibrahim, Rahinah; Rahimian, Farzad Pour			Comparison of CAD and manual sketching tools for teaching architectural design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Conceptual design; VR 3D sketching; Design collaboration; CAD; Protocol analysis	ORGANIZATIONS; KNOWLEDGE	Communications for information synchronisation during the conceptual design phase usually require designers to employ more flexible and intuitive digital design tools. In developing such support tools, a case study research was initiated to first understand the current state of communication among novice design team members. The main purpose of the study is to understand the novice designers' collaboration culture when working on conceptual architectural design projects. The overall case study research involves 1) ethnography for data collection and 2) artefact and protocol analyses for data analysis. This paper presents the latter data analyses based on the earlier ethnography results about novice designers' conceptual design and technology design synthesis strategies. Data analyses on the characteristics of utilised external representation tools indicate that although conventional manual sketching is beneficial for providing rich intuitive design concepts, they have limitations when novice designers need to oversee complicated design problems. The study also found that although current conventional CAD tools are advantageous for detailed engineering design articulation, they do hinder novice designers' creativity due to their intuitive ideation limitation. Based on these results, this paper discusses the identified advantages and challenges of current design media and then proposes an alternative VR-based design interface for enhancing cognition and communication among designers during the conceptual design phase.

J	Fu, MC; Hayes, CC; East, EW				Fu, MC; Hayes, CC; East, EW			SEDAR: Expert critiquing system for flat and low-slope roof design and review	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The Support Environment for Design And Review (SEDAR) is a flexible, graphical expert critiquing system for use by both designers and reviewers during the design of flat and low-slope structure roof systems. SEDAR provides assistance during the design and review phases of the design process through the use of its error prevention, error detection, and design review critics, and a design suggestion critic. The primary contribution of SEDAR to the field of expert critiquing systems is a method for focusing its critiques through the use of a task model of the design domain. The task model, called the Designer's Task Model (DTM), was created from observing how roof designers decompose the roof-design task into interdependent subtasks associated with the layout of roof subsystems. SEDAR uses DTM to flexibly track the progress of roof designers so that its critics can provide the most relevant advice at appropriate times in the design process. Evaluation of a SEDAR prototype demonstrated that the system reduces the number of errors for roof designers and outlined directions for future research.

J	Morrow, S; Hare, B; Cameron, I				Morrow, Susan; Hare, Billy; Cameron, Iain			Design engineers' perception of health and safety and its impact in the design process	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perception; Health and safety; Education; Grounded theory; Design behaviour; Designers	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider design engineers' perception of health and safety and its impact on their behaviour during design activity. The study presents three types of design engineers each, exhibiting particular tendencies when faced with health and safety considerations during design. The discovery of these tendencies pose important implications for education and professional institutions and practical measures are suggested to help design engineers manage their tendencies to be more conducive to ensuring improved health and safety performance. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory design method was used - grounded theory, to include 13, in-depth, one-to-one interviews with design engineers, representing junior staff, middle and senior management. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights about how designers think and behave when asked to consider health and safety issues during the design process. It identifies three group types of designers: doers, receivers and givers, who will exhibit their particular tendencies based on how they view and understand the term health and safety. Research limitations/implications - The data obtained were from design engineers only, and therefore the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for those involved in the creation and development of designers e.g., educators and professional bodies. The data forms the basis for helping designers to manage their perceptions towards the term health and safety and thus, their tendencies exhibited in their behaviour. Originality/value - This paper contributes to new understanding of designers' behaviour and considers the significance of how designers' views of health and safety will influence their behaviour.

J	Zhang, LM; Ashuri, B				Zhang, Limao; Ashuri, Baabak			BIM log mining: Discovering social networks	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social network; BIM; Log mining; Collaborative design; Revit; Production	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CENTRALITY; DESIGN; SYSTEM	This research develops a systematic methodology to deeply mine tremendous volumes of design logs (that are generated from Building Information Model (BIM) design process) to discover social networks in BIM-based collaborative design practices and examine the relationship between the characteristics of the design social network and production performance of designers. Firstly, a data extraction procedure consisting of data harvesting, parsing, and cleaning is proposed to obtain BIM design logs in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format from several designers over the course of working on multiple projects. Secondly, a metric of working together on joint cases is proposed to build up a weighted sociogram that is consisting of performers P, relations R, and weights W. Lastly, a number of indicators are defined to measure and analyze structural characteristics of the discovered BIM-based collaborative network at macro-, meso-, and micro- levels. A dataset of design logs that involves 51 designers working on 82 projects with 620,492 lines of commands, provided by a major international design firm, is used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed approach in this research. Results indicate that: (i) Strong positive correlations exist across all centrality measures calculated based on the discovered social network of BIM-based collaborative design where designers located in the center of the interaction map (with the greatest degree centralities), such as designers "#2" and "#24", are generally those who provide the shortest communication channels (with highest betweenness centralities) and are most reachable for others (with highest closeness centralities); and (ii) All the node centrality measures are significantly and positively related to the production performance of designers in the BIM-based collaborative network. Particularly, the measured node degree centrality by weight is capable of explaining the greatest percentage of variations (71.13%) in the production performance of designers. This research contributes to: (a) The state of knowledge by proposing a novel methodology that is capable of capturing and modeling collaborations among designers from tremendous event logs to discover social networks; and (b) The state of practice by providing insight into a better understanding of relationships between sociological network characteristics and production performance of designers within a design firm.

Strong interorganizational relationships are considered relevant to project performance. Previous research has focused on contractual relationships in direct supply chains, with little attention to suppliers and their non-contractual relationships. This study develops and tests a framework of relationship strength and its antecedents in the non-contractual relationship between suppliers and designers as third parties in construction projects. The intent is to identify the key factors relevant to enhancing the supplier's non-contractual relationships with designers. The results reveal the supplier's activeness and technical capability as antecedents to trust, and supplier's technical capability and supplier designer cooperation beyond project boundaries as antecedents to commitment. The different antecedents of trust and commitment imply alternative pathways for strengthening non-contractual relationships in construction projects, thereby deviating from activities in contractual relationships. Further research is proposed on other types of third parties and other antecedents of commitment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Designers were presented with a task specifically tailored to facilitate the extraction of what they consider useful parameters, indices, diagrammatic and multimodal ways of representing results as well as possibilities of undertaking design changes when building thermal physics was embedded in their design decisions. The experiment generated design journals with all the steps these designers undertook in solving a design problem which included thermal comfort, energy efficiency targets and the testing of passive design strategies. A qualitative research method, from social sciences, was used to analyze these design journals. Examples extracted from the analysis are useful information to thermal simulation tool software researchers who are rarely provided with adequate examples about how to connect time-series graphs and tables containing temperatures and loads with building elements designers manipulate.

This investigation what building designers are doing to embed the low carbon policy aspirations in routine project design, based on a comparative ethnographic study. The researcher documented the design process observed in four non-domestic buildings procured by design and build method. This article documents the tools deployed by building designers to embed energy performance. The analysis of the design tools unveils the low carbon problem-solving process. A number of informal tools and practices were found to be used in the design process to assist the outline of the energy aspirations, understanding and calculation of energy performance. These informal mechanisms supported the adoption of regulations and compliance tools by building designers. The field data suggests that there are pre-existing practices and designers' preferences that are the foreground where the policy requirements are to be incorporated. It is necessary that the policy model is informed by the designers' dimension to overcome the non-technical barriers that hinder the implementation of low carbon policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, users' limited comprehension in the three dimensional space may reduce the efficiency of requirement specification as well as design review process. This paper introduces a Building Information Modeling-based user activity simulation and evaluation method (UASEM), which aims to facilitate the designer-user communications. It assists users to specify their activities in new buildings and simulates these activities based on the building information models. It also helps to conduct a pre-occupancy evaluation. The UASEM was adopted in a case study of a university campus project. The result indicated that this method has potential to improve users' understanding of the design solutions, especially in terms of spatial properties of the layout. It can also improve users' confidence to express comments and increase their willingness to collaboratively work with designers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B..V. All rights reserved.

The system enables designers to locate and retrieve information from distributed resources. There are three types of agents in the proposed model. The 'user agents' consist of designers, engineers, and technicians. The 'information agents' include various knowledge domains as legislation, codes, previous cases, expert domains. The 'communication agents' that identify and match agents are based on the goals and agent's interest. The communication agents working over the Web use sketches as a collaboration medium in the conceptual phase of the design process. The results of the empirical study showed that the design domain and variables; and design strategies and activities are not independent of each other. The quality of a project increases as the communication increases among collaborators during the conceptual design phase and the Internet provides a suitable medium for communication through sketches.

Combining structural performance and designer preferences in evolutionary design space exploration	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Conceptual design; Structural design; Structural optimization; Design space exploration; Evolutionary algorithms		This paper addresses the need to consider both quantitative performance goals and qualitative requirements in conceptual design. A new computational approach for design space exploration is proposed that extends existing interactive evolutionary algorithms for increased inclusion of designer preferences, overcoming the weaknesses of traditional optimization that have limited its use in practice. This approach allows designers to set the evolutionary parameters of mutation rate and generation size, in addition to parent selection, in order to steer design space exploration. This paper demonstrates the potential of this approach through a numerical parametric study, a software implementation, and series of case studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It shows that, in theory, the two paradigms seem to be incommensurable but complementary due to differences in knowledge and praxis between the two professions. The author discusses these differences side-by-side based on a review of the design science literature together with an analysis of the basic structure and knowledge involved in existing thermal simulation tools. This discussion aims to unfold a set of insights into the type of approach needed to move this research area further. It highlights the modus operandi of the building designer rather than focusing on collaborative efforts and sets up the backgrounds for designers to learn relevant concepts of building physics in an environment in which they can experiment with these concepts as 'craftsmen'.

Without such involvement, one can argue that the techniques developed are not subjected to any form of evaluation or independent scrutiny and thus the methodology is wanting in terms of scientific rigor. The paper describes a research project to examine the use of evolutionary computing techniques for the design of commercial office-type buildings.

J	Jin, ZY; Gambatese, J; Liu, D; Dharmapalan, V				Jin, Ziyu; Gambatese, John; Liu, Ding; Dharmapalan, Vineeth			Using 4D BIM to assess construction risks during the design phase	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Case study; Building information modelling; Construction planning; Construction safety	SAFETY HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION MODELING BIM; PREVENTION; FRAMEWORK; CHECKING	Purpose The prevention through design (PtD) concept has been widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches to eliminate or reduce construction site hazards. It encourages engineers and architects to consider occupational safety and health during the planning and design phases. Nevertheless, the implementation of PtD is often inhibited because designers lack adequate knowledge about construction safety and the construction process, and limited design-for-safety tools and procedures are available for designers to use. The purpose of this paper is to provide designers a tool for assessing construction risks during early phases of multistory building projects at an activity level and on a daily basis in a 4D environment. By using the tool, proactive measures could be taken in the design and planning phase to reduce site hazards. Design/methodology/approach The proposed method consists of four steps including risk quantification at a design element level, 4D model integration with risk values, risk assessment, and design alternative selection and model acceptance. A case study was carried out to test and verify the proposed method. Findings The proposed tool has the capability to assess the safety risk for an entire multistory project and visualize safety risk in a particular time period, work space and task prior to construction. It benefits designers in conducting risk assessments and selecting design alternatives concerning safety. Contractors could also utilize the visualization and simulation results of the 4D model for site safety planning so that a range of risk mitigation strategies could be implemented during construction. Originality/value The study provides an innovative PtD tool targeting designers as primary end-users. The proposed tool helps designers assess construction risks and has potential to incorporate the top levels of the hierarchy of risk controls.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework and propositions on enhanced relationship strength between component suppliers and designers as third parties. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual approach is used in this paper. Previous empirical research on business relationships, project networks and relationship strength is reviewed systematically, to identify factors required for strengthening the relationship in project networks. Findings - Cooperative practices needed for strengthening the relationships in project networks were identified. The framework on how such practices are associated with relationship strength between supplier and designers was developed. Propositions on strengthening the relationship between component suppliers and designers were stated. These propositions can be developed further and tested in a hypothetic-deductive study. Research limitations/implications - The research was delimited by the choice of designers as third parties. The authors used some excerpts from the earlier interview study with over 20 designers, to illustrate the issues. Empirical analysis was not included in this paper which causes an evident limitation to validity. Additional research is proposed on analyzing the contractors' and suppliers' viewpoints to third-party relationships. Practical implications - The paper suggests cooperative practices for construction component suppliers to enhance their relationship strength with third parties in project networks. Originality/value - Limited research attention has been directed at the third-party relationships of suppliers in project networks. This paper offers important knowledge about these less salient relationships in project networks, beyond a simple dyadic relationship in the direct supply chain.

Social scientific approaches offer insights on the lack of progress. However, few previous studies have investigated psychological factors despite the pivotal role of the individual professional decision-maker. The aim was to understand what personal motivations drive architectural designers to pursue sustainable design in their work and whether non-environmental motivations can drive sustainable outcomes. Twenty-eight architectural designers in 14 small firms in the London area were interviewed. Thematic analysis was conducted, informed by the self-determination theory of motivation. Although extrinsic motivators were noted, autonomous motivations including a moral imperative and personal commitment predominated. Further, the participants demonstrated other self-determined motivations including realization of self-identity, pursuit of quality in design and awareness of their work's impact on people. These autonomous motivations align closely with sustainability principles including design for durability, high standards and technical expertise. The findings point to the risks of reliance on extrinisic motivators such as regulation, and the opportunities to engage architectural designers more extensively in sustainable design by linking sustainability to autonomous motivations.

J	Rafiq, MY; Packham, ISJ; Easterbrook, DJ; Denham, SL				Rafiq, MY; Packham, ISJ; Easterbrook, DJ; Denham, SL			Visualizing search and solution spaces in the optimum design of biaxial columns	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						computation; optimization; design; columns; imaging techniques		Optimum detailing of reinforcement bars for biaxial columns is a nontrivial task and there is no guidance in the codes of practice on this issue. Conventional methods of producing a single design solution and the use of optimization methods to find a single global optimum solution is not what practicing engineers require. This paper introduces an innovative approach to design, which emphasizes the interactive use of evolutionary computing in design and a new approach to visualization of search and solution spaces. This replaces the '' black box '' nature of the optimization techniques with an interactive approach in which the designer is in full control of the process. Instead of locating a single solution, clusters of good designs are identified in color, allowing the designer to conduct a more focused search in the areas of high performance design solutions. This method enables the designer to view individual solutions in the vicinity of the local peaks in order to learn more about the interrelationship between design parameters. Interactive visualization tools enable designers to develop a deeper understanding of the search and solution spaces and assist them in evaluating the merits of alternative designs and in their decision making. A by-product of visualization is knowledge discovery, which allows the designer to discover novel solutions that would not have been possible by conventional means. This approach could be easily extended to any stage of multidisciplinary design, especially to the conceptual stage of the design process. For example, the position of bars within a column is similar to the position of columns in a floor layout optimization problem.

Based on two sets of survey data collected from designers and general contractors in BIM-based construction projects in China, the results from partial least squares analysis and bootstrapping mediation test provide clear evidence that BIM-enabled capabilities of information sharing and collaborative decision-making as a whole play a significant role in determining BIM-enabled efficiency and effectiveness benefits for both designers and general contractors. The results further reveal that designers and general contractors benefit from project BIM implementation activities significantly non-equivalently, and that this non-equivalence closely relates to the different roles played by designers and general contractors in BIM-enabled interorganizational resource exchange processes. The findings validate the resource dependence theory perspective of BIM as a boundary spanning tool to manage interorganizational resource dependence in construction projects, and contribute to deepened understandings of how and why project participating organizations benefit differently from the implementation of interorganizational information technologies like BIM.

Recent studies have shown that many construction fatalities are related to design and could have been avoided with proper design considerations. Nevertheless, designers have limited knowledge about construction safety and often are unable to identify how their designs may pose a risk during the life cycle of a building facility such as construction, operation and maintenance. Limited effort has been made to help designer to address these safety issues in the design phase. This study presents a structured DfS rule-based knowledge library to provide safety knowledge to designer. Using the DfS knowledge library, an Intelligent BIM-integrated risk review system is proposed to help designers identify risk related to their design element along with required design features. A risk register system is also developed in the BIM platform to follow up for any residual risk. The proposed risk review system has been examined with an illustrative case project. It is found that many of the risks could have been avoided/eliminated with the DfS knowledge library and intelligent risk review system early in the design phase. Thus, it would help to avoid any unexpected delay or costly design change late in the project to mitigate the risk.	[Hossain, Md. Aslam; Abbott, Ernest L.

Nevertheless, little is known about its acceptance in the construction community. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the views of industry stakeholders on safety design in the harmonized safety regulations of South Australia. A desk study on pre- and post-harmonized WHS regulations reveals that design for safety now constitutes a major theme in practice following the harmonization process. After that, a questionnaire survey is conducted to investigate the use of design for safety in the construction industry. The results show that the guidelines promote safety-related design requirements without significantly increasing designers' and contractors' workload. Designers are aware of the hazards on sites and design firms are willing to embrace the guidelines if they are protected from liability. However, the extent to which contracting and procurement systems encourage safety design is uncertain. Moreover, the problem of cost hinders designers in implementing it unless the client accepts it as part of the over-arching life cycle cost structure. There is great uncertainty on whether the concept will be promoted through regulation and subsequently lead to a reduction in hazardous risks and injury rates.

Design subspace learning: Structural design space exploration using performance-conditioned generative modeling	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Deep generative modeling; Latent space; Latent variable; Variational autoencoder; Design space; Computational design		Designers increasingly rely on parametric design studies to explore and improve structural concepts based on quantifiable metrics, generally either by generating design variations manually or using optimization methods. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have important shortcomings: effectively searching a large design space manually is infeasible, and design optimization overlooks qualitative aspects important in architectural and structural design. There is a need for methods that take advantage of computing intelligence to augment a designer's creativity while guiding-not forcing-their search for better-performing solutions. This research addresses this need by integrating conditional variational autoencoders in a performance-driven design exploration framework. First, a sampling algorithm generates a dataset of meaningful design options from an unwieldy design space. Second, a performance-conditioned variational autoencoder with a low-dimensional latent space is trained using the collected data. This latent space is intuitive to explore by designers even as it offers a diversity of high-performing design options.

J	Gambatese, JA; Toole, TM; Abowitz, DA				Gambatese, John A.; Toole, T. Michael; Abowitz, Deborah A.			Owner Perceptions of Barriers to Prevention through Design Diffusion	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prevention through design; Safety; Owner; Designer; Constructor; Barriers; Labor and personnel issues	CONSTRUCTION; ISSUES	Prevention through design (PtD) is an emerging concept for reducing safety hazards and preventing worker injuries and fatalities. Existing literature suggests that diffusion of PtD faces several significant barriers. This paper reports the results of a funded 2-year research study examining how employees in owner firms perceive potential barriers to PtD, including designers' lack of knowledge about performing PtD, increased designer fees, and designers' resistance to PtD due to fears of increased liability exposure. The research included an industrywide survey of owner-organization employees and case studies of four owner organizations, two of which had formal PtD programs. Research findings indicate that barriers to PtD suggested in the literature are not perceived to be as substantial as predicted. Owner employees are attracted to PtD and believe that it is a viable concept for enhancing construction safety. In practice, implementation requires that owners are knowledgeable about PtD, communicate their interest in PtD to the project team, confirm PtD as a high priority, and establish project processes to implement and monitor its success. The research findings are unique; they provide evidence of a pathway for PtD diffusion that was not previously available. In addition, the findings contribute to the knowledge in this area by providing guidance on how owner organizations participating in construction projects can act to successfully implement PtD on their projects.

J	Gu, N; Kim, MJ; Maher, ML				Gu, Ning; Kim, Mi Jeong; Maher, Mary Lou			Technological advancements in synchronous collaboration: The effect of 3D virtual worlds and tangible user interfaces on architectural design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Synchronous design collaboration; Remote design collaboration; Co-located design collaboration; 3D virtual worlds; Tangible user interfaces; Design cognition; Protocol analysis		This paper presents and evaluates two current advancements of collaborative technologies for architectural design. The paper focuses on technologies that support synchronous design collaboration, in particular, 3D virtual worlds for supporting remote design collaboration, and tangible user interfaces (This) for enhancing co-located design collaboration. Both technologies enable designers to collaborate by interacting with 3D models as the design representations. The paper analyzes the effect of these technologies on design collaboration and cognition through a comprehensive interpretation of the results from two independent studies. These two studies, using protocol analysis and each focusing on a different mode of design collaboration, provide the foundation for characterizing the designers' cognition, communication and interaction when using the new technologies. The 3D virtual worlds study investigates remote design collaboration in a 3D virtual world in order to understand the changes of design behavior when designers are physically remote but virtually co-located as avatars within their design representation in the form of a 3D model. The TUI study measures the effect of a tabletop system that integrates TUIs together with augmented reality (AR) on designers' cognitive activities and design process in co-located design collaboration. Finally, the analysis and comparison of the results converge in a set of recommendations for the future development of collaborative design technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Karan, E; Asadi, S				Karan, Ebrahim; Asadi, Somayeh			Intelligent designer: A computational approach to automating design of windows in buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building design; Automation; Artificial intelligence; Markov decision process	GENERATION; SIMULATION	The process of building design is a means of meeting client expectations for a building, followed by a set of comprehensive standards and codes relating to the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings. The rapidly rising volume of data along with increasing client expectations inspired many researchers to develop new computerized techniques to automate building design process. These techniques can be broken down into two broad categories: automated computer-aided design tools (e.g., development of building information modeling or BIM) and measuring or modeling client expectations (e.g., use of facial expressions to find psychological expectations of the client). Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have made possible new approaches to the automation of design. This represents a shift from a focus on client-designer or designer-technology relationships to a more intelligent and independent client-technology communication. In this paper, a novel AI system called intelligent designer is proposed to understand (or learn) the client's need and expectations and generate valid designs. The design environment (i.e., the interaction between the client and the design) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a mathematical framework is provided for making design decisions in situations where new designs are partly random (as they are influenced by the client's feedback) and partly under the control of the computer (as they are influenced by the regulations, standards, and guidelines). The approach is demonstrated using a window design experiment.

It allows designers to effectively reach a balanced cost-safety configuration in the design of structures. In this study, a simulation-based method is presented for RBDO problems in which the design variables are treated as random variables. The method works by uniformly distributing samples in the design space and employing a feature that allows the designer to obtain the optimum design solution by performing only one simulation run. Moreover, the proposed feature also helps the designer to use the results of aforementioned run to provide multilevel design solutions when the arrangement of the design problem is changed. The robustness and accuracy of the method are examined by solving design problems with highly nonlinear constraints and comparing with the results of common RBDO methods. The results confirm the robustness of the method for highly nonlinear problems with different design arrangements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Morozumi, M; Shimokawa, Y; Homma, R				Morozumi, M; Shimokawa, Y; Homma, R			Schematic design system for flexible and multi-aspect design thinking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Media and Design Process	1999	SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH			schematic design; CAD; model		A designer-friendly CAD for a schematic design is one of the important topics of CAD studies. There were attractive preceding studies aiming to develop a CAD that intended to enable designers to have flexible design thinking and interactively manipulate representation models. This paper has the same goals of study, but focuses on the needs to support flexible and multi-aspect design thinking. Though designers normally hope to elaborate on their ideas using separate sets of representation models suitable for respective studies, a present CAD that is designed to build a single set 3D model, has limited its ability as a tool for a schematic design, Assuming this as the base concept, authors have studied to develop a prototype of a schematic design system, customizing AutoCAD R14J: Schematic Design System '98 (SDS'98). It has convenient utilities both for building separate sets of representation models and for integrating and reconciling those models to build a single consolidate model. This paper discusses the common procedures of schematic design studies, necessary functional features for SDS, a case study of the system use, and finally, the advantages and the disadvantages of the proposed system.

The findings suggest that while there is some consensus among parties to a construction project relative to CM duties particularly in the construction phase, there is also some disagreement, most of which appear to be between contractors and designers. Most disagreements are related to CM duties performed in the bidding and postconstruction phases of projects.

Design media are intended to support the cognitive nature of design and, particularly, the exploitation of design knowledge in computational environments. Basic theoretical assumptions are presented which underlie the development of design media. A central assumption is that designers share common forms of design knowledge which can be formalized, represented, and employed in computational environments. Generic knowledge is proposed as one such seminal form of design knowledge. We then develop a cognitive model which relates to the internal mental representations, strategies and mechanisms of generic design. The paper emphasizes the theoretical foundations of design media. This theoretical discussion is then exemplified through case studies presenting current research for the support of visual cognition in design. We introduce an approach to design schema as a visual form of generic design knowledge. Secondly we present a conceptual framework for the support of schema emergence in visual reasoning in design media. Finally, some implications of schema emergence in design collaboration are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of an MDO process is highly dependent on designers' ability to structure the optimization problem for specific challenges, particularly when specifying how building attributes and their associated geometry are configured for an optimization process. This research fills these gaps in MDO literature by developing a computer-aided design (CAD)-centric attribution methodology for multidisciplinary optimization environments (CAMMOE). CAMMOE enables designers to improve the accuracy of their optimization processes by helping them develop and analyze alternative spaces that are of just the right size and composition to meet their design intent. The writers demonstrate the potential power and generality of CAMMOE to enable designers to formulate MDO problems that can be executed efficiently and effectively with two industry case studies.

To improve knowledge sharing, this article investigates the effect of knowledge leadership on knowledge sharing in engineering project design teams by examining the role of social capital. Our results show a significant indirect effect of knowledge leadership on knowledge sharing through the mediating role of social capital.

Perceptions about Design for Construction Worker Safety: Viewpoints from Contractors, Designers, and University Facility Owners	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accident prevention; Accidents; Construction industry; Design; Occupational safety; Owners; Safety; Project planning and design		Decisions made before construction can affect safety on the construction site, either positively or negatively. This was observed from past research that identified the link between design decisions and fatalities. The concept of implementing design decisions that positively affect safety falls under the general concept of prevention through design (PtD), which attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process to eliminate the risks of injury or damage during construction. Prevention through design is practiced in other countries, primarily through legislation. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a survey that was conducted to identify construction industry stakeholders' views on the concept of PtD and gauge the possibility for implementing PtD in the U.S. construction industry through either legislation or other means. Four distinct groups were surveyed: engineers, architects, contractors, and owners. Within this study, PtD was described and introduced to survey participants as design for construction worker safety (DCWS) to differentiate PtD efforts in construction from efforts in other industries. The survey consisted of questions that asked about the industry's knowledge of PtD and the extent of PtD practice in the United States, participants' opinions on designer and owner safety knowledge and perceptions, and obstacles and enablers for designer participation in construction safety. The responses from the various groups were compared to identify the groups that are more receptive to the idea of designer participation in construction worker safety. The results showed that architects were the least receptive to the idea, whereas the other groups were more likely to be supportive, with some hesitations. Architects and engineers identified the existence of economic, legal, and contractual obstacles for designers to practice DCWS, whereas contractors only identified economic obstacles. No enablers were identified by any group. The research contributes additional information that can be used by construction industry practitioners and organizations desiring to expand and optimize PtD implementation in the United States. The research results can be used by project teams to plan for PtD education and training efforts on projects and by construction industry organizations to develop PtD diffusion strategies.

Construction professionals from diverse locales were asked to rate a list of 53 potential factors for the objectives of schedule, budget, and quality, and additionally compare the objectives for overall project success. The set of 53 factors was enriched by eliminating 13 factors that could not prove their statistical significance for even one of schedule, budget, or quality performances for any of the three organizations. Commissioning the 40 significant factors, an analytical hierarchy process was used to determine organization-based factor rankings for overall project success. Spearman's test on rankings of the 40 significant factors for overall project performance results in a highest level of correlation between the managers and contractor personnel (r(s) = 0.54), followed by that between the managers and the designers (r(s) = 0.50), and a least correlation between the contractor personnel and the designers (r(s) = 0.19). Hence for successful project implementation, professional construction managers have an edge over the designers in supervising the contractors. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Won, PH				Won, PH			The comparison between visual thinking using computer and conventional media in the concept generation stages of design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						concept generation; sketch; visual thinking; computer-aided design		The computer, the new media, reaches out and influences the behavior of design as it does almost every facet of life. In recent years, much research into the development of computer-aided design has looked at the concept generation stage of the design process. Most of these applied studies have focused on the testing of computer systems. On the other hand, there are also many studies on the visual thinking and cognitive behavior of designers while sketching or drawing in the stage of concept generation. From the synthesis of the two aforementioned disciplines, we can find that there exists a point of deficiency. That is, the cognitive research about designers using computers as sketching media is absent. It is this area that is discussed in the current paper. The fundamental analytic data of this research is the visual process chronicled from the sketching of subjects. The analytic data is the verbal data from the questions that the subjects are asked after sketching. The data is analyzed using three coding schemes. The cognitive appearance while designers generating concepts with computers or conventional media are propounded and discussed in this research. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Gambatese, JA; Behm, M; Hinze, JW				Gambatese, JA; Behm, M; Hinze, JW			Viability of designing for construction worker safety	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Designing for construction safety entails. consideration of the safety of construction workers in the design of a project. Research studies have identified the design aspect of projects as being a significant contributing factor to construction site accidents. Designing to eliminate or avoid hazards prior to exposure on the jobsite is also listed as the too priority in the hierarchy of controls common to the safety and health professions. Widespread implementation of the concept in the United States by engineering and architecture firms, however, is lacking due to perceived industry and project barriers. Given its absence from standard design practice, a question arises as to the viability of designing for safety as an intervention in the construction industry. This paper presents a pilot study that was conducted to investigate the practice of addressing construction worker safety when designing a project and, to determine the feasibility and practicality of such an intervention. Through interviews of architects and engineers, the study found that a large percentage of design professionals are interested and willing to implement the concept in practice. Among the perceived impacts of implementation, project cost and schedule were mentioned-most often along with limitations being placed on design creativity. The results of the pilot study indicate that designing for safety is a viable intervention in construction. The factors that impact the consideration of safety in-the design of a project do not entirely prohibit its implementation or make its implementation extremely impractical and therefore not feasible. Additionally, the outcomes of implementation provide sufficient motivation to implement the concept in practice. The paper describes the key changes needed for implementation of the concept in practice which include: a change in designer mindset toward safety; establishment of a motivational force to promote designing for safety; increase designer knowledge of the concept; incorporate construction safety knowledge in the design phase; utilize designers knowledgeable about design-for-safety modification's; make design for safety tools and guidelines available for use and reference; and mitigate designer liability exposure.

J	Stollmann, J				Stollmann, Joerg			Neighbourhood resilience in mass housing: co-production via research-by-design	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						agency; built environment; collaboration; co-production; design education; housing; neighbourhood design; participation; resilience; resourcefulness; urban politics		In the debate on neighbourhood resilience, there is a demand for co-production involving inhabitants in adaptation processes. Neighbourhood resilience is discussed in terms of economic, ecological and socio-political capacities, making place-people relations a key factor. Academia-led research-by-design projects are engaging in resilience-building, but professional roles are still unclear. Architects, planners and urban designers often have limited knowledge about the specific community and the socio-economic impacts of their projects. This especially occurs in modernist mass-housing settlements within current conditions of neo-liberalization. Here, inhabitants and designers have only limited access to decision-making power and resources. More significantly, the spatial improvements might endanger major resources: the social cohesion and affordability of the neighbourhood. Using the concepts of collaboration (versus cooperation) and resourcefulness (versus resilience), this paper discusses the advantages and limits of academic design projects using two cases from the Academy of a New Gropiusstadt (AnG) in Berlin, Germany. Based on a process of community-based research-by-design, these projects activate spatial facilities and employ full-scale interventions to improve local resilience. Resourceful collaboration at the neighbourhood level demands new intermediary actors and designers as advocates with multi-scalar and transdisciplinary knowledge and abilities to assess and engage with the impacts of their co-produced design work.

A designer's selection of building systems and materials during early design phase becomes more important. It is essential that designers include embodied energy and emissions among other criteria they use in selecting materials during the design development phase of a building. The aim of this study is to develop a model to integrate the embodied energy, embodied emissions, and cost of the alternative structure and envelope systems of a building during the design development stage. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model is proposed to integrate the embodied energy, embodied emissions, and cost of the alternative structure and envelope systems of a building. A case study is used to test the proposed model in predicting the embodied impacts and cost of structure and envelope systems for an educational building. Findings The proposed model can assist designers in making informed decisions at the early design stage and selecting alternative structure and envelope systems considering embodied impacts and costs. Originality/value Development of a model that can be used to support design decisions regarding sustainable design (embodied energy and embodied carbon emissions) and costs of buildings in early design phase.

J	Breen, J; Nottrot, R; Stellingwerff, M				Breen, J; Nottrot, R; Stellingwerff, M			Tangible virtuality - perceptions of computer-aided and physical modelling	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Design E-ducation - Connecting the Real and the Virtual (eCAADe 2002)	2002	WARSAW, POLAND			computer-aided modelling; rapid prototyping; virtual reality; design education; 3D printer		Designing-giving form to new objects or environments-is largely a question of anticipating the workings of spatial and material environments, which can become 'reality' only by being built. Until 'realized', a design is essentially a figment of the designer's imagination, although his or her ideas may be laid down and conveyed to others via specialized design media. In this way, impressions of the design may be shared with clients, colleagues or other 'actors' in the design process. Such products of the designer's imaging process can be relatively abstract or begin to approach future reality. Form & Media research can be 'revealing', stimulating insights concerning preferences, working processes and the effects of products of the designer's imagination. In the past 10 years, we have gained considerable practical experience with both virtual and tangible (scale) models. We have compared different techniques in conference workshops, within educational settings and in our Form & Media research laboratory. The research projects ranged from the development of practical techniques and working methods to protocol analyses of designing architects. This contribution draws comparisons between different computer-aided modelling techniques, with an indication of their perspectives, making use of the experience gained from various experiments in an educational context, and will highlight the potentials for different combinations of digital and physical modelling techniques.

J	Hartmann, T				Hartmann, Timo			Semiotic User Interface Analysis of Building Information Model Systems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling; Semiotics; User interaction; Symbols, 4D CAD; Signs	FRAMEWORK; EXCHANGE; BIM	To promote understanding of how to use building information (BI) systems to support communication, this paper uses computer semiotic theory to study how user interfaces of BI systems operate as a carrier of meaning. More specifically, the paper introduces a semiotic framework for the analysis of BI system user interfaces and provides a first illustrative application of the framework by analyzing the user interfaces of several state-of-the-art BI software systems. The outcomes of the analysis show that the semiotic framework can improve understanding of how well meaning can be exchanged between BI system developers and building designers, between BI systems and building designers, and between building designers among each other. With these outcomes, the paper shows that the framework allows for gaining insights about how signs are used to convey meaning within complex scenes presented by the BI system. Additionally, the framework also allows understanding of the features of single signs in isolation. These results illustrate that semiotic frameworks that consider BI systems as knowledge encoding devices, can provide researchers, BI system developers, and BI system users with new perceptions on the BI systems' user interfaces that allow for a better use, but also development and implementation of BI systems.

J	Wang, YH				Wang, YH			Coordination issues in Chinese large building projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								After the year of 1990, many large-scale building projects mushroomed in China due to the increase of construction investments. From that time, many designers from the Western countries stepped into this new market to find new opportunities. Their appearance stimulated some positive changes of the local community, but also raised many concerns. The writer made a survey of seven projects in China designed by foreign design firms. Using the information from the survey, this paper evaluates the positive and negative effects of the foreign design on the Chinese construction market and the local community. According to the survey, one of the most conspicuous negative effects is the coordination issue between the foreign designers and the local project participants. This paper analyzes the different backgrounds of the Chinese and the Western construction industries as well as other factors that contribute to the coordination issue. It also evaluates and proposes some measures trying to solve this problem.

Based on the building design process and key design decisions undertaken at each phase, a knowledge set is developed to aid building designers to understand better the effects of design decisions on building fire performance. This also minimizes potential competing objectives in later design phases by sharing necessary concerns in advance. Drawing on the knowledge set, a conceptual building fire safety evaluation tool illustrates how primary building designers and fire safety engineers can quantitatively assess fire safety performance for different solutions. It is shown how building fire safety performance attributes can be arranged by building design phase, how various scenarios can be explored, and how appropriately balanced building design and fire safety design solutions can be identified at different phases of the building design process.

J	Huang, XY; Hinze, J				Huang, XY; Hinze, J			Owner's role in construction safety	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTABILITY; COSTS	Despite dramatic improvements in recent decades, the construction industry continues to be one of the industries with the poorest safety records. Recent improvements are due, in part, to the concerted efforts of owners, contractors, subcontractors, and designers. While past safety studies have investigated the roles of contractors, subcontractors, and designers, the owner's impact on construction safety has not been previously investigated. This paper will present the results of a study on the owner's role in construction safety. Data were obtained by conducting interviews on large construction projects. The relationship between project safety performance and the owner's influence was examined, with particular focus on project characteristics, the selection of safe contractors, contractual safety requirements, and the owner's participation in safety management during project execution. By identifying practices of owners that are associated with good project safety performances, guidance is provided on how owners directly impact safety performance.

Particular attention is given to methods for representing domain knowledge, necessary for creating a general building design model, and techniques that pen-nit the manipulation of both structural and architectural design aspects so that the power of the GA is effectively exploited to support the role of the designer as a decision maker. An example of a decision support system is presented, and its robustness and power of knowledge discovery are demonstrated by means of a parametric study. The role of human-computer interaction in knowledge discovery is also considered, both in the context of better understanding of the design domain and as a tool to increase user confidence in the outcome. This paper is addressed toward readers involved in conceptual building design who have basic knowledge of genetic algorithms.

A megaproject may involve hundreds of organizations that may be competing for a new subproject while collaborating on other subprojects. However, some organizations have competitive advantages to win more tenders than others, and the reasons for such emergence are not thoroughly investigated yet. This study analyzed the network-based bidding competitiveness and the evolution of collaboration networks by social network analysis (SNA) through a 6-year (2008-2013) case study of a zone development project in Wuxi, China, a total number of 1,897 construction projects. The constructed megaproject collaboration network consists of four key project stakeholders: owners, contractors, designers, and quality supervisors. The analytical results show that during the evolution of the collaboration network in China, contractors and designers who exhibit higher normalized degree centralities and larger K-core values are more likely to win a new project tendering competitively. At the same time, owners are primarily inclined to choose the "return" partners, especially designers, as collaborators for future projects. This study enriches the existing literature on the bidding competitiveness in megaprojects and helps us better understand the mechanism of collaboration and competition in megaprojects and provides effective and dynamic strategies to establish relational contracts in megaprojects.

In this paper, we propose the partitioned engineering data flow model (abbreviated PANDA), an extension of the data flow model developed to analyze facility engineering processes. PANDA provides the concepts necessary to do the analysis, while retaining the simplicity and ease of use of the data flow model. PANDA also provides graphical representations of these concepts. Moreover, PANDA has a unique multileveled partitioned data flow architecture. In PANDA, the data flow diagram is structured according to three major partitions: Participants, process, and data-material products. This architecture helps the designer organize thinking about a complicated engineering process and produce highly readable functional schemata. PANDA also includes syntactic and semantic rules and basic schema transformation operations. To assist the designer, PANDA offers a customized method that benefits from the model's partitioned architecture. PANDA was also applied to an industry transmission tower engineering domain.

Statistical analysis was conducted to investigate if consensus exists among the parties and to highlight the agreements and disagreements between them. The findings were compared against the findings of an identical study also commissioned by MPIC 10 years before this study was performed. This study raises awareness among project participants about the fact that they should reconcile their differences and have a common understanding of CM duties over all phases of the construction project since general agreement over CM duties makes CM scope negotiations all the easier.

J	van Leeuwen, JP; van der Zee, A				van Leeuwen, JP; van der Zee, A			Distributed object models for collaboration in the construction industry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction	SEP, 2003	Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, NETHERLANDS		Eindhoven Univ Technol	collaborative design; product data modelling; concept modelling; distributed object model; semantic web		Information about products for the construction industry is increasingly often provided to designers in digital ways that enable them to apply the information directly in the design process. Digital product catalogues are provided using various media and formats and several initiatives are taken by the industry and by CAD developers to integrate this kind of information into CAD systems. Generally, current practice is to distribute the information to designers, for example, by using CD-ROMs or a website where the information can be downloaded. In our research, we recognise that distributing information in this manner detaches it from the business processes in the construction supply chain, which is a major disadvantage. The project presented in this paper concerns the implementation in the Dutch construction industry of a methodology for sharing product information through a distributed object model. The methodology, which is called Concept Modelling, forms a generic basis for the support of collaborative design, but is applied in this project to the integration of information from the supply chain in the design process. Through the distributed object model, design information and product information can be integrated while the actual data objects remain at their source. This enables the supply chain to provide information of a high semantic level to designers while keeping the control over the information and maintaining the relationship of the information with their business processes. The advantages of this approach in which information is shared, rather than exchanged, are numerous. Redundancy of information is minimised, consistency is improved, and updated information is available immediately. Moreover, design and construction processes can benefit significantly from the dynamic aspects of accessing information that is tied to business processes in the supply chain. For example, product selection during design can be based on latest information on product details, prices, production methods, and variants of products. This information can be provided to designers automatically and on demand. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on information obtained through a photographic Q-sort, supplemented with a literature review, health and safety information related to the design of a facade was collected from subject matter experts. This information was used to develop infographics representing the subject matter knowledge. A facilitated workshop was then held with 20 design professionals to engage them in a hazard identification process using a case study scenario. The designers were provided with the infographics and asked to comment upon how the infographics changed their assessments of the health and safety risks inherent in the case study building design. A sub-set of participants was interviewed to explore their perceptions of the impact and usefulness of the inforgraphics. Findings - Infographics were developed at different levels of detail, representing potential health and safety issues associated with the site location and surroundings, the construction site environment and the detailed facade design. Workshop participants identified a number of potential health and safety issues associated with the case study scenario. However, this number increased substantially once they had viewed the infographic. Further, the health and safety issues identified when participants had access to the infographic were more likely to be less visible issues, relating to ergonomic hazards, procurement or the organisation and sequencing of work. The workshop participants who were interviewed described how the infographics enabled them to make a more global assessment of the health and safety implications of the case study building design because it helped them to understand the design in the physical construction site context. Participants also favoured the visual nature of the infographics and suggested that this format may be particularly useful to communicate important health and safety information to novice designers with limited on- site experience. Research limitations/implications - The infographics developed in this research were relatively simple two- dimensional representations produced and presented in hard copy format. It is possible that more sophisticated forms of infographic could have produced different results. Thus, it is important that future research develops different types of infographics and rigorously evaluates their effectiveness in developing designers' health and safety- related knowledge and improving decision making. Practical implications - The results indicate that simple infographics can help design professionals to better understand the health and safety implications of design decisions in the context of the construction site environment. In particular, the infographics appear to have increased designers' ability to recognize less visible health and safety-related issues. The designers interviewed also described the potential usefulness of the infographics in design workshops as a tool to stimulate discussion and develop a shared understanding of the health and safety aspects of a particular design decision or choice. Originality/value - The value of the research lies in the development and evaluation of infographics as a tool supports the integration of health and safety into design decision making. The potential to develop these tools into digital or web-based resources is also significant.

J	Abas, NH; Blismas, N; Lingard, H				Abas, Nor Haslinda; Blismas, Nick; Lingard, Helen			Development of risk assessment tool using damaging energy and argumentation theory for evaluating construction occupational safety and health risks	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Occupational safety and health; Construction industry; Industrialised building system; Damaging energy; Argumentation theory; Knowledge processes		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a risk assessment model to assess the occupational safety and health (OSH) risks presented by different construction approaches, namely traditional and industrialised building system (IBS). The development process applies the concept of argumentation theory, which helps construction designers integrate the management of OSH risk into the design process. In addition, an energy damage model is used as an underpinning framework for developing the model. Design/methodology/approach Development of the model was achieved through two phases. Phase I involved collection of data on the activities involved in the construction process and their associated OSH risks, derived from five different case studies, field observation and interviews. Knowledge of design aspects that have the potential to impact on OSH was obtained from document analysis. Using the knowledge obtained in phase I, a model was developed in the form of argument trees (Phase II), which represent a reasoning template with regard to options available to designers when they make judgements about aspects of their designs. Inferences from these aspects eventually determined the magnitude of the damaging energies for every activity involved. Finally, the model was validated by panels of experts, and revisions and amendments were made to the model accordingly. Findings The risk assessment model development revealed that the concept of argumentation theory and energy damage model is suitable to represent design safety risk knowledge and effectively address the designer's role in making decisions in their designs and further illuminate the level of OSH risk their designs pose. Practical implications The developed model provides best-practice reasoning support for construction designers, which help them to understand the impact of their designs decisions on worker's safety and health, and thereby assist them to further mitigate the risk to an acceptable level. Originality/value This study departs from the existing tool in that the model was developed based upon the combination of argumentation theory and energy damage model. The significance of the model is discussed.

Impact of Design Risk on the Performance of Design-Build Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design-build projects; Design risk factors; Project performance; Exploratory factor analysis; Structural equation modeling	PLS-SEM; CONSTRUCTION; SELECTION	Design risk can greatly affect the success or otherwise of design-build projects. This study presents the identification of design risk factors in design-build projects and an analysis of their impact on project performance. A total of 23 design risk factors were identified, comprising 17 factors obtained from an exhaustive literature review and 6 factors arising from in-depth interviews with 5 experienced construction practitioners. These design risk factors formed the focus of a questionnaire survey of 500 construction practitioners, which used a five-point Likert scale as the response format. This yielded 150 valid responses for data analysis. Exploratory factor analysis showed that these factors could be categorized into six groupings: risk of improper design team, risk of designer's lack of responsibility, risk of designer's lack of experience, risk of inaccuracy or delay of third-party information, risk of improper design scheme, and risk of design change and employer review. Confirmative factor analysis revealed that the risk of an improper design scheme is significantly associated with the risk of designers' lack of responsibility and experience, as well as inaccuracy and delay of third-party information, which has a significant and negative impact on project performance. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge in design-build risk analysis, and, more fundamentally, the findings enhance design-build contractors' understanding of how to achieve better project results through improved design risk management.

J	Way, M; Bordass, B				Way, M; Bordass, B			Making feedback and post-occupancy evaluation routine 2: Soft Landings - involving design and building teams in improving performance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; client satisfaction; design quality; feedback; innovation; involvement; learning; predictability; process improvement; professional services; project delivery; quality control		Once a building is physically complete, designers and builders move on to the next project. Few of them stay around to learn from what they have done and pass on their insights to the occupants. 'Soft Landings' aims to extend the scope of service so that feedback and follow-through can become natural parts of the delivery of a project. It increases designer and constructor involvement before and after handover, and points the 'supply sided to more involvement with users and a careful assessment of building performance in use. The objective is more certainty in delivering buildings that achieve a close match between the expectations of clients and users and the predictions of the design team. A Soft Landings team (designer and builder) is resident on site during the move-in period in order to deal with emerging issues more effectively. It then monitors building use and energy performance for the first three years of occupation: identifying opportunities both for fine-tuning the building and for future projects. This process also creates a coordinated route to post-occupancy evaluation. The cost of the extra work is relatively small and can be balanced against gains from the learning process, less rework and better client references. Soft Landings does not require wide-scale revision of industry-standard documentation: a licensed Scope of Service document set can stand alongside most existing procurement processes.

The assistant gathers data and provides computational support for spatial assistance system on the basis of making intelligent spatial decisions. The main idea behind the assistant is to create a semantic model of the environment and performing preliminary spatial reasoning to provide cognitive feedback. The main goal is to support the designer in his task by perceiving and evaluating spatial design intent. Simultaneously the assistant allows for on-line modeling of real structured environment. It improves the conception-modeling-evaluation-remodeling cycle. This paper also contains an empirical evaluation of the proposed methodology. The results of the experiments performed using the prototype of Mobile Spatial Assistance System (MSAS) are shown. To conclude, the article presents the new methodology behind spatial support systems, which provides designers with cognitive assistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process involves locating equipment and routing connecting elements for each building system. This multidiscipline effort is time-consuming and expensive and requires knowledge regarding each system over the project life cycle. Current practice requires representatives from each MEP trade to work together to identify and resolve interferences. Effective MEP coordination requires recalling and integrating knowledge regarding design, construction, operations, and maintenance of each MEP system. Currently, designers and constructors use tailored CAD systems to design and fabricate MEP systems, but no knowledge-based computer technology exists to assist in the multidiscipline MEP coordination effort. The paper describes results from a research project to capture knowledge related to design criteria, construction, operations, and maintenance of MEP systems and apply this knowledge in a computer toot that can assist designers and builders in resolving coordination problems for multiple MEP systems.

In the proposed environment, special attention is given to the synthesis of solutions by means of adaptation. A pragmatic combination of a number of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, considering case-based reasoning (CBR) as the framing concept, enables the implementation of a system that conveniently supports most designers' cognitive needs. The design of highway bridges was the chosen domain of discourse, for it represents an excellent example for demonstrating the potential of analogy in design. Thus, a large base of real cases is built. The induction of new knowledge is performed by extraction, association, and regression processes. Finally, a real context is used to illustrate the use of the model and to demonstrate its utility and capabilities in supporting designers' decisions, particularly on the synthesis-i.e., adaptation-of solutions.

J	delaGarza, JM; Alcantara, PT				delaGarza, JM; Alcantara, PT			Using parameter dependency network to represent design rationale	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	Building designers typically develop a set of drawings and specifications that graphically and textually depict the building. These documents contain implicit information about the rationale or reasoning leading to the final form of the design. Access to design rationale information avoids the need to speculate about or request for the implicit information stored in the design drawings and specifications. The main focus of this article is on the use of a parameter dependency network to represent design rationale. This paper details one possible data structure capable of generating a parameter dependency network. The parameter dependency network shows how one particular design decision affects other decisions that further affect other decisions. The structured nature of this network allows a computer program to act as a data verification assistant to the human designer. This article also outlines a classification scheme for design rationale systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the contributions of this research and concludes with descriptions of possible future research work.		delaGarza, JM (corresponding author), VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV,BLACKSBURG,VA 24061, USA.							28	12	12	0	0	ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398	0887-3801			J COMPUT CIVIL ENG	J.

Expanding the representation of user activities	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						medical imaging; briefing; activity representation; user activities; design process; hospitals; production of space; early design	DESIGN; ARTIFACTS; SPACE	Space is often designed based on the representations of user activities (i.e. lists, organograms or flowcharts) that streamline user activities in stepwise, oversimplified, representations that may leave insufficient room for future activity development. However, design can anticipate activity development if users are able to represent their own activities while participating in the design process. A case study of a medical imaging centre reveals that once users have such opportunity, their spatial practices are not only taken into account but also expanded. The designers, the users and the researchers created a range of instruments to expand across three units of analysis: operations, actions and activities. As a result, the representations of space proffered by the designers were expanded to a space of representation for the users, where new ways of working were realized. Based on this study, an integrated model for the production of space and the development of activity is proposed.	[van Amstel, Frederick M. C.; Zerjav, Vedran; Hartmann, Timo; Dewulf, Geert P. M.

Architects and design engineers have the opportunity to positively affect construction worker safety and health through the choices they make in the design process. Lack of designer knowledge about construction processes and limited availability of tools to assist in assessing the safety risk associated with a design are considered as inhibitors to implementation of the design for construction safety (DfCS) concept. This paper presents research conducted to quantify the construction safety risk of each of the design elements present in typical multistory buildings in the United States. The major research efforts were (1) identification of the typical building design elements and associated construction activities; (2) quantification of the unit and cumulative risks of the design elements and construction activities; and (3) development of an online design risk-assessment tool. Absolute safety risks were quantified for 141 design elements and 683 construction activities using the survey-analytical research method. The risk factors developed were incorporated into an online tool titled Safety in Design Risk Evaluator (SliDeRulE). The research contributes to the construction industry body of knowledge by providing quantitative values that link specific design features to construction safety. The website is designed to assist building designers with assessing the level of construction safety risk associated with their designs and is intended for use by designers during the design phase to create buildings that are safer to construct.

Difficulty and reasons for sustainable roadway design - the case from Taiwan	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						level of difficulty; sustainable design; roadway project; difficulty reason	CONSTRUCTION; INDICATORS; ECODESIGN; BARRIERS; EXAMPLE; GREEN	To accomplish sustainable design, it is essential to understand its barriers or limitations. This study investigated difficulties and their reasons for sustainable design using roadways as an example. A checklist of 60 sustainability items for roadway design was used to interview roadway designers to identify levels of difficulty, reasons for difficulty and proportions of difficulty reasons when designing these sustainability items. The results were analyzed and compared among sustainable items and design work. The difficulties of incorporating sustainability into designs are classified into three levels as compared with conventional design: equal, medium and high. The average difficulty for sustainable roadway design is between low and medium level; 28 of the 60 items were found to be at the same level of difficulty as conventional design. The technical items are regarded more difficult to adopt than material items. Nine reasons were identified for sustainable roadway design difficulty in which four are in the pre-design stage and five are in the design stage. The proportions of difficulty reasons in the pre-design and design stages are 63% and 37%, respectively. This implies that more difficulties will be encountered in the pre-design stage, and the designers can try to overcome or reduce difficulty in design stage. The top three reasons are natural preconditions; criteria and specifications; and owner, policy and law, which cause 33%, 20% and 14% of the difficulty, respectively. This study pointed out the difficulties and reasons for sustainable roadway design. Having a comprehensive understanding of the difficulties allows a designer to more accurately determine potential limitation, and to make better choices as to which sustainable items a particular construction project should pursue.

These organizations need to exchange information to enhance their teamwork. Understanding the information received from other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information from several sources including a building information model (BIM) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction material cost data provided by material suppliers. Currently, it is not easy to integrate the information necessary for cost estimating over the Internet. This paper discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses Semantic Web technology. Semantic Web technology provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this paper relies on BIM, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data expressed in a web ontology language. The approach presented in this paper makes the various sources of estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints or Semantic Web Services. We present an estimating application that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this paper is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have oftentimes been characterised by their limited generative capacity for top-down developmental control and for pragmatic rule-breaking as they are easily offered by human designers. This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Morphological exploration and form-finding get increasingly enriched by environmental performance feedback. This paper points out a major step forward in software interoperability and the alignment of digital design applications, allowing users to engage with morphological form-finding enriched by real-time physical building performance feedback. The key innovation presented here relates to tools available to designers who neither possess in-depth programming skills, nor need to rely on custom-developed scripts in order to advance their concepts. A recent architectural design studio serves as a testbed to interrogate the level of convergence among tools for morphological design and performance optimization. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Modelling design information to evaluate pre-fabricated and pre-cast design solutions for reducing construction waste in high rise residential buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						modeling; design management; design tools; built environment		This paper describes how modeling information flows in the design process may be used to evaluate design solutions when seeking to reduce construction waste in high rise residential buildings. A survey of practicing designers identified a number of possible ways to reduce construction waste. The most advantageous solutions were based on pre-casting and pre- fabrication. Reviewing three of these solutions using information modeling techniques shows the changes in the design process required to accommodate the different design solutions. This method presents an effective basis for reviewing the impact of design decisions on the design process. To reduce construction waste demands an understanding of the impact of decisions on the level of waste produced, a full understanding of the implications throughout the 'waste-chain', consideration of the lifecycle impact, life-cycle costs and the impact of design decisions upon the overall construction process. Additional tools and techniques are required to fully meet the needs of designers. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Baldwin, A.

A dimensionless layout: Here, users/designers can draw any layout with a rectangular or a non rectangular boundary on a GUI and GPLAN transforms it into a dimensioned floorplan while preserving the adjacencies, positions, shapes of the rooms.& nbsp; The above approaches represent different ways of inserting adjacencies and GPLAN generate dimensioned floorplans corresponding to the given adjacencies. The larger aim of this work is to provide alternative platforms to users/designers for producing dimensioned floorplans for all given (architectural) constraints, which can be further refined by architects.

When implementing BIM, however, individual firms inherently safeguard their self-interests regardless of the fact that inter-firm cooperation might reap joint BIM benefits for a project overall, which epitomizes a typical problem of moral hazards in project-based organizations. This paper develops an outcome-linked benefit sharing model that considers sharing joint BIM benefits among stakeholders including designers, contractors, and clients for tracking moral hazards therein. By modeling stakeholders' behaviors as evolutionary games within a principal agent formalism, it has been deducted that (1) designers/contractors could be incentivized to cooperate had each stakeholder received a share higher than the quotient of BIM costs over value-creation in the design/construction phase; and (2) how joint BIM benefits can be more than noncooperation outcomes is key for clients to support BIM implementation.

Although innovative designs have brought variety to the utilitarian high-rise facades clad in glass, steel and concrete, little consideration has been given to the issues of maintainability during the design/planning stage. This lack of foresight and planning has hindered the efforts of maintenance personnel and compromised the performance of such green facades. To address these concerns, an instrumental case study approach was undertaken using a series of site investigations and interviews with experts and stakeholders. The aim of this research was to strengthen the knowledge base on high-rise vertical greenery facades in the tropics, leading to the formulation of case study-based 'design for maintainability' (DfM) guidelines. These guidelines will assist clients, designers and contractors by providing a supplemental reference during the design, installation and maintenance of high-rise VGSs located in tropical regions.

KB-GA-based hybrid system for layout planning of multistory buildings	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						buildings; multistory; conceptual design; optimization; evolutionary computation; knowledge-based systems; hybrid methods	CONCEPTUAL DESIGN	Layout planning of multistory buildings requires multidisciplinary participation in the decision-making process, which is governed by intuition, creativity, and experience of the designers, and available information. Optimization techniques are rarely applied to the layout planning stage. The present study aims at a hybrid approach by combining knowledge based system and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization technique by employing them for suitable tasks, in order to take specific advantages of respective techniques, i.e., the domain dependent part is isolated and developed as a knowledge-based (KB) system, while the knowledge lean part is handled by the adaptive search techniques. The main issue to be addressed while developing an integrated system is to identify the role of individual approaches and the interactions among them.

Integrating Worker Health and Safety into Sustainable Design and Construction: Designer and Constructor Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Safety risk; Prevention through Design (PtD); Research methods; Statistical analysis; Sustainable construction		Sustainable building design and construction is gaining rapid growth within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency of building projects by incorporating efficient and effective materials, technologies, and strategies into the building process. However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Lin, JR; Zhou, YC				Lin, Jia-Rui; Zhou, Yu-Cheng			Semantic classification and hash code accelerated detection of design changes in BIM models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Change detection; Semantic classification; Hash code acceleration; Design automation; Collaboration; Smart design	MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; SYSTEM	As the design process of a building or infrastructure is complex with iterative steps and multidisciplinary collaboration, design changes are inevitable and efficient change detection based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for design collaboration and quality control. Although some detection methods have been proposed to tackle the problem, majority of them regard syntactic data changes as design changes, which always yield incorrect and meaningless results. For instance, exchanging the locations of two identical columns is meaningless from the viewpoint of a designer, which the current methods take it as a design change. Otherwise, additional time is needed to avoid these issues, thus leading to high time consumption. To address this problem, we first propose a semantic classification of design changes with three categories of data changes and three levels of design changes. Then, an efficient detection method considering the proposed semantic classification of design changes is proposed with hash-code-based acceleration. After implementing the proposed and existing methods, the detection performance of our method is compared with the performances of existing methods and invited designers based on 4 groups of BIM models. Results show that our method could: 1) detect semantic changes with 100% correctness while reducing up to 98.1% of the detection time of existing methods, and 2) improve the average detection rate of designers from 81.3% to 100% while saving 99.88% of the design reviewing time (detecting 7 changes from 5800 instances). This research contributes to the body of knowledge a new definition of design changes and an approach to efficient design change detection with hash-code-based acceleration. Meanwhile, the proposed classification of design changes and developed BIM models in this research can also be taken as a baseline for developing and validating new detection methods.

However, there is no comprehensive study that explores the important project management factors from the perspective of architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms, whose decisions can significantly affect the environmental performance of building projects. In Singapore, Green Mark, a certification for green building, has become a compulsory requirement for all new buildings. AEC firms are now facing challenges on how best to attain Green Mark certification with minimum cost and resources. The purpose of this research is to identify the controllable critical project management factors for delivering Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher Green Mark ratings. Nineteen controllable project management factors were first identified from related literature, and then a survey was carried out to collect data needed to perform the principal component factor analysis. The factor analysis revealed that the controllable project management factors could be grouped into five major components, namely, (1) human resource-oriented factors, (2) technical and innovation-oriented factors, (3) support from designers and senior management, (4) project manager's competence, and (5) coordination of designers and contractors. Finally, multiple regression analysis was applied. It was found that the coordination of designers and contractors and technical and innovation-oriented factors are the most critical success factors, and possible reasons are discussed. With the help of the research findings, project organizations in Singapore will manage their Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher rating levels in a more efficient and effective way.

J	Pocock, JB; Liu, LY; Tang, WH				Pocock, JB; Liu, LY; Tang, WH			Prediction of project performance based on degree of interaction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	This paper demonstrates a direct relationship between designer/builder interaction and project performance, based on a large database. It also presents a predictive model to forecast project performance based on the planned level of interaction. Degree of interaction (DOI) is defined as the extent of interaction among designers, builders, and project team members during all project phases. As DOI scores rise, project performance quickly improves and becomes more consistent. Regression analysis of 38 recently completed projects shows a modest but significant correlation between DOI and project performance, including user satisfaction. Beyond a certain DOI score, performance tends to level off. Achieving this score takes only a modest increase in interaction. Threshold analysis separates the projects into those with DOI scores above and below this score. Performance is significantly better for projects with higher DOI in all areas except design deficiencies. Finally, these results are combined with statistical analysis to predict the performance of future projects based on their DOI scores. The probability of improved average performance on future projects with higher DOI scores is very strong. DOI scores can be used to predict ranges for expected cost growth, schedule growth, number of modifications, design deficiencies, and user satisfaction.

J	Kim, H; Stump, A; Kim, W				Kim, Hyunjoo; Stump, Annette; Kim, Wooyoung			Analysis of an energy efficient building design through data mining approach	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Energy simulation; Data mining; Classification; Factor selection; Energy design process		Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable green design features into new/existing buildings has become a top priority in recent years for building owners, designers, contractors, and facility managers. This paper intends to address why delivery of an energy efficient building is not just the result of applying one or more isolated technologies. Rather, it can best be obtained using an integrated whole building process throughout the entire project development process, which leads building designers to generate a large amount of data during energy simulations. The authors observed that even a simple energy modeling run generated pages of data with many different variables. The volumes of energy modeling data clearly overwhelm traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with so many factors to be considered. An integrated or whole building design process involves studies of the energy-related impacts and interactions of all building components, including the building location, envelope (walls, windows, doors, and roof), heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, controls, and equipment, which shows why it is so difficult to find the correlation between different systems. The objective of this research is to develop an energy efficient building design process using data mining technology which can help project teams discover important patterns to improve the building design. This paper utilizes the data mining technology to extract interrelationships and patterns of interest from a large dataset Case study revealed that data mining based energy modeling help project teams discover useful patterns to improve the energy efficiency of building design during the design phase. The method developed during this research could be used to guide designers and engineers through the process of completing an early design energy analysis based on energy simulation models.

J	Sousa, JP; Xavier, JP				Sousa, Jose Pedro; Xavier, Joao Pedro			Symmetry-based generative design and fabrication: A teaching experiment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Architecture; Geometry; Symmetry; Computational design; Digital fabrication; Design education		Throughout history, symmetry has been widely explored as a geometric strategy to conceive architectural forms and spaces. Nonetheless, its concept has changed and expanded overtime. Nowadays, it is understood as an ordering principle resulting from the application of isometric transformations that keep the original object invariant. Departing from this notion, scientists, philosophers and designers have extended it to embrace other geometric scenarios. Following this idea, exploring symmetry does not mean the generation of simple and predictable design solutions. On the contrary, it is a creative window to achieve geometric complexity based on very simple rules. In this context, this paper aims at discussing the relevance of exploring symmetry in architectural design today by means of digital technologies. It argues that the coupled use of computational design and digital fabrication processes allows designers to explore and materialize a higher level of design complexity in a structured and controlled way, especially when non-isometric transformations are involved. As the background for testing and illustrating its arguments, this paper describes a teaching experiment conducted in the Constructive Geometry course at the FAUP, following design-to-fabrication methodologies.

Stakeholders often make these decisions without a quantitative understanding of how a particular decision will impact future choices or a project's ultimate performance. The proposed sequential decision support methodology provides stakeholders with quantitative information on the relative influence conceptual design stage decisions have on a project's life-cycle environmental impact and life-cycle cost. A case study is presented showing how the proposed methodology may be used by designers considering these performance criteria Sensitivity analysis is performed on thousands of computationally generated building alternatives. Results are presented in the form of probabilistic distributions showing the degree to which each decision helps in achieving a given performance criterion. The method provides environmental impact and cost feedback throughout the sequential building design process, thereby guiding designers in creating low-carbon, low-cost buildings at the conceptual design phase.

J	Tweed, C				Tweed, C			The social context of CAAD in practice	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7uropIA 98 International Conference - Cyber Design	NOV 25-27, 1998	PARIS, FRANCE			design practice; design research; phenomenology; architecture		The term 'application domain' crops up in many CAAD research papers and yet seldom is the domain described in any detail. In the absence of a detailed understanding of the application domain, CAAD research often substitutes a typical 'designer' or 'architect' as the end-user of developed systems. The end-user's beliefs, norms, values, history and other concrete characteristics are rarely fleshed out beyond a stereotypical, totalising view, which serves as an 'ideal-type' that offers a psychological economy, avoiding the need for us to think too deeply about individual CAAD users. But, as anyone who has taught architecture or worked in practice will be aware, despite many shared interests and attitudes among a given group of designers, there is considerable variation across individuals, not just in skills but in general disposition or 'styles' of comportment, which shape how individuals go about designing. Design research has mostly been blind to such variations. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to begin to fashion a set of questions that will enrich our knowledge and to suggest a Framework that can be used to answer them.

Intelligent navigation aids are needed if designers wish to access the information they generate with ease. We present a comprehensive approach to support information navigation in requirement-driven generative design systems, which gain their power form explicit representations of design requirements, which in turn add to the information generated by the system. Our approach takes into account studies dealing with human spatial cognition, wayfinding in physical environments, and information navigation in electronic media. We structure the information to be accessed in terms of a five-dimensional design space model that applies across generative design systems of the type considered here. The model structure supports basic generic navigation operations along its five dimensions. We validated the model in the context of the SEED-Layout system and used it to extend the built-in navigation tools of the system through novel ones, which we subjected to a limited usability study. The study suggests that these tools have promise and warrant further investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This is increasingly relevant as prefabricated facades increase in complexity and bespokedness in response to current societal, financial and environmental challenges. In this paper a process that addresses this challenge is presented. The process consists of two sub-processes 1) to build product-oriented knowledge bases and digital tools for supporting design on a project-by-project basis and 2) to help designers identify a set of optimal solutions that consider the facade-specific trade-off between architectural intent and performance requirements, while meeting the largest number of production-related constraints. This process was applied to a case study and the results were compared with those obtained from a recently-developed facade. It was found that, although the proposed process produces optimal solutions that are approximated, designers can benefit from more control over the product's manufacturability, performance and architectural intent in less time.

J	Hong, NK; Koh, HM; Hong, SG				Hong, Namhee-Kim; Koh, Hyun-Moo; Hong, Sung-Gul			Conceptual Design of Suspension Bridges: From Concept to Simulation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Conceptual design; Suspension bridge; Graphical approach; Entity-based model; Dynamic simulation	VERSION; MODEL	The structural design paradigm has evolved from an engineering-oriented approach to a holistic one that accommodates various concerns including form, function, behavior, economy, efficiency, and elegance. Because as many aspects as possible must be considered in the early design stages to reduce downstream problems afterward, the design tool for this stage has to be iterative and interactive with designers to manipulate various alternatives. In addition, the advancement of computer graphics software together with generative algorithms provide rapid dynamic simulation that enables efficient interactive design. This research has focused on rapid prototyping for the development of a computer-supported design tool that helps to perform the conceptual design of suspension bridges from the designer's concept to computer simulation during the conceptual design stage. The design information and tasks in conceptual design are formalized in terms of entities using the concept of an entity-based model, and these entities are further implemented into the generative algorithms of graphic software. Thanks to the dynamic simulation of the implemented design tool, conceptual design can be done interactively and iteratively while generating and selecting design alternatives following a graphical approach.

J	Lin, CH; Chih, YY; Tsay, YS				Lin, Chuan-Hsuan; Chih, Ying-Yi; Tsay, Yaw-Shyan			Determinants of the Adoption of Green Building Simulation Technologies in Architectural Design Practices in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green building; Simulation; Technology adoption; Architectural design	CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS ACCEPTANCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MODEL 3; EXTENSION; BIM; ANTECEDENTS; DEVICES; DRIVES	Critical decisions about whether and how to integrate sustainability measures into the life cycle activities of green buildings are made in the early architectural design phase. To this end, researchers have advocated the use of various green building simulation technologies (GBSTs) to perform sustainability analyses to support integrated architectural design processes, cross-disciplinary communications, and evidence-based decision making. However, the adoption of GBSTs in architectural design practices remains limited. Building on the technology acceptance model, this paper investigates the determinants and mechanisms that influence the adoption of GBSTs in practice. Empirical data collected from architectural designers in Taiwan through qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey show that perceived usefulness is a strong predictor of designers' intentions to adopt GBSTs. Job relevance, result demonstrability, compatibility, and competitive advantage are also important determinants of GBST adoption. Practical recommendations are offered to encourage greater adoption of GBSTs in architectural design practices. Theoretically, this research extends the technology adoption literature in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry by broadening and deepening the understanding of context-specific determinants of GBST adoption.

This architectural design task is often complex and challenging as it requires the creation of optimal architectural layouts that resemble the selected image from nature while complying with all owner specified space allocation requirements. To support architects in this challenging task, this paper presents the development of a novel methodology to support architects and designers in automating the generation of thematic architectural layout designs that are inspired by images from nature. The methodology utilizes image processing to segment the nature-inspired image and analyze the segmented image to generate regions using region and boundary extraction algorithm. The methodology also integrates two novel optimization algorithms that are designed to optimize room assignments in the generated layout to maximize compliance with designer-specified adjacency requirements and optimize room areas to maximize the functional and operational performance of the architectural layout. An application example was analyzed to illustrate the use of the developed methodology and its novel capabilities in automating the generation of optimal thematic architectural layouts that preserve the image theme while complying with room adjacency and rooms area requirements.

J	Negendahl, K				Negendahl, Kristoffer			Building performance simulation in the early design stage: An introduction to integrated dynamic models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Integrated dynamic model; Parametric; Dynamic; BIM; BPS; Building performance; Building energy; Collaboration; Early design stages	ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN; THERMAL SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; TOOLS; PART; COLLABORATION; BIM	Designing with building performance simulation feedback in the early design stage has existed since the early days of computational modeling. However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages.

Scientists are striving to develop building optimization models so that strategies are ably devised to moderate energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously. An inclusive greenhouse gas emissions valuation model is established to utilise several types of buildings envelop, which is adhered to the National Construction Building Code of Australia - energy efficiency requirement. The extracted results are exported from GaBi version 8.1 and consolidated by Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel to calculate greenhouse gas emissions amount in regard to building's energy consumption in 50 years. Accordingly, Credit 15A which is one of five pathways in the category: Green-Star's greenhouse gas emissions reduction (Green-Star is the rating tool to enhance a project's sustainability during its life-cycle) will be used to assess by selecting the wall structures following the guidance in the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand (2014) handbook.

Despite their importance to the industry, and evident differences from large organizations in business strategy, markets and challenges, the literature has little to say about how small architectural design firms view the marketing potential of improved environmental sustainability. The aim is to address this gap by examining practitioner experience of sustainability and marketing in small architectural design practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 such practices. A critical interpretive stance was adopted in analysis, drawing on the theoretical framings of service-dominant logic (SDL) and relationship marketing. Sustainable design is part of the co-creation of value in architecture, enhancing the value proposition beyond a cost basis. Its inclusion contributed to business development through referrals. Taken together, co-creation of value and asymmetry of knowledge between professional and client drive the conclusion that the architectural designer has primary responsibility in guiding clients towards greater environmental sustainability. This responsibility and the role of sustainability in business development were not necessarily recognized by the designers. Insights from SDL challenge assumptions that cost and lack of client demand prevent greater sustainability in design.

The model creates different scenarios, identifies the LEED points and costs for each scenario. The energy analysis calculations are performed by Sefaira, the quantities of materials are received from Autodesk Revit, and the cost information comes from the RSMeans Database. A macro in Excel automates the process. An office building was used as a case study to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. The minimum cost necessary to achieve any number of points in the "Optimize Energy Performance" credit were calculated, such as a minimum cost of $842,500 to obtain 16 points, and $476,684 for 5 points. The primary contributions of this research include (1) the development of a tool that allows designers to pick the most economical alternative for the desired points in the "Optimize Energy Performance" credit, and (2) the first time integrated use of an energy simulation software (Sefaira), a cost database (RSMeans), and a BIM software (Autodesk Revit).

J	Bouchlaghem, N				Bouchlaghem, N			Optimising the design of building envelopes for thermal performance	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						computer; building; thermal performance		Computer models for the simulation of the thermal performance of buildings have been in existence for many decades. Although these programs save a great deal of time and effort in computational terms they still rely on designers intuition and experience to achieve optimum solutions for a design problem. This paper presents a computer model which, not only simulates the thermal performance of the building taking into account design variables related to the building's envelope and fabric, but also applies numerical optimization techniques to automatically determine the optimum design variables, which achieve the best thermal comfort conditions. The main optimization program is supported by a graphical model for the design of window shading devices, which uses the numerical coefficients that define the window shading to model shading devices taking into account seasonal variations in solar angles and solar gains. The rationale and methodology used to develop the models is outlined and the resulting programs an described with examples of outputs. Finally, it is concluded that the models offer a valuable decision support system for designers at an early design state for the optimization of the passive thermal performance achieving optimum thermal comfort and savings in heating and cooling energy.

The work reported in this paper represents the findings of a 16 month action research project undertaken with an ETO woodwork component fabrication company with both conventional and Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining capabilities. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a way for how BIM objects could first be embedded with fabrication semantics, and then used to support the workflow between designers and fabricators, specifically where CNC machines are used. To demonstrate the idea, the methodology is outlined in the context of a developed BIM object for a base cabinet from the domain of custom cabinetry. The BIM object was validated by fabricating the actual component via a simulated workflow between design and fabrication disciplines in a real setting. The main contribution is that the research clarifies some of the ambiguity relating to BIM and CNC technologies working in tandem. The discussed results explain the benefits and challenges observed through the use of this method as well as provide avenues for further investigation.

Using a mixed-research method, this study examined the interactive effect of participants' characteristics (experience, knowledge, and roles) on sustainable building (SB) practices in conventional buildings in Vietnam-a fast-growing emerging market. Empirical data collected from qualitative (Study 1) and quantitative (Study 2) studies revealed that participants' GB-related knowledge-especially owner representatives' and designers' knowledge-positively affected the extent of SB practices. However, participants' industry experience was found to be a hindrance, which may be due to lack of motivation (e.g., weighting the benefits and extra effort required) for behavioral changes. These findings suggest the need to provide GB-related training to experienced practitioners and owner and designer representatives to enhance their knowledge and willingness to adopt SB practices. This study contributes to the sustainable construction literature by providing empirical evidence of the influence of project participants' characteristics on SB practices.

During the construction stage, shop drawings frequently have to be revised because of cognitive differences between the designers and constructors. These two groups of people view the resolution of such clashes from their own perspectives because of differences in their inherent knowledge and experience. To effectively improve the project delivery time, one option is to reduce the number of model revisions during the construction stage. This could be done by providing a BIM model as a reference. In this model, design clashes can be resolved from the perspective of the constructor before discussions in design coordination meetings to find compromises. In this work, an artificial intelligence system for such design clash resolution was developed with machine learning and heuristic optimizing techniques. In the experiment, we present a real case of a student residence, in which the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in the basement are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system.

The model is integrated with a visualization module to allow users to interact and select form instances as the design evolves. The advantages of such an evolutionary decision support design approach is that diverse instances of the state space can be investigated in relation to specific goal requirements which will enhance the possibility of discovering a variety of potential solutions. The model allows the user to explore and visualize the design evolution and its form generation in an attempt to stimulate the designer creativity that might contribute to their output. The process uses an iterative approach that allows design to be evaluated using CFD analysis automatically to maximize several thermal and ventilation criteria. Design change will then be performed, remeshed and displayed based on the evolutionary algorithms. The process allows the user to experience the morphine of the design based on its performance and continues until the designer has the opportunity to visualize the evolution of the final set of de-sign alternatives.

Self-Organization and Sense-Making in Architect-Engineer Design Teams: Leveraging Health Care's Approach to Managing Complex Adaptive Systems	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP; MANAGEMENT; SENSEMAKING; EMERGENT	Traditional management-led risk-mitigation and performance-improvement procedures tend to ignore the relationship dynamics of Architect-Engineer design teams, and instead focus on the credentials of the designers and the process for inspecting and controlling the quality of the team's output. Management may acknowledge the complex nature of the design process, but the notion of design teams as complex systems, or more precisely, complex adaptive systems (CAS), with their inherently unpredictable behaviors, is not typically considered.

Introducing the qualitative performance gap: stories about a sustainable building	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						branding; expectations; gap analysis; performance gap; post-occupancy evaluation (POE); pre-occupancy evaluation; social context; storytelling; sustainable buildings	GREEN BUILDINGS; POSTOCCUPANCY EVALUATION; COMFORT; ARCHITECTURE; PEDAGOGY; BEHAVIOR; EXPECTATIONS; OCCUPANTS; FUTURE; DESIGN	In the design and operations industries, the performance gap is a common discrepancy found between predicted building energy performance and actual energy performance. The performance gap is considered to have negative impacts for the brand of green' buildings, designers and operators. A socially based analogue is proposed here: the qualitative performance gap, defined as the perceived gap between what inhabitants expect and their actual experience of the building environment. This concept is explored at a regenerative Living Lab: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) in Vancouver, Canada. Official' and lived' stories about the building were interpreted from sources of building information and interviews. Expectations about and forgiveness of building performance were gained from pre- and post-occupancy evaluations and interviews. The solution to the qualitative performance gap is not to eliminate it, but, in line with the concept of interactive adaptivity, to use the gap to generate new stories and new consequences for human wellbeing. The qualitative performance gap is thus conceived as positively generative, of new stories of place and identity. This work recommends crafting an official story' of social aspirations, and a communication feedback loop amongst designers, operators and building inhabitants, transparently sharing successes and failures.

Over half of respondents in four LEED-certified high-rise residential buildings in Toronto, Canada, were found not to use their heat recovery ventilators (HRV). Questionnaire scores, comments and interview results found the following reasons: acoustic dissatisfaction, difficulty with the accessibility of filters, inhabitant knowledge and preferences, and lack of engagement with training materials. A disconnect also exists between the expectations of designers and the thinking and behaviours of inhabitants. The implications of inhabitants' ventilation behaviours were also explored though metered energy data as well as noise and indoor air quality (IAQ) measurements within their dwellings. Results suggest that abandoning mechanical ventilation in favour of passive ventilation can actually lead to greater satisfaction with IAQ and to decreased energy consumption. It is recommended that designers employ resilient design strategies that allow for varied preferences (e.g., for passive ventilation) to be exercised by inhabitants without undermining suite- or building-level performance. The study also highlights the importance of using post-occupancy evaluation methodology to understand how inhabitants interact with (new) technology in order to optimize performance and satisfaction in high-rise residential buildings.

Design buffers involve building slack into a proven systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle. While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus buffers tradeoff.

To investigate the current and ideal cultures, data were gathered among the key stakeholders by means of a survey study with 72 respondents divided over 12 companies. The respondents rated the current and desired cultures by using the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument, which belongs to the Competing Values Framework. The investigations show many similarities and differences between the stakeholder perspectives of the current and the idealized partnering project cultures. Mainly, the General Contractors desire more cooperative behaviors than the (Sub-)Contractors, and the Investors desire more pronounced flexibility than the General Contractors. All stakeholders desire a cultural change from highly competitive behaviors toward more cooperation. Changes in terms of clear procedures or more flexibility are only desired by the Designers. Defining both the current and an ideal partnering project culture enables academics and project managers to compare their actual project cultures to an ideal situation. With such an approach, academics and project managers could measure whether new tools or changes in resources affect their project cultures toward a partnering project culture.

Within the current resilience imperative', co-production processes involving multiple stakeholders can be a key factor for increasing cities' resilience. Co-produced resilience processes are more successful when embedded in collaborative forms of governance such as those associated with urban commons and when fulfilling needed roles with a community. Through the application of the R-Urban approach in a neighbourhood of Colombes (near Paris), the co-production of a commons-based resilience strategy is described. This involved a group of designers as initiators and a number of citizen as stakeholders of a network of civic hubs. The specific strategies involving a participatory setting, collective governance aspects and circular economies are analysed in the light of co-production theories and practices. Internal and external challenges are identified within the implementation process. The nature of conflicts and negotiations in this co-production approach are discussed, and the role of the architects/designers as agents within the process is investigated. Reflections from this example are provided on the limits and promises of this approach and the lessons learned from R-Urban for collaborative civic resilience.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a structured approach to advancing adaptability in hospital retrofits, proposing the preferable timing and scope of different adaptability strategies. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was chosen, with 28 semi-structured interviews designers, project managers, clients and healthcare professionals as the primary research data. Findings This paper presents a model for planning for the future in hospital retrofits. The model includes 11 different adaptability strategies, categorized based on the level of adaptability. Furthermore, each strategy is linked to an open building system level, indicating the appropriate timing. Based on the findings, generality strategies in the tertiary building system level are the most effective forms of adaptability, as they are easy to implement and answer to non-specific changes in hospital operations. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to existing knowledge on adaptability in buildings, and provide practical guidance particularly for designers. A new type of service offering, an adaptability roadmap detailing the scope and timing of adaptability, is suggested. Originality/value The paper contributes to the existing research by detailing different approaches and knowledge related to adaptability and its strategies in hospital retrofits. More specifically, the three-fold categorization of adaptability is linked to both timing and intrusiveness in a novel way.

Referring to existing safety regulations, documents, and best practices, construction safety risks and their pre-control measures as well as the relationships among them were identified and then stored in a PtD knowledge base. Based on the algorithm for extracting and judging specific data information in Revit, an automated rule-based inspection plug-in combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) and PtD knowledge base was developed. The developed plug-in sent the feedback to designers through pop-up alert windows containing construction risk identification numbers (IDs) and the corresponding pre-control measure IDs in the Revit model. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach were also verified by professionals. This research realized accident PtD by integrating the BIM and PtD knowledge base; this approach can help to automatically assess safety risks during the design phase. Therefore, this approach can also increase the willingness and capacity of designers to implement PtD and improve safety performance of the construction industry.

Saeid Hosseini; Guest, Geoffrey			BIM-based approach to conduct Life Cycle Cost Analysis of resilient buildings at the conceptual stage	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA); Building Information Modeling (BIM); Conceptual design; Resilient buildings; Failure cost		All costs within the life cycle of a building are known as its life cycle cost (LCC). In the design process of a building, the use of a lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and validated on two design options. The application of the actual building project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second alternative by 4.6%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by 35.4%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4% within the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin, designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in its life cycle according to the proposed indices.

J	Fredrickson, K				Fredrickson, K			Design guidelines for design-build projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The design-build delivery process is affecting the way design is being provided for civil infrastructure projects. Established approaches and policies regarding design are based on the traditional design-bid-build process and need to be reviewed for those projects being delivered in a nontraditional manner. This paper reviews these impacts and suggests guidelines for determining the appropriate amount of design needed at the bidding, pricing, and construction stages of a design-build project. The paper also addresses concerns that designers may have regarding how the design effort may change using this delivery process as well as concerns about professional responsibility.

J	Yates, JK; Battersby, LC				Yates, JK; Battersby, LC			Master builder project delivery system and designer construction knowledge	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; project management; delivery; information management history; knowledge-based systems		The master builder system for designing and building construction projects was the dominant project delivery system in the construction industry during the early part of the 20th century. Master builders were generally charged with both design and construction services for a project. During the last half of the 20th century, many different systems for project delivery with fragmented responsibilities have replaced the master builder system. Reducing the use of the master builder system has led to the creation of elaborate systems for managing projects in the construction industry. In order to investigate the use of the master builder delivery system and other systems, a research project was conducted that included reviewing (1) the history of the construction industry, (2) project delivery systems, (3) constructability issues, (4) construction industry fragmentation, (5) the results of a survey of architecture, engineering, and construction professionals from the San Francisco Bay Area in California on the current processes they use for training engineers and architects, (6) an analysis of the survey results, (7) construction industry recommendations, and (8) conclusions based on the survey results and analysis. The information obtained from the research project, including the survey and an analysis of the results, is included in this document. The results of the research indicate that reduction in the use of the master builder project delivery system and the rise of numerous fragmented delivery systems have limited the designer's knowledge of construction processes.

A.; Olbina, Svetlana; Hinze, Jimmie			Use of Building Information Modeling in Design to Prevent Construction Worker Falls	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information model (BIM); Computable rule; Construction safety; Model checking software; Prevention through design	SAFETY	The construction industry has incurred the most fatalities of any United States industry in the private sector in recent years. Whereas many factors may contribute to this statistic, one likely cause is due to designers who often lack design for construction safety knowledge, which results in many safety hazards being built into project designs. Therefore, there is a compelling need for tools that can put the safety-in-design concept into practice. To improve the current situation, a prevention through design (PTD) tool based on computer software was developed. Construction safety best practices were compiled into computable rules so that the PTD tool can automatically conduct compliance checking. Particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents since falls are the most frequently occurring cause of fatalities on construction sites. This tool efficiently makes PTD suggestions available to designers and constructors. With this PTD tool, it is possible for project participants to work together to optimize building designs for construction worker safety, which provides valuable downstream benefits. By using the results of the safety check by this PTD tool, constructors have the opportunity to plan for preliminary safety measures to address construction site hazards from the beginning of the project. Preplanning facilitates reduction of potential hazards on construction sites by allowing for consideration of construction worker safety during the design and preconstruction phases of a project.

J	Gui, N; He, K; Qiu, ZF; Gui, WH; Geert, D				Gui Ning; He Kan; Qiu Zhifeng; Gui Weihua; Geert, Deconinck			e-BIM: a BIM-centric design and analysis software for Building Integrated Photovoltaics	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV); Building Information Model (BIM); Shadow and radiation analysis; Data synchronization	PV ARRAYS; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; OUTPUT; MODEL	Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has gained large popularity in recent years. However, its effective design remains challenging. Different but often related design concerns regarding BIPV are normally treated, in the current practice, in multiple but separated design phases with different models and tools. The complexities in maintaining the consistency between those models employed in separated phases make seamless PV and building integration, one of the major concerns of BIPV design, far from satisfying. To this end, this paper proposes a uniform BIPV design platform: e-BIM, which is a BIM (Building Information Modelling) - centric BIPV design and analysis software platform, to address the related design concerns via one uniform data model. The concept of domain-specific models is introduced to allow the external PV-related models to be integrated into the uniform model. To simplify model synchronization problem, the domain-specific views corresponding to specific domains are provided to designers and meanwhile a synchronization engine is developed to automate data consistency among views and the uniform model. The current prototype is developed based on Autodesk Revit and tested in a practical BIPV application. The results show that this platform achieves seamless BIPV design for architects, PV system designers and electricity professionals. Moreover, compared to the initial BIPV design, the photovoltaic system cost is reduced by 11.7% and the transmission losses by 2.95%.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric design have proven to be an effective technology for integrating design and construction while maintaining low cost and producing more benefits to owners, designers, and builders. However, architects, engineers, and designers may lack the time and resources needed to generate accurate BIM models or to be able to use the model information to benefit the construction process. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the automation of shop drawings for the wood-framing design of residential facilities based on a parametric model that is incorporated into a 3D-CAD model. The proposed methodology is tested in a number of virtual scenarios within the CAD environment, and is implemented as a computer program referred to in this paper as FRAMEX, a tool developed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as an add-on to AutoCAD. FRAIVIEX adopts the guidelines at the foundation of BIM technology to generate shop drawings in which the information is consistent at every level of detail, from the studs to the panels to the home where all the panels are joined to form a single entity. It also reduces the time required for drafting design by automating the process based on 3D-CAD and parametric modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We contribute to the discussion by analysing the Center for Properties and Facilities of the University of Helsinki. We ask (1) what kind of information tools for facility management the maintenance personnel use; (2) how the design data was handed over in the University's central library project; and (3) how designers and facility managers find the possibilities of integrating BIM models and maintenance information systems. In the library project, the data was handed over and archived for potential later use. The information for the maintenance manual, however, was collected separately by an outside consultant. The designers thought that models should be simplified to meet the needs of the maintenance. The representatives of the Center did not see that uses of BIM models would provide a significant added value in relation to the potential provided by the maintenance information systems already in use. They found as a possible next step the transfer of some information from BIM models to their facility management and maintenance systems. A partial, stepwise integration of the systems seems to be a realistic way forward.

J	van Eldik, MA; Vahdatikhaki, F; dos Santos, JMO; Visser, M; Doree, A				van Eldik, Maarten Albert; Vahdatikhaki, Faridaddin; dos Santos, Joao Miguel Oliveira; Visser, Maarten; Doree, Andre			BIM-based environmental impact assessment for infrastructure design projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						LCA; BIM; Environmental impact assessment; Workflow; Infrastructure; Bridges	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; LCA; CONSTRUCTION; INTEGRATION	Sustainability is becoming a key factor in the decision-making process of infrastructure projects throughout their lifecycles. In particular, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the design phase is becoming a matter of significant importance, for both public and private sectors, given the long-term impacts of design decisions on the environmental performance of infrastructure projects. Traditionally, EIA is performed by a sustainability expert at the end of the design cycle, by which time the modification of design is both costly and time-consuming. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is leveraged to better integrate EIA with the design practices. However, there are several limitations with how this integration is approached: (1) EIA is normally performed by software other than the one used for the design. This renders the continuous EIA based on incomplete BIM models difficult; (2) there is a lack of explicit data structure for the integration of EIA and BIM data. This limits the interoperability and flexibility of the EIA tools in terms of accommodating to different EIA databases; (3) in the majority of the cases the integration of EIA and BIM is not bidirectional, which results in the incapacity of the designers to immediately visualize the results of EIA in the design platform and to track the progress of the design in terms of EIA; and (4) the BIM-based EIA has rarely been implemented in an infrastructure project. Therefore, this research aims to develop a continuous BIM-based EIA for infrastructure projects that utilizes an explicit data structure to (1) systematically integrate data from various sources, and (2) enable bidirectional data exchange between BIM and EIA. The framework allows designers to run an automated EIA at any point in the design stage and immediately assess the Environmental Impact Score (EIS) of their design choices. A prototype is developed and tested on a case study to indicate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The framework is assessed in terms of functionality, ease of use, scalability, and contribution to raising sustainability consciousness through a workshop with experts. It is shown that the framework is able to quickly provide designers with accurate information about the potential environmental impact of all objects in infrastructure design projects. The workshop with experts showed that the tool clearly makes it easier to perform EIA compared to the existing, highly fragmented, process. This allows the design team to use this assessment on the same level as other design parameters in the decision-making process.

J	Zolfagharian, S; Irizarry, J				Zolfagharian, Samaneh; Irizarry, Javier			Constructability Assessment Model for Commercial Building Designs in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Constructability; Design; Quantitative; Commercial building projects; Project planning and design	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS	At the early design stage of construction projects, designers often rely on rules of thumb to make critical decisions about the geometry, construction systems, and materials of their designs without evaluating construction requirements and constraints. The ease of building, or constructability, is a critical factor that should be examined at the early stage of construction projects when the design is the most amenable to change. The motivation for this study is the current demand for skilled workers and the lack of a quantitative constructability model for commercial construction projects in the United States. To meet these needs, this paper investigates constructability factors and their relative importance in the selection of the most constructible building systems using a multicriteria technique, the analytic hierarchy process. Through a comprehensive literature review, 79 constructability attributes are identified, and based on 298 responses received from a questionnaire survey, the attributes are categorized into six factors. Then using pairwise comparisons between constructability factors and common building systems in the United States, knowledge from construction experts is obtained and a constructability assessment model is developed. The main contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is to develop constructability indexes for building components and their construction systems and to formulate a model for measuring the constructability of commercial building designs. Using the proposed constructability assessment model, designers can identify the trade-offs between the constructability of their design alternatives and make informed decisions.

A simulation model for studying the implementation of performance-based fire safety design in buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						performance-based fire safety design; system dynamics; building control	SYSTEM DYNAMICS	A large volume of huge and complex buildings are being constructed in many cities especially in the Far East, Asia, The conventional regulatory control of building design on the basis of prescriptive building and fire safety codes and regulations may not facilitate the building designers to compile an innovative design. In particular, fire safety codes and regulations are noted to be rigid and have significant influence on the design of building layout and structures. The introduction of a performance-based approach, in which buildings are designed to meet the performance requirements rather than strictly complying with the prescribed rules, recently provides the opportunity for building designers to generate unique and daring solutions. To examine the effect of introducing such performance approach in the regulatory system, a conceptual system dynamic model has been established, with reference to the Hong Kong building control system, to explore the behavior and changes of the system. The model is conceptualized around the technical and mental factors that impact on the decisions of building control officials and various issues. To build the system dynamics model, a causal diagram showing the interrelationships of the system components is first established It can assist the. identification of attributes that affect the implementation and the performance of building design control policy. On the basis of the causal diagram, a simulation model is formulated. Some issues that may affect the implementation of performance-based fire safety design can be examined and discussed.

J	Hur, SH; Kim, D; Park, GT				Hur, Sung-Hoe; Kim, Dongwon; Park, Gwi-Tae			Building automation system via LonWorks and Linux based personal computer	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						web based building automation system; LonWorks; personal computer		Until now, control networks including various kinds of controlled devices have become widespread worldwide in the development of building automation. Control networks have their own network protocols, and because of the inconsistency of IP network protocols, extra equipment is required to integrate these two types of protocols, and to cope with the control and management of building automation systems over the internet. However, because these integration solutions are very costly due to inflexible hardware implementation and are strongly depend on their manufacturers, system designers have difficulty implementing these solutions to their various specific applications. In this paper, an advanced distributed control scheme that connects the control networks to IP networks based on LonWorks technology is presented. The proposed scheme is implemented by using a simple programmable Basic Lon Node (BLN) and compatible personal computer as an internet server. BLN is an electric board that was developed in this research and physically contains a transceiver, Neuron chip, and some memory devices. To perform various functions as an internet server, the PC uses a control software of Lon on Internet System (LOIS), where C-language was used to write the LOIS web server for the GNU/LINUX environment. With our scheme, system designers can easily implement their various specific applications only with the down load of the control program via a PC serial port (RS-232). This scheme can provide an advanced, lower cost, worldwide, distributed control system, as well as freedom and flexibility for comprehensive developments. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this research, EvacuSafe is developed as a tool for designers to allow for layout optimization of buildings and facilities in terms of their evacuation safety performance. Contributions of this research include the development and validation of two spatiotemporal risk indices to quantify the safety of the egress routes and individual building compartments. Other unique advantages of EvacuSafe include the seamless integration of fire dynamics simulation, agent-based crowd simulation and building information models (BIM) using IFC data structures, allowing EvacuSafe to be readily used by designers to analyze a building layout design under various fire scenarios and for layout design optimization based on multiple safety criteria. The development of the framework, the risk indices, and the IFC-based integration is illustrated and validated through a case study on a two-story office building with 59 compartments. The results of the implementation show that the EvacuSafe is a valuable tool for evacuation design and planning that provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the evacuation performance in comparison to the existing indices and safety measures in the industry.

Influence of Buildability Factors on Rebar Installation Labor Productivity of Columns	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Buildability; Labor productivity; Efficiency; Reinforced concrete columns; Characteristic rebar diameter; Rebar installation; Rationalization; Standardization	CONSTRUCTABILITY	Buildability is one of the most important factors influencing labor productivity. A thorough investigation of the literature, however, revealed a dearth of research into its effects on the labor productivity of an integral trade of the in situ reinforced concrete material; namely, rebar installation, especially at the activity levels. Because reinforced concrete columns are among the major encountered activities on construction sites, the objective of this research is to explore primary buildability factors influencing their rebar installation labor productivity. To achieve this objective, a sufficiently large volume of productivity data was collected and analyzed by using multiple and categorical-interaction-regression methods. As a result, the effects of the variability of column sizes, rebar diameter size, reinforcement quantity, and column geometry, are determined and quantified. Although the extent of the size variability and circular geometry show significant negative impacts on the labor efficiency of the operation, the rebar diameter size and quantity of reinforcement installed exhibit positive effects. The results obtained may be used to provide designers and construction managers with feedback on how well the design of this activity considers the requirements of buildability, and the consequences of designers' decisions on the productivity of the installation operation. Moreover, a set of practical recommendations is presented, which upon implementation can improve the design buildability level of the activity explored and, thus, translate into higher labor productivity and more efficient planning and utilization of operatives.

Many joints are not used because they are not adapted or are inconvenient for modern manufacturing and construction technologies. Nonetheless, this construction heritage can be harnessed and adjusted for contemporary use. Significant cultural and social differences in timber jointing and construction technologies are reviewed. The Geometric Breakdown Method is developed to analyse the geometry of timber joints for structural, carpentry and construction considerations. Using this method, traditional and modern joints can be understood better and designers can use accumulated construction knowledge to create new joint designs in a systemic manner.

J	Pan, Y; Zhang, LM				Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao			BIM log mining: Exploring design productivity characteristics	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Log data mining; Efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (EFKCN)	FUZZY C-MEANS; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; MAPS	A clustering-based building information modeling (BIM) log mining method is developed in this research to provide a data-driven knowledge discovery about the design productivity characteristics from a huge amount of BIM design log data. Since design behaviors are non-deterministic and subjective, a novel clustering algorithm named efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (EFKCN) is utilized to produce informative clusters of different features. First, datasets are pulled out from the raw design logs and transformed into understandable forms for computers. Then, EFKCN clustering algorithm is performed in datasets at both individual and team level. Finally, analysis and prediction methods, like time analysis, regression and others, will further investigate the extracted clusters, which help managers to figure out the design preference and productivity of different designers. A case study is conducted in the real BIM design logs from an international architecture design firm with 853,520 records to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From a view of individuals, the personal design behaviors hidden in different clusters are served to arrange proper design work rationally during particular time periods. From a team perspective, the design productivity of different designers can be approximately evaluated as high, medium, and low levels in an objective and efficient manner. In the comparison of EFKCN with other popular clustering methods, EFKCN takes less time and iterations to complete the clustering process, and its clustering results achieve great compactness and separation according to the value of cluster validity indices (CVIs). Hence, this research contributes to performing the novel clustering-based BIM log mining, which acts as a powerful decision-making tool in evaluating design productivity and drawing up personalized work arrangements for a more efficient modeling process.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate various factors (time, cost, technical know-how, organizational, sustainability, etc.) and their influence on the choice of the construction method. The paper examines the different assessments of designers, manufacturers, and contractors regarding precast construction in comparison to traditional in-situ methods, and highlights the major differences in their views. Design/methodology/approach - Structured face-to-face surveys were conducted with top management personnel of precast manufacturers, architectural and engineering firms, and contracting companies in Lebanon. In addition, a case study from the largest precast project in Lebanon was used to provide a deeper understanding of factors encouraging the use of precast concrete, and to highlight major onsite issues associated with its implementation. Findings - On the one hand, the findings highlight technical, logistical, organizational, and cultural factors that inhibit the use of precast concrete as a construction method. On the other hand, results reveal that cost, time, sustainability, and flexibility factors are the main enablers for increasing the uptake of modular concrete construction. Originality/value - The main contribution to knowledge is that this study presents different stakeholders' perspectives on precast concrete construction. Moreover, this is the first research addressing precast concrete construction in the Middle East and Lebanon. The results of the study provide valuable global insights and recommendations that may help increase the uptake of precast concrete construction. They can also guide project stakeholders to properly match project characteristics and precast concrete as a construction method.

This paper addresses the question and presents theoretical rationales for both affirmative and negative answers. Clarifications for the terms 'environmentally preferable' and 'cost' are offered in order to explore the question more thoroughly, introducing the ideas of lifecycle costs and societal costs in addition to initial capital cost. The implicit basis for comparison is dissected, revealing implications both for conventional and green products. It is shown that the cost of green materials need not dictate the cost of green buildings, and that knowledgeable designers can utilize green materials, including some that ostensibly cost more, without increasing overall project costs.

Increasingly complex and sophisticated digital representations of architecture are becoming more commonplace. But in some ways the computer has increased the distance, between the designer and the representation of the problem or idea. This paper reflects on the role of CAAD as an interactive counterpart in the design process; taking in some historic parallels and promising contemporary techniques. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cao, DP; Li, H; Wang, GB; Luo, XC; Tan, D				Cao, Dongping; Li, Heng; Wang, Guangbin; Luo, Xiaochun; Tan, Dan			Relationship Network Structure and Organizational Competitiveness: Evidence from BIM Implementation Practices in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Organizational competitiveness; Project-based organizations; Social network analysis; Chinese construction industry; Building information modeling (BIM)	COLLABORATION NETWORKS; PROJECTS; FIRMS; INFORMATION; MODELS; CENTRALITY; INNOVATION; CREATION; HOLES	Using the structural social capital perspective and a longitudinal data set on building information modeling (BIM) implementation practices in the construction industry in Shanghai, China, from 2007 to 2015, this study explores how the structural characteristics of the project-based interfirm collaboration networks within which design and construction organizations are embedded relate to their long-term organizational competitiveness. Hierarchical regression results provide evidence that after controlling for related organizational characteristics (including organizational experience in participating in large and influential projects, organizational ownership type, organization age, and organization size), degree and eigenvector centrality in relationship networks in an earlier period as a group significantly predicts organizational success in winning new project contracts in a later period. The results also provide evidence that due to their differences in BIM capability and innovation reputation, the competitiveness of designers and general contractors relate differently to the structure of their project-based interfirm relationship networks, with the competitiveness of designers more associated with the quantity of collaborative ties, whereas the competitiveness of general contractors relates more to the collaborative ties with high-status partners. As an exploratory effort at using longitudinal data to investigate the associations between interfirm relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness in the construction industry, this study contributes to the construction literature not only by validating the value of project-based interfirm relationships in generating social capital and thus relating to organizational competitiveness, but also by providing evidence for how the specific association between project-based relationship network structure and organizational competitiveness is contingent on the attributes of the network actors.

J	Franz, B; Leicht, R; Molenaar, K; Messner, J				Franz, Bryan; Leicht, Robert; Molenaar, Keith; Messner, John			Impact of Team Integration and Group Cohesion on Project Delivery Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contracting; Integrated project delivery (IPD); Structural equation modeling (SEM); Collaboration	CONSTRUCTION; COHESIVENESS; DESIGN	The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is often criticized for its fragmented approach to project delivery. Traditional procurement and contracting intentionally serves to isolate designers from contractors to provide checks and balances, but limits opportunities for collaboration. This research presents a structural modeling approach to studying the role of integration in the performance of building construction projects. A sample data set of 204 completed projects was collected to compare cost, schedule, and quality performance under different delivery methods. Integration of project teams was proposed and tested in the form of two latent constructs-team integration and group cohesion-that mediate the link between delivery methods and performance. More integrated teams interacted with more participants from all levels of the building construction process, from designers to specialty trade contractors. These interactions included design charrettes, joint goal setting, and multidisciplinary building information modeling (BIM) uses. The selected project delivery method had a significant effect on team integration. Delivery methods that involved the builder and specialty trade contractors before schematic design achieved higher levels of integration and were more equipped to control project schedule growth. Cohesive teams were characterized by better chemistry, goal commitment, and timeliness of communication. Project delivery methods that included cost transparency with open-book contracts and qualification-based selection of the builder resulted in more cohesive teams and a lower average project cost growth. Additionally, the owner's perception of their turnover experience and building system quality was rated higher for cohesive teams. Understanding how delivery decisions influence the integration and development of their project teams will make building owners more aware of how those decisions ultimately affect the project's performance.

J	Lin, YL; Yang, W				Lin, Yaolin; Yang, Wei			Tri-optimization of building shape and envelope properties using Taguchi and constraint limit method	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building shape; Optimization; Taguchi and constraint limit method; Energy consumption; Thermal comfort; Visual comfort		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a tri-optimization approach to optimize design solutions regarding the building shape and envelope properties considering their implications on thermal comfort, visual comfort and building energy consumption (EN). The optimization approach has been applied to obtain the optimal design solutions in five typical cities across all climatic regions of China. Design/methodology/approach The method comprises a tri-optimization process with nine main steps to optimize the three objectives (thermal comfort, visual comfort and building EN). The design variables considered are four types of building shape (pyramid, rectangular, cylindrical and dome shape) and different envelope properties (insulation thickness [INS] of external walls/roof, window type [WT] and window-to-envelop surface area ratio [WESR]). The optimization is performed by using the Taguchi and constraint limit method. Findings The results show that the optimal design solutions for all climatic regions favor cylindrical shape and triple-layer low-E glazing window. The highest insulation level of 150 mm is preferred in three climatic regions, and the INS of 90 mm is preferred in the other two climate regions. In total, 10% WESR is preferred in all climatic regions, except the mild region. When the constraint limit of lighting intensity requirement by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is applied, the rectangular shape building is the optimal solution for those with 10% WESR. Research limitations/implications The method proposed in the paper is innovative in that it optimizes three different objectives simultaneously in building design with better accuracy and calculation speed. Practical implications Building designers can easily follow the proposed design guide in their practice which effectively bridges the gap between theory and practice. The optimal design solutions can provide a more comfortable living environment and yet less EN, which can help achieve the sustainability requirement of green buildings. Social implications The solutions presented in the paper can serve as a useful guide for practical building designers which creates economic and commercial impact. In addition, the theory and practical examples of the study can be used by building regulators to improve the energy-efficient building design standard in China. Originality/value The research is the first attempt that adopts tri-optimization approach to generate the optimal solutions for building shape and envelope design. The tri-optimization approach can be used by building designers to generate satisfactory design solutions from the architectural viewpoint and meanwhile to find combinations of the building shape and envelope properties that lead to design solutions with optimal building performance.

Walkability evaluation of building circulation based on user preference	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building circulation; Walkability evaluation; User preference; Group decision-making	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; CONSENSUS MODEL; INEQUALITIES; BEHAVIOR; WALKING; TIME	Purpose Building circulation has an important impact on human comfort of buildings and is one of the critical factors in building design. A quantitative walkability evaluation of building circulation can benefit both building design and operation. However, indoor walkability of building circulation is determined not only by objective path features but also by subjective user preference. How to incorporate the preference from a large group of users into the design process is still a challenging issue. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a participatory framework of indoor path walkability evaluation based on user preference. Hierarchical indicators are developed to objectively measure indoor path features. Furthermore, group decision-making theory is adopted to aggregate individual user preference into user common preference for determining the relative indicator weights. Finally, integrated walkability scores (IWSs) are calculated to evaluate indoor path walkability quantitatively. Findings A total of three case scenarios demonstrate that the proposed evaluation framework provides an efficient way for designers and owners to measure user preference quantitatively, analyze building circulations based on user preference and compare the walkability of different building design schemes. Practical implications The developed methods provide an efficient way for designers and owners to measure user preference quantitatively, analyze building circulations based on user preference and compare the walkability of different building design schemes. Originality/value This study develops a comprehensive and quantitative walkability evaluation approach that considers both objective path features and subjective user preference derived from user characteristics and walking purposes, which provides an effective way to incorporate user feedback into the building design process and operation.

Competency-based measures for designing out construction waste: task and contextual attributes	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Competency; Design management; Construction waste; Protocol analysis; Task-contextual model	PROJECT MANAGERS; IMPEDIMENTS; INDUSTRY; REDUCTION; VIEW; TOOL	Purpose - Competency-based measure is increasingly evident as an effective approach to tailoring training and development for organisational change and development. With design stage widely reckoned as being decisive for construction waste minimisation, the purpose of this paper is to identify designers' competencies for designing out waste. Design/methodology/approach - Due to paucity of research into competency for construction waste mitigation, this study corroborates verbal protocol analyses (VPA) with phenomenological research. Findings - Combining findings from the two methodological approaches, competencies for designing out waste are grouped into five categories, three of which are largely task related and two being contextual competencies. The study suggests that design task proficiency, low waste design skills and construction-related knowledge are indispensable task competencies, while behavioural competence and inter-professional collaborative abilities are requisite contextual competencies for designing out waste. In concurrence with task-contextual theory of job performance, personality variables and cognitive abilities are found to influence one another. This suggests that both task and contextual competencies are not only important, they are less mutually exclusive with respect to designing out waste. Practical implications - This study implies that apart from commitment and dedication of designers to waste minimisation, design and firm practices are expected to be adapted to the industry's standard. Originality/value - Basis for training needs of design professionals as well as redeployment criterion are further elaborated in the paper. By enhancing competencies identified in this study, construction waste would not only be significantly designed out, adequate cost saving could be made as a result of waste reduction.

J	Kim, SH				Kim, Sean Hay			Automating building energy system modeling and analysis: An approach based on SysML and model transformations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Systems engineering; SysML; Model transformation; System analysis; Automation; Knowledge	SIMULATION; DESIGN; DECOMPOSITION; METHODOLOGY; STORAGE	A methodology to automate building energy model generation and system analysis is proposed. The contribution of this methodology is to extend the formal model transformation framework toward building energy system modeling, thus enabling efficient and flexible system synthesis through model decomposition and recomposition. It builds on SysML metamodeling and Triple Grammar Graph based model transformation that takes in the descriptive architecture model and outputs the corresponding TRNSYS model in a standardized fashion, thus greatly reducing the potential of heuristic modeling uncertainty. The automation is also extended to the analysis of the synthesized system; thereby human intervention becomes minimized, which expedites decision-makings at various steps of the model-based design exploration. The automation is applied to a special design problem of Model-based Predictive Controls that may contain the heuristic modeling uncertainty in case of custom modeling, and that also requires very frequent system analyses during development. Illustrative examples demonstrate modeling reliability, as well as enhanced modeling and analysis productivity, compared to the manual process. The enhanced productivity even allows extra explorations. If a designer were to create a TRNSYS model by hand, it would most likely be economically feasible to carry out only a few types and rounds of analyses for only a few system configurations at best. With the automated TRNSYS model generation and system analysis, designers can efficiently perform a much larger number of detailed analyses, which would result in an improved exploration of both the design space and the selected alternatives.

J	Arvin, SA; House, DH				Arvin, SA; House, DH			Modeling architectural design objectives in physically based space planning	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Media and Design Process	1999	SALT LAKE CITY, UT			physically based space planning; physically based design; responsive design; space layout planning; human-computer interaction		Physically based space planning is a means for automating the conceptual design process by applying the physics of motion to space plan elements. This methodology provides for a responsive design process, which allows a designer to easily make decisions whose consequences immediately propagate throughout the design. It combines the speed of automated design methods with the flexibility of manual design methods, while adding a highly interactive quality and a sense of collaboration with the design itself. In our approach, the designer creates a space plan by specifying and modifying graphic design objectives rather than by directly manipulating primitive geometry. The plan adapts to the changing state of objectives by applying the physics of motion to its elements. For design objectives to affect a physically based space plan, they need to apply appropriate forces to space plan elements. Space planning can be separated into two problems, determining topological properties and determining geometric properties. Design objectives can then be categorized as topological or geometric objectives. Topological objectives influence the location of individual spaces, affecting how one space relates to another. Geometric objectives influence the size and shape of space boundaries, affecting the dimensions of individual walls. This paper focuses on how to model a variety of design objectives for use in a physically based space planning system. We describe how topological objectives, such as adjacency and orientation can be modeled to apply forces to space locations, and how geometric objectives, such as area, proportion, and alignment, can be modeled to apply forces to boundary edges.

J	Dewlaney, KS; Hallowell, MR; Fortunato, BR				Dewlaney, Katherine S.; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Fortunato, Bernard R., III			Safety Risk Quantification for High Performance Sustainable Building Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Sustainability; LEED; Risk	INJURY	A recent study found that Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings have a recordable injury rate that is 9% higher than traditional, non-LEED buildings. A follow-up study showed that there are distinct aspects of the design elements and means and methods of construction used to achieve LEED certification that have negative impacts on worker safety. The research described in this paper builds on previous knowledge by quantifying the percent increase in base-level safety risk resulting from the design strategies and construction methods implemented to earn specific LEED credits. A total of 26 interviews and 11 validation interviews were conducted with designers and contractors who had completed an average of four LEED projects, 100 traditional projects, in their average of 18 years of experience in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The results indicate that design elements and means and methods of construction implemented to achieve 12 of the 49 LEED credits increase the frequency of injuries or exposure to known, high risk environments. The most significant impacts are a 36% increase in lacerations, strains, and sprains from recycling construction materials; a 24% increase in falls to lower level during roof work because of the installation of on-site renewable energy (e.g., PV panels); a 19% increase in eye strain when installing reflective roof membranes; and a 14% increase in exposure to harmful substances when installing innovative wastewater technologies. These results can be used to understand the safety impacts of sustainable building design, will enhance designer awareness, and help contractors to better prioritize safety resources.

This approach can help designers with integrating technology issues, performance management and life cycle costs for component systems. The performance and durability survey observed an overall premature failure rate of 30%. The principal cause of failure was poor maintenance and inappropriate use. Life cycle costing analysis indicated that polyvinyl chloride membranes offered the highest life cycle costing effectiveness within Israel, primarily because of low maintenance expenditures. Despite its low initial capital investment, the single-layered modified bitumen roofing system exhibited high life cycle costs due to its short service life and consequent replacements costs.

In practice, however, design reuse is plagued with difficulties, including those associated with the indexing, retrieval, understanding and modification of prior design knowledge. We propose that such difficulties can be ameliorated by employing insights deriving from design-rationale research concerning how best to represent and retrieve design information. We illustrate these insights by describing the development of a design-reuse system that maximizes the benefits of rationale capture and information retrieval whilst minimising the costs to the designer that might arise from disruption to natural design work.

As a consequence, designing an optimal building has become more challenging than it has been before. In this article, a multi-criteria "knapsack" model is proposed to help designers to select the most feasible renovation actions in the conceptual phase of a renovation project.

Two building project case studies highlight the organizational and procedural problems for reusing components. Designers need additional information to design effectively with reclaimed components for new projects. They need to understand the risks, economics and implications to the programme. The design process needs to allow for more flexible design and specification. Additional skills are needed to source and evaluate components. Robust procurement contracts are needed to accommodate component dismantling and reuse. The impediments to the reuse of construction components are rarely technical or economic. Instead, they are mostly based on organizational, contractual and social structures.

Specifically, it illustrates a spreadsheet approach to valuing "real options" in a project. The model avoids complex financial procedures, which are both inappropriate for most design issues and constitute barriers to understanding and thus achieving the substantial improvement in performance that real options enable. The spreadsheet approach uses standard procedures; is based on data available in practice; and provides graphics that explain the results intuitively. It should thus be readily accessible to practicing professionals responsible for engineering design and management. A practical application to the design of a parking garage demonstrates the ease of use and presentation of results of this approach.

Each change or addition must fit together visually with the rest. This contextual influence is rarely supported by generative systems, which favor a top-down derivation of solutions from goals. In contrast, this research investigates the potential of generative systems to support the bottom-up process of exploring a formal situation and following its visual cues. The paper defines human-computer interaction guidelines for such a system and then examines a prototype. Results suggest that generative systems can provide context-sensitive support and that tacit methods of human-computer interaction could make generative systems more palatable to architectural designers.

AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Design E-ducation - Connecting the Real and the Virtual (eCAADe 2002)	2002	WARSAW, POLAND			sustainability; virtual reality; computer-aided design; virtual environments		The starting point for this paper is the identification of the four necessary and sufficient conditions which a building should exhibit to be judged to be sustainable; fitness-for-purpose, cost effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and cultural significance. The contribution which the current generation of CAD tools is making to the complex human activity of designing sustainable buildings is then discussed under the headings of widening the search for solutions, integrating the decision-making process, improving design insights, differentiating objective/subjective issues and photorealistic visualization. The paper then describes developments in the next generation of IT tools, based on virtual reality, which will allow multiple designers, working in distributed locations and on different computer platforms, to design from within the virtual world.

Understanding the nature of this kind of uncertainty can reduce the level of inconsistency that reinforces the safety management system in CI. The purpose of this paper is to present an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy-improved score function and weighted divergence based approximation (IVIF-ISF-WDBA) approach for ranking main stakeholders with clear duties that can influence workers' unsafe behaviours as well as risk reduction in final decisions. In this method, a score matrix is compiled based on improved score performance and IVIF decision matrix, and then a linear programming model is developed to determine the weight of unknown criteria. In addition, a divergence measure has been developed to find out the degree of performance of the alternatives. Next, we perform comparative and sensitivity analyses with different proposed methods and different weight criteria sets to determine the stability of the developed approach. The results indicated that the most effective safety factors (ESFs) are safety climate factor(3) (SCF3) (safety management rules and regulations) at 45%, and safety perceptual factor(2) (SPF2) (workers' preferences and behaviours related to safety category) at 25%. The LP-model ranked client, designer, construction manager, and contractor as the authoritative bodies that should carry out extensive inspections of ESFs, namely, SCFs, SPFs, and workplace condition factors (WCFs) in the preconstruction phase. However, these priorities can change during the construction phase among the contractor, construction manager, supervisor, client, and designer. This study concluded that workers' unsafe behaviours could be linked to stakeholder duties in complex and dynamic conditions of the CI.

There is growing evidence to show that associations between perceived productivity and clusters of factors such as comfort, health and satisfaction of staff. Some of the management, design and use characteristics which contribute to towards better energy efficiency also help productivity, thereby helping to close the loop on a potential 'virtuous' circle. Unfortunately, the vast majority of occupied buildings do not have these self-reinforcing qualities and many are unmanageably complex. This paper examines which factors within the control of building designers and managers best contribute to human productivity - the 'killer' variables of the title.

J	Pan, Y; Zhang, LM				Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao			BIM log mining: Learning and predicting design commands	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Log data mining; Long short-term memory neural network; Design command prediction	NEURAL-NETWORK; BEHAVIOR	This paper develops a framework to learn and predict design commands based upon building information modeling (BIM) event log data stored in Autodesk Revit journal files, which has the potential to improve the modeling efficiency. BIM design logs, which automatically keep detailed records on the modeling process, are the basis of data acquisition and data mining. Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM NN), as a probabilistic deep learning model for learning sequential data with varying lengths from logs, is established to provide designers with predictions about the possible design command class in the next step. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a case study runs at large design logs over 4 GB from an international design firm for command class prediction. To begin with, useful data retrieved from logs is cleaned and saved in a 320 MB Comma Separated Values (CSV) file with totally 352,056 lines of commands over 289 projects. Subsequently, various design commands are categorized into 14 classes according to their effects and given numerical labels, which are then fed into LSTM NN for training and testing. As a result, the overall accuracy of this particular case study can reach 70.5% in the test set, which outperforms some classical machine learning methods, like k nearest neighbor, random forest and support vector machine. This research contributes to applying a probabilistic LSTM NN with optimal parameters to learn features from designers' subjective behaviors effectively and predict the next possible design command class intelligently towards automation of the design process. Moreover, the three most possible command classes will be offered as the recommendations under the assumption that the correct class tends to appear owning the top three highest probabilities, which can possibly enhance the reliability of predictions.

J	Khosrowshahi, F				Khosrowshahi, Farzad			Enhanced project brief: structured approach to client-designer interface	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Artificial intelligence; Design brief; Design development; Project strategy; SSADM		Purpose - The focus of this work is on the client-designer interface where decisions have significant impact over the lifecycle of the project. Therefore, the briefing stage is examined in the context of clients' needs which is divided into project-based strategy and broader clients' strategy. The purpose of this paper is to address the pitfalls in the briefing process which has been attributed to the shortcomings in the client-designer communication interfaces. This will be achieved by developing an automated brief generation framework. The research examines the efficiency of standard approaches to modelling and design, and the benefits that these methodologies have offered to the computer industry. The work reviews the similarities between the two industries and argues in support of the potential benefits in adopting a standard methodology in the construction industry. The structure upon which the framework is developed is based on system analysis and design methodology (SSADM) which has proven to be an effective platform used within the software development industry. Design/methodology/approach - SSADM is an established methodology within the software development industry. The paper will demonstrate that due to fundamental similarities between the construction and software development industries, SSADM is likely to offer a viable platform upon which an automated enhanced brief generation model is developed for use in the construction industry. The construction design and construction process will be mapped on SSADM high-level definition before focusing and honing on the design phase. The methodology for the development of the framework will be based on the rationalist approach of generating knowledge through reasoning leading to model-building. Findings - A model that is based on SSADM is proposed for the design development phase of construction projects. In order to shape the project strategy, the model considers the combined role of clients' requirements with organisation strategy and environmental factors. The paper has shown that it is feasible to increase the automation of the briefing process and enhanced the briefing output. The model here does not diminish the importance of direct communication between the client and the design team. It provides a more structured way of doing so, while taking advantage of vast array of data and technology in order to improve the brief outcome. Research limitations/implications - From practical perspective, the proposed framework is in its formative stage, thus requiring incremental refinement through several case studies. This is particularly true about the AI components of the system which typically rely on extensive data representing the real-case scenarios. Therefore, the work invites further research into the examination of various parts as well as the overall system. Practical implications - There are several ways by which construction projects are procured. There may be fluctuation in their rate of usage, but while there is no indication of any procurement option fading, new ones such as PPP and PFI are periodically introduced. The existence of this diversity is indicative of the fact that the industry tends to respond to problems rather than attempting to instigate a measured solution supported by theoretical underpinning. Subsequently, there have been suggestions of a communication and information discourse between actors and within processes involved in project lifecycle. This project is aimed at addressing the gap in the client-designer communication. The automated approach to brief generation will lead to better briefs while reducing ambiguities as well as the overhead associated with brief generation. Social implications - The quality of project brief has a significant impact on decisions at the design stage. In turn, these decisions will influence all phases of construction project lifecycle. The briefing session and requirement analysis of a construction project can be very difficult for inexperienced clients particularly for complex projects. Therefore, there is potential for the process of client-requirement-analysis to be optimised. The work promises to improve the quality of the briefing process, thus helping clients to realise their intended objectives and minimise resource waste. Originality/value - The work builds on the commonalities of the construction and software development industries and takes advantage of the advancements in the latter. In doing so, project quality is defined quantitatively which is used to develop project strategy in a three-dimensional space. The development of the model was also contingent upon enhancement of artificial neural network structure.

The automation of design briefs might allow enhanced linking of client/user requirements to design, construction, operation and post-occupancy review. It has the potential for improved collection of requirements, project integration, as well as feedback and feedforward for clients and designers. Current US research on briefing practices is reviewed in relation to improving design quality by using design performance measures. A Web-based tool under development is described. This tool is one example of how automation of the briefing process can assist design firms to analyse and assess a client's needs, shorten the product delivery cycle and provide an end product with greater customer satisfaction.

This research identified three key influencing variables that were found to be related to engineering change propagation, namely: the engineering subsystem issuing the change, the subsystem interface complexity, and the designer experience. Predicting key influencing variables can reduce change propagation and provides important insights to practicing engineering managers. In particular, the results of this study can be used to improve engineering change decision-making processes and the utilization of resources. Similar complex systems composed of multiple subsystems can also benefit from the findings of this research.

The proposed method involves genetic-based stochastic search, Pareto optimization, and color-filtered graphics. A multicriteria genetic algorithm broadly searches the governing body of design knowledge and identifies Pareto designs that are equal-rank optimal in the sense that each is not simultaneously dominated for all objective criteria by any other feasible design. Computer color filtering of the Pareto-optimal design set creates informative graphics that identify trade-off relationships between competing objective criteria, as well as design subsets having particular designer-specified attributes. Much of the paper is devoted to presenting a detailed illustration of the method for the cost-revenue conceptual design of high-rise office buildings, including several examples.

This entails acquiring skills of integration, projection, exploration, as well as critical thinking-forming the basis of thinking "like a designer". Plaguing the beginning architectural design student as she develops this competence are three typical problems: a lagging visual intelligence, a linking of originality with creativity, and the belief that design is an act of an individual author instead of a collaborative activity. We believe that computation support for design learning has particular attributes for helping students overcome these problems. These attributes include its inherent qualities for visualization, for explicitness, and for sharing. This paper describes five interactive multi-media exercises exploiting these attributes which were developed to support a beginning design studio. The paper also reports how they have been integrated into the course curriculum.

Using generative methods, the computer becomes a design generator in addition to its more conventional role as draftsperson, visualizor, data checker and performance analyst. To enable designers to readily develop meaningful input models, this paper describes a preliminary integration of a generative structural design system, eifForm, and an associative modeling system, Generative Components, through the use of XML models.

A cost optimization-based design of precast concrete floors using genetic algorithms	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Structural optimization; Precast concrete; Genetic algorithm		The integrated design optimization, not only the element optimization, is considered a strong trend. The integrated optimization involves the three major stages of an engineering design process namely conceptual design, embodiment design and detailing design. This paper presents an integrated structural precast floor design optimization tool, called DSSPF (Decision Support System for Precast Floors), for precast concrete structures using GA and considers the cost impact at all construction phases like manufacture, transport and erecting in the structural conception. An example indicating the DSSPF results are very consistent with the results of an existing design is further presented. Based on the results obtained, the DSSPF is considered a powerful novel tool to assist designers in the choice of structural layout and initial element dimensioning phases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

CAM-ORIENTED CAD-SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN	Computers are playing an increasing role in the construction process, especially in the design phase. Designers still use computer-aided design (CAD) systems as drafting tools, mimicking manual drafting to a large extent. Automatic integration of design and construction is not possible without a radical change in this procedure. This paper presents a different approach to design, one that allows automatic extraction of construction-related data from the design database. A CAM (computer-aided manufacture) oriented CAD model is described together with a prototype system that implements the model. The model and the system contribute to improvement of the design process, consequently lowering design costs and improving the design product, increasing compatibility of design and improving communication with construction, etc. The paper describes the first stage of a multistage project; the plans for future development are briefly specified.

Efficient distribution of bracing over a structure is an important concern and often based on intuition and previous experience. This paper presents a topology optimization procedure for cable bracing of the hanging steel facade of a new museum in the United States. In this procedure the use of a multiobjective Genetic Algorithm allows for flexibility during design modifications and accounts for uncertainty of deflection constraint values. The presented method achieves practical solutions to a series of cost minimizing problems, giving the designer a range of optimal bracing configurations which can be selected in response to the continuously changing structural and architectural requirements throughout the design process.

It also proposes that by properly integrating the design process, a company can minimize design liability and exposure. A design-process model of good U.S. building design practice shows key production and design activities. The results of a survey of the activities being introduced into a large design company to better manage liability are covered. These activities are then merged with the design practice model to form the integrated design process model (IDPM). The design model represents the major functions and activities necessary for a successful design. It also identifies the flow of information and knowledge that supports development of the design. Hierarchical decomposition trees and flow models of the IDPM are presented. Definitions of the model are included in an appendix. Finally, a discussion on applying this model in the field closes the paper.		SANVIDO, VE (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV,104 ENGN UNIT A,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802, USA.

A framework for using mobile computing for information management on construction sites	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction information management; Construction sites; Mobile computing	SYSTEM	The application of mobile computing in construction is becoming a major research theme in the domain of Information Technology in Construction. However, most research in this area focuses on a detailed aspect or single facet of a mobile computing technology. This paper introduces a framework for the implementation of mobile computing on construction sites, which comprises an application model and a technical model. The application model identifies the features of mobile computing, construction personnel, construction information, and construction sites, and explores the interactions that are likely to affect the implementation of mobile computing. The technological model generalizes mobile computing technologies and gives system designers a clear structure for designing mobile computing systems from a technical perspective. Finally, a case study of a real construction situation is used to validate this framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Various types of emergency can lead to a need for evacuation. However, there are few studies on proactively reducing emergency evacuation risks through the design for safety (DFS) concept, and these risks pose serious threats to the operational safety of metro stations. Therefore, in this research, fragmented DFS pre-control measures for mitigating emergency evacuation risks were comprehensively identified and classified, and indicators for evaluating the evacuation design effect on reducing emergency evacuation risks in the operation phase were improved. Moreover, through the combination of the DFS application method and BIM platform, intelligent safety design tools were provided for metro station designers so that they may apply the DFS concept to emergency evacuation risk mitigation in real cases.

Drawing on socio-technical theory, this study establishes a research framework to help understand the social and technical factors affecting consumers' intention to purchase on social commerce sites. Our results demonstrate that familiarity, user experience, learning and training, and social commerce constructs all have a positive effect on consumers' perceptions of ease of use and usefulness, thereby enhancing their trust and intention to purchase.

Though researchers generally agree that when firms form into networks they will gain access to new knowledge, the question of learning beyond the firm at the boundaries between firms or at the level of the project network itself remain less explored. We simulate the impact of task interdependence and relational instability on learning in project networks comprised of multiple specialist firms. We find that relational instability in project networks slows learning and task interdependence moderates the impact of increasing relational instability on network productivity rates. The findings have significant implications for interorganizational learning theory. The simulation results provide insights into appropriate firm-level and project network-level strategies for change.

They are lack of information needed in order to create a virtual environment which can interact with users. Such problems will become more prominent in the case of smart spaces where the environment reacts to users' activity. There are no sufficient tools to design and represent real usage of smart space. Achieving this aim, the paper presents Smart-BIM consisting of smart objects which can react to user activities. The created virtual space with Smart-BIM is different from conventional 3D space. Since the resulted space embodies smart objects with the capability of doing certain functions and reacting toward users interaction according to the property sets of objects. A task-based interaction is proposed to apply Smart BIM in a design process. Smart Design systems help end users to experience their daily activity in a virtual environment and understand the space reactions. It can be used as a toolset to improve communications among users and designers in design processes especially in the design of smart environments. Eventually, it is expected that Smart-BIM will lead to match smart technology usability with users demands. To facilitate further developments of Smart Design systems, a prototyping experiment was done. The prototype application utilizes three typical domestic tasks and several real-time interactions. Scripting the tasks, using smart object managers and using smart home objects make the real-time interactions and system reactions possible. Hence, the prototype gives the opportunity of evaluating users' attitude and expressions toward an interactive and responsive BIM. The results from the first evaluations reveal a positive attitude of users toward the prototype. They also show that when the users can directly execute a task in the virtual model, they can deliver a better comprehension of how smart technologies can be utilized. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Provision of Reinforcement in Concrete Solids Using the Generalized Genetic Algorithm	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Reinforcement design; Three-dimensional stress field; Generalized genetic algorithm; Adaptive random mutation; Heterogeneous strategy; Population isolation	DESIGN	A generalized genetic algorithm has been developed to find the global optimal reinforcement contents for a concrete solid structure subjected to a general three-dimensional (3D) stress field. Feasible solutions were examined based on the genetic algorithm, and the heterogeneous strategy used ensures that all of the local optimal regions are searched and the most optimal reinforcement content found. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated by comparing the steel contents evaluated using the present method with those obtained from other available methods. A more economic design is achieved by the proposed algorithm. The method developed provides the designer with a valuable tool for the determination of reinforcements in complicated solid concrete structures. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000083.

With the pre-program. adiabatic hydration curves, which are used to determine the internal heat generation, are calculated. An artificial neural networks approach is used for this purpose. Adiabatic hydration curves, which were included in the learning set, were determined by our own experiments, using the adiabatic calorimeter which uses air as the coupling media. The main program is implemented in the finite element code. This program allows concrete structure designers and contractors to quantify and evaluate the effects of some concrete initial parameters on the adiabatic hydration curves and corresponding temperature development at an arbitrary point in the concrete element. Some examples are also presented and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cellular automata in architectural design: From generic systems to specific design tools	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-Research-in-Asia	MAY 18-23, 2015	Kyungpook Natl Univ, Daegu, SOUTH KOREA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Res Asia	Kyungpook Natl Univ	Cellular automata; Generative design; Design research; Design tools	SUPPORT	In this paper we examine the adaptations cellular automata (CA) are typically subjected to when they are applied to architectural designing. We argue that, despite a number of earlier studies that portrayed CA as generic generative design tools, the transition from CA as generic systems to specific design tools for the purposes of design is not yet well understood. To describe this transition, we first examine CA adaptations in a number of previous studies relating CA to architectural design. We then analyze an applied design case study in detail and trace similarities between findings made in the literature review to findings made in the case study. We conclude with a summary of challenges and opportunities met by architectural designers employing and developing CA as design tools. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The fact of being "deployable" in itself implies a simple way of assembling the structure and this assembly is even more promising if it can be achieved by pressing a button. The first part of this scientific paper is focused on a brief description of the different techniques already used by other authors to automate the deployment of structures. After that, 4 techniques to deploy a structure are proposed where each one is analysed and applied to a deployable structure with straight rods and a cylindrical shape. Finally, some of these applications are built and their behaviour with respect to the theoretical model is checked.

While BIM has become an innate feature of the design process within the construction industry, there have been limited investigations that have examined how it can be integrated into real-time communication on-site. In addressing this gap, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that integrates BIM with augmented reality (AR) so as to enable the physical context of each construction activity or task to be visualized in real-time. To be effective, it is suggested that AR should be ubiquitous (including context awareness) and thus operate in conjunction with tracking and sensing technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), laser pointing, sensors and motion tracking.

We have focused on the type of design intent that is related to architectural design. We express design intent in terms of function, user requirements, performance, and physical properties of a design description. This paper shows how design intent can guide the contractor's material selection and substitution when faced with a proprietary brand-name-or-equal specification. In such cases, the designer requires the contractor to use a specified material brand or any other material that is ''equal.'' However, the conditions of ''equal'' are usually not explicit. Five algorithms structured in pseudocode terms are provided for such equality interpretation. The paper concludes that a better understanding of design-process knowledge can strengthen the communication between design and construction.

J	Goucha, HY; OConnor, JT				Goucha, HY; OConnor, JT			Redesign of vendor-data processes for industrial projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The vendor-data processes within industrial piping design are very inefficient throughout the industry. Through personal interviews with procurement experts, the problems causing these inefficiencies were identified. The problems with vendor data were in the general areas of communication, coordination, and vendor selection. The improvement of these processes was achieved by first identifying the uncertainties in vendor data, designer reviews, and owner specifications, which are injected into various phases of the vendor-data cycle. After identifying the uncertainties, a process redesign was performed. A process redesign is an improvement on an existing process such as vendor-data coordination meetings. Other recommendations include vendor-data request forms and a vendor prequalification program. Every recommended process redesign will help improve the efficiency of vendor-data processes and consequently improve the efficiency of industrial piping design and installation by reducing delays and/or field rework. These recommendations have been validated by industry input.

Knowledge and reasoning in design systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Visual language; Design diagram; Hypergraph; First-order logic; Knowledge-based reasoning		This paper deals with problem-oriented visual languages used for solving design tasks during the conceptual design phase. Visualization of early design solutions by means of visual languages requires an appropriate design knowledge representation in computer systems. The continuation of our method to develop a knowledge-based decision support design system is presented. It consists in connecting a graph-based knowledge representation with a design reasoning method which uses first-order logic formulas. The design diagrams being elements of a visual language are automatically transformed into hierarchical hypergraphs and then information stored in these hypergraph data structures is translated to formulas of the first-order logic forming design knowledge. Modifications of design diagrams cause changes in logic formulas, which can be traced by the designer. The approach is illustrated by examples of designing floor layouts and navigating robots in them. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, based on the extensive statistics of actual projects, topology optimization techniques and principle of minimum strain energy, two precise strut-and-tie models for the cable-pylon anchorage zone are proposed, which can clearly reveal the load-transmitting mechanism of the anchorage zone. The explicit geometric parameters of the strut-and-tie models are derived; thus, the designers can directly use these models. A simple design procedure to deploy prestressing tendons in the anchorage zone is also introduced, whose effectiveness and convenience are demonstrated by two design examples. A new design named the "one-way prestressing tendons PC cable-pylon" is also discussed regarding its application scope.

The system discussed has a hierarchical and modular structure and is designed for monolithic constructions. Major elements of this system are objects Such as: concrete mixers, buckets, Slip forms, cranes and a building team. The paper describes the work of two modules that enable combining production systems of sets of means, simulation, and visualisation results. Simulation is a valuable tool in analyzing construction process because it allows construction designers to carry Out experiments that make evaluation of different variants possible.

In other cases, rebar suppliers accept hard copies of blueprints and return CAD files featuring different design layers and elements. Under this arrangement, communication between project participants is fragmented and depends solely on the direct input of the participants in a specific task. This paper proposes a business-to-business (13213) e-Work system to improve the approval process for rebar estimation data. This system is composed of extensible markup language-based databases that support essential tasks of the approval process such as design and revision of structural drawings, bidding, shop drawing preparation, revision, and correction, and rebar delivery. The performance of the proposed system is compared with existing industry practices based on data obtained from structural designers, contractors, and rebar suppliers.

J	Sass, L				Sass, Lawrence			Synthesis of design production with integrated digital fabrication	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						digital fabrication; rule-based design	MODEL	Presented is a research project that demonstrates cross-scale design production with physical examples. Designers today have begun using rapid prototyping to materialize designs of a variety of materials from plastic to metal and ceramics. They also use CAD/CAM to materialize full-scale building components during construction with metal, stone, and a variety of woods. Dilemmas are found in the translation of a description that drives rapid prototyping tools and descriptions that drive CAD/CAM machinery for full-scale component manufacturing. This paper presents a method to produce designs with test results that drive varying types of digital fabrication devices across scales from one geometric file. Presented is an integration of machines, materials, and modeling resulting as a full-scale house and a redefinition of construction components, assembly and building shape. Final results demonstrate a relationship between design artifacts built by rapid prototyping and full-scale CNC construction. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automatic design quality evaluation using graph similarity measures	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Graph representation; Spatial relations; Hierarchical graphs; Graph similarity; Graph kernels; Design evaluation	DISTANCE	This paper contributes to the problem of assisting the designer in dealing with evaluating the quality of a design. Especially, spatial relationships and arrangements of components within a design are explicitly dealt with. Hierarchical graphs are used as the design representation to enable capturing different ways components can be related by taking into account the fact that a component can form a part of another one. As the human evaluation is often based on the experience gained from seeing and analyzing many designs a similar approach is proposed in this paper. This approach uses methods drawn from machine learning, in particular kernels for structured data. Kernel functions are used to calculate similarity of new designs to other designs for which the evaluation is known thus simulating the process of learning from experience. The proposed approach is illustrated by experimental results obtained for the task of floor layout design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Weinstein, M; Gambatese, J; Hecker, S				Weinstein, M; Gambatese, J; Hecker, S			Can design improve construction safety?: Assessing the impact of a collaborative safety-in-design process	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper analyzes the impact of a large-scale safety-in-design initiative during the design and construction of a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Drawing on multiple data sources including individual interviews, group interviews, construction documentation, and an expert panel involved in the initiative, the writers identify 26 potential design changes on the project and assess the importance of timing, trade contractor involvement, and the type of design change in determining whether a proposed design change was ultimately integrated into the final construction plans. The writers further consider whether adopted design changes would have occurred in the absence of the safety-in-design initiative and whether the accepted design changes ultimately impacted construction site safety on the project. This analysis of a full-scale safety-in-design initiative provides important insights into how injury prevention efforts in the construction industry can begin upstream by involving designers, engineers, and trade contractors in preconstruction processes.

J	Bonino, D; Corno, F				Bonino, Dario; Corno, Fulvio			Modeling, simulation and emulation of Intelligent Domotic Environments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Simulation; Emulation; Intelligent Domotic Environment; State chart; Ontology modeling		Intelligent Domotic Environments are a promising approach, based on semantic models and commercially off-the-shelf domotic technologies, to realize new intelligent buildings, but such complexity requires innovative design methodologies and tools for ensuring correctness. Suitable simulation and emulation approaches and tools must be adopted to allow designers to experiment with their ideas and to incrementally verify designed policies in a scenario where the environment is partly emulated and partly composed of real devices. This paper describes a framework, which exploits UML2.0 state diagrams for automatic generation of device simulators from ontology-based descriptions of domotic environments. The DogSim simulator may simulate a complete building automation system in software, or may be integrated in the Dog Gateway, allowing partial simulation of virtual devices alongside with real devices. Experiments on a real home show that the approach is feasible and can easily address both simulation and emulation requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This context presents a clear opportunity to integrate advanced functionality for engaging with quantitative design objectives directly into computational design environments. This paper presents a toolbox for data-driven design, which draws from data science and optimization methods to enable customized workflows for early design space exploration. It then applies these approaches to a multi-objective conceptual design problem involving structural and energy performance for a long span roof with complex geometry and considerable design freedom. The case study moves from initial brainstorming through design refinement while demonstrating the advantages of flexible workflows for managing design data. Through investigation of a realistic early design prompt, this paper reveals strengths, limitations, potential pitfalls, and future opportunities for data-driven parametric design.

J	Sampaio, AZ				Sampaio, AZ			Geometric modeling of box girder deck for integrated bridge graphical system	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						automation and integration in bridge design; geometric modeling		This paper presents a geometric modeling of box girder deck to automate deck design representations. A geometric methodology was developed and implemented in a computer program. This software allows the geometric description of the deck, using bridge design data usually given at the conceptual stage, and the automation of several drawings and three-dimensional (3D) models, defined accurately. Using traditional graphical system, the execution of deck specific drawings is extremely time-consuming, the 3D deck model gives an approximation only of the exterior shape of the deck and the 3D finite elements (FE) mesh generation software imposes geometric simplifications on the real configuration of the deck before discretization. The computer application provides an important toot to the bridge designer, particularly at the conceptual stage, as it allows aesthetic and structural evaluation of the bridge at an early stage in the design. The geometric modeling process and graphical results of a case-study are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

First a brief description of the telegenesis project which formed a background to the research project is provided to help place in context the solutions that emerged from the investigation and development. The principal development from the research project was a transitional framework of how design will evolve into the future based on a pop-i configuration. The concept of pop-i is outlined. The transitional framework projects the future state of design, defined by the time horizon projected to 2020, and based on information from the sectors of aerospace, construction, and product design. The rationale and use of the transitional map is explained. The transitional map is recommended as an audit system for managing the long-term future of design organization.

This paper uses five systems that make up earthmoving equipment (implement, traction, structure, power train, and control and information) to analyze this technical advancement. The analysis of each system includes its purpose and operation, technical limitations and key technologies, and a chronology of major, advancements. The findings are the benefits of using the five systems for analysis of technical change, the sequence and timing of key technical advances in each system, the fundamental technologies that fostered these advances, and the integration of systems into balanced. equipment designs. This increased understanding from this analysis results in significant implications and relevance for civil designers working on integrated teams, contractors selecting methods and planning operations, equipment suppliers developing new machines construction educators teaching the technical basics of equipment, and researchers developing advanced modeling and simulation tools.

However, on-site design work is challenging for designers, because the current design tools can hardly merge virtual three-dimensional (3D) models with real surrounding environments for visualization and interaction. To address this challenge, we designed and developed a mixed reality (MR) tool called HoloDesigner. In this paper, we describe the development process and core components of HoloDesigner. Through an on-site design application at a community park, we demonstrated its main workflow and functionalities. The results proved that HoloDesigner could successfully render on-site 3D visualization as well as real-time interactions to control 3D models in the real surrounding environment. This research offers new insights on supporting on-site design work with MR technologies and contributes to overcoming the limitations of current MR tools for on-site visualization and interaction.

To provide customers with individually tailored unit designs, this study proposes customer interactive building information modeling (CIBIM), a type of parametric unit design method. In CIBIM, a parametric 3D modeling tool has been used to create separate fixed walls and movable walls which were linked to lighting and furniture families. Customer satisfaction with CIBIM was evaluated through a survey comparing an actual model house and a new design. The efficiency was evaluated by comparing a number of drawings using conventional methods and CIBIM. In comparison, the results show that the CIBIM provides various designs which reflected individual desire to change. CIBIM represents a means to meet customer needs as well as a way to reduce labor requirements by designers.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A rigorous analysis of the myriad specific interactions between them indicates that a synergy exists which, if properly understood in theoretical terms, can be exploited to improve construction processes beyond the degree to which it might be improved by application of either of these paradigms independently. Using a matrix that juxtaposes BIM functionalities with prescriptive lean construction principles, 56 interactions have been identified, all but four of which represent constructive interaction. Although evidence for the majority of these has been found, the matrix is not considered complete but rather a framework for research to explore the degree of validity of the interactions. Construction executives, managers, designers, and developers of information technology systems for construction can also benefit from the framework as an aid to recognizing the potential synergies when planning their lean and BIM adoption strategies.

Owners are driving the change away from the traditional design/bid/build method. This change and changes in federal procurement laws necessitate investigation, formalization, and development of new design/build guidelines and practices. Public-sector use of design/build represents a fundamental departure from traditional competitive, low-bid procurement procedures. Understanding the evolution and current trends in public-sector design/build provides a foundation for developing uniform guidelines and practices. This paper describes the rapid evolution of public-sector design/build and analyzes results from 104 completed public-sector design/build projects. The results provide insights for owners, designers, and builders into the changing public-sector procurement system. Items analyzed include owner experience, level of design completion, design/builder selection. contract type, method of award, and design/build process variations. The research conclusions provide a design/build benchmark for public-sector agencies.

J	Chen, L; Whyte, J				Chen, Long; Whyte, Jennifer			Understanding design change propagation in complex engineering systems using a digital twin and design structure matrix	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Digital twin; Design structure matrix; Design change propagation	INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS; BUILDING DESIGN; MODEL; IMPACT; REPRESENTATION; DECOMPOSITION; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; ATTACK	Purpose As the engineering design process becomes increasingly complex, multidisciplinary teams need to work together, integrating diverse expertise across a range of disciplinary models. Where changes arise, these design teams often find it difficult to handle these design changes due to the complexity and interdependencies inherent in engineering systems. This paper aims to develop an innovative approach to clarifying system interdependencies and predicting the design change propagation at the asset level in complex engineering systems based on the digital-twin-driven design structure matrix (DSM). Design/methodology/approach The paper first defines the digital-twin-driven DSM in terms of elements and interdependencies, where the authors have defined three types of interdependency, namely, geospatial, physical and logical, at the asset level. The digital twin model was then used to generate the large-scale DSMs of complex engineering systems. The cluster analysis was further conducted based on the improved Idicula-Gutierrez-Thebeau algorithm (IGTA-Plus) to decompose such DSMs into modules for the convenience and efficiency of predicting design change propagation. Finally, a design change propagation prediction method based on the digital-twin-driven DSM has been developed by integrating the change prediction method (CPM), a load-capacity model and fuzzy linguistics. A section of an infrastructure mega-project in London was selected as a case study to illustrate and validate the developed approach. Findings The digital-twin-driven DSM has been formally defined by the spatial algebra and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. Based on the definitions, an innovative approach has been further developed to (1) automatically generate a digital-twin-driven DSM through the use of IFC files, (2) to decompose these large-scale DSMs into modules through the use of IGTA-Plus and (3) predict the design change propagation by integrating a digital-twin-driven DSM, CPM, a load-capacity model and fuzzy linguistics. From the case study, the results showed that the developed approach can help designers to predict and manage design changes quantitatively and conveniently. Originality/value This research contributes to a new perspective of the DSM and digital twin for design change management and can be beneficial to assist designers in making reasonable decisions when changing the designs of complex engineering systems.

By taking a 3D building model with material properties as input, RadVR allows users to (1) perform physically-based daylighting simulations via Radiance, (2) study sunlight in different hours-of-the-year, (3) interact with a 9-point-in-time matrix for the most representative times of the year, and (4) visualize, compare, and analyze daylighting simulation results. With an end-to-end workflow, RadVR integrates with 3D modeling software that is commonly used by building designers. Additionally, by conducting user experiments we compare the proposed system with DIVA for Rhino, a Radiance-based tool that uses conventional 2D-displays. The results show that RadVR can provide promising assistance in spatial understanding tasks, navigation, and sun position analysis in virtual reality.

J	Luca, C				Luca, Caneparo			Generative platform for urban and regional design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures	JUN 20-22, 2005	Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, AUSTRIA		Vienna Univ Technol	large-scale modelling; generative modelling; participatory design; DSS; GIS; software agent; datascape; urban simulation; regional simulation		The paper introduces a dynamic and interactive generative modelling platform for urban and regional design. By dynamic modelling, the platform evolves in time according to the interactions of designers, planners, decision-makers and all others involved. By interactive modelling, we mean a process across policy, planning and design, and their respective actors. Based on several synchronous and/or asynchronous users' interactions, models are generated at run time. The models are built by defining the datasets and the actions (tasks) to perform on that data. The platform reads and correlates data at urban-regional extent from various authorities to generate dynamic datasets. Tasks are especially powerful when they integrate generative procedures in a hierarchical structure. We consider the platform application to dynamically and interactively generating models of an Alpine valley. The modelling in the spatial and temporal dimensions provided us with the elements to study the evolution over the next 20 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a proactive approach to safety management, Construction Hazard Prevention through Design (CHPtD) can significantly eliminate or reduce the construction safety risk. However, this concept is not implemented effectively in practice because the technical issues that underlie CHPtD have not been addressed. This paper proposes a novel method of quantitative construction safety risk assessment for building projects at the design stage. This method consists of three indexes: Likelihood, consequence and exposure. These indexes are calculated using occupational injury, fatality and specific construction planning data which are accurate and objective. A plug-in that links building information modeling (BIM) with safety risk data is developed in Autodesk Revit, which can automatically calculate construction safety risk to help architects and structural designers quickly select design alternatives. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) is a relationship-based procurement model that allows the client, the designer, and the contractor to work collaboratively, which results in improved performance. Previous ECI research has focused on its implementation in private projects and public projects managed by the Federal and State Governments. This research investigates the implementation of ECI in Local Government projects in Sydney, Australia. Interviews revealed that the main challenges are probity, developing principle project requirements document, running ECI workshops, changing the attitudes of project participants, and the time-consuming nature of ECI process. When these challenges are overcome, Local Government projects can reap the benefits of ECI, such as collaborative work relationships, better constructability, innovation, cost certainty, improved risk management, and better value for money. It is concluded that ECI is a suitable procurement model to improve project performance in the Local Government context.

Section 2 of this paper looks at precedents in automated construction research and identifies an apparent gap in design related themes. Section 3 is devoted to the introduction of a research programme which addressed topics related to the conceptual design of robotic systems for construction, and developing overall design principles for top-down architect/designer applications. The research included the derivation of simple shape grammars and a simulation research programme for understanding component connections and robotic manipulation, using a model robotic construction system remote controlled over the Internet. Section 4 presents a report of the research carried out according to the programme, and introduces an example concept automated construction system designed according to the principles derived from the investigation outlined in Section 3.

J	MAHER, ML; BALACHANDRAN, B				MAHER, ML; BALACHANDRAN, B			MULTIMEDIA APPROACH TO CASE-BASED STRUCTURAL DESIGN	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Case-based reasoning provides an approach to the reuse of previous design experience through the storage, retrieval, and adaptation of specific design projects. One of the major issues to be addressed in the application of case-based reasoning to structural design is the representation of design projects in case memory. This representation provides the basis for reasoning about retrieval and adaptation. A schema for representing structural design projects that includes the function and behavior of the structure as well as geometry is required for a flexible indexing system that can identify a relevant case. A multimedia representation provides the visualization of the structure that augments the symbolic indexing schema. The implementation of a multimedia database with a flexible indexing schema involves a heterogeneous environment that combines object-oriented representations and CAD systems. A prototype of a case-based system aimed at evaluating the potential of the combined multimedia and case-based-reasoning technologies to assist structural designers at conceptual design stage is presented.

J	Ostwald, MJ				Ostwald, Michael J.			Ethics and the auto-generative design process	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						computer-generated design; design philosophy; design process; digital architecture; ethics		In the last decade, the rise of sophisticated software tools has enabled a growing number of designers to experiment with new processes for the creation of architectural form. Several of these processes, which are loosely grouped under the rubric 'auto-generative', rely on the computer to evolve extraordinary biomorphic or topographic forms. In the years since the rise of this approach, prominent members of the architectural community have embraced the computer-generated buildings produced in this way and praised them as being the products of an innately ethical or moral design process. This supposition is tested through a critical textual analysis of several high-profile architects' statements and is focused exclusively on accounts of the design process and not on the buildings that are produced in this way. A three-part conceptual framework is developed for the ethical analysis of a creative or constructive process. Evidence is used selectively to interrogate the claims made about this movement from a moral or an ethical standpoint.

There are several Building Sustainability Assessment (BSA) methods that allow designers to assess and optimise the building sustainability level. Due to the potential of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the opportunity for BSA methods to adopt and benefit from BIM arises. Despite the benefits in the approach simplification for assessing building sustainability, so far the method has not been used comprehensively in the evaluation process. This paper analyses how using BIM can contribute to optimising BSA methods, focusing on the SBTool(PT)-H. BIM applicability is assessed and a framework for a BIM-based application - SBTool(BIM) - is proposed. BIM is still not oriented to sustainable building, but it has great potential. For the SBTool(PT)-H, results show that it is possible to directly and indirectly assess 24 out of 25 criteria using BIM.

A solution to this problem could be useful in a number of situations: the systematic and automatic (historical) analysis of large design corpora, to leverage computer-aided design tools that assist designers in predicting performance measures that are difficult or time-consuming to calculate, or as a complementary method to generative design models, both in the formulation and evaluation of these models. In particular, we propose the use of one-class support vector machines (SVMs) with graph kernels to learn architectural style from a single dataset of designs that belong to this particular style. As a result, the trained classifier can successfully detect new unobserved designs as similar or different from the learned style. Also, two experiments demonstrate the ability to learn an architectural style that can be sufficiently generalized to new designs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) has played a significant role, with governments commissioning emergency hospital projects. Due to the conflict between some DfMA strategies/guidelines, their integration requires further thorough investigation. This study aims to explore the integrated approaches to DfMA. A three-step method, including a focus group, 18 designer interviews, and archival study, formed the basis and validation of the case. Finally, the study identified 31 DfMA measures and revealed three organizational (concurrence, integration, and collaboration) and five design attributes that correspond with integration strategies for DfMA. Critical to the integrated approaches to DfMA is breaking the mirroring trap. This study contributes to the theory development of DfMA in terms of systems integration. Future practitioners can take the example by the case to adapt the project organizational structure to the building production.

Investigating the types, causes and severity of claims in construction projects in the UAE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Claims; contracts; projects; questionnaire survey	MODEL	Construction projects are complex and involve thousands of details and complex interrelationships among several parties. In this multidisciplinary environment, claims are immanent and appear to cause delays in delivering projects. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), claims are seen in almost every construction project. In an attempt to prevent/reduce claims, this paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among construction practitioners in UAE to investigate the types and causes of construction claims and their frequency and severity. The survey data was collected from contractors, designers and owners. Results of data analysis indicated that the 'changes' and 'delay' types of claims are the most frequent ones while 'contract ambiguity' is ranked last. The analysis also showed that 'change/variation orders' is the most frequent and severe cause of claims while 'delay caused by owner' is ranked second and 'owner personality' is ranked last. General recommendations on how to reduce/prevent claims are then presented.

We argue that traditional methods are incapable of addressing LCA data requirements, and for such a data and meta-data intensive task, the semantic web is the only logical choice of technology. This paper presents a review of the semantic web and its applications in the construction industry, along with an overview of the current LCA tools. LCA challenges are thoroughly discussed, and a framework using the semantic web is developed to address the data management issues of BIM-LCA applications. For comparison, the implementation is also done using an LCA tool (Tally), and a method using Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Results show that the proposed method is superior to RDBMS methods in terms of capturing semantics and can improve LCA tools by providing reliable data in the early design stages.

In this paper, we propose a use-phase memory model for residential buildings, whose aim is to store energy consumption and usage patterns. This storage can be done automatically or voluntarily. We give examples of useful information extracted from the data captured. The objective of this data analysis and synthesis is to provide building experts two specific use-cases: designing a new sustainable building, and renovating an existing one. Our model is deployed on a residential building, integrating the beneficial services for all stakeholders to demonstrate a sustainable relationship between designers, the residential building and the users.

There has been an increase in the interest in synchronous collaborative virtual environments as an alternative or extension to collaborating using CAD systems. This paper puts forward a 3D virtual world environment which provides real-time multi-user collaboration for designers in different locations and allows for the different design disciplines to model their view of a building as different representations. This 3D world is extended to provide a more complete collaborative environment. Relationships between the objects in the different models are seen as central to the maintenance of consistency and control while changing the design. Agent technology is used to manage the different views, the creation and modification of objects in the 3D virtual world and the necessary relationships with the database(s) belonging to each discipline.

The use of this technology in the design process differs from previous research and practise in that it looks at the use of computer-generated physical modelling recursively in design process rather than as a means to create a final presentation model [W.J. Mitchell, M. McCullough, Digital Design Media, Van Nostrand Reihnold, New York, 1994]. Previous research in the field by the author identified recursive strategy in the design process as the area in which computer-generated physical modelling offers unique opportunities to the designer. Three unique advantages in the use of computer-generated physical modelling technology are illustrated by three case studies. These advantages are: (1) understanding kinetic design, (2) understanding design involving complex geometry and (3) understanding design at the interface with the human body.

A significant number of models have been developed in a variety of disciplines (computer graphics, robotics, evacuation dynamics, etc.). This paper presents a review of crowd simulation models and selected commercial software tools for high rise building evacuation simulation. The commercial tools selected (STEPS and EXODUS) are grid-based simulations, which allow for efficient implementation but introduce artifacts in the final results. This paper focuses on describing the main challenges and limitation of these tools, in addition to explaining the importance of incorporating human psychological and physiological factors into the models. The paper concludes with an overview of fundamentals that should be applied to simulate human movement closer to real movements of people, where interaction between bodies emerges and flow rates, densities, and speeds become the result of those interactions instead of some predefined value.

J	Sturts, CS; Griffis, FH				Sturts, CS; Griffis, FH			Pricing engineering services	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN BUILD	Technology has an incredible impact on the pricing and profitability of engineering services. Historically, pricing for engineering services has been based on labor-hours. However, some in the industry have experienced at least a tenfold increase in efficiency because of computer-aided design and the development of three-dimensional computer models. Consequently, the labor-hours spent on a project no longer adequately represent the value of the engineering services rendered. There is a need for engineers, designers, and consultants to revise old, and develop new, pricing strategies. The writers discuss current and foreseeable issues and constraints facing engineers today. On April 16, 2003, the ASCE San Francisco Younger Member Forum, (YMF) met to discuss the topic of pricing for engineering and consulting services. The presentation, discussion, and conclusions as well as a discussion of the current state of the marketplace and future technical developments in the industry are included in this paper. Pricing and contracting strategies are discussed and analyzed, and a call is made to industry, academics, and practitioners alike to address the pricing and perception problems outlined in this paper.

J	Hegazy, T; Zaneldin, E; Grierson, D				Hegazy, T; Zaneldin, E; Grierson, D			Improving design coordination for building projects. I: Information model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Detailed design of building projects is a complex multidisciplinary process highly dependent upon effective aggregation of individual designs to produce a coherent set of final design documents. Throughout the detailed design process, changes are frequently introduced and need to be properly managed among the various members of the design team. This paper presents an information model for storing design information, recording design rationale, and managing design changes. The proposed model is built around a central library of generalized building components that can be used to describe a complete building project hierarchy. Each component allows the designer to store desired performance criteria and related design rationale. Each component is also sensitive to its own changes and automatically communicates such changes to affected parties through preset communication paths. The model, as such, provides improved design coordination and control over changes, thus helping to increase the consistency and productivity of the overall design process. Conceptual details of the model are described in this paper, and model implementation into a collaborative design system is presented in a companion paper.

Therefore, the current study attempts to identify a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the success of construction megaprojects. By conducting a questionnaire survey, research data were collected, which contained 129 valid replies from three groups of respondents from the Chinese construction industries: owners, contractors, and designers. IBM SPSS version 25 software was employed to analyze five underlying dimensions for CMS: (1) project efficiency, (2) key stakeholders' satisfaction, (3) organizational strategic goals, (4) innovation and development of the construction industry, and (5) comprehensive impact on society. Afterward, the fuzzy set theory was utilized to evaluate the KPIs' effectiveness. The results of this research can contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of megaproject management and serve as a theoretical foundation for the enhanced performance assessment of construction megaprojects and related management success.

However, there are many challenges in receiving construction-specific information from a BIM, limiting the usability of BIMs for construction and other downstream processes. This paper describes a novel approach that utilizes ontology-based feature modeling, automatic feature extraction based on a well-established AEC XML standard schema, and query processing to extract information relevant to construction practitioners from a given BIM. The feature ontology generically represents construction-specific information that is useful for a broad range of construction management functions. The software prototype uses the ontology to transform the designer-focused BIM into a construction-specific feature-based model (FBM). The formal query methods operate on the FBM to further help construction users to quickly extract the necessary information from a BIM. The tests demonstrate that this approach provides a richer representation of construction-specific information than existing BIM tools. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Thomson, DS; Austin, SA; Devine-Wright, H; Mills, GR				Thomson, DS; Austin, SA; Devine-Wright, H; Mills, GR			Managing value and quality in design	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						customer focus; design; design management; design quality; qualities; quality; value; values		The role of stakeholders in defining project values influences product quality expectations as well as designers' expectations in meeting these goals. Ultimately, these determine the functional, physical and symbolic product characteristics that are necessary to achieve customer satisfaction. The issues of value and quality are compared within the context of design management, including their theoretical and philosophical underpinnings as well as current management techniques. Value and quality can be misunderstood and confused; therefore, it is vital for stakeholders to have a common understanding of terminology and meaning. This is particularly true of customers who need to be engaged in a straightforward manner. Our research into the management of value delivery in design is used to explore opportunities for incorporating design quality indicator (DQI) assessments into a project management system that ensures the delivery of stakeholder value during the design stage. Opportunities for customization of the DQI content and the context of application at this stage of a project (as opposed to assessments during and after construction) are explored and may be key to success in delivering value in addition to product quality.

For healthcare projects in the UK, this includes statutory and guidance documents. Existing research indicates that they contain subjective requirements, which challenge the practical adoption of automated compliance checking, leading to limited outcomes. This paper aims to propose recommendations for the adoption of automated compliance checking in the design of healthcare buildings. Design Science Research was used to gain a detailed understanding of how information from existing regulatory requirements affects automation, through an empirical study in the design of a primary healthcare facility. In this study, a previously proposed taxonomy was implemented and refined, resulting in the identification of different types of subjective requirements. Based on empirical data emerging from the research, a set of recommendations was proposed focusing on the revision of regulatory documents, as well as to aid designers implementing automated compliance in practice.

Currently, performance simulation is mostly executed after the design stage and thus not integrated into design decision-making. In order to evaluate the dependencies of performance criteria on form, material and technical systems, building performance assessment has to be seamlessly integrated into the design process. In this approach, the capability of building information models to store multi-disciplinary information is utilized to access parameters necessary for performance calculations. In addition to the calculation of energy balances, the concept of exergy is used to evaluate the quality of energy sources, resulting in a higher flexibility of measures to optimize a building design. A prototypical tool integrated into a building information modelling software is described, enabling instantaneous energy and exergy calculations and the graphical visualisation of the resulting performance indices.

The model considers a knowledge representation, based on the function-behaviour-structure framework that increases the number of relations between the representation levels. With this model, the designer can explore and converge the design space by means of rules that connect the abstraction levels. The model begins the synthesis from any level of abstraction; it explores the knowledge by means of pop-up menus, which can be freely selected by the user and makes it possible to go back to higher levels of abstraction during the synthesis. The paper starts with a brief survey of some of the most significant functional synthesis models and the knowledge schemes used, and then it describes the proposed model and its application to a design case.

J	Reed, B				Reed, Bill			Shifting from 'sustainability' to regeneration	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction management; consumption; design process; mental models; sustainability; whole systems		Sustainability, as currently practised in the built environment, is primarily an exercise in efficiency. In otherwords, the use of environmental rating systems and other mechanisms allows a reduction in the damage caused by excessive resource use. However, instead of doing less damage to the environment, it is necessary to learn how one can participate with the environment by using the health of ecological systems as a basis for design. The shift from a fragmented to a whole systems model is the significant cultural leap that consumer society needs to make - through framing and understanding living system interrelationships in an integrated way. A place- based approach is one way to achieve this understanding. The design process begins by attempting to understand how the systems of life work in each unique place. The role of designers and stakeholders is to create a whole system of mutually beneficial relationships. By doing so, the potential for green design moves beyond sustaining the environment to one that can regenerate its health - as well as our own.

J	Cooper, I				Cooper, Ian			Winning hearts and minds or evidence-driven: which trajectory for regenerative design?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; design framework; design practices; regenerative design; sustainable building; sustainable development		The Building Research & Information special issue titled 'Regenerative Design and Development' (2012, volume 40, number 1) describes the emerging theory and practices for this field. This commentary reflects on the types of argumentation that are used to promote the regenerative design approach. Predominantly the papers seek to 'win hearts and minds' by presenting regenerative design as a virtuous activity that society should do - either altruistically for the sake of the planet or more selfishly to ensure that it continues to be inhabitable for our species. The effort required by the regenerative approach as described in the papers is enormous: to remake both the nature of professional services and wider society through our work as designers and developers. While regenerative design is still in its infancy, its theoreticians and practitioners need to establish its evidence base as quickly as possible. Without clear and overwhelming evidence of its benefits, it is unlikely that regenerative design will prove any more influential for mainstream policy and practice than sustainability has over the last two decades.

SPOT supports multidimensional data visualization including sun angle variations with diurnal and annual cycles in three-dimensional space. In SPOT, users can sketch on any surface in the 3D environment to indicate the area for simulation. SPOT then generates a spatial distribution representation of the illuminance level on a selected surface over time, rendered with colors of varied gradients. SPOT also enables designers to visualize the temporal information of light distribution over time for a given point.

The study enabled a research team to assist with refining an element of this building at design stage and monitor it in use. The element was the glass louvre itself within a system of automatically-controlled louvres that were intended to provide solar shading to reduce heat gains. Initially it was anticipated that a secondary set of blinds would be used to control glare. However in the revised brief, the primary louvred shading system was designed to perform both functions and also, if possible, aid the penetration of daylight into the inferior parts of the building. This paper considers some of the factors examined by the designers and describes a study undertaken by the researchers to investigate the shading devices using physical models. Comparisons are made between the conditions within the scale model and those experienced in the finished building. The implications of using scale models in future design studies are discussed.

A custom Grasshopper component library was developed in C# using the RhinoCommon SDK. The component allows for the voxelization of any three-dimensional shape into a set of identical finite elements and produces ready-to-use Input files for simulation in Abaqus. The main contribution of this work is providing an extensive, yet easy-to-use plugin to be used by both non-experts (e.g. architects and designers that are familiar with the parametric toolbox that is provided by Grasshopper) and more advanced users (that can experiment with the broad range of input parameters in an attempt to optimize their 3D prints). The core component generates input (.INP) files based on state-of-the art numerical methods for simulation of concrete printing.

Those are applied by the designers in the various disciplines for aesthetic purposes, relying on an intuitive and subjective process. Thus, numerical analysis of design visuals and disclosure of the aesthetic value embedded in them are considered as hard. However, it has become possible with emerging artificial intelligence technologies. This research aims at a neural network model, which recognizes and classifies the design principles over different domains. The domains include artwork produced since the late 20th century; professional photos; and facade pictures of contemporary buildings. The data collection and curation processes, including the production of computationally-based synthetic dataset, is genuine. The proposed model learns from the knowledge of myriads of original designs, by capturing the underlying shared patterns. It is expected to consolidate design processes by providing an aesthetic evaluation of the visual compositions with objectivity.

This leaves a lot to be desired especially in most developing countries which are now embracing environmental sustainability. This paper examines the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana within a case study (The Kumasi City Mall project). Thematic template analysis revealed designer?s own philosophy, request by clients, incentives for green designs, policies and regulation, and competitive advantage as the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. Furthermore, the results disclosed specific governmental role and social network utilization as drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. The outputs of this study offer strategies which are significant to the construction industry in embracing environmental sustainability. Further, the findings contribute to knowledge on achieving the sustainable development agenda.

Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive. Finally, three alternatives to the established automatic quantity take-off are discussed for future developments.

Schema for Interoperable Representation of Environmental and Social Costs in Highway Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							NOISE	Decision makers and designers have utilized various methods for quantifying the environmental and social impacts of highway projects. However, the definition of these impacts, their costs, and their estimation methods lack interoperability. A schema is proposed to support interoperable documentation of relevant knowledge related to the environmental and social costs (E&S) of highway projects. The schema identifies the E&S impacts associated with each project element, lists possible impacted entities, provides access and description to existing methods to estimate associated E&S costs, and provides links to best practices to mitigate such impacts. The schema was encoded into an extensible markup language. The schema was developed based on a synthesis of the different ways for cost estimation, cost estimates, and best practices for managing the E&S costs of highway construction. The schema was evaluated through interviews with domain experts and through analysis of three representative case studies. An interactive Web site was developed to support project teams establish a unified view of the costs, their estimates, and best practices to control them.	[El-Diraby, T.

Origins and probabilities of MEP and structural design clashes within a federated BIM model	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modelling; Clash detection; Probability density function; Cumulative distribution function; Generalized Gamma distribution; Log Logistic (3P) distribution	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; LIFE-CYCLE; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; SUSTAINABILITY; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; FUTURE	`Design clashes' encountered during the development of a large multi-storey educational building, awarded under a Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) Design and Build contract, are reported upon. The building was developed in Birmingham, UK and the contract value was circa 36 million (UK Sterling, 2015). Members of the project management team (PMT) produced designs that were subsequently integrated by the main contractor into a federated building information modelling (BIM) model; at this stage 404 error clashes were evident between the positions of the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) designer's and structural designer's building compartments. The contractor deemed that these particular clashes were 'mission critical' as previous experience suggested that project costs could spiral uncontrollably if left unabated. Participatory action research was employed to acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of the clash incidents. Clash data accrued (in mm) was subsequently quantitatively modelled using the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Two models produced were the Log Logistic Three Parameter (3P) (using all data including outliers) and Generalized Gamma distribution (excluding outliers). Both models satisfied Anderson Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests at a 0.01 and 0.02 levels of significance. Model parameters could be used to forecast similar clashes occurring on future projects and will prove invaluable to PMT members when accurately estimating the time and resource needed to integrate BIM designs. The predictive modelling revealed that 92.98% of clashes reside within the 30-299 mm range while the most probable occurrence of a clash overlap resides in a discrete category of 100-199 mm. Further qualitative investigation is also conducted to understand why these clashes occurred and propagate ideas about how such may be mitigated. The research concludes on two important points, namely: i) BIM is not a panacea to design related construction project rework and that innovative 21st century digital technologies are hampered by 20th century management practices; and ii) improvements in clash and error mitigation reside in a better understanding of tolerances specified to alleviate the erroneous task of resolving unnecessary clashes. Future research is proposed that seeks to: automate the clash detection management, analysis and resolution process; conduct further investigative analysis of the organizational and human resource management influences impacting upon design clash propagation; and devise and validate new procedural methods to mitigate clash occurrence using a real-life project.

The overall goal of Green Building Challenge '98 (GBC '98) was to develop, test and demonstrate an improved method for measuring building performance across a range of environmental and energy issues and then to inform the international community of scientists, designers, builders and clients about the results. 34 case study buildings from 14 countries were used to test and demonstrate this new method. As a second-generation method for assessing building performance, the GBC '98 assessment framework builds on the first generation systems developed in a number of countries. Unique to GBC '98 is the provision of an international framework capable of being adapted to national or regional circumstances. A description of the design goals and design features of the GBC '98 assessment method and GBTool is provided. Both the process and the product have served to stimulate critical debate about the scope and role of building environmental performance assessment and the actual design of green buildings.

However, current research focusing on the adoption of TC in the construction industry still follows a manual, time-consuming process. Improvement measures are heuristic and rely on the intuition of designers. This paper proposes a systematic framework, called target cost modeling (TCMd), for the application of TC in the construction industry to automatically generate a detailed project estimate based on a set of client requirements and a desired cost. It uses a three-level database to collect project data and generate a set of available alternatives. Value and compatibility studies govern the process of selecting among alternatives, and mathematical costing models calculate the cost accordingly. Finally, alternative value analysis improves the project value through the use of an optimization method, simulated annealing. TCMd is expected to efficiently improve project performance and enhance the design process while meeting a desired overall cost.

More attention needs to be given to creating a fully integrated design loop of digital architecture, where the gap between form in the virtual model and physical model is generally larger than it was in the pre-digital era due to the difficulty of the externalization of challenging forms via traditional methods. This study examines the significance of reciprocal relationships among different dimensions of design media including 2D drawings, digital models and physical models in design process. For a better understanding of the integrated design process, the characteristics and roles of these media are described particularly within the context of digital architecture. Three case studies of student work show a reconciled design conversation among three different types of media that contributed to the designer's haptic cognitive process offering not only visual serendipities but also suggestions on structure, material and assembly based on understanding the attribute's of each medium.

This study aims to redesign a virtual organisational structure for such projects. Two-pronged action research was adopted. The survey was to redesign the virtual organisational structure. The case study was to validate the virtual structure redesigned and conduct an in-depth description of the application of the virtual organisational structure on real prefabricated projects. The result shows that the virtual organization's core actors are client, general contractor, designer, and PC manufactory. The chain of command starts with the client, and ends with peripheral actors such as subcontractor elements. Meanwhile, prefabricated buildings that adopted the virtual organisational structure proposed are better managed and have better project performance than those that did not. This study contributes to the knowledge of the management for prefabricated buildings by showing that a virtual organisational structure needs to incorporate stakeholder salience attributes and stakeholder relationships.

This paper aims to establish the principles for regenerative construction project management (RCPM). The regenerative approach has been assimilated into the project management concept considering construction project management requirements of the regenerative constructions, their need to be kept alive and in harmony with their location adapting changes in technology throughout their entire life. The research reveals that the RCPM requires changes in the current construction project management with respect to: the feasibility and processes; designers', project managers' and communities' roles; scope, complexity and focus of construction project management; contracts; and supply chain and material industry. The RCPM concept introduced in this paper allows the introduction of new concepts. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge as it is the first preliminary study on the RCPM concept and its principles.

Multi-criteria evaluation model for the selection of sustainable materials for building projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building material selection; Sustainable criteria; Multi-criteria decision making; Analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy logic	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING; FUZZY AHP; PART 1; CRITERIA; INDICATORS; CONCRETE; WEIGHTS; SYSTEM; WASTE	Sustainable material selection represents an important strategy in building design. Current building materials selection methods fail to provide adequate solutions for two major issues: assessment based on sustainability principles, and the process of prioritizing and assigning weights to relevant assessment criteria. This paper proposes a building material selection model based on the fuzzy extended analytical hierarchy process (FEAHP) techniques, with a view to providing solutions for these two issues. Assessment criteria are identified based on sustainable triple bottom line (TBL) approach and the need of building stakeholders. A questionnaire survey of building experts is conducted to assess the relative importance of the criteria and aggregate them into six independent assessment factors. The FEAHP is used to prioritize and assign important weightings for the identified criteria. A numerical example, illustrating the implementation of the model is given. The proposed model provides guidance to building designers in selecting sustainable building materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automated generation of structural solutions based on spatial designs	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Structural design; Spatial design; Pattern recognition; Structural grammars; Finite element method	BUILDING DESIGN; FRAMEWORK; ELEMENT; MODEL	To aid in the understanding of design processes and to support the involved actors, a "Research Engine" (RE) is under development. The RE is a set of automated computational processes that simulate a spatial-structural design process. The first developed phase of the RE in which a Spatial Design is transformed into a Structural Solution is presented. It generates a structure, performs a structural analysis and provides an indication of its structural behavior. A case-study presents three building spatial designs which are used to generate 36 different structural solutions. A study of the influence of the transformations in the results is presented. For instance, structural zoning has a larger influence on the maximum displacements of the structural solutions than the amount of structural mass. Additionally, in design processes' early stages, this phase of the RE could help designers to devise different structural solutions and to quickly predict their structural behavior.

On this background, there is a need to conceptualize the buildings flexibility aspects into sustainability-led design. This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluate the flexibility level of buildings by introducing six selective criteria, which are implemented in a BIM environment by coupling Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Visual Programming Language (VPL) tools. The results show that it is possible to automatically calculate the flexibility of buildings during the design process phases. Therefore, the real-time iteration potential of the method provides information for the decision-making process as a means of guiding designers towards more flexible and sustainable design choices.

Rule-based systems incorporate heuristics for design evaluation that might be reasonable and valid for designers in stereotypical situations but inaccurate for others. A method for the prescriptive integration of the actual preferences of individual design engineers into the rule base is presented. The heuristics are analyzed to separate rules that reflect objective technical expertise from those that include assumptions as to preferences of the expert-system users. The preference rules are eliminated and dealt with in a more direct manner with multiattribute utility analysis. System performance is enhanced by increasing sensitivity to users' preferences without disturbing the original expert's objective knowledge. This approach leads to improved selections for a wider cross section of end users, without compromising system performance. The method is applied to the problem of material selection for automobile-bumper fascia, beam, and energy-absorber components.

In the literature, several definitions exist for an adaptive facade and many terminologies were introduced and used interchangeably. Therefore, this paper aims to distinguish the existing adaptive system typologies based on their key characteristics. In addition, a review based on a systematic search is conducted to outline possible design approaches towards non-conventional adaptive facades (AFs) through simulations at early stage of design. As the main research outcome, most of the studies evaluated indoor daylighting level and discomfort glare through parametric tools, while none of them proposed a specific control strategy to predict non-conventional adaptive facades' performance. These observations emphasize existing research gaps in this field that can affect the applicability of such facades in real practices.

J	Cole-Colander, C				Cole-Colander, C			Designing the customer experience	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						client; common language; customer focus; design; design quality		As the role of the professional changes, the importance of 'the client' and 'the user' is increasing. Two initiatives in the UK have sought to improve design quality by bridging the gap between the client and the user on the one hand, and the client and the designer on the other. These initiatives, 'Designing the Customer Experience' and 'Design Quality Indicators' (DQIs), seek to address the divergent goals and impenetrable language that often inhibit communication between client and architect. Designing the Customer Experience aimed at transferring design thinking from the retail sector and led to an Agenda for Change, which included an investigation into how to find a common language between clients and their design consultants. The DQIs build on this agenda and provide a tool for the uninitiated as well as the professional to allow each to express and evaluate the design quality of a building. The extent to which these initiatives have been and potentially can be successful in changing professional relationships with client and user and so improving design quality is assessed.

Design Error Costs in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Designers; Errors; Costs; Procurement method; Project type	PROCUREMENT; REWORK; MANAGEMENT	Design errors can adversely influence project performance and can contribute to failures, accidents, and loss of life. Although there has been a considerable amount of research that has examined design error causation, little is known about design error costs. With increasing emphasis placed on the use of nontraditional forms of procurement methods as a result of various government reports and the advent of Building Information Modelling there is a general perception that design error costs will be significantly less than those projects procured by traditional means. By using a questionnaire survey, estimates for design error costs were obtained from 139 projects. The mean direct and indirect costs for design errors were revealed to be 6.85 and 7.36% of contract value, respectively. Design error costs were found not to significantly vary with procurement method and project type used. Although the research provides invaluable insights into practitioners' perceptions of design errors costs, their actual costs remain relatively unexplored. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000454.

Recent advances in computational architecture have permitted to automate the fabrication and assembly of such structures using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and industrial robotic arms. While several large-scale demonstrators have been realized, most developed algorithms are closed-source or project-oriented. The lack of a general framework makes it difficult for architects, engineers and designers to effectively manipulate this innovative construction system. Therefore, this research aims at developing a holistic design tool targeting a wide range of architectural applications. Main achievements include: (1) a new data structure to deal with modular assemblies, (2) an analytical parametrization of the geometry of five timber joints, (3) a method to generate CNC toolpath while integrating fabrication constraints, and (4) a method to automatically compute robot trajectories for a given stack of timber plates.

Performance prediction metamodels can help to overcome this issue and serve as an investigation tool in the early design stage. This paper describes the development and validation of a tool to integrate building information models (BIMs) and a previously developed metamodel to predict the thermal load of dwellings through gbXML. The results obtained show the feasibility of developing the proposed tool. However, inconsistencies between gbXML files from different BIM authoring tools were observed. There was a need for manual adjustments to the building information models before export to gbXML. This finding reinforces the need for the standardized implementation of exportation tools for open interoperability formats by software manufacturers. It also indicates the possibility for the future use of this tool to support the Brazilian energy labeling certification process and assist building designers in the early design stage.	[Bracht, M.

BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						energy efficiency; homeowners; housing; low carbon; retrofit; water; water conservation; water-energy nexus	SYSTEMS; POLICY	Rising carbon and water footprints of housing present a significant policy challenge across the Westernized world, and this has led to a growing range of government policies and programmes designed to promote greater residential energy and water efficiency. An analysis of low carbon/energy renovations is presented based on interviews with homeowner renovators and project managers in Australia. The renovators included self-declared green renovators' and other, more typical general' renovators. The project managers included a range of builders, designers, coordinators and retrofitters who provided specialized low carbon/water renovation services. Using the idea of niches and multilayer perspective (MLP), the analysis reveals both the limits to government initiatives promoting low carbon/water renovations and the importance of aspirations and relations in the low carbon/water housing renovation niche. The use of deep enquiry using semi-structured interviews reveals a detailed picture of these relations that cross the supply' and demand' sides of housing renovation. These relations reveal interdependence and tensions that profoundly shape low carbon/water renovations. Such relations should be explicitly accounted for in the design of government programmes and regulations.

Analysis of construction projects by means of value curves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project; Construction; Strategy canvas; Value curve; Stakeholders	DESIGN; INNOVATION	The present work analyzes the expectations and relationships of the three key stakeholders involved in the construction project management process: the construction Promoter (the company that finances, owns and represents the interests of the client), the project designers (the company that elaborates the construction project) and the builder (the company that executes the construction project). In this article we propose an analysis of the project stakeholders' expectations using the strategy canvas tool (a graphical model that uses value curves as a way of measuring the evaluation of the key factors involved in the design of the construction project document). The analysis aims to provide evidence on the phases, characteristics and documents of the construction project design and management process better rated by the agents involved in the process. The analysis of the value curves will provide evidence on deficiencies in the elaboration of the construction project document and will allow us to propose some solutions for certain situations.

J	Kim, DY; Kim, SA				Kim, Do-Young; Kim, Sung-Ah			An exploratory model on the usability of a prototyping-process for designing of Smart Building Envelopes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Virtual Model (VM); Smart Physical Model (SPM); Smart Building Envelope (SBE); Prototyping; Sketch		The Smart Building Envelope (SBE) is an interactive system which is adaptive to environmental conditions by transforming its shape and functions. The success of the SBE depends on elaborate interactions among the various building components. The acutely challenging issue is to design the SBE not only to satisfy multidisciplinary requirements but also to orchestrate the technical functions of components. The research objective is to propose an exploratory model on the usability of a prototyping process for SBE design. So the research is related to the conceptualization of the prototyping process model based on complementary use of the Virtual Model (VM) and Smart Physical Model (SPM). The conceptual prototyping process model is appropriate for consideration of the characteristics of the architectural design, the resources of the educational environment and the limitations of the novice designer. Furthermore, the prototyping process model in this research will help in the formulation of guidelines for the educational process, which in turn will help not merely to make intricate engineering products but also to introduce observed results into the architectural design process.

This paper outlines the results of 14 case studies where designers and their clients used one or more techniques chosen from a portfolio of ten to evaluate their buildings or processes at any stage in the life cycle of a project. It is revealed that considerable value could be obtained for relatively low effort, helping to improve both the performance of the building concerned and the skills and insights of the participants; and that there was value in using established techniques that were robust, cost-effective and had benchmarks available where appropriate. It proved easier to undertake a survey than to get people together to discuss their experience. However, after the procurement process had started, it proved difficult to incorporate feedback, because everyone was already committed to a particular mode of operation.

J	He, TF; Zhang, JP; Lin, JR; Li, YG				He, Tianfeng; Zhang, Jianping; Lin, Jiarui; Li, Yungui			Multiaspect Similarity Evaluation of BIM-Based Standard Dwelling Units for Residential Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Residential design; Standard dwelling unit; Similarity evaluation; Building information model	SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM DETECTION; MAXIMUM OVERLAP; COMMON SUBGRAPH; GRAPH; POLYGONS; TRANSLATION; MODELS	The standard dwelling unit (SDU) has been adopted to standardize dwelling units and to reuse them in residential design, especially in the floor-plan design of multifloor buildings. However, conventional attribute-based search methods fail to represent important features, such as topology and shape, making it difficult to fully utilize the previously obtained information. Because building information models (BIMs) are replacing drawings and documents in storing and managing SDUs, this paper proposes a multiaspect similarity evaluation method to provide a more comprehensive way to search SDUs in residential design. The proposed approach introduced six similarities and their corresponding evaluation methods from the aspects of attribute, topology, and shape. Furthermore, a combined similarity was proposed to combine different similarities to reflect designers' search intentions. Finally, a database with 170 SDUs and a prototype design tool were developed and tested in two projects. The application showed that the proposed method is capable of evaluating the similarity of SDUs in a more comprehensive manner and increasing the efficiency and quality of the search for SDU alternatives in the residential design process.

This paper summarizes and synthesizes the results of a research program to increase understanding and effectiveness of two key construction engineering focus areas: integration of project activities, and increasing innovation. Key findings related to project integration include planning activities to improve constructability and foster use of major construction methods. The integration research also included identifying constructability knowledge and using project models to increase its availability for designers. The second main theme of the research is process and product innovation. This investigation used case studies of innovative projects to identify major differences. This increased understanding led to overall findings regarding innovative design and construction organizations and projects and to highlight recommendations for practical applications to increase the scope and rate of innovation in practice. Both parts of the paper contribute to the core body of knowledge regarding construction engineering activities and their vital role in improving project performance in meeting cost, schedule, safety, quality, and sustainability objectives.

The present work analyses the effect that these sources have on the stress reduction of patients' companions in a paediatric service. A two-phase study was carried out. During the first phase, 120 participants assessed 20 waiting rooms in situ in order to select the environmental sources with the greatest effect. During the second phase, the stress levels of 26 participants were measured in four simulated waiting rooms that combined the selected sources from the first phase. A multisensory simulation was carried out through a virtual reality experiment with visual, auditory and olfactory elements, and stress levels were measured at the psychological and neurophysiological levels. Results suggest that a combination of environmental satisfaction sources creates an important synergistic effect at the psychological and neurophysiological levels and underlines the importance of auditory and olfactory stimuli. Conclusions may be of interest to designers and managers of healthcare facilities.

J	Johnson, HM; Singh, A				Johnson, HM; Singh, A			The personality of civil engineers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The civil engineering umbrella encompasses many different disciplines-from construction management to water resources management, and everything in between. Consequently, in civil engineering organizations nationwide, often there is conflict and infighting among the various disciplines. Perhaps this could be attributable to differences in the ways these disciplines see their world. This paper uses a modified Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to determine the personality types of construction engineers and design engineers at a State Public Agency. The results indicate that the construction and design engineers share similar predominant personality traits. They are predominantly introverted, preferring to focus their energy on the internal world of ideas and possibilities. They prefer to gather their facts using their senses, and are predisposed to facts and figures. When making decisions, they prefer to forego pure logic, relying instead on personal and organizational values. Finally, they show a slight preference for a structured environment. The greatest differences between the construction and design engineers were found in their preferences for decision making. Although both disciplines preferred using their values in decision making rather than pure logic, the designers chose value-oriented responses more frequently than did the construction engineers. Possible reasons for similarities and differences are discussed.

However, such tools still have much room for improvement: manual input of thermal properties of a building material; input of incorrect data; and semantic conflicts between building designers and engineers. This research proposes a semantic material name matching system to find a standardized material name and its associated material property values, and enter them into a BEA tool. The core of our approach is to define ontologies capturing the concepts associated with the standard materials and their property values that are required by BEA tools. The proposed system uses an IFCXML file of a building information model as a source of input data, captures material data in the files, and automates the process of material property input. Using the proposed system, engineers will be able to increase their efficiency in entering required data into BEA tools and to reduce the possibility of erroneous data input. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Seo, JW; Choi, HH				Seo, J.

Presently, however, designers typically are not involved in construction safety. They are often uncertain of their responsibilities in relation to construction safety and fail to be responsible for avoiding or reducing safety-related risks. In this study, the concept of safety impact assessment to achieve "design-for-safety" in the design phase is introduced. For this purpose, a safety impact assessment model was devised, and a methodology using the risk-based safety impact assessment approach for open-cut type underground construction projects in Korea is suggested. The suggested methodology includes a safety information survey, classification of safety impact factors caused by design and construction, and quantitative estimation of magnitude and frequency of safety impact factors. A checklist which can be easily used for assessing the safety performance of design products is also proposed. A real-world case study on the safety impact assessment of a subway construction project in Korea is also provided in the paper.	[Seo, J.

Traditional simplified design tools are typically too limited to be of much use, even in conceptual design. The proposal is to provide access to the power of detailed simulation tools at a stage in design when little is known about the final building, but at a stage also when the freedom to explore options is greatest and the ability to improve the design is greatest. The concept of the building performance sketch forms the basis of the proposed design tool. It was derived from consultation with design analysis teams as part of the development of the COMFEN tool for fenestration design. Tools like COMFEN are explored to understand how they were shaped by consultation and how requests from these teams for real-world relevance might shape such tools in the future. The simulation process can effectively utilize some of the as-built, as-occupied and as-managed lessons on behaviours and technical outcomes from the Post-occupancy Evaluation (PoE) of buildings.

It has been adopted in the regulatory framework for H&S in the UK construction industry through the Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015 (CDM 2015) which place on the project client obligations with emphasis on coordination of H&S at the pre-construction stage of the project by a client-appointed 'Principal Designer' (PD). Unfortunately, research into the implementation of CDM 2015 into actual practice at the pre-construction stage has been patchy. The paper reports, with respect to the PD role, on part of research undertaken to respond to this gap. It involved surveys of clients and practitioners via fourteen focus group discussion sessions with over eighty participants to develop knowledge and understanding of the PD role. The research issues included: appointments to the role; structures for discharge of the role; day-to-day functions of the PD; remuneration arrangements; and common challenges regarding the PD.

J	Lai, HH; Deng, XY; Chang, TYP				Lai, Huahui; Deng, Xueyuan; Chang, Tse-Yung P.			BIM-Based Platform for Collaborative Building Design and Project Management	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							INFORMATION; INTEROPERABILITY; GENERATION; ENVIRONMENT; SUPPORT; SERVER; SYSTEM	The use of building information modeling (BIM) in large building systems in conjunction with team-effort collaborative design perhaps represents one of the most useful approaches in achieving cost-effectiveness as well as high-quality design results. Nevertheless, the major difficulty in using this technology lies in data exchanges when designers from different professions employ heterogeneous design tools. In this paper, a diagnosis of the major difficulties in data exchange among various design tools, particularly for collaborative design, is given. Subsequently, a BIM-based platform is proposed for collaborative design and project management to resolve data interoperability problems; thus, one can handle data exchange between different software tools in a streamlined fashion. The platform consists of a BIM-based database and five data-processing engines to facilitate the tasks involved in collaborative design. The platform is capable of handling BIM-based data from multiple design tools; yet it is generic enough to accept almost any design-related software tool. Finally, a multistory library building is used to illustrate various aspects of data processing involved in the stated collaborative design and project management.

Traditional practice is rather unproductive, involving the work of several different trades crowded in situ and delivered sequentially one after another. To enhance productivity in IDC, offsite practice is receiving increasing attention as a process innovation along with Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA), an emerging concept in the industry. This paper aims to investigate offsite IDC practice and develop a set of DfMA enablers for better achieving this building process. It undertakes a literature review, case study, and 18 semi-structured interviews. To support the offsite IDC and its production line, standardized procedure, automated machinery, and supply chain, 10 DfMA enablers are adopted, such as early collaboration, design standardization and simplification, and light material selection. These findings indicate a paradigm shift not only in interior design methodology but also in IDC professional practice process. This research enriches the literature on DfMA and IDC, in particular their synergy, and offers a new model for interior designers and offsite IDC practitioners.

The calculations were carried out on the energy efficiency class of the building and the geographic area of the construction. On the basis of the results, a simple payback time was calculated. The main aim - thermal transmittance coefficients of soil touching partitions must satisfy the normative value of technical construction regulation and European standards. The research object of the study is relationships between the thickness of a thermoinsulation layer of the typical floor-on-soil sample and its simple payback time. Lithuania was chosen as the geographic area of the research. Calculations were carried out for seven towns: Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys, Utena, and Dukstas. The test result - developed correlation functions. Correlation analysis results are important not only for designers making decisions during the pre-design stage, but also for energy consumption auditors and experts.

J	Yan, W; Culp, C; Graf, R				Yan, Wei; Culp, Charles; Graf, Robert			Integrating BIM and gaming for real-time interactive architectural visualization	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Gaming; Building Information Modelling; BIM; Visualization; Interoperability		This paper presents our findings of current applications of computer games in design visualization and education, and our solution to address interoperability between games and building models to enhance architectural visualization and education. We demonstrate our BIM-Game prototype that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) and gaming into architectural visualization. Our system supports an innovative Design-Play process that allows designers to play in their own designed environments with the capability for simulations of physical dynamics and user activities. The implementation of this BIM-Game provides a variety of connections among several fields including architecture, engineering, computer science, visualization, and game development. These connections bridge diverse areas such as building modelling, equipment simulation and visualization, character modelling and animation, collision detection, navigation, path planning, materials and lighting, and interaction through game controllers and user interfaces. The paper presents a framework for integrating BIM and games, and a sample experiment of real-time, interactive, and photorealistic walkthrough with a virtual user model to demonstrate the use and the potentials of the framework. We expect this research to extend the study and adaptability of computer games in design education. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little research has been done to characterize the nature and extent of the potential impact of the occupant on energy consumption. Energy models typically assume deterministic loads and schedules to represent occupancy and provide singular estimates of energy consumption. This paper investigates uncertainties introduced by occupant behavior by exploring the impacts of high and low comparisons on the energy performance of buildings through parametric simulation of commercial and residential buildings in two climates. The results suggest that variant occupant behavior can impact annual energy usage on the order of magnitude of 75% in residential buildings (peak load varying by 65%) and 150% for commercial buildings (peak load varying by 140%), with modest variations across climates. Although further and more sophisticated experiments are necessary, the contributions of this paper include a simple process model for assessing, through simulation, the role of the occupant on energy consumption and demonstration data about the type and magnitude of impacts that occupants can have in residential and commercial buildings across climates.

This paper reports a study on the features of ADR based on interviews with practitioners who have experience with using ADR in construction projects with a contract sum in excess of $HK10 million. The interviews were conducted with 20 accredited mediators/arbitrators of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center (representing the neutrals) and 42 construction practitioners (representing the users). A total of 19 key features, identified and categorized in four categories-nature, neutral, settlement, and benefits-were prioritized according to their relative importance by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The inconsistency ratio of the AHP helped ensure the reliability of the ranking scores mathematically. Six of the top eight features as ranked by the neutrals and the users are common to both groups. These are preservation of business relationship, enforceability, neutrality, cost to obtain, speed to obtain, and fairness. These suggest that the neutrals and users have similar expectations from ADR processes. The ranking also assists ADR process designers to focus on the fundamentals and avoid overly complicated processes.

J	Gardiner, PD; Simmons, JEL				Gardiner, PD; Simmons, JEL			Conflict in small- and medium-sized projects: Case of partnering to the rescue	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								It is well known that project and other temporary organizations have special characteristics that can result in a higher incidence of dysfunctional conflict than their ongoing organizational counterparts. In this paper, qualitative data collected from a selection of retrospective UK-based construction projects of between approximately $2,000,000 and $8,000,000 show that the occurrence and effect of dysfunctional conflicts in projects remain a cause for concern despite changes in project management organization design. This paper provides a brief review of the more important mechanisms leading to dysfunctional conflict within these projects and illustrates the important role of people rather than procedures or systems in this process. In a later section of the paper, examples are drawn from one case in particular where interorganizational team building was included as a component of project organization design. The outcome of this case is consistent with the hypothesis that interorganizational team building, whether acknowledged as part of a formal partnering arrangement or not, can be used at the start of small-and medium-sized construction projects to reduce conditions of latent conflict and help engender a culture of cooperation and conflict resolution between the client, designers, utilities, and construction organizations.

Performative design environment for kinetic photovoltaic architecture	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Kinetic architecture; Multi-functional envelope; Parametric design; Adaptive shading; Performative design	ENERGY-SYSTEMS; CHALLENGES; MODEL	The design of complex architectural components such as kinetic architectural elements poses a challenge due to the multiple technological branches involved. This paper presents a performative design environment that combines the branches of structural and energy engineering, control, industrial design, and architecture. The methodology is applied in the context of the Adaptive Solar Facade, a kinetic photovoltaic shading system for the HiLo building in Duebendorf, Switzerland. The authors describe how the environment enables the user to design the form of the facade, get feedback on its structural strength, analyse the energetic performance of the interior space, conduct a daylighting analysis, render images, and produce fabrication plans for a rapid design process. With the parametric design environment, project meetings transform from information exchanges to design sessions where all stakeholders can collaboratively influence the design and see immediate results. What would normally take a month, was condensed to just a few hours. Ultimately, this paper extends the field of performative design by presenting a practical example where a system as complex as a kinetic photovoltaic envelope can be designed, prototyped, and fabricated by a small team of four designers.

The degree of vibration comfort for people has an important effect on the functionality of grandstands. In this paper, the changes of the dynamic properties of the stand owing to different human postures are demonstrated. The comfort degree for human vibration in the large stand is also examined by full-scale measurements and questionnaire surveys. In addition, the analysis of the influence of different parameters on acceleration responses of the stand is presented via numerical simulation. Thereafter, it has been observed that ISO10137-2007 and BS6472 are more suitable than GB10070 and AISC-11 for evaluating vibration serviceability owing to crowd jumping loads during football matches in the large grandstand environment. Moreover, it has been observed that females and the staff are more likely to feel uncomfortable during matches, whilst students younger than 30 years old are the least sensitive group to vibrations of large stands. When the frequency of the jumping loads is close to the fundamental frequency of the stand or the synergy rate is high, the resonance is more likely to occur, which should be avoided by designers and users.

The contextual analysis of the conventional jewellery production systems indicates that the separation of knowledge leads the consequence and the problems of partial representation. In order to study how the tacit-format attributes, which were separately contributed by the jewellery designers and goldsmith, can be extracted, recaptured, recorded, integrated and finally coded into CAD database, a project of scanning a hand-crafted 3D object was initiated and implemented. The successful result of the tested project not only demonstrates the feasibility of codification of tacit knowledge in design representation, but also gives a strong theoretical foundation of the extendibility of both tacit and coded knowledge in a design perspective.

J	Burry, M; Coulson, J; Preston, J; Rutherford, E				Burry, M; Coulson, J; Preston, J; Rutherford, E			Computer-aided design decision support: interfacing knowledge and information	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						information systems; knowledge-based systems; metadata schema		Computer-aided design decision support has proved to be an elusive and intangible project for many researchers as they seek to encapsulate information and knowledge-based systems as useful multifunctional data structures. Definitions of 'knowledge', 'information', 'facts', and 'data' become semantic footballs in the struggle to identify what designers actually do, and what level of support would suit them best, and how that support might be offered. The Construction Primer is a database-drivable interactive multimedia environment that provides readily updated access to many levels of information aimed to suit students and practitioners alike. This is hardly a novelty in itself. The innovative interface and metadata structures, however, combine with the willingness of national building control legislators, standards authorities, materials producers, building research organisations, and specification services to make the Construction Primer a Versatile design decision support vehicle. It is both compatible with most working methodologies while remaining reasonably future-proof. This paper describes the structure of the project and highlights the importance of sound planning and strict adhesion to library-standard metadata protocols as a means to avoid the support becoming too specific or too paradigmatic.

Their decisions reflect their different perspectives of a project and these different perspectives typically lead to many conflicts. These conflicts, if not resolved early, create more expensive designs, delays in the design-construction process, and compromises in the final product. This paper presents research on the representation, use, and communication of design rationale for conflict mitigation in a collaborative environment. This research is based on the view that: (1) The designers' perspectives are expressed in their design rationale; (2) a system for capturing the design rationale needs to represent and manage design intent evolution, artifact evolution, and relationships between intents and between intent and artifact; (3) a design rationale system needs to capture its information in a nonintrusive manner by providing part of the design rationale; and (4) a system for conflict mitigation needs to provide active computer support for the negotiation between multiple participants. Based on these requirements, this paper proposes ''Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM)'' as an ontology for design rationale and ''SHARED-Design Recommendation and Intent Management System (SHARED-DRIMS)'' as a system for conflict mitigation based on this ontology.

In spite of this, designers, builders and sometimes even procuring clients do not engage closely with the performance of the buildings they have created. Hence, low-level, chronic problems tend to persist, innovations miss their targets, and true successes may be overlooked - even in some of the best buildings, as the Probe series of post-occupancy surveys revealed. This paper discusses how feedback, follow through from design and construction into occupancy, and post-occupancy evaluation could become a natural part of project delivery, and how this could improve the quality and sustainability of our buildings. It describes progress made since the Probe series of post-occupancy ended in encouraging the use of feedback, including a portfolio of established techniques, development of the Soft Landings technique, and setting up a charity to promote and support feedback. The results of tests with a user group are also discussed.

Although stiff competition exists between construction firms, corporatist arrangements have developed in The Netherlands to reduce high costs and risks to individual firms. The implications and benefits of these corporatist arrangements for research and development, employment, training and housing investment are assessed and concluded to provide well-balanced market competition and regulation while maintaining long-term needs. The relationships between the many parties in the construction process (clients, investors, contractors, suppliers, designers and regulatory authorities) are analysed. A particular area in which corporatist arrangements have predominated is in tendering for public works, where there is a tradition of price-ringing on the grounds that this reduces transaction costs and favours social solidarity. However, the European Commission has banned such arrangements on competition grounds. The Dutch construction industry's attempts to reform tendering arrangements on a more competitive basis, while retaining the valued aspects of the poldermodel are assessed.

The capability of ML to provide a fast and accurate prediction of energy loads makes it an ideal tool for decision-making tasks related to sustainable design and retrofit planning. However, the accuracy of these ML models is dependent on the selection of the right hyper-parameters for a specific building dataset. This paper proposes a method for optimising ML models for forecasting both heating and cooling loads. The technique employs multi-objective optimisation with evolutionary algorithms to search the space of possible parameters. The proposed approach not only tunes single model to precisely predict building energy loads but also accelerates the process of model optimisation. The study utilises simulated building energy data generated in EnergyPlus to validate the proposed method, and compares the outcomes with the regular ML tuning procedure (i.e. grid search).

However, designers struggle at times to apply the different BIM-tools. In order to understand this disjoint, it is necessary to understand first the existing practices of different specialists in the building design process in order to improve future development and implementation of BIM. The aim of this article is to investigate the consequences of using BIM-tools in a collaborative building design setting consisting of different specialists. A case study was carried out to trace when BIM-tools were used (or not) in an inter-organizational design process of a naval rescue station in Denmark. The design process was holistically examined through the lens of Activity Theory which is an analytical framework. Five key findings were identified: the mediating role of 3D visuals, real-world coupling with point cloud, rule-breaking to ensure design completion, inability to integrate BIM-analysis into the design and the use of heuristics to form and choose among design solutions.

J	Lu, P; Qian, LM; Chu, ZF; Xu, XY				Lu, Ping; Qian, Lamei; Chu, Zhaofang; Xu, Xiaoyan			Role of Opportunism and Trust in Construction Projects: Empirical Evidence from China	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Opportunism; Trust; Project success; External uncertainty; Complexity	INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS; MANAGEMENT; MARKET; PERFORMANCE; COMPLEXITY; MECHANISM; FRAMEWORK; RISK	Project success is the ultimate goal for all projects, and doubts often arise about what actually determines project success. On the basis of the transaction cost exchange (TCE) and relational exchange theory (RET), this study proposes that opportunism and trust coexist and work together to affect project success. External uncertainty, complexity, and cooperation duration are the variables that are considered in the specific construction context. Using primary data collected from 225 owners, contractors, designers, and supervisors in China's construction industry, the empirical analysis shows that the negative opportunism and the positive trust counteract each other and affect the project success. Their relationships are influenced by the level of external uncertainty, but not by the level of complexity. In particular, the results also demonstrate that opportunism affects project performance through a mediating process, and the effects of opportunism and trust differ under varying cooperation durations. Based on a more comprehensive model, this study empirically addresses the importance of the two mechanisms of restraining opportunism and developing trust in the construction industry.

Interpreted Information Exchange: Systematic Approach for BIM to Engineering Analysis Information Transformations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling; Interpreted information exchange; Engineering design and analysis models; Model view definition; Interoperability; Industry Foundation Classes	MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN	Transforming a building information model to an engineering analytical model is tedious and time consuming. With the current state of interoperability, after importing the building information model, the designer makes extensive modifications to prepare the model for analysis. This issue could be addressed by automating the model transformation process. In this paper, an automated interpretation mechanism referred to as interpreted information exchange (IIE) is presented and compared with the conventional direct information exchange (DIE). Moreover, a methodology is proposed for design and standardization of this type of information exchange to facilitate its implementation. Subsequently, application of IIE for engineering analyses is illustrated by explaining and validating a case study platform developed for interpreting the structural analytical model from the architectural model. Furthermore, based on the experience gained as a result of developing this tool, the considerations that need to be taken in the design of an IIE process are specified. Finally, the paper suggests how IIE can facilitate using building information modeling (BIM) for engineering modeling purposes.

The selection of appropriate design variables and objective functions are essential elements in the optimization process. However, the existing methodologies seem to be too complicated and designers seek to use simplified methods in order to evaluate the overall performance of the buildings. The advancement of information technology enables the use of Building Information Modelling and energy simulation tools for the integrated building design in an early stage. Thus, this article introduces a new evaluation method for analysis of the effective solution of the building performance and aims at determining the influence of a complex criteria (construction duration, construction cost, annual bill-based costs, annual primary energy demand, annual CO2 emissions of energy use, CO2 emissions of construction materials and works, thermal comfort) for the final decision making. The findings of the article have confirmed that the high level of the building energy efficiency is not directly proportional to the overall investments, i.e. additional investments do not bring benefits from economic and environmental points of view.

Regulation information is an important factor for initial architectural design evaluations. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated system that designers and owners can check the evacuation regulation compliance of BIM data. In this study, the scope of applied regulation information is confined to evacuation regulation, as high-rise and complex building design has high priority and is critical on adequate disaster prevention systems and egress routes. To achieve this purpose, the authors have investigated case studies of BIM-based regulation checking process and illustrated the possible mechanism for the process through evacuation regulation analysis. Based on the presented methodology and scenario of the proposed automated evacuation regulation checking system, the authors developed a prototypical system, called InSightBIM-Evacuation.

This paper describes ongoing research on the constructability of such structures using planar quadrilateral glass facets for the Jerusalem Museum of Tolerance project by Gehry Partners, in collaboration with Schlaich Bergermann & Partners, engineers. The challenge here lies not only in the development of a geometric strategy for generating quadrilateral planar facet solutions, but also in the fact that said solutions must closely match the designs created initially in physical model form by the architects. We describe a simple but robust geometric method for achieving the structure by incorporating the necessary geometric principles into a computational parametric framework using the CATIA Version 5 system. This generative system consists of a hierarchical set of geometric 'control elements' that drive the design toward constructible configurations. Optimization techniques for approximating the generated structural shape to the original created by the designers are also described. The paper presents the underlying geometric principles to the strategy and the resulting computational approach. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An important issue associated with design-build delivery is the procurement method used to select the design-build team. It is a critical decision that involves several key project team members, including the owner, designer, and contractor organizations, and requires the owner to carefully choose the design-build procurement method that will be used to select the team that will deliver the project. This research quantitatively analyzed the correlation between the design-build procurement method and the performance of the design-build project with regard to cost, time, and quality metrics. The procurement methods studied were sole source, qualifications-based, best value, and low bid selection. Data were collected through surveys from 76 design-build projects in the United States. Based on the patterns and relationships identified from these data, a better understanding of the procurement process and how it influences project performance is achieved. The impact of project-specific factors and guidelines are presented to assist owners in selecting the design-build team procurement method that responds to their project goals.

Mail questionnaires are one commonly used method to survey user preferences. Research methods which increase response rates and quality of mail surveys can help result in the design of products that more accurately reflect market needs. This study examines the effect of a nominal monetary gift and different contacting approaches on mail survey response rates among a population of engineers. The study found that the inclusion of a nominal monetary gift had a dramatic effect on survey response rates among engineers. Precontact with targeted firms was also found to increase survey response rates. Additionally, this research found differences in the response rates between direct precontact of subjects in target firms versus indirect contact of engineers who were referred as CAD experts in their firms. These referrals were found more likely to answer difficult survey questions and much more likely to volunteer to participate in follow-up qualitative research. Identification of this group of qualified referrals may be useful for design teams working on new, technologically advanced products.

To assist them, a full year, climate-based daylighting simulation method, called Lightsolve, was developed, providing design guidance regarding daylight performance by combining temporal performance visualization over the year with spatial renderings. This paper focuses on the user's perspective for Lightsolve. After a summary of its foundational concepts, it discusses the results of several user studies conducted in educational contexts. As a core element of the paper, the results of an original, design-oriented user study on Lightsolve's expert system are discussed, conducted to determine how well its decision-making algorithm would work when independent human interactions were included. It demonstrated that the expert system shows a high educational potential and is generally successful as a performance-driven design guidance tool, respectful of its non-deterministic nature.

Improved System for Modeling and Simulating Stadium Evacuation Plans	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Evacuation plans; Multiagent simulations; Algorithm; 3D spatial models; Total evacuation time	CROWD	Under the circumstances of natural disasters or anthropogenic hazards, the crowd inside large-occupancy facilities needs to be evacuated. The goal of evacuation plans is to safely evacuate a crowd as fast as possible. But there is need for an accurate estimate of the total evacuation time and bottleneck occurrences. This study presents an innovative simulation methodology and algorithm with modified parameters intended to improve the simulation and analysis of the evacuations methods used in stadiums. The evacuation simulations are categorized according to the types of emergent situations and the number of evacuees. Each simulation is validated based on real-time data collected through observations and published literature. Dijkstra's algorithm is reconstructed using modified parameters, i.e., revised triangular distribution and normal distribution for walking speeds and empirical distribution for crowd behaviors. The simulation results demonstrate that the P-values of the system with normal distribution will yield statistically better equivalencies than those of triangular distribution. The results will help designers in analyzing evacuation design with enhanced confidence in total evacuation time and bottleneck prediction. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

On the contrary, BWIM analysis on road bridges are more scarce and therefore, this work intends to provide a contribution by presenting the BWIM analysis performed on two major road bridges in Portugal - Leziria Bridge and Pinhao Bridge. These bridges are equipped with electric and optical strain gauges, acquisition systems with features that allow high sampling rates. Based on the collected data and focussing on the bridges' lifetime, a probabilistic approach to quantify extreme traffic loads was implemented using extreme distribution functions. The bridges' behaviour to these extreme traffic loads is numerically evaluated and a comparison with the alarm levels established by the bridge designers is performed. Although the bridge's safety is not compromised, it was concluded that the representativeness of the observation period is a critical issue and the analysis of this kind of results must be carefully considered. A comprehensive discussion about this matter is carried out at the end of this work.	[Sousa, Helder; Costa, Bruno J.

The simulation of an office module in a three-storey university building in South Eastern Australia is described. The module, located at the north-west corner of the top floor of the building, was chosen because it was likely to have the highest cooling load - a primary concern of energy-conscious designers of commercial buildings for most parts of the country. The simulation process identified the major influences on thermal performance against a base case. This enabled changes in materials and construction, as well as basic design concepts, to be evaluated. Features incorporated into the base case such as a metal roof and glazed walkway had an adverse influence on energy consumption, and were consequently rejected in preference for an improved design that included a hypocaust slab system on the roof of the office module. The final design was predicted to reduce the annual energy consumption for heating and cooling by 72 and 76%, respectively, which suggests the added value to the design process from advanced modelling and simulation.

J	Cao, DP; Li, H; Wang, GB; Huang, T				Cao, Dongping; Li, Heng; Wang, Guangbin; Huang, Ting			Identifying and contextualising the motivations for BIM implementation in construction projects: An empirical study in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modelling (BIM); Institutional theory; Innovation diffusion; Innovation implementation motivations; Construction projects	TQM ADOPTION; DIFFUSION; ANTECEDENTS; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; ORGANIZATIONS; INNOVATIONS; LEGITIMACY; INDUSTRY; MOTIVES	Grounded in institutional theory and the innovation diffusion literature, this paper identifies the motivations of designers and general contractors to implement BIM in construction projects, and investigates how different motivations are impacted by organisational BIM capability and other contextual factors. Results of factor analysis with survey data collected from China provide support for the theoretically developed motivation model which classifies BIM implementation motivations into four categories: image motives, reactive motives, project-based economic motives, cross-project economic motives. Hierarchical regression results suggest that although project participants will have stronger economic motivations to improve project performances as their BIM capability matures, this increase in economic motivations does not necessarily require a parallel decrease of desires to improve social image. Regression results also suggest that BIM implementation motivations relate to organisational ownership type and project characteristics. The findings contribute to a broadened understanding of the multi-dimensionality and dynamics of construction organisations' innovation implementation motivations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mang, P; Reed, B				Mang, Pamela; Reed, Bill			Designing from place: a regenerative framework and methodology	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						living systems; permaculture; place; regenerative development and design; story		The radical changes required for Earth to 'remain fit for human habitation' require a change in worldviews from 'mechanistic' to 'ecological'. A key question is: how can those working on the built environment - a field with major impact on global resources and systems - best support a smooth and timely transition? It is proposed that design practitioners can facilitate that response in the built environment through the development, application and evolution of comprehensive new methodologies, explicitly shaped by a regenerative sustainability paradigm. It is further proposed that successfully evolving a regenerative practice requires going beyond just adopting new techniques to taking on a new role for humans and designers, and a 'new mind', and learning how to work 'developmentally'. As an example of how a consciously held worldview shapes a practice, an actual regenerative methodology, developed and evolved over 16 years of practice, is explored in detail. A framework, adapted from accepted scientific methodology protocols, is used to structure this exploration, differentiating the different elements and levels, showing how they work as an integrated system and revealing the underlying premises and assumptions behind the choice of aims, strategies, methods and progress indicators.

This has initiated the development of design tools that could better reflect the environmental performance of buildings. This article describes the extension of building information modelling (BIM) through the development of the sustainable resource application (SURAP) that can be used to determine the material, water, and climate footprints of buildings at the design stage. The Python application programming interface (API) of openLCA software was used with the GaBi construction materials database for the preparation of footprint data. Footprints of construction materials were determined through life cycle assessments (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis, and the application was developed as a new tab in the Autodesk Revit software. The Revit API was used for data exchange between the Revit core system and the developed plug-in. The application prototype was tested for the design of a multifamily building. The results show that the developed tool can support building designers in quantifying and visualizing cradle-to-gate material, water, and the climate footprints of buildings within the BIM environment. The promotion of sustainability in the building industry and its current limitations are discussed.

In the past many examples have been reported of where fire caused significant damage to priceless monuments of the world's cultural heritage (e.g.,Chiado area in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1988; Fenice Theatre in Venice, Italy, in 1996). A holistic approach to the preservation of historic buildings should include, among other things, a concern for suitable fire protection design. Such actions, however, are frequently subjected to stringent budget restrictions that confront designers with challenging trade-offs in their decision-making process. In this context, the current study provides an integrated scheme that embodies innovative tools for the solution of the budget allocation problem with respect to protecting historic buildings from fire. In particular, a generic selection and resource allocation model for updating the fire safety of historic buildings is proposed, along with an effective technique for efficiently solving the model for real-world test cases. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is presented for the case of the Mount Athos Monasteries, and results are discussed.

This is particularly relevant for large-scale, whole-house refurbishment programmes tasked with achieving deep cuts in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Evidence from pre-refurbishment occupancy can influence which interventions are chosen and increase their efficacy. A critical review is undertaken of a portfolio of short- and long-term occupant feedback techniques for evaluating occupants' perception of comfort, satisfaction, behaviour, and expectations. A number of these occupant feedback techniques are then tested empirically at the pre-refurbishment stage for two discrete case-study house types as part of ongoing research. The evidence reveals wide gaps between modelled and actual energy consumption; poor indoor CO2 and daylight levels, low operating internal temperatures, as well as problematic noise transmission. Such findings influence the selection of suitable user-centred low-carbon refurbishment interventions and ensure that there is a robust learning process for building owners, occupants, designers, and building managers. To optimize time, cost, and occupant involvement, it is important that feedback from occupants on building performance focuses on 'need-to-know' rather than 'nice-to-have' factors.

Thus, BIM implementation needs to be enhanced. The objectives are to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for enhancing BIM implementation and investigate the interrelationships among these CSFs. 32 success factors were identified through a literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted. The results indicated that 15 CSFs were identified and grouped into integration and accuracy of models (IAM), commitment and training from the management (CTM), and advantages and support of implementation (ASI) through factor analysis. The results from structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that CTM resulted in IAM and from ASI, while ASI facilitated IAM. The proposed framework indicating the CSFs and the intergroup relationships provides an in-depth understanding of BIM implementation and can help firms to commit on their part of project-wide BIM adoption and associated advantages. Overseas practitioners may use the identified success factors and follow the method to customise their own CSFs.

Reuse can be a part of the deconstruction process resulting in cost and environmental benefits. Several studies have identified various design principles that facilitate the deconstruction process. These may consequently maximize the reusability of building components. However, the extent to which these measures are effective is unclear. This study examines the importance of these principles in relation to the reusability of building components. A questionnaire survey investigating design principles based on previous studies was administered to building industry professionals including civil engineers, architects and demolition contractors. It was designed to determine the degree of suitability and relevance of the design principles to the practice of reuse. Over 170 responses were collected and analysed using a number of statistical approaches including ANOVA and factor analysis to identify critical technical design principles (TDPs) and to determine the potential relationships among them. Nine TDPs were identified as highly significant for the practice of reuse. Statistically significant differences between the opinions of demolition contractors and of building designers to eight principles were also determined and are also discussed.

The aim of this study is to determine the critical causes affecting projects delays in Moroccan construction industry. Forty-nine causes of delay were identified from the literature review and redefined through interviews with Moroccan experts. These causes are classified according to nine categories: client, contractor, consultant/designer, finance, planning and scheduling, communication and contractual relationship, material, labours and equipment, and external. A questionnaire survey was conducted with public and private contractors and consultants in order to assess the relative importance of construction delay causes in Morocco. A total of 330 valid responses were collected. Statistical analysis of data collected from this survey study reveals that the top-10 delay causes are: delay of progress payment, lack of training for employees, lack of waste management strategy, unrealistic contract duration imposed by clients, rework due to the construction errors, excessive subcontracting, delay in obtaining permits from governmental agencies, ineffective planning and scheduling, lack of collective planning, and unskilled workforce. These findings can be helpful for construction project managers to guide efforts in improving the performance of the Moroccan construction industry.

These stakeholders include end-users, authorities, insurance companies and financial institutions, among others. They look for proof that engineering risks are being properly managed and that specified performance-based requirements are fulfilled throughout all stages of the project (e.g. technical requirements related to the building such as structural safety, structural serviceability, structural durability, fire safety, energy efficiency, or others). Such demonstration can be conveyed through statements of technical conformity, such as technical risk reports or engineering performance certificates. Statements of conformity are particularly valuable to make informed decisions associated with contractual or other legal warranties against building nonconformities. This paper describes the conceptual background and the methodologies undertaken to design and develop a management framework that enables recognition of the conformity assessment results of building projects. It also presents the outreach of this management framework throughout the planning, programming, design, construction and use phases of building projects. This paper also summarizes the wide range of practical implications and benefits of this management framework for authorities and official bodies, owners and their representatives, banks and insurance companies, conformity assessment bodies, designers, builders, suppliers and end-users.

Sources of Changes in Design-Build Contracts for a Governmental Owner	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of the Portland-International-Center-for-Management-of-Engineering-and-Technology (PICMET 2007)	AUG 05-09, 2007	Portland, OR	Portland State Univ, Dept Engn & Technol Management, Natl Sci Fdn, Ikon Off Syst, Portland Int Ctr Management Engn & Technol			DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; CONSTRUCTION	In recent years, many U.S. federal, state, and local governments have been authorized to use the design-build method of project delivery instead of the traditional design-bid-build method. Recent studies have not been definitive on the cost advantage of design-build for governmental owners. There are fewer change orders in design-build due to design errors because the designer (architect/engineer) and contractor are one entity, but there are other causes of change orders. Some literature suggests that changes requested by the owner of the facility are greater with the design-build method. This research examines the causes for construction-phase changes in 14 design-build and 20 design-bid-build projects. Total changes, expressed as number per contract, cost per contract, or percentage of original contract, were significantly lower in design-build. Fewer design errors in design-build accounted for this advantage. The number of owner-requested changes was significantly greater in design-build. The cost of owner-requested changes, averaged over all the projects, was significantly less for design-bid-build. The differences in changes due to differing site conditions were not significant. The concept that there are more owner-requested changes in design-build projects is supported by this research.

J	Carretero-Ayuso, MJ; Moreno-Cansado, A; Garcia-Sanz-Calcedo, J				Carretero-Ayuso, Manuel J.; Moreno-Cansado, Alberto; Garcia-Sanz-Calcedo, Justo			Anomalies in External Construction Elements in Spain according to Cause-Damage Relationship	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Construction defects; Cause-damage relationship; Building project; External construction elements	DEFECTS	This paper's objective is to determine the usual typologies of deficiencies in external construction elements, identifying the most frequently recurring anomalies by analyzing all judicial complaints pertaining to construction in Spain between the years 2008 and 2010. A total of 368 anomalies were identified in 1,166 records of judicial complaints related to external construction elements. The types of damages with the highest number of cases are settling (22.55%) and bulging and/or tenting of floor cladding (20.38%). The causes with the highest prevalence are deficient ground compaction (26.36%) and characteristics of the material or of its finishing (16.03%). The construction elements in which anomalies arise most frequently are outdoor flooring and perimeter footpaths, representing 67.93% of the total. The most frequent cause-damage relationship is that of settling caused by deficient ground compaction. The methodology used and the results obtained through this research contribute to optimizing construction quality, allowing designers and site managers to easily detect the most common damages along with their causes. As a result, they will be able to act with an awareness of the origin of problems and avoid issues in other situations.

Based on the paradigm shifted from 'drawing' to 'constructing' in architectural design practice, this paper focuses on developing a new type of CAD system that automatically constructs and manages well-structured floor plans with minimum geometrical input from the designer. The paper also took advantage of the building data models developed from the prior research. The model includes hierarchical building components such as 'building', 'plan', 'space', 'ring', 'wall skeleton', 'surface', 'column', etc. The creation algorithm developed assures a semantically rich and structurally correct floor plan at any point in the design process. In particular, the floor plan constructed through the design process contains spatial information as well as other design information about the building components. Thus, the system effectively manages spatial design information in the real-time basis. Since the system implemented on the basis of the algorithm is the very first step toward a complete intelligent CAD system, research and development issues to be considered next are identified at the end of the paper.

A Green Star Environmental Rating System is one of many green-building rating systems that has been employed throughout the world. For this rating system, the "Material" category occupies 14% of credit points, which could be achieved from eight major categories. To help engineers and designers have simple tools to process sustainable projects, this paper develops a computer-aided model to calculate life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for conventional and high-strength concrete to maximize Credit 19B.1: Life-cycle impacts-Concrete in the Green Star Design and As Built in Australia. The model has been built under Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic platforms; thus, it is flexible and appears to be one of the effective ways to provide concrete mixture design using its life-cycle GHG emissions. Options to maximize Credit 19B.1 have also been discussed for normal and high-strength concrete. The model demonstrates the relationship between the utilization of supplementary cementitious material, coarse and fine aggregates used in concrete, a water-to-cement ratio with concrete strength, as well as sustainable points to be achieved.

Household energy consumption behaviours, however, span a spectrum from reasoned and deliberate to unplanned and automatic. The aim of this paper is to advance knowledge of reasoned and unplanned behaviours in the context of pro-environmental action. Using results of a survey administered to occupants of an urban residential green building, this study explores five household consumption behaviours and tests the hypothesis that unplanned behaviours will be poorly predicted by a reasoned, values-based behavioural framework. Using path analyses, variables in a values-based framework are used to predict surveyed behaviours. Findings indicate that behaviours hypothesized to be unplanned were not well predicted by the values-based framework. The framework successfully predicted what was hypothesized to be a fully reasoned behaviour. Three potential reasons are discussed for the lack of prediction of some behaviours. A deeper understanding of how unplanned, automatic or habitual behaviours intervene in conservation intentions can help policy-makers and building designers better respond to influences of occupant behaviour on building performance.

Based on social exchange theory, this study presents a novel approach extended from stakeholder value network (SVN) to identify the critical relational behavior and unveil the reciprocal multi-type relational behavior exchanges among the main stakeholders in megaprojects. Built upon six relational behavior types and 110 relational behavior flows, a qualitative relational behavior SVN (RB-SVN) model was first constructed. Questionnaire surveys from 224 megaproject managers were then used to quantify the RB-SVN model. By analyzing critical relational behavior types, flows, and cycles, we found that effective communication is the most significant relational behavior type for stakeholders. Owner-designer cooperation could create the largest relationship value through reciprocal relational behavior. The top 10 restricted (dyadic) and general exchanges were also identified to help promote stakeholders to engage in critical relational behavior cycles. This research contributes to the broad literature on relationship management, and more specifically, furthers the understanding of relational behavior networks that strengthen the relationship value of multiple stakeholders in megaprojects.

J	Teng, Y; Li, X; Wu, P; Wang, XY				Teng, Yue; Li, Xiao; Wu, Peng; Wang, Xiangyu			Using cooperative game theory to determine profit distribution in IPD projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IPD; cooperative game theory; BIM; Shapley value; profit distribution	RISK-MANAGEMENT; TRENDS; POWER	IPD (Integrated Project Delivery) mode is regarded as an effective project delivery method that could achieve the consensus project goals by a collaborative team. However, the number of projects using IPD remains small, partly because of the lack of a fair incentive scheme. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fair profit distribution scheme among stakeholders of IPD projects. This study uses cooperative game theory as the method for analyzing profit distribution among the designer, construction contractor, owner and BIM consultant. The Shapley value is used as the solution to the cooperative game theory because it can assess the marginal contribution of each stakeholder to the coalition. In addition, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are used to assess the risk levels of each stakeholder to modify the profit distribution based on the marginal contribution. A modified Shapley value model, which includes four categories of risk factors, i.e. operation, economic, profit and market risks, was established in this study. The results show that the modified Shapley value can help establish a fair profit distribution scheme for the IPD projects. Practitioners are also encouraged to focus on information sharing to reach the full potential of IPD.

Obtaining research funding increasingly presupposes economic and/or societal value of research outcomes. Our study aims to gain a nuanced understanding of what knowledge transfer in an inter- and transdisciplinary context, like healthcare building design, means for various actors involved. Based on the notion of productive interactions, we reflect on a knowledge-transfer project seeking solutions for real-world problems in the design of healthcare buildings with a focus on patient experience. We analyze how different actors involved in the project -including researchers, healthcare organizations, and designers - view and value the knowledge provided and transferred, and the (pathways towards) impact. In doing so, we illustrate how productive interactions can take place in real-life situations. We conclude that the roles of researchers and practitioners in knowledge exchange processes should be understood to be fluid. Future realizations of productive interactions could be supported by evaluating knowledge-transfer projects in terms of process and outcomes, thus acknowledging the shifting roles of researchers and practitioners, and the potential to improve well-being and social relations through research.

This paper discusses the peer review process and analyzes whether the questions used in the review can predict project success, as measured by cost, schedule, and the project peer rating, for 22 past projects. The data were analyzed retrospectively by using the point biserial correlation coefficient. The results indicate that project peer reviews conducted during the construction process can be used to assess and predict final project performance. Questions regarding working relationships, communication, timing, project controls, and relational approaches to project participants had significant correlations with project success. In addition, the relationship between the designer and contractor appears to be very important to the outcome of the project, regardless of project delivery method. This study suggests that companies and organizations can strategically improve projects by conducting project peer reviews early in the construction process. Future research can extend and validate these findings in more detail by analyzing additional peer review questions to determine the best indicators of project failure or success.

However, limitations in tools and expertise hinder meaningful human-centric decisions during the design process. In this paper, a novel Spatial Human Accessibility graph for Planning and Environment Analysis (SHAPE) is introduced that brings together the technical challenges of discrete representations of digital models, with human-based metrics for evaluating the environment. SHAPE: does not need labeled geometry as input, works with multi-level buildings, captures surface variations (e.g., slopes in a terrain), and can used with existing graph theory (e.g., gravity, centrality) techniques. SHAPE uses ray-casting to perform search, generating a dense graph of all accessible locations within the environment and storing the type travel required in a graph (e.g., up a slope, down a step). The ability to simultaneously evaluate and plan paths from multiple human factors is shown to work on digital models across room, building, and topography scales. The results enable designers and planners to evaluate options of the built environment in new ways, and at higher fidelity, that will lead to more human-friendly and accessible environments.

The prototype system is developed by employing blackboard architecture and a commercial shell VISUAL RULE STUDIO. Its present scope covers design of three types of liquid-retaining structures, namely, a rectangular shape with one compartment, a rectangular shape with two compartments and a circular shape. Through custom-built interactive graphical user interfaces, the user is directed throughout the design process, which includes preliminary design, load specification, model generation, finite element analysis, code compliance checking and member sizing optimization. It is also integrated with various relational databases that provide the system with sectional properties, moment and shear coefficients and final member details. This system can act as a consultant to assist novice designers in the design of liquid-retaining structures with increase in efficiency and optimization of design output and automated record keeping. The design of a typical example of the liquid-retaining structure is also illustrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

One of the most effective solutions to hedging against building operation optimization is incorporating energy efficiency measures and architectural programming early. This paper proposes a Smart Integrated Workspace Design (SIWD) framework that integrates architectural programming system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology into the Value Engineering (VE) process to assess design alternatives targeted explicitly at future smart office buildings. The use of the SIWD led to an improved development cycle linking architectural plans and engineering design. An empirical test using a large building owner, their designers, and contractors in Jakarta, Indonesia, resulted in an 18% improvement in building energy performance and quality when the design team used the SIWD framework. It is also indicated that leveraging advanced technology and incorporating familiar concepts and processes increased user willingness to adopt the SIWD in future projects. So, incorporated the IoT in architectural design and evaluated by VE made the readiness and friendly technology to all occupants to get the building efficiency and comfort unsteady.

THE IMPACTS OF BUILDABILITY FACTORS ON FORMWORK LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY OF COLUMNS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						buildability; categorical-regression; columns; formwork; labour productivity; rationalization; repetition; standardization	CONSTRUCTABILITY	The impacts of buildability on formwork labour productivity of major in situ reinforced concrete elements such as, foundations, walls, columns, beams and slabs, are yet to be determined and quantified. The labour unit cost of columns formwork, in comparison with other constituents of the reinforced concrete frame, is constantly higher due to the forming complexity of these elements, especially non-rectangular shapes, and the small output achieved in the operation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the impacts of buildability factors on columns formwork labour productivity. To achieve this objective, a large volume of productivity data was collected and analyzed using the categorical- regression method. As a result, the impacts of the grid patterns, variability of column sizes, repetition, total and average shutter size, and geometry of columns are quantified. Apart from the variability of column sizes, the findings show significant effects of these factors on labour productivity, which can be used to provide designers feedback on how well their designs consider the requirements of buildability principles, and the consequences of their decisions on labour efficiency. Moreover, the depicted patterns of results may provide guidance to construction managers for effective activity planning and efficient labour utilization.

J	Lawrence, M; Pottinger, R; Staub-French, S; Nepal, MP				Lawrence, Michael; Pottinger, Rachel; Staub-French, Sheryl; Nepal, Madhav Prasad			Creating flexible mappings between Building Information Models and cost information	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Mapping; BIM; Query; Cost estimate; Design changes; IK; Views; XML; Schema; Database	IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT	During the early design stages of construction projects, accurate and timely cost feedback is critical to design decision making. This is particularly challenging for cost estimators, as they must quickly and accurately estimate the cost of the building when the design is still incomplete and evolving. State-of-the-art software tools typically use a rule-based approach to generate detailed quantities from the design details present in a building model and relate them to the cost items in a cost estimating database. In this paper, we propose a generic approach for creating and maintaining a cost estimate using flexible mappings between a building model and a cost estimate. The approach uses queries on the building design that are used to populate views, and each view is then associated with one or more cost items. The benefit of this approach is that the flexibility of modem query languages allows the estimator to encode a broad variety of relationships between the design and estimate. It also avoids the use of a common standard to which both designers and estimators must conform, allowing the estimator added flexibility and functionality to their work.

However, the existing BIM tools and frameworks within prefabricated buildings are minimal. This research study aims to identify the opportunities and barriers of integrating BIM in the Australian prefabrication industry. The research was carried out using a mixed method of literature review and questionnaire survey with 30 indudstry professionals. The literature review identified the key challenges associated with prefabricated buildings including construction discipline-specific, fabrication-specific issues and communication-specific issues. The survey results proved that the most significant BIM opportunities are minimizing design errors and discrepancy of final product model between designers and manufacturers and increasing mass customization. The study revealed that seamless and timely information exchange among key project stakeholders via a BIM system was identified as the most critical success factor to adopt BIM in the prefabrication industry. This research provides practical insights into how to utilize BIM effectively for prefabrication in the housing sector. The survey results document the opportunities and barriers to BIM integration and provide professional insights on how BIM can benefit the prefabrication. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on enhancing the productivity/practice of prefabrication through BIM integration within the Australian housing context.

The study first seeks supporting material to outline an understanding of how design professionals have access to time estimation information for quoting their projects. Design/methodology/approach - The work was based on in-depth interviews conducted with 13 professionals from various design sectors that focused on understanding important elements of the project quotation process. Content analysis was performed on the information provided, and four dimensions were identified. A framework that included these dimensions was designed and validated using a focus group composed of professionals involved in project quotation. The framework includes the generation of a project network structure; identifying tasks and their duration for each design activity; and the ways in which this information remains updated and evolves through the incorporation of dynamic systems concepts. Findings - The results of this study will be the production of an external knowledge base that designers can use as a basis for performing their profession. Originality/value - This study is relevant because there is no information source that addresses tasks and associated durations on which design professionals can rely for the development of quotations.

These categories distinguish the ways professionals interpret or frame reality. The hypothesis developed is that this inconsistency, at least partially, explains the limited success that energy-efficiency research has realized in the prediction and control of climate change catalysed by the built environment. An analysis employs both historical and empirical methods to understand how the North American air-conditioning industry has framed, and subsequently regulated, the inseparable problems of human comfort and energy consumption. Historically, the dominant framework long-inhabited by moderns has constructed a unit-efficiency model of evaluation that is concerned with universal standardization and normal design. In the empirical analysis of the selected case, an emergent framework inhabited by non-moderns constructed a unit-efficacy model of evaluation concerned with local implementation and post-normal design. The two models came into conflict when designers applied code-required energy models and financing formulae based on unit-efficiency assumptions to a case of sustainable, affordable housing. The analysis concludes with seven findings designed to move building energy research and practice beyond the current epistemological divide.

In this paper, the main objective is geared towards developing a knowledge-based decision support system for optimizing costs of heavy earthmoving operations and corresponding linear schedules at early design stages. Also, the proposed system is capable of generating an automated linear schedule based on stochastic scheduling techniques. Thus, a meta-heuristic simulated approach utilizing a metropolis algorithm is implemented to assist in generating optimized line-of balances. The successful implementation of the proposed system will provide the user with optimum fleet of equipment for performing earthwork operations and linear scheduling for strategic planning purposes. Towards the end, an actual dam construction project is utilized to numerically validate the proposed system and quantify its degree of accuracy. Results presented in this study are anticipated to be of major significance to owners, designers, and construction managers specialized in embankment dams heavy earthmoving operations and would contribute to the database of fleet management systems by incorporating a novel system that integrates heavy equipment economical operational analyses with its corresponding line of balance.

An analysis is presented on the consequences of integrating embodied impacts into the assessment of the environmental advantageousness of net-zero concepts. Fundamental issues needing consideration in the design process - based on the evaluation of primary energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions - are examined by comparing three net-zero building design and assessment cases: (1) no embodied impacts included, net balance limited to the operation stage only; (2) embodied impacts included but evaluated separately from the operation stage; and (3) embodied impacts included with the operation stage in a life cycle approach. A review of recent developments in research, standardization activities and design practice and the presentation of a case study of a residential building in Norway highlight the critical importance of performance indicator definitions and system boundaries. A practical checklist is presented to guide the process of incorporating embodied impacts across the building life cycle phases in net-zero design. Its implications are considered on overall environmental impact assessment of buildings. Research and development challenges, as well as recommendations for designers and other stakeholders, are identified.

A literature review, interviews and case studies are presented to address this question. Sustainable building is not hindered by a lack of technologies and assessment methods, but is instead beset with organizational and procedural difficulties entailed by the adoption of new methods. New technologies are resisted because they require process changes entailing risks and unforeseen costs. These hindrances can be reduced by learning what kind of decision-making phases, new tasks, actors, roles and ways of networking are needed. The barriers are outlined as steering mechanisms, economics, a lack of client understanding, process (procurement and tendering, timing, cooperation and networking), and underpinning knowledge (knowledge and common language, the availability of methods and tools, innovation). The most important actions to promote sustainable building are the development of the awareness of clients about the benefits of sustainable building, the development and adoption of methods for sustainable building requirement management, the mobilization of sustainable building tools, the development of designers' competence and team working, and the development of new concepts and services. The interviews and case studies were carried out in Finland, but the results may be applicable or interesting to other countries as well.

Until now, project alliances have focused mostly on large-scale road, rail and water infrastructure projects. Despite the positive results achieved in these projects, the building and real estate sector has been rather reluctant to use this delivery method. The objective of this study was to find out whether it makes sense to use project alliancing in more everyday projects. The chosen case study is a renovation construction project in Finland that was contracted using the project alliance approach. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the issues involved, a literature review was conducted and case project-specific documentation analysed. Subsequently, several interviews were conducted with project participants, paying particular attention to the experiences and feedback obtained from developer, contractor and designer sides. In terms of the project participants' perspectives, the alliance was unanimously seen as an asset which contributed to high levels of collaboration between participants and made it possible to achieve positive results.

The aim of the study presented in this paper was to contribute to understanding a healthy construction site brought about by the best practices implemented by large construction sites to prevent WMSDs. A triangulation method made of interviews, site observations and studies on company's documents was used to identify the best practices in 13 several construction projects. A range of the best practices both in the pre-construction and construction phases of the projects were identified in six different areas of the balance of the construction workplace system; however, there seems to be a significant need for good practices in the management of a systematic work environment. It is now established that Swedish construction industry has several best practices to protect work-related musculoskeletal health. However, inadequate worker participation and the neglect of health and safety issues by designers in the planning process as well as the implications of some remuneration methods on the production schedule were perceived as detrimental to the musculoskeletal health of construction workers.

Combating overheating: mixed-mode conditioning for workplace comfort	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						agency; mixed mode; occupant satisfaction; offices; overheating; post-occupancy evaluation (POE); thermal comfort; workplace design; Australia; India	PERFORMANCE	Using post-occupancy evaluations of seven mixed-mode buildings- three in Australia and four in India- this paper demonstrates that effective mixed-mode conditioning (instead of year-round air-conditioning) can deliver comfortable workspaces. Occupant feedback reinforces strong associations between overheating, thermal comfort, overall comfort and perceived productivity. However, differing levels of thermal acceptability within and between the Australian and Indian contexts are evident. Occupants in the Indian buildings were found to tolerate a wider range of temperatures when compared with Western contexts where lower temperature limits entrench an energy demand through a greater reliance on air-conditioning. The outcomes from the study suggest that the perception of overheating and consequent risk to building performance can be intensified when occupants perceive limited adaptive opportunity or problems are not rectified quickly, whereas perceived control is less important where building systems are user responsive. Occupants in three of the study buildings also perceived higher-than-anticipated comfort which could be attributable to well-liked attributes, such as break-out spaces, daylight and fresh air included in these buildings. The findings challenge designers and clients to develop user-responsive climate interactive workplaces that capitalize on spatial and mixed-mode environmental control to tackle the question of overheating.

To address the need for early integration into the design process, a new approach called Lightsolve has been developed. Its key objectives are to support the design process using a goal-oriented approach based on iterative design improvement suggestions; to provide climate-based annual metrics in a visual and synthesized format; and to relate quantitative and qualitative performance criteria using daylighting analysis data in various forms. This methodology includes the development of a time-segmentation process to represent weather and time in a condensed form, the adaptation of daylight metrics that encompass temporal and spatial considerations, and the creation of an interactive analysis interface to explore design options and design iterations. This system relies on optimization techniques to generate these suggestions. Lightsolve allows the designer to explore other design alternatives that may better fulfil the objectives and to learn about appropriate strategies to resolve daylight or sunlight penetration issues. It offers architects and building engineers support for daylighting design that can be employed interactively within the existing design process.

An alternative set of maps based on interpreted degree-days is presented and can be used for regulation and design strategies. A dataset of 21 years of hourly, 0.05-degree data was used to produce a map with discrete heating and cooling degree-day classes. The resultant zones are therefore not derived from only the dominant climatic characteristics, but from simultaneous annual heating and cooling demands. The advantage is that the new map enables adaptive building design for climates with significant diurnal or annual temperature swings, making it useful for regulators and designers. A good correlation exists between the developed degree-day indices and building energy. The majority of South Africa was found to fall within the medium heating/medium cooling zone as expected; however, the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region is within the medium cooling zone and not the expected high cooling zone. This may be due to the humidity levels that are not accounted for.

With climate change and rising mean temperatures this is a growing concern. There is a need to understand the kinds of practices, learning and interventions adopted by the occupants of individual homes to try to reduce overheating, as this area is poorly understood and under-researched. This case study focuses on the impact of different home-use practices in relation to the severity of overheating in 18 flats in one tower block in northern England. Internal temperatures monitored in comparable flats show that the percentage of time spent above the expected category II threshold of thermal comfort according to BS EN 15251 can differ by over 70%. Extensive monitoring, covering a full year, including two summer periods, has identified emergent changes in heatwave practices linked with increased home-use skills and understanding among the research participants. Close analysis of design intentions versus reality has identified key physical barriers and social learning opportunities for appropriate adaptation in relation to heatwaves. Recommendations for designers and policy-makers are highlighted in relation to these factors.

An extended range of indoor temperatures can significantly reduce the energy load. However, lower temperature set points for heating can cause thermal discomfort. Giving building occupants the option to warm themselves (e.g. a local source at their desk or workstation) can mitigate this discomfort by the provision of a personalized conditioning system. A model is presented to assess the performance of personalized heating and its impact on the whole building energy load. Researchers, designers and facility managers can use this model to compare performance and analyse energy savings. The total energy use of personalized heating is estimated by scaling its settings to the actual level of discomfort resulting from a lowered heating set point. This model is used to assess seven different personalized heating systems. Assessments reveal that personalized heating brings a remarkable energy-saving potential, while maintaining or even improving individually perceived thermal comfort. Assessments are based on an assumed linear relation between the power and level of increased thermal sensation. Future research in personalized conditioning systems should be directed towards the development of the full characteristics and specific settings.

A comprehensive life cycle water analysis framework for residential buildings	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						embodied water; life cycle analysis; life cycle water analysis; operational water; residential buildings	VIRTUAL WATER; SYSTEM BOUNDARY; INPUT; ENERGY; TRADE; SUSTAINABILITY; REQUIREMENTS; FOOTPRINTS; MODEL	Most studies on the environmental performance of buildings focus on energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions. They often neglect to consider the range of other resource demands and environmental impacts associated with buildings, including water. Studies that assess water use in buildings typically consider only operational water, which excludes the embodied water in building materials or the water associated with the mobility of building occupants. A new framework is presented that quantifies water requirements at the building scale (i.e. the embodied and operational water of the building as well as its maintenance and refurbishment) and at the city scale (i.e. the embodied water of nearby infrastructures such as roads, gas distribution and others) and the transport-related indirect water use of building occupants. A case study house located in Melbourne, Australia, is analysed using the new framework. The results show that each of the embodied, operational and transport requirements is nearly equally important. By integrating these three water requirements, the developed framework provides architects, building designers, planners and decision-makers with a powerful means to understand and effectively reduce the overall water use and associated environmental impacts of residential buildings.

Rule-based scripts that assist and guide the modeller in model authoring are needed to enhance the level of usage of BIM. The authors developed a framework for incorporation of rule-driven domain knowledge into BIM authoring tools. With the objective of customizing the modelling process using a set of rules, the approach presented in this paper combines rules of modular coordination in prefabricated building with BIM. Modular coordination, a dimensional coordination system for sizing and placing building elements within a three-dimensional (3D) reference system, is translated into rules that are incorporated into the BIM authoring tool through object-level and process-level interventions. The study explores various options of parametric modelling for integration of identified modular coordination rules. The aim of integrating modular coordination rules is to assist the user during the modelling process. The proposed approach has the potential of reducing inconsistencies and time spent in modelling and documentation allowing the designer to spend more effort on value-adding design tasks. With the help of a case study and an experiment, capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated and validated.

This research uses a multi-functional approach that is widely recognized in the contract literature, and anatomizes FIDIC model contracts in order to gain a holistic and comprehensive understanding of them. Moreover, this research comparatively analyses the distribution of the three functions, namely control, coordination and adaptation, in four forms of FIDIC model contracts to explore how project delivery systems (PDSs) affect contract design. After a classification framework that includes three functions and ten subclasses was established, the FIDIC 1999 series model contracts were coded sentence by sentence using content analysis. The results show that the three functions are all non-trivially reflected in construction contracts and are influenced by project complexity. Regarding different PDSs, the complexity of contract control is relatively rigid; the complexity of contract coordination is largely influenced by PDSs; and the impact of PDSs on the complexity of adaptation provisions depends on the sub-class. The conclusions may help scholars and practitioners understand construction contracts from a functional perspective, and offer references for contract designers to reasonably consider the distribution of the three functions in construction contracts.

However, lack of information and frequent changes that occur as a result of a negotiation process between the owner and the designer in defining the project scope make it difficult to compute real-time construction duration. Domestic and foreign models for calculating the construction durations cannot be readily applied to computation of construction duration for general office buildings in Korea specifically during the project planning phase as there is a limit in its applicability due to numerous restrictions. Moreover, there are no preceding studies suggesting different computational approaches to predict the entire construction duration for office buildings with the approximate construction duration concept during planning phase. Therefore, based on the collected performance data, this study proposes a multiple linear regression model that facilitates reliable prediction of approximate construction duration for office buildings in the project planning phase. The model will allow the owner and other stakeholders to predict the real-time construction duration using the basic information on office buildings and to assess the construction durations incorporating frequent changes during the project planning phase.

J	Mtenga, PV; Spainhour, LK				Mtenga, PV; Spainhour, LK			Applications of mathematical software packages in structural engineering education and practice	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							COLUMNS	The use of mathematical software packages provides a number of benefits to an engineering user. In general, the packages provide a platform that supports iterative design and parametric analysis through a flexible, transparent interface combined with extensive computing power. This enables an engineering user to develop design equations that are based on fundamental mechanics theories, rather than relying on the "black-box" approach of most commercial design packages. As an example, a closed-form solution for obtaining effective length factors for the design of stepped columns is presented. In the example a series of formula is used to demonstrate the transparency of Mathcad, including the ability of using real engineering units in the calculations, formulas as they may appear in textbooks or in codes, and ability to hide and password protect some areas. This facilitates easier automation of the design and design checking processes. Most commercial structural design packages can be classified as black-box packages. The analyst inputs data at one end only to receive results at the other without fully appreciating the process the input data have gone through. This phenomenon has the tendency of reducing the engineer to a technician, blindly implementing the ideas of the software designer. The Mathcad package discussed in this paper and similar mathematical packages returns the engineer to being in control of the design process.

Unfortunately, BIM applications normally stop prior to the construction stage. The MEP layout design may no longer fit properly during the installation process when there are asbuilt deviations between structures and the MEP layout. The purpose of this paper is to develop a practical BIM framework for integrating the MEP layout from preliminary design to construction stage. In this framework, BIM models were categorized into five levels of details; 3D MEP preliminary design model, 3D MEP detailed design model, 3D MEP construction design model, MEP construction model and MEP prefabrication model. Four types of coordination steps have been formulated to solve the design and constructability issues. A case study was adopted to validate the practical BIM framework. The results are very encouraging and demonstrate the significant value of the proposed BIM approach. In addition, one issue of collision detection is discussed because 78% collisions are ineffective when using the BIM tools for collision detection; and a significant number of effective collisions (102 collisions) are still detected by the designers and contractors manually. Ultimately, the research renders a practical insight into improving the MEP design and constructability using the developed BIM framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reassessing thermal comfort in modern architecture: E.1027 as a case study	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article; Early Access						Thermal comfort; climate; simulation tools; modern architecture; E; 1027; Eileen Gray	ENERGY-EFFICIENT; BLIND-CONTROL; DESIGN; BUILDINGS; STANDARDS; SUNLIGHT	There is a general agreement that much of the syntax of modern architecture contributed to design buildings that were often inadequately adapted to climate conditions. However, there are some renowned examples that, while consistent with modern tenets, prove that assumption to be wrong. Amongst them the E.1027 house designed by Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici stands out. This research aims to contextualise and assess the quality of the E.1027 overall design in relation to thermal comfort. The original texts of Gray and Badovici on the E.1027 are contrasted with the results obtained from a series of simulations using thermal performance specialist software in terms of sun exposure and ventilation. Additionally, the building's expected thermal comfort performance is assessed under a combination of three methods, Givoni's, Fanger's and ASHRAE 55. These simulations and environmental analysis results showed that Gray's and Badovici's deep understanding of the sun's impact and the cross ventilation needed to provide comfort can be modelled and confirmed. At the same time, it is demonstrated that the designers did indeed produce a design as sophisticated as it was comfortable, while distilling the two major architectural trends at the onset of modernity: neoplasticism and Corbusean imprint.

Integrative Structural Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Structural design; Optimization; Interactive modeling; Numerical simulation; Instantaneous feedback; Visualization		Current processes for design and detailing in structural engineering are often broken up into a sequence of partial processes because of the complexity of the problem. But sequential additions of separate solutions rarely lead to an optimal design. For example, the basic structural system is often developed with its geometry and topology but without consideration of important aspects of structural performance, like robustness, redundancy, ductility. Decisions on performance are left for later design stages, when it is still possible to change details but too late to improve the structural system. A design that takes into account multiple objectives, such as safety, functionality, and aesthetics, requires a complete reconsideration of the authors' conventional sequential structural design process. Most engineering tools were developed many years ago as technology was much more limited, resulting in separate tools for separate objectives to be used in succession. In this paper, a new approach is presented as integrative structural design (ISD), where separate state-of-the-art solutions are synchronized in such a way that designers are not confined to predetermined solution paths but rather are enabled to consider different objectives concurrently including interactions between objectives. The resulting design tool for the conceptual, interactive modeling, simulation, and visualization of structural design or integrative design is presented under the term integrative structural design system (ISDS).

This paper presents the concept of a telematic digital workbench. a horizontal tabletop user interface integrating mobile computing and wireless communication to facilitate synchronous construction site to office collaboration. We demonstrate the capabilities and potentials of this system concept for construction defect management. The on-site crew uses a handheld mobile device to collect defect information and transfers the information to the design office through wireless communication by sending the information to a database listener. The digital workbench application monitors the database and synchronizes the location of the visual information on the site with the 3D model on the server. Integrated with 3D viewing capability in a CAD system, designers can interact with the combined model/site data using a horizontal and vertical screen. A case study compared the telematic digital workbench against paper-based and Pocket PC-based methods for defect management in a controlled laboratory experiment. The case study results show that the telematic digital workbench has the potential to improve the accuracy of matching site data to digital data and reduce information loss between site and office collaboration.

Cyclic application of transformations using scales for spatially or structurally determined design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						structural design; structural design; generative design; design evaluation	OPTIMIZATION	In multi-disciplinary design processes in the field of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), the design of buildings is continuously subject to transformations by the individual disciplines, e.g. when the structural designer makes a structural design for the building using the spatial design of the architect as a starting point. This paper will show that by introducing a scale for evaluating the design stages between the individual disciplines in a cyclic application of transformations, new insights can be obtained into the relationship between spatial and structural design in addition to the overall multi-disciplinary design process. The proposed design stage scale will indicate whether a design is developed to create space (spatially determined) or to create structure (structurally determined). Examples are presented for small-scale buildings and specific transitions. They will show that fundamentals, e.g. diaphragms separate spaces, will automatically be generated by the proposed cyclic application of transformations. The method also allows conclusions to be drawn from the design process, e.g. the spatial design layout will determine whether the ensuing design steps will evolve towards a spatially determined design or towards an integrated design. The idea of cyclic application with evaluation scales can be developed further by applying it to large scale buildings with additional and/or other types of transitions and scales.

In this paper, we redefine the term module as a unit composed of a set of components with a set of specific interfaces. This unit serves one or more purely nonfunctional goals, such as flexibility, evolvability, manufacturability, testability, and maintainability. According to this definition, a configuration item, a subsystem, an assembly, a subassembly, or a component can all be regarded as modules as they can serve nonfunctional goals. The important assertion here is that a module's boundaries do not necessarily coincide with those dictated by the functional or spatial system decomposition and hierarchy. The aim of this paper is to lay the foundations for the future standardization of various engineering design processes based on modularity for nonfunctional benefits. A clear definition of the terms module and modularity can assist systems designers and developers to optimize the value of a modular system. This research highlights the present inconsistencies in the field of modular system design and puts forward some critical questions, which will shape the future research into this field.

This paper addresses the subject of design changes management in the context of a multidisciplinary collaborative environment of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Due to evolving role of BIM in designing of building projects and the increasing complexity of the design process a need to develop change management based on BIM methodology aroused. The application of BIM to construction projects has the potential to enhance the quality of information provided for making critical design decisions. Trusted change propagation is the key for successful change management. Paper describes developed method to predict the propagation of change through the building information model and provides the concept of visual technology to help designers to predict the change in the construction industry. The developed method includes the use of parameter-based Design Structure Matrix (DSM) as a tool for predicting change propagation. The novelty of research is the proposed integration of DSM with BIM to support the visual representation of predicting change within BIM. Case study demonstrates the possibilities of method in BIM environment.

To research the bending mechanical behaviors of pre-stressed steel-concrete composite box beams and provide corresponding design specification and requirements, the tests of ten pre-stressed composite box beams were finished, and the effects on flexural behaviors were given for different initial pre-stress levels, the forms of reinforcement placement and loading method and so on. Design calculation methods under serviceability and bearing capacity limits were mainly discussed. Test results indicated that the pre-stressed composite beam displays a lot of advantages compared with ordinary composite beams. The flexural capacity of the composite beams through using pre-stressed technology was greatly increased. The elastic-plastic analysis of the pre-stressed composite beams was finished; what's more, the equations of deflection and elastic bearing capacity with consideration of interface slip were derived out. Calculating equations for ultimate banding capacity were derived with consideration of pre-stress increments. Finally, the calculated values met precise requirements when compared with the test results. This study provides advisory opinions for the designer to analysis and design of the pre-stressed composite beams. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lutzkendorf, T; Lorenz, D				Luetzkendorf, Thomas; Lorenz, David			Capturing sustainability-related information for property valuation	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building information; buildings; property valuation; real estate (property) appraisal; sustainability assessment	INVESTMENT	Within current property markets, sustainability characteristics enhance and complement the traditional drivers of a property's economic value. However, sustainability-related information needs to be considered within the property valuation process to account for how this impacts upon a building's valuation. This requires adjusting and further developing valuation procedures. Most sustainability assessment systems coexist in isolation beside the traditional instruments and methods of the property industry, e.g. property valuation and risk analyses. This paper shows that the sustainability assessment of buildings can be adapted to serve as a key source of information for several actors in property markets (particularly valuation professionals). The information requirements of valuation professionals are explored in relation to sustainability. A structure for information is proposed that enables valuation professionals to reach an improved and more systematic description of buildings for valuation purposes combining both traditional as well as sustainability-related aspects. Several actors (sustainability assessors, designers, planners and facility managers) have a role (1) in providing an improved description of buildings along their life cycle and (2) in creating a more robust informational basis for property valuations. This would provide a competitive advantage for these actors (or for some 'early adopters' among them) by responding to the sustainability-related information requirements of valuation professional and their financial colleagues within the property industry.

It is where risks associated with the project are analysed, early designs are formulated, critical decisions are made and the specific project execution approach is defined. However, early planning in many cases is not performed well in the building industry, and, as a result, the building sector suffers from poor or incomplete scope definition, frequently experiencing considerable changes that result in significant cost and schedule overruns. The Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI) is a weighted score sheet used for determining the level of scope definition of building projects during preproject planning. Developed by the Construction Industry Institute (CII) in 1999, this tool has been widely adopted by various owners and designers in the building industry. Using the PDRI while conducting planning charrettes (i.e. intense focus meetings involving key stakeholders) provides a collaborative environment that can enhance design quality during pre-project planning by integrating the perspectives of the various project participants. The background of the PDRI, its benefits for the project and use of the PDRI in planning charrettes, including key participants, required resources and outcomes, are assessed. Recommendations are provided for project professionals about the use of the charrette approach for planning.

While models such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) have been used to explain the acceptance of development products, very little research exists on the acceptance of the more complex development processes. Using the theory of planned behavior, goal-setting theory, and the TAM, this study develops it model to explain the acceptance of innovative information systems development processes by individual software developers. A total of 150 experienced developers; completed a survey designed to explore factors that relate to the acceptance of object-oriented systems development (OOSD), the focus of this particular study. An analysis of the collected data reveals a succinct model that explains more than 60% of a developer's acceptance of OOSD. These results have important implications for both managers and process designers in their efforts to promote the acceptance of systems development -inno n vations among developers. Researchers should also benefit from an augmented understanding of the acceptance of complex innovative processes.

Advanced energy retrofit projects: cross-case analysis of integrated system design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Energy-efficiency; retrofits; case study; integrated system design; construction management		Built environment researchers and practitioners are addressing the current sustainability and energy challenges facing the industry. The shift in building energy and sustainability expectations has led project teams to develop new practices and processes. Owners, project managers, designers and contractors now actively seek opportunities to improve the energy performance of existing buildings through retrofitting. Given that integrated system upgrades result in more significant energy reduction rates than traditional approaches, this study adopted a case-study approach to understand the integrated system design process and its effects on energy-efficiency performance measures in retrofit projects compared to traditional retrofit processes. Within this scope, three retrofit projects with different processes and rate of energy consumption reduction were purposefully selected to meet certain project delivery and system design characteristics. This paper focuses on effects of these characteristics on the collaborative decision-making process and integrated system design. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of critical decisions related to process and performance modelling practices in the delivery of retrofit projects. As a consequence, it was found that while collaborative energy benchmarking and performance goal setting provided a transparent decision-making environment, the review of existing conditions prior to design and the use of historical operational performance data made the iterative energy modelling of an integrated building system design realistic.

J	Bowen, P; Edwards, P; Cattell, K; Jay, I				Bowen, Paul; Edwards, Peter; Cattell, Keith; Jay, Ian			The awareness and practice of value management by South African consulting engineers: Preliminary research survey findings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Value management; Construction industry; Professional engineers; South Africa	CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS	The awareness of value management (VM) and the nature and extent of its practice by professional civil, electrical and mechanical engineers in the South African construction industry are investigated using a web-based, online questionnaire survey as the first part of a more extensive investigation. A primary objective of the early study is to test the UK-based assertion of Kelly et al. [Kelly, J., Male, S., Graham, D., 2004. Value Management of Construction Projects. Blackwell, Oxford] that VM is an established service with commonly understood tools, techniques and styles. The survey findings suggest that, while awareness of VM is reasonably prevalent among South African engineers, its practice is considerably less extensive. Where VM is undertaken, almost no attempt is made to benchmark VM activities against international standards nor does its use appear to conform to any standard methodology. Engineers prefer other ways of delivering value to projects, and do not generally employ VM to facilitate the client briefing process. The findings are important given the increasing globalization of construction services, especially given the international ties between designers, project managers and other professionals. Professional engineering associations in South Africa should adopt a proactive role in promoting the use of VM by engineers, possibly through continuing professional development programmes.

However, there is a lack of approaches for identifying the potential ergonomic risks of a proposed design that can effectively address designers' lack of familiarity with ergonomic risks and understanding of the PtD concept and its implementation. Furthermore, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of ergonomic interventions on productivity and vice versa using available tools. Thus, an integrated approach to PtD is proposed by developing a comprehensive framework that uses simulation modeling, coupled with Predetermined Motion Time Systems (PMTS) and ergonomic and biomechanical assessment, as well as workplace visualization, in order to incorporate both productivity and safety analysis into the design process. The results of implementing the proposed approach indicate its effectiveness in achieving optimum designs in terms of efficiency and safety by evaluating different scenarios of carrying out construction manual operations. The proposed framework also enables evaluating the relationship between safety and productivity from a physical perspective.

On the other hand, reliability analysis is an efficient approach which can be applied in order to quantify the identified risks. By applying such analyses, a designer can therefore define and develop different scenarios in order to evaluate the effect of identified risks. The risk management process can be further implemented within a value management cycle where the potential alternatives should be evaluated and finally the best-known alternative must be selected. In order to measure the efficiency of risk analysis approach in a dam, a case study is studied and then implemented. The result of the reliability analysis for the piping phase shows a conservative approach with a low risk during the dam design process. Based on the value analysis, two different scenarios are then developed. In the first scenario, the piping phase is considered as a high risk issue; and in the second scenario, the risk is considered as its minimum acceptable threshold. Based on the obtained results, this can be summarized: utilizing risk analysis for improvement of the decision-making process can be efficiently defined and developed as a fundamental strategy in water resource projects.

User-Centered Design Roadmapping: Anchoring Roadmapping in Customer Value Before Technology Selection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Companies; Technological innovation; Transmission line measurements; Product development; Research and development; User centered design; Design engineering; product design; product development; user process design; centered design; systems thinking; technology management	FRAMEWORK	Designing an innovation strategy in a world of rapid technological change has become increasingly challenging. Some companies are finding that anchoring technology choices in deeper understanding of the value users seek allows them to find a better balance among feasibility, viability, and desirability of potential solutions, and thus create more successful user outcomes. They do so by involving designers earlier in the roadmap development to guide product and technology selection, toward a future vision based on user value and aspirations. In this article, we extend two streams of prior research on technology roadmapping (TRM) and design roadmapping (DRM). First, we identify and compare technology and DRM approaches and their distinct strategic emphases: Technology selection and user value, respectively. Second, we compare two cases of DRM deployment in corporations: Siemens and Air France-KLM. The intent is to provide an in-depth understanding of why and how DRM complements TRM and how DRM facilitates making tradeoffs among strategic goals to more comprehensively address the feasibility, viability, and desirability of new product and service designs. We find that DRM embeds a deep understanding of current and future user needs, linking user-centered design and technology selection to strategy in practice.	[Kim, Euiyoung; Simonse, Lianne W.

The literature review identified 30 popular communal amenities and was tested via a questionnaire survey conducted in Taiwan. Participants (N?=?759) evaluated the importance level of the proposed amenities with five-point Likert scale. Data were analysed with Friedman Ranking Test and Kruskal?Wallis test. Results showed that both respondent groups placed outdoor open space, trail and garden with seat as top three important amenities, where outdoor and multifunction were the spatial and functional qualities. While the general public believed physical category amenities were more important, healthcare practitioners put emphasis on social and spiritual categories. Within the general public group, respondents aged 65 years and older had different views than younger respondents on dog run area, BBQ areas and video game room. Swimming pool and religious space were viewed as an important amenity by respondents from different regions. It was concluded that in Taiwan, views may differ with upbringing and cultural backgrounds, residing regions and age. The initial findings can assist policymakers, real estate developers and designers for decision-making in future housing projects.

Specifically, we explore environmentally responsible manufacturing (ERM) as perceived and acted on by two critical groups within this design process. The first consists of the champions and supporters of ERM, who either formally or informally act as advocates of ERM within the organization. The second consists of the users of design for environment (DfE) tools and procedures. Typically, these people consist of product designers and design engineers. We study these two groups through in-depth interviews with managers and engineers in a sample of ten firms drawn from the "best-in-class" environmental leaders. We found that a large gap exists between the ERM supporters and the users of ERM tools in terms of expectations, perceptions and orientations toward ERM principles, practices and tools. To overcome some of the many obstacles preventing effective integration of environmental criteria into the design process, we conclude with a process map that proposes the following steps: 1) enlisting support of a corporate champion; 2) defining environmental goals; 3) selecting a pilot project; 4) setting product launch goals and evaluation system; 5) enlisting support of team members; 6) providing DfE tools and training; 7) monitoring the project; and 8) celebrating successes.

This study illustrates how the combination of multicriteria decision analysis and a group decision-making technique can be used to arrive at solutions that are mutually acceptable to multiple stakeholders when selecting sustainable transport projects. The proposed methodology, in which the collective preference is determined based on the aggregation of individual preferences from all stakeholders, is illustrated through a case study of the prioritization of nine prospective transport projects affecting three stakeholder groups (decision-makers, project designers, and system users) in Tianjin Binhai New Area, China. Specifically, the various projects were evaluated for their probable sustainability performance according to 14 criteria. The results show that the proposed methodology can enable transportation managers to achieve an acceptable solution to a complex project-prioritization problem by understanding the different needs and concerns of diverse stakeholders. It is hoped that the present research will serve as a practical tool for infrastructure managers seeking to build consensus, and helping them to assess the degree of consensus among stakeholders at various points in the process, thereby facilitating effective communication and the coordination of decisions.

J	Smith, RP				Smith, RP			The historical roots of concurrent engineering fundamentals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						concurrent engineering; design for manufacturing; engineering design management; history of design		This paper explores the history of the ideas behind concurrent engineering from the end of the 19th century until the 1960's, Concurrent engineering is the relatively recent term that is applied to the engineering design philosophy of crossfunctional cooperation in order to create products that are better, cheaper, and more quickly brought to market. The principles of concurrent engineering that are traced by this paper are: manufacturing and functional design constraints need to be considered simultaneously; combining of people with different functional backgrounds into a design team is a useful way to combine the different knowledge bases; engineering designers must bear in mind customer preferences during the design process; and time to market is an important determinant of eventual success in the market. None of these principles is by itself surprising; concurrent engineering has led to their propagation to many people and firms in the engineering world, The author has examined the engineering literature in order to locate the existence of similar themes in published engineering thought, All of these themes have recurred often in the literature, Concurrent engineering can be seen therefore as a summary of best practice in product development, rather than the adoption of a radically new set of ideas. The paper suggests some reasons that concurrent engineering ideas may not have been adopted more widely,		Smith, RP (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT IND ENGN,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.							99	52	54	1	14	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394	0018-9391			IEEE T ENG MANAGE	IEEE Trans.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) enables a scientific assessment, which facilitates locating possible changes associated with different stages of the cycle which results in improvements in its environmental profile. Although LCA is increasingly present in the demands of the building sector, professionals continue to seek new ways to incorporate such a methodology into the building design and construction processes as seamlessly and straightforwardly as possible. A promising possibility is the integration of building components LCA data in the Building Information Modelling (BIM) platform. This paper discusses the consequences of the simplifications of LCA data and methodology in the main existing tools that integrates LCA in the BIM platform using a simulation on wall systems performed in a BIM plug-in. The consistency of the results is compared to a full WA on Gabi 6 software. The results were not consistent, despite the research efforts towards equalizing the scope of the studies to provide a fair comparison. The reasons are probably the simplifications and shortcuts necessary for developing a simpler BIM-based tool to be applied during the design process, by any building designer with no particular expertise in LCA.

Impact of Green Building Design and Construction on Worker Safety and Health	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Sustainable, or "green," rating systems, such as the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), are leading to changes in the way owners, designers, and contractors approach the design, construction, and operation of buildings. The processes and features included in green design and construction may have positive and/or negative impacts on construction worker safety and health. This paper presents the findings of a research study of the impact of green building design and construction practices on construction worker safety and health. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable and lost time injury and illness data from green projects (as identified by LEED) and from nongreen projects was collected through a structured questionnaire survey. The data collected was analyzed to test for the presence of a difference in OSHA recordable incident rates (RIRs) and lost time case rates (LTCRs) between green and nongreen projects. It was found that there was suggestive, but inconclusive evidence of a statistically significant difference in the RIRs of the green and nongreen building projects included in the study. No statistically significant difference was found between the LTCRs for the green and nongreen projects included in the study. The study findings provide valuable information to the construction industry for the purposes of project safety planning and the assessment of safety and health on projects.

This paper presents an open computing infrastructure, Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI), that allows building designers and engineers to enhance their simulations by combining empirical data with diagnostic or prognostic models. Based on the idea of dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS), the VIFI infrastructure complements conventional data-centric sharing strategies and addresses key data-sharing concerns such as the privacy of building occupants. To demonstrate the potential of the VIFI infrastructure, an empirically derived lighting schedule in the US Department of Energy's small office building reference model is simulated. The case-study simulation is used to explore (1) the possibility and potential of integrating data-centric and analytic-centric sharing strategies; (2) the method of combining empirical data with simulations; (3) the creation, sharing, and execution of analytics using VIFI; and (4) the impact of incorporating empirical data on energy simulations. Although the case study reveals clear advantages of the VIFI data infrastructure, research questions remain surrounding the motivation and benefits for sharing data, the metadata that are required to support the composition of analytics, and the performance metrics that could be used in assessing the applications of VIFI.

J	Boyd, P; Schweber, L				Boyd, Philippa; Schweber, Libby			Unintended consequences: institutional artefacts, closure mechanisms and the performance gap	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						closure mechanisms; energy performance; innovation; performance gap; renewable technology; social construction of technology (SCOT); socio-technical; system integration	ENERGY PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION; BUILDINGS; TECHNOLOGY; PROFESSIONALS	Renewable technologies often feature in policies to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. Designers introduce predicted energy values for specific technologies, but are surprised when the technologies fail to perform as expected. Three building projects are used to explore the effect of construction processes on the energy performance of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. In two cases BIPV failed to deliver expected energy generation, while in the third, dramatic changes in project processes and technical specifications were needed to achieve the specified output. A social construction of technology (SCOT) analysis documents how the energy generation of BIPV disappeared from view at certain points as actors focused on building features. A contribution is made to the theoretical development of SCOT by responding to two issues: privileging of cognitive closure mechanisms and the neglect of institutional analysis. The concept of inflection mechanisms is introduced as a second type of closure mechanism. More specifically, the role of institutional artefacts (e.g. planning requirements and schedules) in the construction process is found to contribute to the performance gap. To reduce the performance gap', practitioners need to focus on the distribution of design responsibility, sequencing of work and the location of expertise.

At the same time, enhancing the satisfaction of participants not only helps in problem solving but also improves their motivation and cooperation. However, previous research related to participant satisfaction is primarily concerned with clients and customers and relatively little attention has been paid to contractors. This paper investigates how the performance of project participants affects contractor project satisfaction in terms of the client's clarity of objectives (OC) and promptness of payments (PP), designer carefulness (DC), construction risk management (RM), the effectiveness of their contribution (EW) and mutual respect and trust (RT). With 125 valid responses from contractors in Malaysia, a contractor satisfaction model is developed based on structural equation modelling. The results demonstrate the necessity for dividing abstract satisfaction into two dimensions, comprising economic-related satisfaction (ES) and production-related satisfaction (PS), with DC, OC, PP and RM having significant effects on ES, while DC, OC, EW and RM influence PS. In addition, the model tests the indirect effects of these performance variables on ES and PS. In particular, OC indirectly affects ES and PS through mediation of RM and DC respectively. The results also provide opportunities for improving contractor satisfaction and supplementing the contractor selection criteria for clients. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Strategies for providing enriched thermal environments must be conjoined with reducing energy; these are inseparable for any building striving for high performance. The objective of current comfort standards is to have no more than 20% of occupants dissatisfied, yet buildings are not reaching even that scant goal. A significant energy cost is incurred by the current practice of controlling buildings within a narrow range of temperatures (often over-cooling in the summer). If building designers and operators can find efficient ways to allow building temperatures to float over a wider range, while affording occupants individual control of comfort, the potential for energy savings is enormous. Five new ways of thinking, or paradigm shifts, are presented for designing or operating buildings to provide enhanced thermal experiences. They are supported by examples of research conducted by the Center for the Built Environment, and include shifts from centralized to personal control, from still to breezy air movement, from thermal neutrality to delight, from active to passive design, and from system disengagement to improved feedback loops.

This paper examines the magnitude, causes, preparedness and remedies for addressing the risk of summertime overheating in four case study residential care and extra-care settings across the UK, spanning different building types, construction and age. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, drawing from building science and social science methods, including temperature monitoring, building surveys, and interviews with design and management teams. The findings suggest that overheating is a current and prevalent risk in the case study schemes, yet currently little awareness or preparedness exists to implement suitable and long-term adaptation strategies (e.g., external shading). There was a perception from designers to managers, that cold represents a bigger threat to older occupants' health than excessive heat. A lack of effective heat management was found across the case studies that included unwanted heat gains from the heating system, confusion in terms of responsibilities to manage indoor temperatures, and conflicts between window opening and occupant safety. Given that care settings should provide protection against risks from cold and hot weather, design, management and care practices need to become better focused towards this goal.

Research and practice have demonstrated that management tasks may be duplicated when standards are implemented in parallel. Consequently, integrated management systems are strongly advocated. However, existing literature demonstrates that the integration of planning and control instruments involves a high level of uncertainty. This paper presents an innovative model to enhance the integration of environmental-and health and safety-management systems in construction companies, focusing on the subsystems for identifying, assessing, and operationally controlling environmental aspects and health and safety hazards and using risk as an integrating factor. The findings of this study have direct implications for both designers and contractors because the model helps to explicitly consider on-site environmental impacts and construction-worker safety during the design process and offers on-site guidance to eliminate the remaining impacts and risks or reduce them to acceptable levels. A case study is reported to illustrate the practical use of the proposed model and its benefits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000579. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The aim of this research is to develop a framework for the integration of BIM and structure verification to improve the application of BIM in road engineering and thus reduce the mistake and repetition in pavement design. Relying on the capabilities of Dynamo, a three-dimensional road model with pavement controllable parameters was first established. Successful implementation of this step can facilitate the designer with more flexible and convenient needs in design process. Secondly, a subroutine is developed based on Python to combine Dynamo with the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) which provides the pavement structure analysis. As a response to long-term development between BIM and road engineering, this paper contributes by offering innovative and practical solutions for integration of road design and pavement analysis, which effectively solves the long-existing defect that the pavement structure cannot be analyzed in the environment of BIM, and thus, will significantly promote the further application of BIM technology in the road industry.

The supply chains of PBPs involve large numbers of stakeholders, including clients, designers, main contractors, transporters, and assembly subcontractors, all of which need to interact with each other by frequent information exchanges. However, cross-border supply chains are found to be quite complex, resulting in risks that significantly affect the performance of PBPs. Supply chain risks (SCRs) are closely associated with the stakeholders involved and have high interdependency with each other. This paper adopts social network analysis (SNA) to develop the risk network of the supply chain of a PBP in Hong Kong to prioritize the stakeholder-associated SCR. The research findings show that poor planning of resources and schedule, poor control of working flows, and poor information sharing between stakeholders are the major challenges to the supply chains of PBPs. This is the first study to consider the dynamic risk interdependency and associated stakeholders in SCRs. By providing a greater understanding of the risks embedded across the supply chains of PBPs in Hong Kong, this study could assist practitioners dealing with such risks more effectively and efficiently.

The next-generation constitutive correlations for simulation of cyclic stress-strain behaviour of sand	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cyclic stress-strain relationship; hardening; shear modulus; damping ratio; linear genetic programming	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELING DAMPING RATIO; SHEAR MODULUS; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SOILS; PREDICTION; STRENGTH; FORMULATION; STRATEGY; SCOUR	This paper presents an innovate approach to simulate the stress-strain behaviour of sands subjected to large amplitude regular cyclic loading. New prediction correlations were derived for damping ratio (D) and shear modulus (G) of sand utilizing linear genetic programming (LGP) methodology. The correlations were developed using several cyclic torsional simple shear test results. In order to formulate D and G, new equations were developed to simulate hysteresis strain-stress curves and maximum shear stress (tau(max)) at different loading cycles. A genetic algorithm analysis was performed to optimize the parameters of the proposed formulation for stress-strain relationship. A total of 746 records were extracted from the simple shear test results to develop the tau(max) predictive model. Sensitivity and parametric analyses were conducted to verify the results. To investigate the applicability of the models, they were employed to simulate the stress-strain curves of portions of test results that were not included in the analysis. The LGP method precisely characterizes the complex hysteresis behaviour of sandy soils resulting in a very good prediction performance. The proposed design equations may be used by designers as efficient tools to determine D and G, specifically when laboratory testing is not possible.

Its essence is the digitalization and automation of the AEC/FM industry. As robots and other technologies make their way into the different phases of the lifecycle of construction projects, the concern about the future of jobs and wages will increase. While the use of robotics has the potential to improve productivity and safety, it should not necessarily reduce total employment in the construction sector in the long run. It is expected that existing roles will evolve, and new roles will be created (e.g., in addition to designers there will be a need for employees with digital skills). Focusing on the construction phase of a robotically built concrete wall, the different roles were evaluated. From this study, it was found that there will be a time in which conventional construction and robotic technologies will coexist, leading to a higher job variability and new roles, both at the managerial and operations/execution levels. Although this study is not meant to be an exact representation of how the AEC/FM roles will change as a consequence of Construction 4.0, it opens the debate and research in this area.

J	Arroyo, P; Tommelein, ID; Ballard, G				Arroyo, P.; Tommelein, I. D.; Ballard, G.			Comparing AHP and CBA as Decision Methods to Resolve the Choosing Problem in Detailed Design	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Decision support systems; Multiple objective analysis; Sustainable buildings; Lean construction; Teamwork; Management method; Choosing by advantages; Analytical hierarchy process; Multicriteria decision making; Material selection; Project planning and design	FRAMEWORK; CRITERIA; SELECTION	Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods can help designers address the choosing problem in building detailed design. Many, however, appear to assume that all methods are equivalent. This paper argues that differences between MCDM methods matter. The first contribution of this paper is differentiating between the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and choosing by advantages (CBA) by comparing them through an example. The second contribution is explaining why CBA is superior to AHP for this context. In summary, CBA (1) provides a more context-based analysis than AHP, (2) does not incorporate conflicting judgments for weighing factors as AHP does, (3) does not assume linear trade-offs between factors as AHP does, (4) does not assume that factors have zero as a natural scale as AHP does, (5) focuses on differentiating between alternatives more than AHP, (6) maintains the result of the decision when nondifferentiating factors are removed, whereas AHP may not, and (7) defers subjective judgments until late in the decision-making process, whereas AHP requires expressing them earlier. This presents a significant research finding, considering the wide use of AHP. Further research is needed to assess what range of design decisions CBA supports.

AEC projects are challenging to collaborate because they require those in different subgroups to address uniquely defined technical and functional contexts. The AEC industry often seeks integrated collaboration through organizational integration because the literature assumes that organizational structure determines collaboration structure. This study uses a network perspective to identify the inconsistency between the organization and collaboration networks through the data of email records from a $20 million AEC project with a typical fragmented organization. The analytical focus is on two network configurations: (1) a community structure through which subgroups are defined to attend to specific aspects of the project and then coordinated through ties between members of different teams; and (2) a core-periphery structure in which a relatively small number of members interact frequently in the core and then coordinate as each member of the core interacts with specific members of the periphery. Results provide evidence of integrated collaboration in fragmented project organization, indicating organizational integration is not a must to achieve integrative collaboration. The findings suggest implications to facilitate integrative collaboration: (1) efforts should focus on collaboration behaviors, (2) subgroups should adopt a dual-lead pattern, (3) subgroups should encourage non-high-profile members to function as cores, and (4) subgroups should ensure information sharing and prevent information overload.

Currently, layered rapid prototyping technologies are not suitable for the fabrication of this kind of objects, due to the necessity of a large number of layers and the limitations in size. This paper reports a novel approach of layered manufacturing that is more appropriate for the fabrication of these large objects. A method of thick-layered object manufacturing is presented, which is based on a higher order approximation of the shape and application of a flexible curved cutting tool. The method allows the production of physical prototypes, which need little or no finishing. In order to meet the designer's intend, as closely as possible, some feasible system characteristics are introduced. The process is ordered in a sequential way and provides a highly automated process. A hierarchical decomposition of the CAD geometry takes place into components, segments, layers and sectors, based on morphological analysis. This method enables the manufacturing and the re-assembly of the parts to produce the physical prototypes without affecting the requested functionality. Due to the possibility of obtaining multiple solutions in the physical model, much attention must be paid to the efficiency of the process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ju, CJ; Ning, Y				Ju, Chuanjing; Ning, Yan			Integrating interorganizational justice to facilitate tacit knowledge sharing in architectural and engineering design projects: a configurational approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Tacit knowledge sharing; Interorganizational justice; Architectural and engineering design projects; Configurational analysis	SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS; EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; ORGANIZATIONS; PROFILES; MODELS; ROLES; TRUST; ADOLESCENTS	Purpose Sharing tacit knowledge across firm boundaries is challenging in architectural and engineering design projects as tacit knowledge is embedded in the designer's mind. It thus requires autonomous motivation. This study aims to examine how clients integrate distributive justice (DJ), procedural justice (PJ) and interactional justice (IJ) to motivate tacit knowledge sharing in interorganizational architectural and engineering (A/E) design projects. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was built, describing how the combination of distributive, procedural and interactional justice influences tacit knowledge sharing. This model was then verified using latent profile analysis (LPA) of 360 A/E design projects. Findings A total offour subgroups with quantitatively different combinations of distributive, procedural and interactional justice were identified. Within each subgroup, the levels of the three forms of justice were quite aligned. The results indicate that clients often implement interorganizational justice in a collective manner. Among the four subgroups, projects with the highest level of justice combination have a significantly higher level of tacit knowledge sharing than the other three. This indicates that sharing of tacit knowledge is driven by the overall level of interorganizational justice. Originality/value The configurational approach complements previous research by presenting how combinations of interorganizational justice influence tacit knowledge sharing in A/E design projects.

J	Zwikael, O; Shtub, A; Chih, YY				Zwikael, Ofer; Shtub, Avraham; Chih, Ying-Yi			Simulation-Based Training for Project Management Education: Mind the Gap, As One Size Does Not Fit All	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Simulation-based training; Engineering education	LEARNING OUTCOMES; RISK-MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS GAMES; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; UNCERTAINTY; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; KNOWLEDGE	Project management training is an important component in engineering education; in particular, simulation-based training (SBT) is considered a valuable teaching strategy. However, the effectiveness of SBT in project management education has not been empirically examined and it remains unclear in the literature why some trainees benefit from SBT more than others. To address this gap, the authors conducted two pre-/post-test experimental design studies, involving area experts and graduate students with a range of individual differences in two project management courses in the United States and Australia. The results suggest that SBT (1) enhances trainees' declarative knowledge only in cases of successful performance in the simulation, and the existence of an appropriate gap (discussed in the paper) between the trainees' prior knowledge and the challenges presented by the simulator; and (2) energizes trainees' learning processes only in cases of success in the simulation, high prior knowledge level, and positive prior attitude toward SBT. These findings advance existing theory by revealing some conditions under which SBT is more effective in project management education, and identifying individual differences that, if taken into account, may improve its value. Practical implications suggest that SBT designers should integrate various levels of difficulty into the design, and lecturers should ensure that trainees possess the required theoretical knowledge before the SBT session.

J	Shahi, A; Sulaiman, MN; Mustapha, N; Perumal, T				Shahi, Ahmad; Sulaiman, Md Nasir; Mustapha, Norwati; Perumal, Thinagaran			Naive Bayesian decision model for the interoperability of heterogeneous systems in an intelligent building environment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Intelligent buildings; Naive Bayesian; Decision-making	ECA RULES	The environment of an intelligent building includes systems and sensors with significant heterogeneity. With the growth of heterogeneous devices and sensor technologies in intelligent buildings,,designers are often faced with more interoperation complexities among heterogeneous systems that are data-intensive in nature. Conversely, performing decision making on these systems with a variety of building data is not efficient in terms of adapting to a changing environment. Current interoperation solutions for intelligent buildings focus on dry-contact and static rule-based systems to solve interoperability in intelligent buildings. Although static rule-based systems are efficient, the bottleneck can be in the area of the scalability of heterogeneous systems that will affect the efficient performance of interoperations. Therefore, to ensure a timely decision-making mechanism among heterogeneous systems, the performance delay and interpretation capability of systems should be improved. This paper offers a framework that improves the communication responses and the ability of automated decision support among the heterogeneous systems with a rule-based repository for the management of intelligent buildings. The implementation of the framework was performed with several systems to show their adaptation to joint interoperation. It is also interwoven with Web services to offer unified integration among heterogeneous systems. Testing of the framework was performed in a local area network (LAN) setting and proved to be reliable in solving interoperation problems for intelligent buildings.

It is a broad concept with various interpretations and meanings across research disciplines. The complexity and scope of a module is not captured sufficiently and clearly in the construction management and engineering literature, and the impact of modularization across project phases has not been fully explored and articulated. Therefore, the main question addressed in this paper relates to the inherent meaning of what is a module in the context of different phases of a building project. In addressing this question, this paper empirically investigates the use of modularity in 15 construction projects situated in Italy, Germany, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. The findings of this research suggest that a design-based and an operations-based perspective of modularity coexist, and that there is the need for an integrated view of modularity across the project lifecycle phases and for collaborative working between designers and site operators. To this aim, a unifying definition of a module in building projects is proposed along with a practical guide to help managers organize project activities for effective modularization. The actual cost analysis of the various modularization strategies provides an interesting avenue for future research. The template proposed also requires wider testing with a wider range of modules.

A methodology was proposed to facilitate the investigation of the environmental implications of density and the search of alternative built form typologies with good environmental performance potential that can be further explored in the context of high density development. The utility of the proposed methodology was demonstrated through a preliminary case study on several representative urban blocks and residential precincts by focusing on one environmental performance variable, i.e. exposure to the sky. The results indicate that the existing environmental performances as indicated by facade and ground level sky exposure vary across the representative built form typologies under study. Moreover, the performances of the cases selected react differently to variation of density due to increase of building height. The differences in existing performances and sensitivities to density variation between the cases investigated in relation to their built form are discussed. The findings suggest that, when targeting at higher development density, the proposed methodology can assist planners and urban designers in their search for alternative urban block typologies that provide different spatial configurations with equally good or even better environmental performance.

Dramatic growth of electric vehicles (EVs) on roads is projected in the next decade. The pivotal challenge to infrastructure is how to fill the charging-capacity gap for the increased number of EVs. The challenge is twofold: one is the energy gap in charging stations due to peak demands, and the other is shortage of charging infrastructure owing to high construction costs. As an emerging solution, energy storage technology provides stable and reliable electricity buffers during peak hours; however, it is unknown how to effectively integrate energy storage to charging stations while obtaining the lowest cost. The objective of this paper is to develop a simulation model that determines the optimal design of the energy storage system (ESS) for a given network of charging stations. The model is made novel by integrating the charging station network and energy storage system as a whole. The optimal ESS design informs the configuration and distribution of battery type, size, amount, and location. A case study of the Detroit area in Michigan indicates the model is robust and provides efficient decision support for planners, designers, and engineers to construct energy storage systems. Strategies retrieved from the case suggest large-sized batteries and microgrids for cross-station energy exchange, which leads to a potential 20%-36% of cost savings for energy storage development.

However, reliance on information technology is associated with risks. The purpose of this paper is to offer a better understanding of the emerging contractual and legal risks, which might influence the successful adoption of BIM, in order to facilitate the successful implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The risks used in the study were documented from the literature, and primary data were collected by a questionnaire survey. The analysis of the results was driven by univariate and inferential statistics (Analysis of Variance) to identify the emerging contractual and legal risks. Findings The findings showed that there were little significant differences in the mean rating of the occurrence of contractual and legal risks between the respondents. The study confirmed that emerging risks are likely to be related to BIM documentations, intellectual rights and liability, missing data and misplaced assumptions among project stakeholders. The results showed that BIM success depends on close collaboration, at the outset of the project, with the client, designers, contractors and consultants. Originality/value Important legal and contractual risks have been identified in the application of BIM. It renders a new understanding of the risks that might influence the successful adoption of BIM.

J	Zhong, Y; Ling, FYY; Wu, P				Zhong, Yun; Ling, Florence Yean Yng; Wu, Peng			Using Multiple Attribute Value Technique for the Selection of Structural Frame Material to Achieve Sustainability and Constructability	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Structural material; Economic sustainability; Constructability; Multiple attribute value technique; Structural steel; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable construction	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; CONCRETE; ENERGY; CONSTRUCTION; EFFICIENCY; EMISSIONS; MODEL	Selecting appropriate structural materials to meet economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and constructability performance can be a challenge as these parameters are not mutually exclusive. This study therefore aims to build a model for the selection of structural frame material that integrates economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and constructability considerations. The research method is through a detailed investigation of 39 construction projects. Data were collected from archival records and interviews with 148 project participants. From the data, importance weights and performance levels of two structural materials-reinforced concrete (RC) and structural steel (SS)-are determined. It is found that SS-framed buildings outperform RC-framed buildings in the aspects of environmental sustainability and constructability, while RC-framed buildings have better economic performance. Furthermore, environmental sustainability and constructability performance are perceived to be of significantly lower importance than economic sustainability. Using the multiattribute value technique, a model to assist in the selection of structural material was constructed and tested. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a mathematical model that calculates the structural frame material (SFM) score based on an integrated consideration of economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and constructability. The model is recommended to clients and designers to assist in the selection of structural frame materials in the concept and preliminary design stage. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Experience in Expert Estimation of Probabilities and Correlations for Rail Line Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Expert interviews; Probability and correlation estimation; Biases; Questionnaire; Rail lines		To counteract cost escalation and delays in infrastructure construction, an estimation model has been developed that simulates project uncertainty with probability distributions, correlations, and disruptive events. When applied to a new rail line project, three model inputs were not available from the designers: time distributions, cost correlations, and probability of occurrence and cost/time impacts of disruptive events. Experts in the field of tunnel-, viaduct-, and earthwork construction were asked to estimate the unavailable information. This paper presents a brief overview of biases that occur when experts estimate probabilities, the calibration steps taken to prevent the experts from being affected by such biases, and example questions from the questionnaire, followed by an in-depth discussion of findings. Unexpectedly, the experts followed radically different estimation techniques: the tunnel expert recalled values from past projects, the viaduct expert calculated the required values, while the earthwork expert estimated the mode value, and from it, the extreme values. Depending on estimation technique, a bias influences or cannot influence an expert. It was also observed that experts not familiar with probability theory encountered major difficulties in correlation estimation, despite concept explanation and visualization. Thus, for a successful correlation estimation it is paramount that experts be acquainted with probability theory in addition to being knowledgeable in their fields.

J	Biagini, C; Capone, P; Donato, V; Facchini, N				Biagini, Carlo; Capone, Pietro; Donato, Vincenzo; Facchini, Nora			Towards the BIM implementation for historical building restoration sites	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Historical building heritage; Historical Building Information Modelling; Building restoration site; Site workflow		Dealing with the renovation and restoration of historical building heritage often means facing several difficulties which not only concern ways of representing the ancient building and the design ideas, but also the phases of on-site interventions. The designers must always take into account a range of possible and compatible solutions that avoid endangering the cultural significance of the historical building. Traditional methods are often time-consuming and barely efficient, because they are related to the exchange of two-dimensional and paper-based support information. Building Information Modelling (BIM) may represent an answer to these problems, allowing users to model the three-dimensional compounds of the building and to link a variety of information to it. The aim of this article is to propose an innovative approach to the construction management of historical building interventions, based on BIM technologies, and explore different issues such as: parametric modelling of historical buildings, starting with laser scanner survey: LoD (level of detail) definition and measurement accuracy, with relation to modelling procedures; parametric modelling of the site and the several phases of restoration work in a fixed schedule (4D dimension); 3D graphic representation of safety procedures and related tools.

Case Study on the Effect of 690 mpa (100 ksi) Steel Reinforcement on Concrete Productivity in Buildings	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Reinforced concrete; Steel; Construction materials; Productivity; Case studies; Reinforced concrete; High-strength steel; Material technology; Productivity		High-strength steel reinforcement in buildings had previously been limited to specialized applications, but recently published design guidance allows expanded use. A case study, conducted to investigate productivity benefits of using 690mpa (100ksi) versus 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement, found that there was little to no benefit in using 690mpa (100ksi) steel in slabs, post-tensioned girders, and columns, but the beam reinforcement weight was reduced by 36%. The 2010 material cost ratio of 690mpa (100ksi) to 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement was two, outstripping the weight reduction. However, labor cost is a function of weight, bringing the overall cost of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement to within 35% of 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement cost. The material cost ratio will presumably decrease over time; if it drops by 30% or more, 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement will be more economical. Labor costs, which vary by location, strongly influence the productivity benefits of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement. The use of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement is more favorable in expensive labor markets and it appears to be currently competitive in some. The paper's primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the quantitative understanding of the economic factors that influence the ability of 690mpa (100ksi) steel reinforcement to have a productivity advantage over the use of conventional 414mpa (60ksi) steel reinforcement. Practitioners, designers, and researchers can use this information to understand the cost and productivity impact of high-strength reinforcing steel.

J	Kleindienst, S; Andersen, M				Kleindienst, Sian; Andersen, Marilyne			Comprehensive annual daylight design through a goal-based approach	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building design; building performance; daylight design; daylight simulation; glare; goal-based metrics; illuminance; solar heat gain; temporal maps	HEALTH-CARE; LIGHT; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; ALERTNESS; HUMANS; OFFICE; SYSTEM; MODEL	Decisions affecting building form and orientation, and choices regarding opening size, type and positioning have a great effect on the building's access to daylight and are typically made during the earliest stages of architectural design. Computer simulations of daylight performance have become a powerful tool for making design decisions, especially since the diurnal and seasonal changes in daylight necessitate an annual, climate inclusive performance analysis because of the strong influence of climate conditions on daylight accessibility. However, the amount and complexity of information generated by an annual analysis can be overwhelming, so a need exists for appropriate, user-friendly methods to process and communicate these data to the designer. To address this problem, an alternative approach to traditional daylight analysis is explored here to develop appropriate goal-based metrics and annual graphic display formats which present illuminance, glare and solar heat gain data with a focus on time variations. Graphic outputs are created using the temporal map format to improve understanding of daylight performance as it varies over the year, and to enable comparisons to be made between spatial and non-spatial quantities. In particular, a consistent and intuitive triangular colour scale is proposed to express goal compliance, so as to enhance further comparability between dissimilar quantities and thereby assist with critical choices and performance tradeoffs during the design process.

Our approach combines automation and interactivity. From a simple specification of the plant room geometry (an orthogonal polygon with known obstructions, openings and external walls), and the heating load in kW, our software proceeds through a number of steps. First, the number and size of standard modular boilers, pumps, etc., are determined from the heat load. Then, a compatible optimising 3D variational solution is generated, using Constraint Logic Programming. To do this, we firstly enumerate a satisfactory topological solution, and then refine it to form a compatible geometrical solution. The final step generates pipe routes, using optimisation techniques to minimise the length of pipes and the number of bends. The solution obtained can be modified or improved by the designer, for which we have interactivity. Modifying the topology of the solution or the geometry of the plant room is done directly through the graphic interface, e.g. modifying a boiler position is done by dragging; the system automatically updates the 3D model including the pipe routing while maintaining all the design rules. The solutions generated by our prototype have been tested against conventional solutions in a benchmarking exercise. Advantages have been underlined and suggestions for further development have been made.

J	Jin, ZY; Gambatese, J				Jin, Ziyu; Gambatese, John			Exploring the Potential of Technological Innovations for Temporary Structures: A Survey Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Anniversary Conference of the International-Group-for-Lean-Construction (IGLC)	2017	Heraklion, GREECE				BUILDING STRUCTURES; CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM; SAFETY; FAILURES; DESIGN; SELECTION; PROJECT; CIVIL; MODEL	Technology innovations, such as virtual design and construction (VDC) tools, light detection and ranging (lidar), global positioning system (GPS), and other vision-based or sensor-based systems, provide approaches that designers, builders, and other stakeholders can adopt to address, manage, and tackle design, planning, and site safety issues effectively during the design and construction phases. Nevertheless, the majority of technology applications have focused on permanent structures rather than temporary structures such as concrete formwork and scaffolding. Due to the temporary nature of temporary structures, stakeholders might easily underestimate their importance and pay less attention to their safety, quality, and performance. Therefore, the benefits received for temporary structures as a result of the development of advanced technologies have been limited. This paper aims to investigate, through a survey questionnaire, the current practices related to the level of attention given to temporary structures compared with that of permanent structures, and professionals' viewpoints of using construction innovations on temporary structures. Based on empirical evidence from professionals who have experience with either designing or constructing temporary structures, the findings reveal that the industry currently pays less attention to temporary structures, and more attention is anticipated to improve safety performance related to temporary structures. In general, design and construction professionals hold positive attitudes toward applying construction innovations on temporary structures to improve the design quality and structural health when they are in use.

In this context of voluntary Web site adoption and use, we provide a more precise understanding of the nomological network related to the cognitive variables (both beliefs and attitudes) that precede this use. Designers and engineers need to be concerned not just with building an objectively better Web site but also with building a Web site that conveys desirable characteristics. Although the theory of reasoned action has been acknowledged as the underlying theory for technology acceptance and some trust research, past studies integrating these two theories have omitted important variables from their models and have posited different causal relationships among model variables. This research argues for the reinclusion and/or clarification of belief and attitude constructs relevant to technology acceptance and trust research streams, explains why these constructs are critical for understanding causality in such models, proposes an integration model that is consistent with this argument, and finally tests this model in a context exploring initial reactions to an e-vendor and evaluates the relative importance of trust and technology acceptance variables in predicting user intentions.

This paper proposes viable low-carbon adaptation strategies for a recurrent building type within the Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) zone. An existing 23-storey tower in Hangzhou is investigated within the context of a representative city environment. Indoor air temperatures and energy consumption were monitored across a typical floor and simulated in EnergyPlus. Outdoor and indoor airflow patterns were modelled in an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool, FLUIDITY. Across a typical floor, observations and modelling show marked variations. South-facing flats overheat significantly in summer largely due to solar radiation. External sun-shading structures are proposed and evaluated to counter summer overheating. An innovative wind catcher and exhaust-stack natural ventilation system is proposed to enhance indoor thermal comfort using natural ventilation. Modelling of this integrated ventilation system indicates that the proposed retrofit system will improve indoor thermal comfort even in the lower floors. The proposed building retrofit strategy is costed using locally established construction cost estimates. Predicted energy savings suggest that the adaptation strategy proposed is potentially viable with significant implications for policy-makers, developers, constructors and designers in this challenging climate zone in China.

J	Chua, DKH; Godinot, M				Chua, DKH; Godinot, M			Use of a WBS matrix to improve interface management in projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Many researchers agree that smoother construction would result from better communication between designers and constructors about specific requirements and constraints for construction that can be incorporated into the design. The same principle can be generalized to apply to all the phases of a construction project (design, equipment procurement, transport, delivery, installation, and testing, as well as hand-over activities), to the different partners (main contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers), and even internally to the teams working on different parts of a system for the same contractor. Specific requirements and constraints at work interfaces that are technical, organizational, temporal, and geographical in nature have to be made transparent so that they can be managed and resolved to avoid unnecessary reworks and delays. This paper proposes to use the work breakdown structure (WBS) concept to improve work interface management. In the manufacturing industry, the WBS concept is well exploited by crossing a horizontal breakdown of production activities with a vertical breakdown of final products, thus obtaining a WBS matrix, which is more complete and useful than the classical WBS tree. In this paper, the WBS and interface management concepts are first clarified. Then, it is proposed to transpose the WBS matrix concept into the construction industry and to analyze, in a case study, how it may be used to improve interface management. The case study involves the construction of a segment of a mass rapid transit system comprising many specialty trades spanning track works, power supply, signaling, passenger vehicles, and control.

J	Azhar, S; Carlton, WA; Olsen, D; Ahmad, I				Azhar, Salman; Carlton, Wade A.; Olsen, Darren; Ahmad, Irtishad			Building information modeling for sustainable design and LEED (R) rating analysis	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Sustainable design; LEED (R) rating; Green building rating systems; Building performance analyses		Today, there is a high level of demand for sustainable buildings. The most important decisions regarding a building's sustainable features are made during the design and preconstruction stages. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) is the most widely adopted sustainable building rating system in the United States. For projects pursuing LEED (R) certification, designers have to conduct in-depth sustainability analyses based on a building's form, materials, context, and mechanical-electrical-plumbing (MEP) systems. Since Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one model, it creates an opportunity to conduct these analyses accurately and efficiently as compared to the traditional methods. In this exploratory research, a case study was conducted on Salisbury University's Perdue School of Business building to demonstrate the use of BIM for sustainable design and the LEED (R) certification process. First, a conceptual framework was developed to establish the relationship between BIM-based sustainability analyses and the LEED (R) certification process. Next, the framework was validated via this case study. The results of this study indicate that documentation supporting LEED (R) credits may be directly or indirectly prepared using the results of BIM-based sustainability analyses software. This process could streamline the LEED (R) certification process and save substantial time and resources which would otherwise be required using traditional methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kim, H; Anderson, K				Kim, Hyunjoo; Anderson, Kyle			Energy Modeling System Using Building Information Modeling Open Standards	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling; Energy simulation; Industry Foundation Classes extensible markup language (ifcXML); Interoperability; DOE-2; Energy simulation input (INP) file	SIMULATION; CONSUMPTION	There is an urgent need in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries for new programs and methods of producing reliable energy simulations using building information modeling (BIM) technology. Current methods and programs for running energy simulations are not very timely, are difficult to understand, and lack high interoperability between BIM and energy simulation software. It is necessary to improve on these drawbacks as design decisions are often made without the aid of energy modeling leading to the design and construction of nonoptimized buildings with respect to energy efficiency. The goal of this research project is to develop a new methodology to produce energy estimates from a BIM model expeditiously and to improve interoperability between the simulation engine and BIM software. In the proposed methodology, the extracted information from a BIM model is compiled into an input file and run in a popular energy simulation program on an hourly basis for a desired period. The case applied in this paper showed that the application of this methodology can be used to quickly provide energy simulations from BIM models. With the aid of an easy-to-run and easily understood energy simulation methodology, designers will be able to make more energy conscious decisions during the design phase and as changes in design requirements arise.

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings.

J	Nassar, K; Al-Kaisy, A				Nassar, Khaled; Al-Kaisy, Ahmed			Assessing sign occlusion in buildings using discrete event simulation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						sign visibility; sign occlusion; signage; discrete event simulation; sign placement and location; way finding		Correct sign placement in large buildings such as airports, railway stations or large academic buildings will have a significant impact on the usability of the building as well as having a beneficial impact on the way-finding characteristics of the pedestrian in these environments. This paper presents a discrete event simulation model that evaluates the effect of placement on the sign occlusion in architectural spaces. The simulation model allows the designers to identify optimum location for signs in a space to maximize visibility and minimize occlusion. The model takes into account the geometric configuration of the space, the occupant/pedestrian travel flow patterns, and the location of obstructions as well as the legibility distance. An analytical tool was developed where the movement and location of occupants'/pedestlians' legibility zones and. obstructions are simulated at any point in time. The model also accounts for variables like the location of obstructions, sign design, and the primary and secondary travel paths of occupants/pedestrians. The occlusion of wall and ceiling-mounted signs by obstructions is estimated using two measures. The first measure is the probability of a sign being occluded under certain space design and geometric conditions. The second measure estimates the likelihood of an occupant/pedestrian missing the sign based on the minimum time required for that occupant/pedestrian to detect, recognize and read the sign.

J	Swaffield, JA; Jack, LB				Swaffield, JA; Jack, LB			Simulation and analysis of airborne cross-contamination routes due to the operation of building drainage and vent systems	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						airborne contamination; building operation; disease vectors; drainage design; drainage systems; modelling infection; public health; water seals; water traps	PRESSURE TRANSIENT PROPAGATION	Recent concerns about the role of the drainage and vent systems installed in high-rise and other buildings in the possible spread of airborne contamination have highlighted the need for simulations capable of predicting system response when subject to multiple and random events. Such simulations would allow designers to predict the possible contamination routes established as a result of failures of the system, e.g. trap seal loss and/or the influence of dried-out traps. In addition, the simulations proposed would provide diagnostic tools in the event of cross-contamination. Mathematical solutions are used to simulate the system unsteady water and entrained airflows, and the application of these simulations to predict likely contamination routes. The AIRNET simulation is employed to represent the unsteady air and water down-flow conditions in the network, the associated propagation of air pressure transients and trap response. The simulation can provide a design and standards development tool as well as a forensic and diagnostic tool for the investigation of suspected cross-contamination. The simulations confirm that cross-contamination routes result from normal operation and random failure conditions, including system surcharge and trap depletion due to, for example, poor maintenance. It suggests that simulation predictions have an important role in ascertaining potential hazards, as well as a forensic role.

J	Negash, YT; Hassan, AM				Negash, Yeneneh Tamirat; Hassan, Abdiqani Muse			Construction Project Success under Uncertainty: Interrelations among the External Environment, Intellectual Capital, and Project Attributes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; External environment; Intellectual capital; Fuzzy Delphi; Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory	IMPACT; AHP; IDENTIFICATION; CRITERIA	Prior studies have focused on identifying and ranking critical success factors (CSFs), but both their interdependence and the vagueness resulting from human judgment have been neglected. Furthermore, there is a need to explain CSFs from the short- and long-term planning horizons. This study aims to identify, rank, and examine the interdependence of the critical factors affecting construction projects in low-income economies. The study applied the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to validate subfactors identified from the literature. The hierarchical relationship between success factors and linguistic preferences is considered by using a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) methodology. The former is applied to rank the relative weights of the factors and subfactors, and the latter is used to discover the nature of their interrelationship. The results indicate that over the short term, the relationships with the clients, consultants, designers, top management, and the financial situation of the contractor are essential. However, for strategic management and long-term success, the most influential factors are the external environment and the types of projects undertaken. Therefore, the economic climate, technical and professional capabilities, and costs, funds, and resources should be the primary concerns when establishing the project goals. Furthermore, this study provides managerial and theoretical implications to guide construction projects from both short- and long-term perspectives. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Marx, J				Marx, J			A proposal for alternative methods for teaching digital design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-in-Architecture	OCT, 1998	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture				Computers have the potential to radically change the process of architectural design, and match more closely the formal aspirations of contemporary designers. What, then, should be the direction educators take in response to the opportunities created by the use of computers in the design process? There are, perhaps, two obvious methods of teaching Digital Design at a university level; a course adjunct to a design studio, or a course offered independently of a design studio. The computer is a facilitator of design ideas, but by itself, is not a creator of content. The primary responsibility of the design studio is the creation of content. It is the implementation of theory and critical analysis which should be the core concern of studio instruction. Given the limited time students are exposed to design studio it would seem appropriate, then, that the digital tools, which facilitate the design process, be taught separately, so as not to dilute the design studios importance. Likewise, this separation should allow the student to concentrate attention on Digital Design as a comprehensive process, beginning with initial massing studies and ending with high resolution presentation drawings. The burden of learning this new process is difficult as well as time consuming. Students are generally struggling to learn how to design, much less to design on the computer. In addition, the current lack of digital skills on the part of design faculty makes it difficult to create a level of consistency in teaching digital design. Compounding these problems is the cost to architectural departments of providing hardware and software resources sufficient to have a computer on every studio desk.

The work is based upon research on agent based Modeling and simulatitm techniques (ABMS), and the combination of analytical and optimization methods with geometric modeling and User centered design. The motivation is to render more accessible the exploration of the generative aspect of bottom up design techniques when coupled with optimization and performance criteria. The objective of the work is to develop and test a design methodology, which enables designers to explore larger sets of informed solutions by coupling design requirements and generative design techniques with validated simulations (i.e., environmental analysis) based partly on the inclusion of user light preferences early in the design process. The development of the proposed methodology and the implementation of the design system for a building facade are described, while the robustness and validity of the framework is initially tested by applying it to the generation and optimization of facade panel configurations of an office building. The results show that the MAS for design system can generate unique design configurations that perform environmentally (daylight factor analysis) better than a facade with normative facade shading.

Reliable and sufficient epistemic knowledge are required for predicting ground movements and controlling the displacement of adjacent structures. Hence, this paper provides a novel global sensitivity analysis method, namely the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) algorithm, to explore the building disturbance induced by tunnel excavation. The Wuhan Yangtze River Metro Tunnel (WYRMT) was used as a case study to verify the applicability of the proposed approach. The deterministic and stochastic finite-element (FE) model were used to develop the approximate relationship between the input and output parameters with a high level of accuracy. Based on the simulated data from the FE model, a metamodel constructed by particle swarm optimization-least squares support vector machine (PSO-LSSVM) was then built and has been used to generate 10,000 groups of data for sensitivity analysis. The input variables with a high global sensitivity were identified as crucial variables that should be well controlled and managed during tunnel excavation, which helps to reduce the building disturbance and safety risk induced by tunneling.

Integrated Prefabrication Configuration and Component Grouping for Resource Optimization of Precast Production	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prefabrication configuration; Component grouping; Project planning; Optimization; Mixed integer programming; Cost and schedule	INDUSTRY; MODEL	It may be possible to reduce uncertainty in construction projects by adopting the prefabrication method. In this method, components are produced in factories and transported to the construction site to satisfy installation demands. For successful and effective prefabrication, the project designer and precaster must develop an integrated plan to manage the available resources in a way that satisfies design flexibility, production constraints, and installation demands. Configuring individual building elements and forming building components or modular units will result in employing a higher degree of prefabrication for higher productivity and ease of construction. The production of such complex configurations requires complex molds. To achieve optimization of resources and costs for the precast production of complex configurations, two new ideas have been adopted: namely prefabrication configuration and component groups; these are incorporated into the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Moreover, an integrated plan is developed to efficiently utilize complex molds in production platform by using a mold adaptability matrix. Based on these concepts, an MILP optimization model is developed to adopt appropriate molds and create an optimal production plan. The model is validated by using two examples with different scenarios. The results show that employing the idea of prefabrication configuration and component grouping in production planning for prefabricated structures can reduce total costs by up to 13% compared to the existing planning approach. The developed model should help prefabrication manufacturers better manage their resources and possibly expand their production capacity. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Bingham, E; Gibson, GE; El Asmar, M				Bingham, Evan; Gibson, G. Edward, Jr.; El Asmar, Mounir			Measuring User Perceptions of Popular Transportation Project Delivery Methods Using Least Significant Difference Intervals and Multiple Range Tests	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DESIGN/BUILD	One of the most critical decisions made by transportation project stakeholders is the choice of a project delivery method for their project. Delivery methods have been shown to significantly impact project cost and schedule. As the use of alternative project delivery methods increases, the perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages to using a particular method have matured. This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals. The analyses show that delivery method selection is motivated primarily by project urgency, cost, and risk allocation. For the three main delivery methods of DBB, CMAR, and DB, motivation for their selection is primarily based on cost, risk allocation, and project urgency, respectively. User perceptions align with findings from literature in terms of schedule performance, but do not align in terms of cost performance. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by reporting on the most current motivating factors for the selection and use of the most popular delivery methods.

J	Ma, QW; Li, S; Cheung, SO				Ma, Qiuwen; Li, Shan; Cheung, Sai On			Unveiling Embedded Risks in Integrated Project Delivery	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integrated project delivery (IPD); Critical risks; IPD projects; Previous; future partnership	MANAGEMENT; COLLABORATION; CHALLENGES; EVOLUTION; ALTRUISM; PARTNER	Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is an innovative procurement approach through which the client, designer, and contractor work together under one contract as a team. While an integrated team is expected to be able to create extra value for the project, this practice may bring new risks if not all team members are committed. The slow uptake of IPD may possibly be due to the insufficient understanding of the risks involved, especially those hidden risks associated with inappropriate integration practice. This study identifies critical risks in IPD projects, and investigates if risk criticality can be alleviated by having previous or future partnership between IPD partners. By collecting the views of construction professionals on the level of criticality of general risks and IPD-specific risks, it is found that (1) most highly critical IPD project risks are borne from multidisciplinary teams of poor integration quality, inaccurate target costs, or unreasonable cost estimates; and (2) having future cooperation intent can significantly alleviate the criticality of certain IPD risks, whereas no effect of previous partnership was found on risk criticality. This study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on IPD by providing insight into the effect of new and general risks on IPD project outcomes in particular and clarifying the role of previous/future partnership in risk management. This study suggests active involvement of client and contractors in the design of IPD and signals future cooperation intent to IPD partners during the project process.

J	Senagala, M; Masden, K				Senagala, M; Masden, K			Interrupted interface on the cybernetics of digital design process	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Design E-ducation - Connecting the Real and the Virtual (eCAADe 2002)	2002	WARSAW, POLAND			design process; pedagogy; cybernetics; interface design; theory		From the viewpoint of Batesonian cybernetics, 'conscious purpose' and 'artistic process' are distinct ends of a spectrum of the functioning of 'self'. The conceptual stage of the design process is essentially an artistic activity unencumbered with accuracy, dimensionality, scale, program or even tectonics, albeit all of these maybe tacitly present at the 'back of a designer's mind'. Artistic activities involve broad mental processes that are beneath the stratum of consciousness. By definition, consciousness is selective awareness; it is linear in execution and limited in its capability to synthesize complex parameters. One of the central questions of this paper is "if artistic process requires one to abandon, or relinquish conscious purpose at the time of the generation of the work of art, and if the early stages of artistic process is a result of a vast number of 'unconscious' forces and impulses, then how can the computer, which demands (and thus propagates) geometric precision, focused operation and rational execution, be part of that process?" This paper will explore bow, cybernetically, the computer can be 'coupled' with 'self' (via a visual interface) and the artistic process. Three specially devised conceptual design exercises-namely BlurrDesign, BlinDesign and BlitzDesign-and three corresponding "interruptive" computer interface modifications were deployed in an introduction to digital media course. The results of this study are now under consideration for their effectiveness in promoting conceptual design using the computer, and how the 'self' might form a cybernetic whole with the machine. The findings could have implications in design pedagogy, informatics and interface design. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces the buildings - seven office, five educational and four other - and reviews aspects of their technical performance in a number of areas: building envelope and window design, heating, hot water and ventilation systems, artificial lighting, controls and operations and ICT (the energy and occupant surveys are reported in papers 3 and 4 of this series). The buildings are above average in performance for the UK - some exceptionally so - but nevertheless certain types of problem were widespread. Many buildings had poor airtightness and problems with controls, which sometimes seriously reduced occupant satisfaction and energy efficiency (which is discussed in more detail in paper 3). Important lessons for designers, owners, tenants and operators of buildings are described, based on feedback from Probe. For both old and new techniques and technologies there are frequently chronic, minor problems; often revealing the need to make components, systems and particularly their means of control more understandable to those using and operating them; to avoid unnecessary complication; for design to be appropriate to the management resources likely to be available to run the buildings; and for all but the simplest and most standardized buildings to have a period of 'sea trials' following completion in which performance is evaluated, problems fixed, and information collected for the benefit of the organizations concerned and of the whole industry.

A.; Giel, Brittany			BIM Cloud Score: Building Information Model and Modeling Performance Benchmarking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Performance evaluation; Productivity; Benchmarking; Information technologies		The rapid adoption of building information modeling (BIM) in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry in recent years has resulted in large differences in the level of BIM adoption and application among organizations. AECO stakeholders, including owners, general contractors, and designers, do not have a benchmark system for them to understand their own performance and know how to improve themselves. A cloud-based BIM performance benchmarking application, BIM Cloud Score (BIMCS), has been proposed to collect BIM performance data from BIM users nationwide in order to allow them to compare their BIM performance with the results collected from their industry peers. This research aims to develop and validate an initial list of metrics that are suitable for the proposed BIM benchmarking application. A survey was conducted in the AECO industry and included BIM authors (architects) and users (contractors) to validate the proposed initial list of metrics. The responses from the survey were used for initializing the metric weights for the benchmarking system. In addition, an analysis of the differences in perception among different groups of respondents showed that out of 26 variables used, the perceived importance of 6 variables was statistically different between BIM authors and BIM users. This result indicates that the surveyed architects and contractors were in agreement with the importance level for most of the variables proposed including model usefulness, model economy, and model productivity. Future adjustments of the metric weights might be needed in the implementation based on the different intended purposes for the BIM models.	[Liu, Rui; Issa, Raja R.

Defining Best Value for Construction Manager/General Contractor Projects: The CMGC Learning Curve	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project delivery; Construction management; Managers; Contractors; Alternative project delivery; Construction manager; general contractor; Procurement; Best value; Transportation		Construction manager/general contractor (CMGC) project delivery is rapidly being implemented to deliver the full gamut of highway projects across the United States. One issue that must be resolved before a public transportation agency can advertise a CMGC contract is whether or not to include price in the selection scheme, and if so, how much weight the price component will carry versus all other evaluation criteria. This paper discusses the results of research into this topic based on an analysis of the experience of 26 public transportation agencies on 36 CMGC projects in 14 U.S. states. The paper finds that there is a learning curve that can be mapped as the change in price factor weight over time as an agency gains experience with CMGC, and details that finding via a case study of the Utah Department of Transportation's CMGC program. The paper concludes that non-price factors, such as the CMGC contractor's approach to the preconstruction phase, are more important than price factors and should carry a greater weight in the evaluation plan. It also finds that weight accorded to price factors decreases as an agency gains CMGC experience. Finally, it recommends that agencies that are trying CMGC for the first time focus their selection scheme on factors that will reflect on a given contractor's ability to collaborate with the owner and designer during the preconstruction phases of the project rather than on obtaining the lowest price.

In this analysis, architecture design with an approach to optimizing energy consumption in the design of individual units, complex plan sites, and apartment sets using a computer was studied. Parameters affecting this research include the geometry of units, the arrangement and location relationship of buildings, and the form and height of apartment units. Different plans were produced by utilizing the initial plan of the designer and changing some aspects of it approved by the architectural design using the parametric modeling technique. Utilizing similar logic and a shift in the arrangement of buildings on the site, a variety of options were produced. By selecting existing and pre-designed plans, the optimal form was produced by computer. After computer-simulating each option, the energy analysis process was started for each building design. In the optimization process for each of the three designs, a genetic algorithm was used to achieve the optimal solution. After accomplishing the various stages of optimization, the final option compared with the initial design had reductions in energy consumption of 21% in plan design, 2% in site plan design, and 26% in apartment units form design. It should be noted that the processes of simulation and optimization were performed in the context of a continuous algorithm and by utilizing parametric tools that reduced the duration of this process.

J	Trinius, W; Sjostrom, C				Trinius, W; Sjostrom, C			Service life planning and performance requirements	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						performance requirements; performance-based building; service life planning; system levels		Service life planning comprises a model for the determination of a reasonable expected service life for buildings and components, and it establishes a routine for the assessment of design alternatives. A design option is considered reasonable when it meets or exceeds performance requirements over time that have been drawn up specifically for the specific project. Due to this assessment reference, there is a very evident link to the concept of performance-based building. Any stakeholder involved in the value chain or in the design process of the building, as well as regulators and building users, can express performance requirements. Identified requirements. both in relevance and in quality, will vary with the stakeholder and his/her perspective of interest. As building sector manufacturers develop most products with reference to standards rather than with reference to specific requirements. there is no direct link from user requirements to the product design. Instead, the building designer has the responsibility to ensure performance requirements are met by the performance of products integrated into the design. As these design decisions also have to be made at the material and component level, a performance-based building would benefit from an established rationale that enables the communication of performance requirements across the relevant system levels in the relevant design processes. A path for the connection of the established concepts of service life planning and performance-based building is presented. The aim is to identify key elements that need to be developed for the successful linkage of performance-based building with service life planning.

J	Nassar, K				Nassar, K			A procedure for multi-criteria selection of building assemblies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						building; design; optimization; assemblies; AHP; multi-criteria; construction; design; architecture; construction details; utility curves		During some of the different building design stages, typical construction materials/components are often grouped together to form what is called building assemblies. One of the most important tasks in the design development stage of building design is the selection of the appropriate building assemblies to be used in the various elements of the building, e.g. walls, roofs, floors and so on. This decision will have a significant impact on the performance of the building with respect to the various design criteria. Although this decision cannot be entirely separated from other design stages, the use of decision-making techniques can render this a more rational decision. In this paper, a computer tool is developed for selecting the best combination of building assemblies for each particular design situation. The tool utilizes some of the existing decision-making models in a single comprehensive procedure. In the described procedure, the building assemblies are selected by finding a trade-off between a set of designer-specified criteria. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the relative importance weights for the different criteria. In addition, various methods for determining an aggregated criteria performance for each alternative solution is described.

Application of 4D visualization technology for safety management in metro construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Metro construction; Safety management; Visualization technology; 4D	SIMULATION; DESIGN; MODEL	Safety accidents occur frequently in underground metro construction due to its complexity. These accidents cause huge losses because most metro construction is located in the center of very congested cities. Therefore, safety management is a priority in the metro construction industry. This paper proposes an approach for safety management using visualization technology. Safety is integrated with the construction management process throughout the project life cycle. Information from the design phase about construction components and scheduling has been gathered to formulate a 4 dimensional (4D) model. Before construction begins, a rule-based tool analyzes this combined information, automatically detects potentially unsafe activities and conditions and provides instructions for correction. More importantly, actual site monitoring data are continuously compared to the 4D model during the construction process. Therefore, the safety status of related components can be continuously visualized in the system as conditions change and potential safety risks evolve. This paper presents a prototype which was developed and verified with a case study of a real project. The results show that the proposed approach can be a tool of collaboration, virtual analysis and prediction for designers, site project managers, safety engineers and other participants. With real-time safety status visualized, it can detect safety risks before and during the construction process and then provide preventive measures. Thus, timely decisions can be made to avoid accidents. This contributes to the success of safety management in the metro construction industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ding, L.

J	Malsane, S; Matthews, J; Lockley, S; Love, PED; Greenwood, D				Malsane, Sagar; Matthews, Jane; Lockley, Steve; Love, Peter E. D.; Greenwood, David			Development of an object model for automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM standards; Interoperability; Knowledge formalisation; Object model; Compliance checking		Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently checked manually against a frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations. This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales.

Occupants' comfort and stress indices in a structural timber school building in the Northeast US in different seasons	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Occupants' comfort; stress indices; cross-laminated timber (CLT) school buildings; warm and cold periods; WBGT (Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature); UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) models	THERMAL COMFORT; HEAT-STRESS; CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; CLASSROOMS; TEMPERATURES	The study examines stress indices and occupants' comfort in a cross-laminated timber school building in the Northeast US in different seasons. The case study has won different awards for its sustainability credentials and use of structural timber for the construction. The environmental parameters were measured in the cold and warm periods. Thermal comfort models were applied to evaluate the occupants' comfort. The stress indices were computed using the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) models. The average internal temperatures of 20.2 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C were measured in the cold and warm periods. In the cold and warm seasons, the mean relative humidity values were 43.6% and 58.3%, respectively. Lower and higher temperatures were noted during the occupied and non-occupied hours, which can cause warm and cold discomfort. The proposed Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature and UTCI in the warm period are 3.4 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C higher than the values computed for the cold season. The overall results showed that no thermal stress is predicted in the spaces. The study recommends that designers should consider thorough assessments before recommending interventions in buildings. The study also suggests that occupants should be enabled to adjust the thermal environment of buildings outside the occupied hours.

However, exploring different design alternatives based on both is challenging. To support the design exploration of quantitative performance and geometry typology of various design alternatives during the early design stages of indoor arenas, this paper proposed a novel design method of SOM-MLPNN by combing self-organizing map (SOM) and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), based on the inspiration of local linear mapping based on self-organizing map (SOM-LLM). In SOM-LLM or SOM-MLPNN, the SOM can support designers to explore the whole design space according to geometry typologies and provides reference/labelled inputs for LLM/MLPNN to approximate multiple quantitative performance data for various design alternatives. Both SOM-LLM and SOM-MLPNN are applied and compared in a design of indoor arena. Besides the development of the method, original contributions include 1) proposing two operations (using a large size of SOM network and using a small amount of input data to train the SOM network) to save the computational time and increase the accuracy in data approximation and 2) proposing a series of data visualizations to interpret the results and support design explorations in different ways.

The conducted analysis focused on what impact different geographical areas of building construction and different energy performance classes of the building may had on the thickness of the thermo-insulation layer. Lithuania was chosen as the object of this study. Calculations were carried out in seven towns, including Vilnius, Klaipeda, Kaunas, Siauliai, Panevezys, Utena and Dukstas. According to requirements for legal acts passed in the Republic of Lithuania and to Directive 2010/31/EU (2010), as a result, the necessary thickness of thermo-insulation layers (EPS70) and a payback period were calculated. A multiple criteria decision support system for analyzing the correlation between the thickness of the thermo-insulation layer and its payback period of the external wall (DSS-ACTILPW) consisting of a database, a database management system, a model-base, a model-base management system and a user interface was developed. Information on the performed analysis is important to building designers, energy consumption auditors and investment experts who make the final decisions on energy efficiency of buildings in the residential building sector.

CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.

J	Gibb, AGF; Isack, F				Gibb, AGF; Isack, F			Re-engineering through pre-assembly: client expectations and drivers	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						business process re-engineering; clients; modularization; pre-assembly; re-engineering construction; system building		Pre-assembly is an important facet of the strategy to re-engineer construction. It can be categorized as: modular building; volumetric pre-assembly, non-volumetric pre-assembly and component manufacture/subassembly. This paper presents the results of an interview survey of major construction clients about their expectations from and drivers for pre-assembly on their projects. In particular, time, cost, quality and productivity benefits through minimization of on-site operations and duration, less congestion on site, improved health and safety along with greater and more predictable quality are identified. To get the best out of pre-assembly, clients acknowledge that they must be able to freeze the design early, provide reasonable lead times and provide time for presite prototyping. Clients' past experience has been mixed, with some citing tangible benefits, but others experiencing poor-quality products and a limited and disjointed supply chain - these mitigate against efforts to increase pre-assembly as part of the re-engineering mantra. Typically, clients accepted that suppliers should be involved early, but in practice many do not re-engineer the process and leave key decisions too late in the process to maximize benefits. More than half wanted to see an increase in the use of pre-assembly on their projects, but the supply chain must refocus to consider the client's perspective and capitalize on this opportunity. Whilst pre-assembly is not new and many have published on the subject, the perspective of clients has not been adequately covered. Pre-assembly may be well understood by manufacturers, contractors and even some designers, but unless the client decision-makers understand its benefits and limitations, then their misunder standings and prejudices will continue to be a barrier to further development.

J	Yu, WD; Hsu, JY				Yu, Wen-der; Hsu, Jia-yang			Content-based text mining technique for retrieval of CAD documents	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						CAD; Text mining; Information retrieval; Characteristic document; Construction engineering	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PROJECT	The computer aided design (CAD) document provides an effective communication medium, a legal contract document, and a reusable design case for a construction project. Due to technological advancements in CAD industry, the volume of CAD documents has been increased dramatically in the database of construction organizations. Traditional retrieval methods relied on textual naming and indexing schemes that require the designers (engineers and architects) to memorize in details the meta-information used to characterize the drawings. Such approaches easily overwhelmed the users' memory capability and thus caused low reusability of CAD documents. In this paper, a content-based text mining technique is adopted to extract the textual content of a CAD document into a characteristic document (CD), which can be retrieved with similarity matching using a Vector Space Model (VSM), so that the automated and expedited retrievals of CAD documents from vast CAD databases become possible. A prototype system, namely Content-based CAD document Retrieval System (CCRS), is developed to implement the proposed method. After preliminary testing with a CAD database with 2094 Chinese annotated CAD drawings collected from two real-world construction projects and a public engineering drawing database, the proposed CCRS is proven to retrieve all relevant CAD documents with relatively high precision when appropriate query is specified. Finally, three search strategies are recommended for the users to narrow down search scope while a target CAD document is desired. It is concluded that the proposed content-based text mining approach provides a promising solution to improve the current difficulty encountered in retrieval and reusability of vast CAD documents for the construction industry.

Global Collaborative Network of Skyscraper Projects from 1990 to 2010: Temporal Evolution and Spatial Characteristics	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Megaproject collaborative network; Skyscraper; Social network analysis; Spatial characteristics; Temporal evolution	SOCIAL NETWORKS; BUSINESS; MEGAPROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; CENTRALITY; REPUTATION; POWER	With architecture, engineering, and construction projects tending to be larger and more complex, their participating organizations are becoming more diversified and internationalized. This is particularly true for megaprojects that require higher levels of specialized workforces and exhibit more complicated organizational relationships. To examine the characteristics of megaproject collaboration from a dynamic network perspective, this research selected skyscraper projects as a featured megaproject field. A total of 422 completed skyscraper projects over 250 m in height that were built from 1990 to 2010 worldwide, as well as more than 1,100 participating organizations, were analyzed using social network analysis. Increasingly tight and interwoven collaborative relationships in the discrete-time global skyscraper networks were found, and design firms played a vital role by holding central network positions over time, indicating the importance of the design phase in skyscraper projects. The distinctive interregional and/or intraregional collaboration features were revealed at different geographical settings. Designers, especially those from North America, Europe, and Oceania, were also more active and thus successful in participating in skyscraper projects abroad, mostly in Asia and the Middle East, whereas the general contractors were more generally involved in local projects. The identified preferential attachment phenomenon and regional collaborative features led to the network topology dynamics. This study not only contributes to an holistic understanding of the status quo and development trends of the skyscraper industry integrating network theory with megaproject management, but also provides a reference for corporate practices and decision making in the specific megaproject field.

J	Viles, E; Rudeli, NC; Santilli, A				Viles, Elisabeth; Rudeli, Natalia Carolina; Santilli, Adrian			Causes of delay in construction projects: a quantitative analysis	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Design management; Construction planning	COST; OVERRUNS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to perform a quantitative analysis of the literature in order to determine the main causes of delay in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A set of 47 articles from the literature were analyzed, yielding 1,057 different causes of delay. In order to analyze and compare the main causes of delay, their degree of impact was studied statistically. Next, a mention count method was used to determine the primary causes of construction project delays and through the use of Pareto diagrams, the main causes of delays in construction projects were determined. Findings It was determined that the three main causes of construction project delay are problems that occur during execution, administrative problems and labor conflicts; together they account for almost 80 percent of the causes found in the literature. Moreover, it was deduced that problems during execution are based on unpredictable events, while administrative problems are rooted in poor cash flow management. In addition, seven sub-groups of delay causes were identified as being major due to the number of mentions detected. These were "Changes during construction," "Poor construction management," "Construction errors," "Economic/Financial," "Conflict/Relationship" and "Lack of experience." Social implications Identifying the factors and causes of the delays will allow mitigation actions to be taken in order to avoid delays, which will ultimately allow homes, schools, hospitals and other necessary infrastructure to be delivered on time or even before the planned date.

Dynamic shading systems: A review of design parameters, platforms and evaluation strategies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Geometries; Mechanisms; Control systems; Dynamic shading systems; Responsive architecture	ENERGY PERFORMANCE; DAYLIGHTING SYSTEM; OFFICE BUILDINGS; VISUAL COMFORT; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; DEVICES; FACADES; OPERATION; SUPPORT	The advancements in software and hardware technologies provide opportunities for solar shading systems to function dynamically within their context. This development has helped dynamic shading systems respond to variable environmental parameters such as sun angles and solar insolation. However, the technical understanding of system design, mechanism and controlling methods presents a challenge for architects and designers. Therefore, this study aims to review the current applications and trends of dynamic shading systems to clarify the potentials and limitations in enhancing system performance based on integrated design objectives. This study assessed several systems on the basis of a critical review to identify different models, applications and methodologies. This study is divided into two main sections: (i) design elements and platforms that engage with specific methods in creating a dynamic shading system and (ii) evaluation strategies to examine system performance. The systems were investigated based on the multiplicity and integration of the parameters involved through various components, such as architectural, mechanical, operational and automation components. The review analysed various studies on the following two bases: (1) geometric-based analysis, which distinguishes between simple and complex shading models, and (2) performance-based analysis, which assesses the shading systems based on two groups of methodologies, namely, theoretical and experimental. The outcome of the review reflects a clear classification of shading models and a comprehensive analysis of their performance. This study generally provides a systematic framework for architects based on thorough research and investigation. Finally, the study introduced several findings and recommendations to improve the performance of dynamic shading systems.

But there has not been a comparable progress in the development of tools intended to assist design to generate architectural forms in an easy and interactive way. Even worse, architects who use the powerful means provided by computers as a direct tool to create architectural forms are still an exception. Architecture continues to be produced by traditional means using the computer as little more than a drafting tool. The main reasons that may explain this situation can be identified rather easily, although there will be significant differences of opinion. In my opinion, it is a mistake trying to advance too rapidly and, for instance, proposing integrated design methods using expert systems and artificial intelligence while no adequate tools to generate and modify simple 3D-models are available. The modeling tools we have at the present moment are unsatisfactory. Their principal limitation is the lack of appropriate instruments to modify interactively the model once it has been created. This is a fundamental aspect in any design activity, where the designer is constantly going forward and backwards, re-elaborating once and again some particular aspect of the model, or its general layout, or even coming back to a previous solution that had been temporarily abandoned. This paper presents a general summary of the actual situation and recent developments that may be incorporated to architectural design tools in a near future, together with some critical remarks about their relevance to architecture.

J	Faucher, D; Nivet, ML				Faucher, D; Nivet, ML			Playing with design intents: integrating physical and urban constraints in CAD	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-in-Architecture	OCT, 1998	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture			SIMULATION	Our work deals with the exploration of a universe of forms that satisfy some design intents. That is, we substitute a "generate and test" approach for a declarative approach in which an object is created from its properties. In this paper we present an original method that takes into account design intents relative to sunlight, visibility and urban regulation. First df all we study how current CAD tools have considered these properties until now. Our conclusion is that the classical design/simulation/analysis process does not suit design practices, especially in the early stages. We think that an improved CAD system should offer the architect the option of manipulating abstract information such as design intents. We define an intent as a conceptual expression of constraints having an influence on the project. For instance, a visual intent will be stated with no reference to vision geometry: "from this place, I want to see the front of the new building". We show how to represent each of these constraints with a 3D volume associated to some characteristics. If some solutions exist, we are sure that they are included in these volumes. For physical phenomena we compute the volume geometry using the principles of inverse simulation. In the case of urban regulation we apply deduction rules. Design intents are solved by means of geometrical entities that represent openings or obstructions in the project. Computing constraint volumes is a way of guiding the architect in his exploration of solutions. Constraint volumes are new spaces that can restore the link between form and phenomenon in a CAD tool. Our approach offers the designer the possibility of manipulating design intents.

J	Mollaoglu, S; Sparkling, A; Thomas, S				Mollaoglu, Sinem; Sparkling, Anthony; Thomas, Sean			An Inquiry to Move an Underutilized Best Practice Forward: Barriers to Partnering in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						partnering; delphi method; barriers; trust; cultural; organizational; project team	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; MODEL; PROJECTS	There is an obvious need in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry for improved project team integration through project delivery to ensure improved project outcomes. The literature reports that, among other methods, project partnering, when followed successfully, provides a great opportunity to improve project performance via improved collaboration among key project stakeholders (e.g., owner, designer, contractor) and reduce claims as a result while letting all project members stay in their traditional roles and work under any contractual framework, including design-bid-build. Despite its potential and history in the United States since the late 1980s and being classified as one of the best practices by the Construction Industry Institute in 1996, partnering continues to be underutilized. Existing research on partnering is mostly limited to public projects such as mega roadway and bridge projects. Guided by the literature, the aim of this research is to understand and report barriers to project partnering in the United States from both vertical/horizontal and public/private construction sectors. Via a comprehensive literature review, followed by a Delphi survey of partnering experts, this study systematically classified barriers to project partnering. In study results, implementation barriers to partnering during project delivery are more frequently pronounced than the barriers to its adoption. Of the top reported barriers to project partnering, the majority are cultural; project team related barriers show the greatest area of potential for improvement; and contrary to the literature, none is legislative. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by drawing attention to project delivery and management practices in the AEC industry to improve team collaboration and chances of successful implementation and adoption of integrative practices.

A.; Olbina, Svetlana			Building Information Modeling in Support of Sustainable Design and Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling; Sustainability; Design; Construction		The use of building information modeling (BIM) has provided a means of increasing total project quality, providing accurate quantity take-offs, and improving scheduling, consequently diminishing total project contingencies and costs. Although BIM is a recent development, a lot of research has been conducted in order to further enhance the capabilities of BIM in design and construction. However, there has been very little research done so far on the effect that BIM has on sustainable construction practices. Hence, the goal of this research is to investigate the perceptions of the use of BIM for sustainable design and construction among designers and constructors. A survey was developed and administered through the Internet to determine the existing trends of BIM application in general as well as its use as a tool in sustainable design and construction. The survey results indicated that although the majority of the respondents believed that sustainable design and construction practices were of importance within their company, most still believed that sustainability was not a primary application of BIM and that project coordination and visualization were instead more important. Although BIM is perceived as a multidisciplinary tool, problems with interoperability continue to persist among the various BIM applications in the industry. In terms of project delivery methods, the majority of the survey respondents believed that design/build and integrated project delivery (IPD) are the optimal project delivery methods to integrate BIM as a sustainability tool. Although BIM is still a recent development, as more design and construction professionals understand the potential benefits offered through its use, BIM will become a vital tool for sustainable design and construction.

Buildability Factors Influencing Concreting Labor Productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Buildability; Labor productivity; Efficiency; Pumped concrete; Skipped concrete; Concrete volume; Height; Reinforcing steel congestion ratio; Workability; Categorical-regression	CONSTRUCTIBILITY IMPROVEMENT; CONSTRUCTABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Improving labor productivity of in situ reinforced concrete construction is necessary because of the importance of this material to the industry. Several factors influence labor productivity, but buildability is among the most important. Despite the plethora of research into construction productivity reported over the years, a thorough examination of the literature revealed a dearth of research into the effects of buildability factors on the efficiency of the concreting operation. Because concreting is an integral, labor intensive, trade of in situ reinforced concrete construction, the objective of this research is to explore the influence of primary buildability factors on concreting labor productivity. In achieving this objective, a sufficiently large volume of productivity data was collected and analyzed by using the categorical-regression method. As a result, the effects and relative influence of: (1) concrete workability; (2) reinforcing steel congestion; (3) volume of pours; and (4) height relative to ground level, on labor productivity of skipped and pumped placement methods are determined and quantified. The findings show significant impacts of factors investigated on the efficiency of the concreting operation, which can provide designers with feedback on how well their designs consider the requirements of the buildability concept, and the tangible consequences of their decisions on the productivity of the operatives. Practical recommendations, moreover, are presented, which upon implementations, may improve the buildability level of this trade, thus translate into higher labor productivity and lower labor cost. On the other hand, the depicted patterns of results can provide guidance to construction managers for effective planning and efficient labor and plant utilization.

Pilgrims must stay in the Holy Area (Arafat) for one day as part of Hajj rituals. For this reason, pilgrims are housed in lightweight temporary structures: tents. In Arafat, these tents are constructed before each Hajj season. The arrangement of these tents differs from one year to another and from location to location. For the spatial and temporal constraints of ritual happening in Arafat, space optimization is an important issue. The extensive demand for a rapid, automatic, and high quality algorithm for feature extraction has been the subject of much recent research. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting and extracting tents using airborne images. The approach is used to calculate the areas covered by tents. It utilizes the intensity in digital images in two stages. First, it classifies tents from other features in Arafat's environment. Second, it calculates the number of tents based on image matching subroutines. This can evaluate the design and planning of tents' layout and space optimization. Using this automatic approach, the number of pilgrims in a tested area can also be estimated according to the average capacity of one-meter squares covered by tents. Moreover, services, utilities, and transportation needs can be determined more precisely. An actual sample area in Arafat during the Hajj season is used to test the approach developed in this research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the root causes of changes in hospital construction projects. The paper aims to propose ways to prepare for the changes. Design/methodology/approach - The study focuses on changes during the construction of new hospital facilities. An explorative, case study research design is utilised. Five case projects from Finland, Sweden and the USA were selected for in-depth analysis. The primary data comprise semi-structured interviews, supported by secondary evidence such as change order documents. Findings - The findings reveal eight categories for change sources: contracts, and equipment and systems are reflective of the fast-paced healthcare technology and changing user requirements, while external environment comprises changes caused by both regulatory and physical environment. Changes in operations are reflected in the continuous development of treatment methods and processes. The user, owner, designer and contractor initiated changes represent the stakeholder influence. The paper makes a connection between these change sources and project complexity dimension. A framework for change dynamics is introduced, and product and process flexibility is suggested as a suitable method to prepare for and manage changes. Originality/value - The paper is the first to link construction changes to project complexity factors. The paper argues that changes, when managed appropriately, are not only necessary but also beneficial to large construction projects in a quickly changing environment. The findings guide project stakeholders in implementing project flexibility, in the product and process dimensions, which is a balancing force to project complexity.

Dynamic and Proactive Risk-Based Methodology for Managing Excessive Geometric Variability Issues in Modular Construction Projects Using Bayesian Theory	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Excessive geometric variability; Tolerances; Modular construction; Bayesian theory; Dynamic risk assessment; Proactive management; Decision support	OFF-SITE PRODUCTION; HONG-KONG; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; SAFETY	Managing excessive geometric variability risks (i.e., out-of-tolerance and out-of-alignment issues) represents a major challenge in modular construction projects, owing to lack of accurate data on modularization process capabilities for fabrication, transportation, and erection at the early design phase. Unrealistic and insufficient modularization process capability data typically convey a misleading risk profile and result in suboptimal mitigation solutions, which can in turn lead to cost overruns, schedule delays, quality issues, and owner dissatisfaction. Current modularization practices and previously developed risk management frameworks apply static risk assessment and management techniques, which do not enable updating of the generic information and initial assessment of the risk profile, when more realistic data become available. To address this persistent challenge in modular construction projects, this paper aims to introduce a systematic methodology that employs Bayesian inference theory for the dynamic assessment and proactive management of excessive geometric variability issues. The developed methodology includes a practical process for continual (1) updating of initial estimates of the performance of tolerance-based mitigation strategies based on real-time data, (2) reassessment of the risk profile, and (3) refinement of risk response decisions. The results of the case study described subsequently in this paper demonstrate how key project stakeholders and modular construction managers (e.g., designers, fabricators, and contractors) can use this methodology to efficiently reduce uncertainty in tolerance-related risk estimates and proactively manage impacts to improve modularization performance and maximize its benefits.

However, to achieve more dependable results, proper energy analysis is needed to take into consideration the stochastic behavior of renewable energy, energy consumption in the building and vehicle use pattern. This study aims to stochastically model a building integrating photovoltaic panels as a microgeneration technology and EVs to meet NZEB requirements. Design/methodology/approach First, a multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was developed to optimize the building energy performance considering panels installed on the facade. Next, a dynamic solution is implemented in MATLAB to stochastically model electricity generation using solar panels as well as building and EV energy consumption. Besides, the Monte Carlo simulation method is used for quantifying the uncertainty of NZEB performance. To investigate the impact of weather on both energy consumption and generation, the model is tested in five different climatic zones in Iran. Findings The results show that the stochastic simulation provides building designers with a variety of convenient options to select the best design based on level of confidence and desired budget. Furthermore, economic evaluation signifies that investing in all studied cities is profitable. Originality/value Considering the uncertainty in building energy demand and PV power generation as well as EV mobility and the charging-discharging power profile for evaluating building energy performance is the main contribution of this study.

J	Chen, JL; Augenbroe, G; Song, XY				Chen, Jianli; Augenbroe, Godfried; Song, Xinyi			Lighted-weighted model predictive control for hybrid ventilation operation based on clusters of neural network models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article							URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; PART II; ENERGY; BUILDINGS; PERFORMANCE; PARAMETERIZATION	As one of the most significant factors to determine the success of a hybrid ventilation building, the control strategy for the hybrid ventilation operation attracts increasing attentions from both building designers and researchers these years. Recent advancements of the building control strategy have shown the potential to improve the hybrid ventilation operation. In this paper, we demonstrate the development of an advanced data driven model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, i.e. a light-weighted three phase NN (neural network) model, for controlling the operation of hybrid ventilation buildings. To develop a robust model predictive control algorithm, firstly, different levels of uncertainties that commonly exist in the real world and building simulation are quantified to efficiently train the central model of the MPC and thoroughly test it in the future. In addition, in the model predictive control establishment process, four candidate mathematical models and ten prediction variables were analyzed during the MPC development to investigate its performance on the prediction as well. The results show that the neural network (NN) achieves the best performance considering both prediction performance and computation time. Six variables including the indoor and outdoor air temperature, relative humidity, office and season index and wind speed were finally chosen. At last, we conduct the validation of the algorithm for hybrid ventilation across four cities in different US climates under uncertainties presented in real practice. The comparison between the MPC and the rule-based control clearly presents that the developed MPC could be better at maintaining the thermal comfort of hybrid ventilation buildings while achieving a comparable amount of energy savings.

J	Lindkvist, L; Hjorth, D				Lindkvist, Lars; Hjorth, Daniel			Organizing cultural projects through legitimising as cultural entrepreneurship	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Legitimacy; Cultural industries; Cultural entrepreneurship; Organization-creation; Vandalorum	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RESOURCES; CREATION	Purpose - This paper is a study of creating organization in the case of cultural projects; cultural entrepreneurship. This includes taking advantage of opportunities and using ones social capital through networks. It is a case study of Vandalorum which is an Swedish international art and design centre with a strong regional connection. They want to offer close collaborations between artists, designers and the creative industry. It is located in Varnamo in the south of Sweden and was inaugurated in April 2011 after an establishment process running over 15 years. Renzo Piano has created the architectural concept of Vandalorum, inspired by traditional Swedish materials and building techniques. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Through interviews with significant actors over many years and secondary analysis of data collected by others the authors describe and analyze the establishment process of Vandalorum Art and Design Centre. Findings - The case of Vandalorum shows that organizing a cultural project like Vandalorum is characterized by no well-defined starting and stopping point, but - quite typically for entrepreneurship as an organization-creation process - builds momentum and legitimacy narratively. Originality/value - The originality lies in answering the question that the authors chose to focus on, which is embedded in the opening story of Vandalorum: how can such a cultural project become legitimized in a place like that, outside and rather far from any large city? In a changed cultural landscape with reduced public contributions, the claim is that it is crucial to legitimize the idea and project in relation to the main/key stakeholders. Such legitimization is a key entrepreneurial achievement.

J	Dijkstra, J; Timmermans, H				Dijkstra, J; Timmermans, H			Towards a multi-agent model for visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of design performance	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Media and Design Process	1999	SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH			multi-agent model; design performance; cellular automata grid	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; TRAFFIC FLOW	We introduce the outline of a multi-agent model that can be used for visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of design performance. We will consider various performance indicators of building environments, which are related to user reaction to design decisions. This system may serve as a media tool in the design process for a better understanding of what the design will look like, especially for those cases where design or planning decisions will affect the behavior of individuals. The system is based on cellular automata and multi-agent simulation technology. The system simulates how agents move around in a particular 3D (or 2D) environment, in which space is represented as a lattice of cells. Agents represent objects or people with their own behavior, moving over the network. Each agent will be located in a simulated space, based on the cellular automata grid. Each iteration of the simulation is based on a parallel update of the agents conforming local rules. Agents positioned within an environment will need sensors to perceive their local neighborhood and some means with which to affect the environment. In this way, autonomous individuals and the interaction between them can be simulated by the system. As a result, designers can use the system to assess the likely consequences of their design decisions on user behavior. We think that the system provides a potentially valuable tool to support design and decision-making processes, related to user behavior in architecture and urban planning.

J	Mallasi, Z				Mallasi, Zaki			Designing with pixels: parametric thinking for patterning dynamic building facades	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building facade; Computational design; Image pixels; Parametric modelling; Patterning		Purpose Advances in digital design tools enable exploration and generation of dynamic building facades. However, some processes are formally prescribed and manually driven to only visualize the design concepts. The purpose of this paper is to present a proactive framework for integrating parametric design thinking, paying particular attention to building facade patterning. Design/methodology/approach This work developed the PatternGen((c)) add-on in Autodesk (R) Revit which utilizes an analytical image data (AID) overlay approach as a data source to dynamically pattern the building facade. The add-on was used to manipulate the placement rules of curtain panels on facade surface geometry. As means of validating this research model, a real-life design project has been chosen to illustrate the practical application of this approach. Feedback and observations from a short end-user questionnaire assessed qualitatively the facade patterning and panelization approach. Findings The proposed merge (or overlay) of AID images can be used as a parametric thinking method rather than just theory to generate and articulate dynamic facade design. The facade panelization responds to an AID that resembles design-performance data (e.g. solar exposure, interior privacy importance and aesthetics). Originality/value This work identifies a form of parametric thinking defined as the expression of geometrical relationships and its configuration dependent on the AID pixel Red Green Blue color source values. In this type of thinking, it explores the impact of the digital process and parametric thinking utility when driven by an AID overlay. The framework highlighted the practical application of AID pixel approach within a digital process to benefit both designers and computational tools developer on emerging design innovations.

Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process. In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine. The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings.

Restructuration of architectural practice in integrated project delivery (IPD): two case studies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IPD; Architecture; Integration; Design management; Case study; Integrated project delivery; Integrated practice; Architectural practice; Restructuration	CONTRACTORS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to clarify that while integrated project delivery (IPD) methods can be momenta for restructuring architectural practice, they do not predetermine specific patterns of restructuration for the roles, responsibilities and services of architects. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a multiple case study design; two IPD projects were theoretically sampled and studied. The data collection methods included semi-structured interviews and observations. An inductive data analysis approach was applied to frame the phenomena, conduct cross-case comparisons and develop propositions. Findings While IPD implementations set expectations for new structures for practices, it is the project participants' situated decisions that lead to the restructuration of some dimensions of architectural practice. The dimensions in this study included team formation, design leadership and collaboration and architectural services. IPD project participants locally changed and redefined conventional roles, responsibilities and project artifacts (e.g. drawings and models) that concerned design development and coordination. Practical implications - IPD context, by itself, does not predetermine a fixed pattern of change in establishing designers' roles, responsibilities and services because restructuration is highly negotiated amongst the IPD parties and can lead to different responses to this contractual setting. Contracts set expectations for collaborative behavior, but the fulfillment of these expectations is situated and emerging as project participants negotiate to develop practices. Originality/value - While IPD research and guidelines aim to provide recipes for IPD implementation, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by clarifying that IPD is a context in which unprecedented ways of practice restructuration could emerge.

But how accurate and realistic is this? Have we really managed to get computers to actually aid creative design and how effective is it? This paper discusses how we support the central creative design process itself It does this by exploring the implications of what we know so far about the cognitive processes involved in the human design process. It outlines some of the sub-systems we will need in order to develop true comprehensive computer-aided architectural design. We have had computer-aided design in architecture now for over four decades. During this time, the computer has been used in several quite different roles, some of which will be discussed here. However, so far, the contribution the computer has made to supporting creative design remains patchy and uncoordinated [B.R. Lawson, CAD and creativity: does the computer really help? Leonardo 35 (3) (2002) 327-331]. Why is this and what, if anything, can we do about it? One clue to this is that some four decades ago we also knew very little about the design process compared with our contemporary understanding [B.R.

It seeks to complement methods for measuring performance in construction by providing feedback and capturing perceptions of design quality embodied in buildings. The research team worked closely with the sponsors and an industry steering group to develop the indicators that could be readily used by clients and practitioners to better understand and promote value through design. The development and piloting process was explored within a context of lessons from earlier attempts by others. The three main elements of the DQI toolkit (conceptual framework, data-gathering tool, weighting mechanism) mapped the value of buildings in relation to their design for different uses and their ability to meet a variety of physical, aspirational and emotional needs of occupants and users. The DQI pilot studies consisting of five design and construction projects are discussed along with their graphical representation of results generated by end-users, individual team members and project teams. The process raises questions about the difficulties in the description and application of indicators for design quality. It is argued that the benefit of the DQI is a 'tool for thinking', rather than an absolute measure, because it has the potential to capture lessons from current building design for strategic future use as well as initiate, represent and inform discussions involving designers', clients', producers' and end-users' perceptions on the tangible and intangible aspects of possibilities within live design projects. The limitations of the approach, the next phase of development and further research issues are raised.

Workers' lower backs are often affected by heavy or repetitive lifting and prolonged awkward postures. Exoskeletal interventions are effective for tasks involving manual lifting and repetitive movements. This study aims to examine the potential of a postural-assist exoskeleton (a passive exoskeleton) for manual material handling tasks.Design/methodology/approachFrom an experimental observation of participants, the effects of postural-assist exoskeleton on tasks and workers were measured. Associated benefits of the exoskeleton were assessed through task performance, range of motion and discomfort.FindingsFindings suggest that the exoskeleton influenced discomfort significantly, however range of motion decreased with lifting tasks. The reduced back flexion and increased hip flexion were also indicatives of the participants' responsiveness to the feedback from the exoskeleton. In addition, task completion time increased by 20%, and participants' back pain did not reduce.Research limitations/implicationsThe work tasks were performed in a controlled laboratory environment and only wearable inertia measurement units (IMUs) were used to assess the risk exposures of the body parts.Practical implicationsThis study opens a practical pathway to human-exoskeleton integration, artificial regeneration or enablement of impaired workforce and a window toward a new order of productivity scaling. Results from this study provide preliminary insights to designers and innovators on the influence of postural assist exoskeleton on construction work. Project stakeholders can be informed of the suitability of the postural assist exoskeletons for manual material handling tasks.Originality/valueLittle has been reported on the benefits and impact of exoskeletons on tasks' physical demands and construction workers' performance. This study adds value to the existing literature, in particular by providing insights into the effectiveness and consequences of the postural-assist exoskeleton for manual material handling tasks.

Their work consists of subtasks that promote nonfatal injuries and pains that affect different body segments. The purpose of this study is to examine ergonomic exposures of carpentry subtasks involved in floor framing, how they lead to musculoskeletal injuries, and how preventive and protective interventions around them can be effective. Design/methodology/approach Using wearable sensors, this study characterizes ergonomic exposures of carpenters by measuring and analyzing body movement data relating to major subtasks in carpentry flooring work. The exposures are assessed using Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment classification, which is based on tasks involving repetitive subtasks and nonstatic postures. Findings The findings of this paper suggest severe risk impositions on the trunk, shoulder and elbow as a result of the measuring and marking and cutting out vent locations, as well as in placing and nailing boards into place. Research limitations/implications Because of the type and size of wearable sensor used, only results of risk exposures of four body-parts are presented. Practical implications This study draws insights on how to benchmark trade-specific measurement of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Safety efforts can be targeted toward these risk areas and subtasks. Specifically, results from these will assist designers and innovators in designing effective and adaptable protective interventions and safety trainings. Originality/value Extant studies have failed to provide adequate evidence regarding the relationships between subtasks and musculoskeletal disorders; they have only mimicked construction tasks through laboratory experimental scenarios. This study adds value to the existing literature, in particular by providing insights into hazards associated with floor carpentry subtasks.

Edward, Jr.; Zhang, Yuanxin; Shah, Dev			Industry Attitudes toward Alternative Contracting for Highway Construction in Florida	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Alternative contracting methods; Project delivery systems; Highway construction; Florida		Alternative contracting methods have become popular replacements for traditional practices based on low-bid acquisition. The benefits of decreased project duration, increased job quality, and improved delivery processes have demonstrated their value to the public over the years through the implementation of such methods as AthornB, design-build (D-B), incentive/disincentive (I/D), no excuse bonus (NEB), and lump sum (LS) contracting. In their continued efforts to gauge the performance of their Alternative Contracting Program in the administration of highway construction projects, the Florida DOT (FDOT) sought to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods compared with the traditional design-bid-build (DBB) system. The research team first examined literature and surveyed past project participants on common practice. Next, interviews were conducted to garner further insight on method-specific performance and general sentiment. To assess the effective administration of alternative contracting methods, this report provides the results of the surveys, interviews, method reviews, and recommendations. The results show that attitudes have improved over time both within and between project participants. Increased exposure, understanding, and use of newer alternative contracting methods has improved the manner in which state highway agencies more accurately select projects that use these methods. The data obtained from the implementation of these methods in this research will provide further substantive support for the use of nontraditional methods of project procurement. Furthermore, the expressed opinions of the designers, contractors, and inspectors in this research help shed light on the perceived benefits and drawbacks of each alternative contracting method. Moreover, understanding the personal views in the use of each method will aid in preventing and resolving party conflict. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Identification, Quantification, and Classification of Potential Safety Risk for Sustainable Construction in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk; Safety; Prevention through Design (PtD); Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Sustainable construction; Social equity	WORKER SAFETY; HEALTH; DESIGN	Sustainability is a balanced approach that puts equal focus on the environment, economy, and society. Research suggests that worker health and safety is an integral dimension of social sustainability. The present research contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing, quantifying, and classifying occupational health and safety (OHS) risk associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance of sustainable projects across the United States construction industry and compares it with OHS risk encountered on nonsustainable counterpart projects. The researchers conducted a credit-by-credit review of the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating system to evaluate the potential positive or negative impact of green design elements and construction practices associated with the implementation of LEED credits on the OHS of construction and maintenance workers. The researchers also quantified OHS risk associated with LEED credits on 41 green projects distributed across the United States. The results show that even though a large number of LEED credits are neutral toward OHS, sustainable construction represented by LEED projects is associated with an increase in base-level safety risk. Finally, a risk model was integrated into a risk plane analysis to classify safety risk associated with each of the LEED credits. The risk classification analyses indicate that two credits are associated with unacceptable risk to OHS across the United States construction industry. It is expected that the findings from this research will benefit safety professionals, academics, designers, and all construction stakeholders by providing evidence of how their chosen sustainable designs may impact OHS on building projects.

Effect of Buildability on Labor Productivity: A Practical Quantification Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Buildability; Labor productivity; Efficiency; Formwork; Building floors; Project planning and design		Notwithstanding technological advancements, construction continues to be a labor-intensive industry, and labor productivity remains the industry's predominant determinant of performance. Numerous factors influence labor productivity, but buildability is among the most significant. Nevertheless, one of the barriers, and perhaps the most important to the implementation of the buildability concept, is the difficulty in measuring its tangible benefits to the construction industry; hence, the dearth of quantitative related research reported in the literature. Using a practical approach, this study has determined the relationship between relevant buildability factors and formwork labor productivity of building floors. The intermittent observation technique was applied to collect the data from 72 residential, office, and commercial buildings located in Kuwait. The factors explored included (1)variability of beam sizes in the floor, (2)usable floor area, (3)number of beams used to support the floor area, (4)number of individual slab panels formed within the floor due to beam-framing plan, (5)number of joints formed due to beam intersections, (6)floor configuration repetition criteria, and (7)number of angles formed around the floor perimeter. The relationship between each factor and formwork labor productivity was modeled by the categorical regression method. The results obtained show significant effects of the factors investigated on labor productivity, which substantiate the importance of applying the buildability principles to the design stage of building construction. The findings not only provide designers with feedback on how well their design schemes consider the requirements of buildability, but can also prove advantageous to construction managers for effective activity planning and efficient labor utilization.

J	Isikdag, U; Underwood, J				Isikdag, Umit; Underwood, Jason			Two design patterns for facilitating Building Information Model-based synchronous collaboration	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Information Models; Collaboration; Sharing; Exchange; Design patterns	PRODUCT MODEL; AEC INDUSTRY; CAD; ENVIRONMENT	The traditional fragmented nature of the construction industry along with the ad hoc matter in which investments in ICT have been made has resulted in a key cause of the poor performance and inefficiencies of the industry being attributed to the communication and exchange of information. The concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM) emerged to address the seamless exchange of information throughout the life of a facility following early modelling efforts focused on providing a solution to data exchange problems between several CAD and analysis systems. On the other hand. ICT supported collaborative teamwork has been an important aspect of building lifecycle management over the years in order to address the problems related to the fragmented nature of the industry. In parallel, recent studies in the field have demonstrated that BIMs will play an important role in facilitating collaboration. Most of the studies related to collaborative computing in construction have focused on facilitating the coordination and communication aspects of collaboration. In contrast, this paper proposes a system level and BIM-based approach for facilitating collaboration through the entire lifecycle of the building. In this context, the paper presents two design patterns that can be used as a foundation in formulating the design of information systems for BIM-based synchronous collaboration. The proposed patterns will help the system analysts/designers to focus on a system level picture when tackling recurring problems in the design of collaborative environments. Following a brief summary on the history of information modelling in the construction industry, this paper reviews the storage and exchange mechanisms of BIMs and then proposes two design patterns as a means to facilitating model-based synchronous collaboration.

J	Guo, SW; Wang, JW; Wu, H				Guo, Shuwen; Wang, Junwu; Wu, Han			Profit distribution of IPD projects using fuzzy alliance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy alliance; Degree of participation; Integrated project delivery; Profit distribution; Shapley value		Purpose This paper examines the profit distribution of engineering projects in the integrated project delivery (IPD) mode. IPD is a new delivery method that can ameliorate many of the disadvantages of traditional delivery methods and improve project results. In the implementation of IPD, the profit distribution is key for ensuring the success of IPD projects. Design/methodology/approach This paper described a new method for characterizing profit distribution in the IPD mode. The payment function and Shapley value of the cooperative fuzzy game of fuzzy alliance were defined by considering the Choquet integral of the fuzzy measure. The participation of each player was considered, and the influence of participation on the profit distribution was discussed. Lastly, changes in the profit distribution of core participants under different alliance combinations were studied. Findings A case from a report of The American Institute of Architects (AIA) was used to verify the fuzzy alliance model. There was a significant correlation between the degree of participation of the owner, architect and builder and the profit distribution among these three participants. Research limitations/implications The theoretical research in this paper has some limitations. Initially, this paper selects a case with only three key participants in order to simplify the research. When there are many core participants, how to establish the alliance in the IPD mode and how to establish the corresponding profit distribution model, further work is certainly required to disentangle these complexities in models. Second, in this case, BIM technology has little impact on the income of the whole project. Therefore, this paper does not consider the impact of BIM technology on the marginal effect of the IPD project. Third, the contract type in the case is a custom tri-party based on IFOA. There is no classified discussion of the impact of different contracts on the profit distribute in the paper. Practical implications Based on the in-depth study of cooperative game with alliance structure, this paper promotes the classic cooperative game with alliance structure. The authors define the payoff function of fuzzy cooperative games by Choquet integral of fuzzy measure, and introduce the idea into the field of IPD. It aims at extending the solution to a cooperative game without a core. It can be obtained through a simple calculation. In the IPD alliance, the fuzziness and uncertainty of the participation degree of each participant will affect the profit of the whole project. The authors find that the higher the participation rate of players, the more profit each participant has. The greater the influence weight of the designer on the alliance, the lower the influence weight of the contractor on the alliance, the lower the participation of the contractor and the designer, and the lower the income distribution value of the three core participants. It shows a monotonous decline status. Social implications For any construction enterprise, it can make more profits if it joins the grand alliance. In the IPD alliance, each participant can maximize their own interests, which can also promote the enthusiasm of construction enterprises to participate in the alliance and increase the application of IPD mode in AEC industry. This research method provides a new fast, effective, and more realistic solution method for cooperative countermeasures. It can be further extended to other cooperative game fields and advance a new research perspective and solution for the distribution of cooperative interests. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is the development of a fuzzy alliance model that provides a tool for measuring the profit distribution in IPD. This is the first quantitative model to connect the degree of participation with the profit distribution in IPD using fuzzy alliance.

Updating ground conditions and time-cost scatter-gram in tunnels during excavation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Markov process; Bakhan road tunnel; Ground conditions; Time-cost scatter-gram; Time-cost uncertainties; Updating process	RISK-ASSESSMENT; DECISION AIDS; PREDICTION; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; NETWORKS; DESIGN; MODEL	Minimizing uncertainties is an important issue among the significant discussions pertaining to the project design and planning. Usually, the uncertainties in subsurface projects arise from the unknown ground conditions that may cause the designer to fail to consider all the potential issues prone to occur during the construction procedure. Total time and costs uncertainties can be considered as the most important uncertainties during the planning and excavation of a tunnel project that is directly connected with cognition of the subsurface conditions. This work presents an updating procedure and associated code, which allows one to refine predictions during construction. Updating does not only involve replacing the original prediction by actual data from the excavation but also includes a learning effect. The updating uses information from the actual excavation to arrive at an improved prediction for the unexcavated part. Updating the ground conditions and time-cost scatter-gram in tunnels during excavation is a tool, which helps the user refine input parameters by deriving relevant information from construction data and presenting it together with original input. In this paper, an example project shows that the updating result has a significant impact on the precision of the prediction and reduces the uncertainty about ground conditions and construction time and cost of the tunnel substantially. It facilitates both the owners and the contractors to be aware of the risk they should carry before construction of the unexcavated part, and it is useful for both tendering and bidding.

However, despite opinions by BIM experts, questions regarding BIM jobs and their competencies still have no clear solution. This paper addresses this question by the collection and analysis of 242 online job postings, written in English, from the US, the UK, and China. These 242 job postings comprised a total of 32,495 words, from which 35 types of job titles and 5,998 terms related to job competency were extracted. Sequentially, the 35 job types were classified into eight BIM job types by analyzing the relations between the job titles using the role and position analysis of social network analysis. The eight BIM job types were BIM project manager, director, BIM manager, BIM coordinator, BIM designer, senior architect, BIM mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) coordinator, and BIM technician. The 5,998 competency-related terms were categorized into 43 competency elements using the O*NET classification as a framework for analysis. The 43 competencies were then subcategorized into essential, common, and job-specific competencies for the eight BIM job types. The findings of this paper could contribute to the research, industry, and academia by a) providing researchers with a scientific foundation for conducting studies related to BIM jobs and competence in the future; b) setting up guidelines for recruiting and training BIM experts in the industry; and c) allowing universities to develop BIM-related courses depending on their educational goals.

J	Duncan, J				Duncan, J			Performance-based building: lessons from implementation in New Zealand	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building codes; governance; innovation; performance; performance-based regulation; regulation; New Zealand		New Zealand was an early adopter of a performance-based building code in 1992. The subsequent lessons learned from its implementation strategy are examined. Performance-based codes have decided advantages, but need careful implementation to capture these advantages. There are particular problems where the building code does not use specific numerical levels as the basis for mandatory performance requirements. A small fraction of houses built over the last decade developed 'weathertightness' problems. The resulting media and political focus has led to a full review of the Building Act (the legislation leading to the Building Code) and new legislation will be in place by late 2004. As part of this, the Building Industry Authority will be absorbed into a government department. This will be followed by a detailed review of the New Zealand Building Code between 2005 and 2008. Although the performance requirements remain unaltered, the 'Acceptable Solutions' that are deemed to satisfy the code have already been made more conservative and prescriptive to account for the lack of sufficient experience and understanding in some parts of the building industry. Other legislation is expected to address the asymmetry between the industry and its clients, including a builder licensing scheme and consumer protection systems. The key lesson is that implementation of performance-based building codes systems cannot simply be done by putting the documents before the industry. Successful introduction of performance-based building codes, and changes to them, must be accompanied by well-focused training programmes for all involved in the process, and especially the designers, the building control staff and the on-site workforce.

A literature review of past studies investigating chaos theory approaches in building simulation models suggests that as a basis chaos model is valid and can handle the increasing complexity of building systems that have dynamic interactions among all the distributed and hierarchical systems on the one hand, and the environment and occupants on the other. The review also identifies the paucity of literature and the need for a suitable methodology of linking chaos theory to mathematical models in building design and management studies. This study is broadly divided into two parts and presented in two companion papers. Part (I), published in the previous issue, reviews the current state of the chaos theory models as a starting point for establishing theories that can be effectively applied to building simulation models. Part (II) develop conceptual frameworks that approach current model methodologies from the theoretical perspective provided by chaos theory, with a focus on the key concepts and their potential to help to better understand the nonlinear dynamic nature of built environment systems. Case studies are also presented which demonstrate the potential usefulness of chaos theory driven models in a wide variety of leading areas of building research. This study distills the fundamental properties and the most relevant characteristics of chaos theory essential to (1) building simulation scientists and designers (2) initiating a dialogue between scientists and engineers, and (3) stimulating future research on a wide range of issues involved in designing and managing building environmental systems.

It must be more than form. It can be spectacular, it can be revolutionary, but it should also be comprehensible, reasoned and plausible and this should be reflected in its form. This very nature of architecture makes it different from other design disciplines. However, it is these central aspects that are not supported by current computer-aided planning systems. The development of digital models concentrates on the purely formal aspects. Architecture does not just concern the external appearance, it also involves finding solutions for the organizational and technical realization of a building. The function, suitability, economic and ecological aspects, construction and implementation are important factors in the design and execution of a building. For architects at least, they should remain uppermost in the design considerations. Leaving aside the few exceptional buildings whose characteristic is defined by the building's form, it is obvious that the majority of buildings are determined by other factors. During the concept design, fundamental decisions are made that influence the rest of the design, without the architect having objectively considered a variety of relevant planning information. A large amount of potentially influential information cannot be considered, remains neglected or simply ignored, The paper describes research in progress into the design of planning systems which provide the architect and designer with such information during the conceptual development of a building, so that the chosen solution is plausible, reasoned and understandable. The design of such a planning system is oriented around the possibilities of information technology with regard to architectural demands and constraints. In contrast to currently available systems, the proposed system will include concepts which provide the architect with relevant information during the design phase. Architectural and urban planning issues are here as important as technical, ecological or economic factors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Song, Y; Koeck, R; Luo, S				Song, Yang; Koeck, Richard; Luo, Shan			Review and analysis of augmented reality (AR) literature for digital fabrication in architecture	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Augmented reality (AR); Architecture; Digital fabrication; Literature review		The use of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies has increased recently, due to the equipment update and the mature technology. For architectural design, especially in digital fabrication projects, more designers begin to integrate AR methods to achieve the visualization in the process. To help unskilled labors for holographic on-site previewing and instruction training, experimental and practice-based studies in AR for the architectural digital fabrication have emerged in recent years. Now, it is a great opportunity to discuss the topic of AR in architectural digital fabrication. By presenting a statistical review of AR technology in architecture projects, this literature review aims to review ongoing research and provide pathways for further research in architectural digital fabrication. This review article is based on information found in journal publications and conference papers in the fields of architecture, engineering, robotics, and digital fabrication, published to date (from 2010 to 2020). The review narrows the literature within these papers by filtering 84 articles through the keyword "Augmented Reality", "Digital Fabrication" and "Assembly". The selected articles can be categorized based on the most use of AR function in architectural digital fabrication into an order of the following three classifications with the most significant growth in the last years: (A) AR 3D holographic instruction, (B) AR data sharing, (C) AR for HumanComputer interaction. The information collected from these articles within their classifications is meant to give insight into the current state-of-the-art of AR in the architectural digital fabrication area, as well as to summarize how the topic has matured and developed over time in the research and industry literature. This article has not only analyzed the existing literature but also highlighted new emerging fields in AR research and the future trends of AR function in architectural digital fabrication.

The potential for infrastructure and urban improvement remains unrealized, however, due to technical, financial, and social constraints and criticisms that limit the implementation of smart cities concepts for infrastructure management. The discussion presented here provides a review of smart technologies including sensors, crowdsourcing and citizen science, actuators, data transmission, Internet of Things, big data analytics, data visualization, and blockchain, which can be used for infrastructure management. Smart infrastructure programs are reviewed to explore how enabling technologies have been applied across civil engineering domains, including transportation systems, water systems, air quality, energy infrastructure, solid waste management, construction engineering and management, structures, and geotechnical systems. Gaps in the application of smart technologies for infrastructure systems are identified, and we highlight how the civil engineering profession can adopt new roles toward the development of smart cities applications. These roles are: (1) master designer: civil engineers can identify ready applications of enabling technologies to improve the delivery of urban resources and services; (2) steward: civil engineers must account for both the environmental and societal impacts of smart infrastructure applications; (3) innovator and integrator: civil engineers should integrate across diverse sectors and groups of experts to develop smart infrastructure programs; (4) manager of risk: civil engineers should manage existing and growing risks of natural disasters, emergencies, and climate change; they should also manage new vulnerabilities in the privacy and security of individuals and households that are introduced through smart technologies; and (5) leader and decision maker: civil engineers can take a lead in smart infrastructure discussions and policy development.

J	Chang, MC; Shih, SG; Schmitt, G				Chang, Mei-Chih; Shih, Shen-Guan; Schmitt, Gerhard			Information theory-based approach for constructability assessment in truss structural systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Quantification of constructability/buildability; Information theory; Symmetry group theory; Markov chain; Monte Carlo method		The importance of constructability is often understated in the design phase of a construction project. Issues regarding constructability often do not receive sufficient attention until it is too late for design changes. This paper proposes a quantitative measure of truss structural system design that can be used as an index of constructability in the aspect of standardization and repetition elements at early design stages. Construction can be regarded as a co-operative undertaking among architects, who specify the form of a building, and builders, who implement construction tasks. The designed form alone does not provide enough information to specify feasible processes for actual,building. Sufficient fabrication information is needed so that fabricators can be completely certain concerning how to actually build the form. The goal of this study is to establish a model for estimating the amount of information needed for construction based on Shannon's information theory. This amount of information is based on uncertainty concerning assembly construction in the topological graph of the designed form, and the knowledge base shared by the designer and the builder in a design-build communication model. In this paper, the entropy of uncertainty is shown as being quantified as an index of constructability assessment for the attributes of standardization and repetition. Markov chain, Monte Carlo method and symmetry-group theories are also used in our model to analyze different levels of assembly. The scope of this research is currently focused on analyzing the constructability of truss structure systems. The assessment of constructability is demonstrated for six different types of truss structural systems. The five alternative designs are assessed for a schoolhouse project in Cambodia requiring easy construction, identified by our theoretical model. The results show that our methodology can help architects to design easily constructed truss structural systems and explore important design principles for improving constructability. The limitations and future works are discussed in the final two sections.

Compared to other green tools, Green Star is considered as one of main streams green assessment tools, which cover almost sustainable criteria. Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has also been introduced into the industry. BIM is expected to aid designers to shift the construction industry towards more environmentally and economically sustainable construction practice. Whilst the aspirations of Green Star rating and BIM implementation are broadly aligned, in the context of New Zealand this has led to some disconnects in design strategy and process. The purpose of this paper is to improve the practicality of BIM implementations for delivering Green Star certification in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach - The extensive literature review is conducted through a series of incremental steps. A conceptual framework focussing on the relationship between benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star is then developed. Findings - BIM supports practitioners to achieve the majority of Green Star criteria (75 per cent). Energy efficiency criterion is the key factor affecting the assessment process of Green Star and National Australian Built Environment Rating System in New Zealand. Research questions about lessening the challenges which can be encountered during the BIM and Green Star implementation are developed. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to a conceptual research. Further empirical research should be conducted to validate and modify the conceptual framework and the propositions presented in this paper to provide an initial insight into BIM and Green Star connectivity within the context of New Zealand. Originality/value - This paper provided a clear picture for investors, developers, practitioners about benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star implementation. The outcomes are anticipated to deliver visions for shifting the country further towards development of sustainable future cities.

The objectives are to understand the dynamics and the respective implications of the DIR under alternative design-construction (DC) modes (e.g. fast-track). Design/methodology/approach The methodology of work includes: (1) identifying the relevant factors that may impact the release of design deliverables under APDMs, (2) representing the selected APDMs with corresponding DC sequencing modes and (3) conceptualizing the possible alternative dynamics of the released deliverables. Findings The findings reveal that in contrast to the traditional one-time packaging of design deliverables, multiple DIR - with less certainty on their scope, timing, frequency and coordination quality - are released under alternative DC modes. This uncertainty mainly emanates from the deduced impact of the identified factors (e.g. DC overlapping intensity and degree of pressure by the builder) on the design deliverables dynamics. Practical implications This study can be of benefit to Architecture/Engineering (A/E) professionals as well as to project owners in better planning for their roles and responsibilities under each of the identified modes, as it helps raising their awareness on new issues brought about by APDMs. For instance, the presented analysis indirectly informs designers, design review professionals and project owners about a potentially increased liability exposure emanating from the reduced certainty on the DIR's coordination quality. Moreover, it informs design managers about the need for a design team's re-formation and/or re-structuring (i.e. of the involved staff) in order to accommodate for the hypothesized DIR dynamics. Originality/value This work offers a novel study that theorizes the impact of time-reduction-related factors, under alternative DC modes, on the release of design deliverables.

J	Jarkas, AM				Jarkas, Abdulaziz M.			Beamless or beam-supported building floors Is buildability knowledge the missing link to improving productivity?	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Efficiency; Buildability; Building floors; Formwork; Labour productivity; Reinforced concrete construction	FORMWORK LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; CONSTRUCTIBILITY IMPROVEMENT; CONSTRUCTABILITY	Purpose - Due to a dearth of quantitative research into buildability factors affecting formwork labour productivity of in situ reinforced concrete construction, the purpose of this paper is to establish a distinct point of departure from the prevalent qualitative trend of buildability research practices by exploring, quantifying and comparing the influence of the two widely used design schemes; namely, beamless and beam-supported building floors, on formwork labour productivity. Design/methodology/approach - A considerable quantity of relevant formwork labour productivity data associated with each building floor configuration was collected from projects sharing similar characteristics. The data were analysed to determine the statistical significance of the difference between the two labour productivity "means" of the sample sets representing both populations. Regression analyses were further carried out to assess the impact of floor area on labour efficiency. Findings - The results obtained show a statistically significant difference between the two means of formwork labour productivity achieved, where the efficiency of "forming" the beam-supported floor type is, on average, lower by 57 per cent than that of the beamless configuration. The outcomes further demonstrate a significant influence of building floor area on the productivity of the form-working operation. Practical implications - The findings can provide designers with feedback on how well their decisions consider the requirements of buildability principles, and the consequences thereto on labour productivity. The depicted pattern of results may, moreover, provide guidance to estimators and project managers for reasonable cost estimation, effective planning and efficient labour utilisation. Originality/value - The general guidelines available for buildability improvement lack the supporting quantitative evidence, and thus are often viewed with scepticism, especially amongst design practitioners. On the contrary, the quantitative outcomes reported in this study are based on rigorous methodology, hence can be used as a supporting reference to "formalise" the specific buildability knowledge of the activity explored.

The study further investigates its effectiveness in enhancing the design communication and coordination between the stakeholder. Design/methodology/approach Quasi-experimental research was adopted involving 12 FFE professionals, designers and end-users in single-group pre-test-post-test design. The tests were performed primarily to ascertain the impact of the application of interactive virtual reality on delivering furniture design selection and coordination tasks. Further interviews were used to elicit participants' views on the functionality and usefulness of the proposed approach. Findings The findings indicate that an interactive immersive virtual FFE environment: enhances the productivity of the design team through a collaborative virtual workspace offering a synchronised networked design testing and review platform; reduces the time required for the stakeholders to comprehend the design options and test those; enhances the design communication and quality of the design and encourages the collaborative culture in the industry; improves the design satisfaction of the stakeholders; and finally, requires significantly less time for design decision-making when compared to traditional methods. Research limitations/implications Future studies should incorporate space planning concepts and explore non-experimental methodologies in a real-life FFE project setup. Practical implications The proposed approach provides opportunities for enhanced interpretation of design intent in FFE as well as efficiency in design selection and coordination tasks when compared with conventional two-dimensional methods of communication. Originality/value This study proposes a step change in the way furniture design is communicated and coordinated through an immersive virtual experience. Previous studies have not addressed the issue of impact on design coordination instead focussed on marketing and sales.

Design for occupational safety and health: key attributes for organisational capability	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design for safety; Delphi technique; Health and safety; Prevention through design; Safety in design; Voting analytic hierarchy process	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; DELPHI METHOD; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Purpose Against the backdrop of the contribution of design to the occurrence of occupational injuries and illnesses in construction, design for occupational safety and health (DfOSH) is increasingly becoming prominent in the construction sector. To ensure that design interventions are safe for construction workers to build and maintain, design firms need to have the appropriate organisational capability in respect of DfOSH. However, empirical insight regarding the attributes that constitute DfOSH organisational capability is lacking. The purpose of this paper, which trailblases the subject of DfOSH organisational capability in construction, is to address two key questions: what organisational attributes determine DfOSH capability? What is the relative priority of the capability attributes? Design/methodology/approach The study employed three iterations of expert focus group discussion and a subsequent three-round Delphi technique accompanied by the application of voting analytic hierarchy process. Findings The study revealed 18 capability attributes nested within six categories, namely: competence (the competence of organisation's design staff); strategy (the consideration of DfOSH in organisation's vision as well as the top management commitment); corporate experience (organisation's experience in implementing DfOSH on projects); systems (systems, processes and procedures required for implementing DfOSH); infrastructure (physical, and information and communication technology resources); and collaboration (inter- and intra-organisational collaboration to implement DfOSH on projects). Whilst these categories and their nested attributes carry varying weights of importance, collectively, the competence-related attributes are the most important, followed by strategy. Originality/value The findings should enable design firms and other key industry stakeholders (such as the clients who appoint them) to understand designers' DfOSH capability better. Additionally, design firms should be able to prioritise efforts/investment to enhance their DfOSH capability.

J	Nassar, K				Nassar, Khaled			A model for assessing occupant flow in building spaces	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Level of service; Discrete-event simulation; Architecture; Corridor; Passageway; Occupant; Pedestrian		As buildings are becoming larger in size, the need to efficiently plan and predict the occupant movement in building spaces is gaining more attention and importance. Occupant movement in large public buildings such as train stations, airports, universities, hospitals, and shopping centers needs to be carefully analyzed and predicted for safety and also for other issues such as the level of service (LOS), comfort, and short-term planning. Currently there are many detailed occupant/pedestrian simulation models that can predict the level of service in corridors and other dynamic spaces in the building in terms of occupant flow. However, these simulation models require a well-formulated design with detailed design features. In addition, significant investment in time and effort is required in order to build the models for simulation analysis. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and quick analysis method to aid in the sizing and design of building spaces during the early design stages so that these spaces can accommodate occupant flow efficiently and safely. This paper presents a method to evaluate the LOS of occupants in dynamic buildings spaces without the need for building and running detailed simulations, so that designers can understand how well a particular space accommodates occupants' movements and activities early on in the design phase. The proposed method can be used to determine the occupant flow density in a wide array of building layouts and designs as it correlates to the level of service. A mathematical model that offers a closed-form formula for sizing space for occupant flow is developed. The model is presented in this paper and validated using real-life data. Results should be of interest to practicing architects as well as researchers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

These modules must be lifted vertically, raised evenly, and maintained in a level position during the lift in order to prevent them from deflecting and, more importantly, to mitigate safety issues regarding potential rigging failure. In this respect, a comprehensive crane lift study at the planning stage of the project is required to ensure the lifts are successful and to improve safety and productivity. One of the most tedious and time-intensive tasks involved in conducing the lift study is the design of the rigging assemblies, which are the link between the crane hook and the module. In practice, however, this task is performed manually and relies heavily on guesswork, which is error-prone and time-consuming, especially when the center of gravity is offset from the center of the module. Poorly designed rigging assemblies are only detected at the job site when the module does not raise evenly at the beginning of the lift, which then results in wasted time and productivity loss as the assembled components have to be unrigged and properly adjusted. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an automated mathematical-based rigging assembly design system that consists of: (i) collecting module and available rigging component information; (ii) the solver analysis, which calculates the sling angles and performs the calculations required to balance the module; (iii) the rigging assembly designer, which determines the required capacity of the rigging components and selects the suitable riggings from the database; (iv) rigging assembly design alternatives; and (v) the 3D visualizer, which creates a 3D model of the designed rigging assembly. This framework enables lift engineers to create rigging assembly designs more precisely and expeditiously. The methodology is validated in a case study.

J	Liu, SF; Feng, JC; Zhu, PH; Li, X				Liu Shaofeng; Feng Jincai; Zhu Pinghua; Li Xiang			Stability Analysis of Two Parallel Closely Spaced Tunnels Based on Convergence-Confinement Principle	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Parallel tunnels; Convergence-confinement principle; Numerical simulation method; Quantitative analysis method; Safety factor; Construction technology	BROWN FAILURE CRITERION; TWIN-TUNNELS; ROCK MASSES; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS; EXCAVATIONS; SETTLEMENT; DISPLACEMENT; SATISFY; DESIGN	Stability analysis and risk assessment are key issues in the design and construction of tunnels; however, these assessments are often hard to conduct accurately because of the complexity of tunnel engineering. In order to improve tunnel construction technology, this paper uses the safety factor as the assessment index. A quantitative analysis method for tunnels is presented by using the convergence-confinement principle and the numerical simulation analysis method. To meet these objectives, based on the actual construction technology, the tunneling method is studied using a detailed numerical model to investigate the effects of different patterns for advancing the tunnel face. A new method for solving the safety factor of the support structure is proposed using a three-dimensional numerical model; the detailed solution process is illustrated through the case of Luoyixi tunnel. The results show that the safety factor of a lagging tunnel is significantly less than that of the leading tunnel, and that in order to ensure the stability of a lagging tunnel, reinforcement measures should be included during the construction process. Moreover, there is also a danger signal for leading tunnels: the direction of the butterfly-shaped wings in the plastic zone began to deflect to the vault at the start of lagging tunnel construction. In order to prevent the possibility of the roof falling, an advanced rockbolt should be applied in time. For designers and builders, the developed quantitative method in the form of safety factors can be used for a comprehensive evaluation of the support design and the rock state. For these reasons, this method is a convenient option for optimization analysis in construction technology.

J	Tan, GW; Hayes, CC; Shaw, M				Tan, GW; Hayes, CC; Shaw, M			An intelligent-agent framework for concurrent product design and planning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						concurrent design; intelligent agent (IA); integration of perspectives in multi-agent systems; conflict detection (CD) and conflict resolution (CR) in engineering design; product design, and planning management	GROUP DECISION-SUPPORT; INTEGRATION; SYSTEMS	A problem in the traditional product development cycle is that the communication between different perspectives is linear in nature. This leads to long and costly development cycles as design mistakes are often not discovered until downstream stages of product development. This paper proposes a multi-agent framework to develop product design and planning using the concurrent engineering approach. The ideas in the framework draw on design-team behavior in many domains. The goal is to provide information that will help teams of designers, engineers and managers from various functional areas improve initial designs so that they satisfy a wider variety of concerns. Our model provides support to bring together constraints from the different team members in the development cycle. By integrating downstream constraints into the design phase, we reduce the need for redesign (due to design mistakes) later in the product development cycle. Our framework integrates a blackboard architecture with an intelligent agent (IA) network. Our methodology uses conflict-resolution (CR) techniques and design-improvement suggestions to refine the initial product design, and process plan generation and simulation to verify the manufacturability of the design. The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, our framework provides a more realistic way of modeling design teams by providing a way to model an individual team member's perspective as a segment of a continuum of task knowledge. Second, we identify the essential components of concurrent engineering needs, and develop a framework for integrating these components so as to ensure adequate coordination among the processes involved. Third, our methodology uniquely meshes together design constraints with factory resource considerations, so that the final product design are ensured to be feasible and manufacturable.

J	Fallahtafti, R; Mahdavinejad, M				Fallahtafti, Reza; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad			Window geometry impact on a room's wind comfort	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Wind-driven natural ventilation; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Optimization; Window geometry; Building aerodynamics; Parametric study		Purpose Natural ventilation is an environmentally friendly effective way of improving thermal comfort and the quality of indoor conditions if applied properly. This study aims to investigate the physical mechanism of the air movement and also the influence of building geometry in a cross-ventilated room through a parametric study of window geometrical characteristics using computational fluid dynamics. Design/methodology/approach Momentum and continuity equations are solved by the control volume method using a commercially available software. Standard k-e turbulence model is employed to simulate the incompressible airflow and SIMPLE algorithm to solve the conservation equations. Mean air velocity magnitude is measured at three different surfaces of different heights, and the effect of incoming wind velocity inside the building is studied. Findings The research concluded that window hood and sill projections reduce indoor wind velocity magnitude, play a major role in incoming wind direction and thus have a crucial impact on wind circulation and indoor air quality. Social implications The paper has evaluated redesigning of a both practical and ornamental architectural element named Palekaneh, which is found in many historical buildings in several hot places in the world. Its optimal design could increase indoor natural ventilation quality and decrease a space's cooling load. Therefore, a new passive cooling architectural element could be re-introduced to the regions previously enjoying such ornaments. This is economically efficient because it eventually saves a considerable amount of energy in the long run and is socially important because of the revitalization of architectural identity. Originality/value The role of a building envelope's physical features, although being studied for solar absorption and daylight availability, has rarely been investigated for natural ventilation, especially in a small scale, thus making the paper novel in this regard. This provides a guideline for designers to assess the impact of their design on redirecting wind-induced natural ventilation the very early stages of design.

J	Esmaeili, B; Hallowell, MR; Rajagopalan, B				Esmaeili, Behzad; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Rajagopalan, Balaji			Attribute-Based Safety Risk Assessment. I: Analysis at the Fundamental Level	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Content analysis; Construction safety; Safety attributes; Labor and personnel issues	IDENTIFYING ROOT CAUSES; SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY; CONSTRUCTION SITES; IDENTIFICATION; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; FATALITIES; HAZARDS; DESIGN; MODEL	Quantifying safety risks and performing comparative analyses is an emerging research field. Unfortunately, current risk assessment strategies are problematic because they require every new infrastructure feature and construction method to be individually evaluated using laborious research processes. To enhance the current construction safety management methods, an attribute-based risk identification and analysis method is presented that helps designers and preconstruction planners identify and model safety risk independently of specific activities or building components. The inspiration for this new risk management technique was derived from the Human Genome Project, which implies that while there are billions of people around the world, their vulnerability towards specific kinds of disease can be explained by a limited number of genes. This concept for attribute-based risk assessment was adapted by testing the hypothesis that injuries and fatalities in construction result from a finite number of hazardous attributes of the work environment. The research reported in this paper includes content of large, representative, and reliable national database of 1,812 injury reports of struck-by incidents. The combined manual and automated content analysis procedure was created for this specific application to overcome the challenges associated with a large and complex dataset. In total, 22 safety risk attributes that lead to struck-by incidents were identified and their relative risks were quantified. The results can be used by practitioners to integrate robust safety risk data into technological models and management systems, thereby facilitating proactive safety management. The contribution of fundamental and empirical attribute-based safety risk data fills a knowledge gap that has long prevented the integration of empirical safety data with technological models. It is expected that this new knowledge will serve as a catalyst for proactive safety management in emerging technologies. (c) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Gan, XL; Chang, RD; Langston, C; Wen, T				Gan, Xiao-Long; Chang, Rui-Dong; Langston, Craig; Wen, Tao			Exploring the interactions among factors impeding the diffusion of prefabricated building technologies Fuzzy cognitive maps	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Technology; Construction; Simulation; Approach	OFF-SITE CONSTRUCTION; PRECAST CONCRETE SYSTEMS; GREEN BUILDINGS; WIND POWER; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; POLICY; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDUSTRY	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the interactions of factors impacting the widespread adoption of prefabricated building technologies and the intervention strategies to facilitate the development of prefabrication based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). Design/methodology/approach Through in-depth interviews with six stakeholder groups, namely, the government, developers, designers, contractors, manufacturers and researchers, 13 critical factors were identified and used to construct stakeholder-grouped FCMs, which were further aggregated into a collective FCM. The complexity and density of the collective FCM and the centrality of factors in the FCM were examined. Subsequently, a series of "what-if" simulations of the collective FCM were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting prefabrication. Findings The results show that three factors including market demand, cost, and policies and regulations have been mentioned by all stakeholder groups. However, these factors were ranked differently by stakeholder groups, implying that different stakeholder groups perceive the barriers to prefabricated building technologies differently. FCM simulations show that strengthening policies and regulations yield the strongest overall effect stimulating prefabrication, alleviating the organizational and environmental barriers more than the technological barriers, while improving the knowledge and expertise alleviate the technological barriers more. These measures need to be accompanied by other approaches, such as reducing cost and improving quality. Originality/value Few studies aim to analyze the interactions among the barriers to prefabrication, while this study specifically investigates this issue by illustrating the complex interactions using FCMs. Few studies also aim to identify the intervention strategies promoting prefabrication based on a quantitative approach, while this study employs FCM simulations to directly simulate the effectiveness of different strategies to facilitate prefabrication in a quantitative manner.

The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used.

J	Franz, B; Messner, J				Franz, Bryan; Messner, John			Evaluating the Impact of Building Information Modeling on Project Performance	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Project delivery; Project execution planning; Virtual design and construction (VDC)	BIM	There is growing interest among practitioners to measure the benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and demonstrate the impact that BIM has on projects. In recent years, several researchers have used illustrative case studies to demonstrate how adopting BIM for specific uses can improve project performance. However, generalizable findings that may be extended across the industry remain somewhat elusive. This paper presents the results of a quantitative study to examine the impact of BIM use adoption and BIM Execution Planning (BEP) on project performance across a range of project delivery methods. The core research questions guiding the study were (1) does increased BIM use adoption improve project performance, as measured by cost, schedule, and quality metrics? and (2) what role does BEP have in the successful implementation of BIM on a project? By leveraging data from over 200 projects, these questions were answered via a multiple regression analysis. The results showed a significant positive relationship between BIM use adoption and the speed of delivery, perceived facility quality, and group cohesion within the project team, when controlling for project complexity. There was no evidence to suggest that the level of participation in BEP by members of the project team moderated those relationships. Instead, BEP participation was a significant predictor of BIM use adoption. Projects implementing BEP with either a designer-contractor team or the full project team were associated with increased BIM use adoption compared with projects that did not implement BEP. Despite these key findings, this study revealed a need for a new approach for capturing process data across projects to enable more-detailed future analysis. Prior research, including the data set used in this study, was designed to test macrolevel relationships, and omits many of the details about the specific processes or implementation aspects that drive day-to-day actions. Transitioning to collect a more focused data set, aimed at the microlevel of BIM and BEP implementation, and potentially lean construction practices, would enable a better understanding of the value these tools bring to projects.

Currently, MDO is developed with software tools that work together and automatically. However, the technical requisites to develop MDO using Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) platforms are not clearly specified in the design optimization literature. There are many difficulties not covered by the literature: especially the tools' behavior, and the strategies to deal with PIDO. To determine the technical requirements, the tools' behavior, the challenges of interoperability and viable strategies, we reviewed the literature and tested five tools. This paper presents the main behavior of the tools we studied, and explains the challenges and strategies to develop MDO through PIDO. We observed three technical tool requisites: component interoperability, tool automation, and model parameterization capabilities. We detected low openness levels of the tool interfaces that did not always enable a full integration with PIDO or permit access to model properties. The scarcity of commands and the presence of pop-up menus impeded performing analyses automatically. Moreover, most of the tools did not allow parametric associations among components, compatibility among themselves or the addition of custom components. The strategies proposed focused on testing the tool interfaces, to validate that each computational process runs automatically, and to confirm that parametric relationships and components are possible: The tools tested were not specifically designed to include full capability to work with PIDO, therefore, enhancements would be needed to meet the three requisites: component interoperability, automation and parameterization. Technological, documentation and programming challenges also emerged when working with tools. We demonstrated that only certain tools can be used with a PIDO platform. However, there may be still other requisites for MDO using different methods that can become the focus of future work. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gerbov, A; Singh, V; Herva, M				Gerbov, Alexander; Singh, Vishal; Herva, Maila			Challenges in applying design research studies to assess benefits of BIM in infrastructure projects Reflections from Finnish case studies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design management; Methodology; Case study; Building information modelling	PERCEIVED VALUE; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a reflective assessment on a research project aimed at applying design research methodologies to understand the benefits of building information modelling (BIM) in infrastructure design projects, a context where design research has not been applied adequately. Design/methodology/approach - The findings reported in this paper are based on a reflective diary and reporting by the researchers on the challenges and barriers they faced in a research project that involved four case studies. The data in the case studies were collected from project documentation, questionnaire surveys, interviews and workshops. Sentiment analysis was conducted to assess the research participants' perceptions. Findings - Several challenges faced during the research study forced changes to the research process as well as adjustments to the research objectives. From the original objective of quantitatively measuring the benefits of BIM in the design process, the objective was shifted to measuring qualitatively how the designers' perceived the benefits. There was evident lack of shared understanding between the researchers and industry partners about the scope of design research and design in infrastructure projects. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on the studies in one country, and the reflective assessment could have researchers' bias in terms of their interpretation and experience. Practical implications - The presented findings and the lessons learnt from the research will be useful for others planning to conduct similar studies, because they are likely to encounter similar problems. The recommendations will benefit both the industry as well as the academia in bridging the gap between design theory and practice. Originality/value - This paper primarily focusses on the challenges and barriers to conducting empirical research, especially from the viewpoints of a young researcher aiming to adopt design research methodology in infrastructure design projects. While the reported challenges may be widespread in similar research projects, they have not been the focus of research themselves, and are often sidelined. The primary contribution of this research is to identify and bring the key barriers and challenges to the forefront.

J	So, ATP; Chan, WL				So, ATP; Chan, WL			LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						building automation; self-positioning; vision; construction; management; maintenance; surveillance; local area network		The building and construction industry is the major industry of Hong Kong as in many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system (BAS) of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building. Teleoperation of the robot via the Internet or intranet is also possible, which is the second achievement of this project. Finally, the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard CAD drawings, which is the third achievement of this project. The main goal of this paper is not the description of some groundbreaking technology in robotic development. It is mainly intended to convince building designers and managers to incorporate robotic systems when they are managing modem buildings to save manpower and improve efficiency.

J	Tong, B; Guo, JJ; Fang, S				Tong, Bin; Guo, Jingjuan; Fang, Shen			Predicting Budgetary Estimate of Highway Construction Projects in China Based on GRA-LASSO	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Highway construction; Cost estimate; Budget; Prediction model; Cost indexes; Gray relation analysis-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GRA-LASSO)		Under the development strategy of traffic power, Chinese highway engineering has been in the critical stage, and controlling investment has become a top priority. The budgetary estimate is the main basis for the Chinese government to verify the highway project investment, which is estimated mainly based on the quota and price information issued by government but still lacks systematic cost indices to measure its rationality. The highway engineering cost of different regions in China varies greatly, and the accumulated cost data are not insufficient. This paper chooses the gray relation analysis-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GRA-LASSO) hybrid method, which has significant advantages in dealing with high-dimensional small sample data and multiple correlation variables, to establish the highway engineering budgetary estimate prediction model so as to examine the rationality of estimated investment at the initial stage of construction. Using budgetary estimate data on 121 highway projects that have been approved by the Chinese government and various macroeconomic data, the key cost drivers are identified through gray relation analysis (GRA) quantitatively, and 10 high-correlation indexes are selected as input variables. Then, the relationship among engineering characteristic variables, economic factors, and highway engineering budget are established by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The empirical test results show that eight indexes have significant impact on the highway cost, including earthwork quantities, route length, number of lanes, bridge-tunnel ratio, protection works quantities, highway construction investment, producer price index (PPI) and purchasing manager's index (PMI) of construction industry. Compared with ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and LASSO method alone, the GRA-LASSO combined method has better performance in error evaluation index and stronger model accuracy and generalization ability. The study result can be mainly used for government to rapidly audit, forecast, forewarn, monitor, and manage the highway engineering cost, and also help investors and designers to pay close attention to the influence of design parameters and external environment on cost. Moreover, it provides a reference method or model for establishing a highway engineering cost index.

J	Zheng, H; Moosavi, V; Akbarzadeh, M				Zheng, Hao; Moosavi, Vahid; Akbarzadeh, Masoud			Machine learning assisted evaluations in structural design and construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Iterative machine learning; Neural networks; Surrogate model; 3D graphic statics; Subdividing the force diagram		This paper proposes a new design approach based on an iterative machine learning algorithm to speed up the topological design exploration of compression-only shell structures with planar faces, considering both structural performance and construction constraints. In this paper, we show that building neural networks allows one to train a surrogate model to accelerate the structural performance assessment of various possible structural forms without going through a significantly slower process of geometric form-finding. The geometric form-finding methods of 3D graphic statics are used as the primary structural design tool to generate a single-layer, com-pression-only shell with planar faces. Subdividing the force diagram and its polyhedral cells using various rules results in a variety of topologically different compression-only structures with different load-bearing capacities for the same boundary conditions. The solution space for all possible compression-only forms for a given boundary condition is vast, which makes iterating through all forms to find the ideal solutions practically impossible. After training with an iterative active sampling method, the surrogate model can evaluate the input data, including the subdivision rules, and predict the value of the structural performance and the construction constraints of the planar faces within milliseconds. As a result, one can then evaluate the nonlinear relations among all the subdivision rules and the chosen structural performance measures, and then, visualize the entire solution space. Consequently, multiple solutions with customized thresholds of the evaluation criteria are found that show the strength of this method of form-finding in generating design solutions. Besides, considering the total training time of the neural network model, the proposed framework is still faster than a traditional optimization method, such as the genetic algorithm that can find only the optimum values. This process will result in interactive sampling methods in which the machine learning models assist the designer in choosing and controlling different design strategies by providing real-time feedback on the effects of the selected parameters on the design outputs.

J	Oltean-Dumbrava, C; Watts, G; Miah, A				Oltean-Dumbrava, Crina; Watts, Greg; Miah, Abdul			Procurement of Sustainable Noise-Reducing Devices: State-of-the-Art Review from EU Project QUIESST	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Review						Noise barriers; Sustainability		There is a pressing need for the sustainability of noise-reducing devices (NRDs) for transport systems to be considered by procurement agencies, policy makers, and industry professionals/designers in order to be in line with a growing sustainable agenda for surface transport systems including the supporting infrastructure. This need has been recognized by the European Union (EU) and an appropriate research project has recently been commissioned. Quietening the Environment for a Sustainable Surface Transport (QUIESST) is a three-year project funded by the EU that began late in 2009. It is a multidisciplinary project undertaken by 13 EU partners from eight countries. Within the project, the University of Bradford is the specialist research team tasked with assessing the sustainability of noise-reducing devices. These devices are designed to control noise from surface transport (both road and rail) and include noise barriers and absorptive claddings. For the purpose of this research, sustainability was defined as: the optimal consideration of technical, environmental, economical, and social factors during the design, construction, maintenance and repair, and removal/demolition stages of NRD projects. A comprehensive literature review has been carried out of the relevant European standards, design guides used around the world by road and rail authorities, and existing research on NRDs conducted by academics and leading practitioners to identify sustainable practices and gaps in the knowledge base. It became evident that sustainability factors are not being fully considered across the whole life cycle of NRDs. At the present time and based on the available data, it is not possible to quantify and rank NRDs in terms of sustainability for a given site, project, or case study. Clearly this has major implications for the management of the procurement process. Further data collection and analysis are required to provide guidance that can be considered useful for all stakeholders. This is the aim of the further stages of this work package within the QUIESST project. This paper presents an overview of the current state of the art for the sustainability of NRDs, and describes some of the major deficiencies while highlighting knowledge gaps and the further research that is needed.

J	Akin, S; Ergun, O; Surer, E; Dino, IG				Akin, Sahin; Ergun, Oguzcan; Surer, Elif; Gursel Dino, Ipek			An immersive performative architectural design tool with daylighting simulations: a building information modeling-based approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Architecture; Design; Building information modeling; Simulation; Innovation; Integration	VIRTUAL-REALITY; BIM; TECHNOLOGIES; EXPERIENCE; SCIENCE; SYSTEM; VR	Purpose In performative architectural design, daylighting is a crucial design consideration; however, the evaluation of daylighting in the design process can be challenging. Immersive environments (IEs) can create a dynamic, multi-sensory, first-person view in computer-generated environments, and can improve designers' visual perception and awareness during performative design processes. This research addresses the need for interactive and integrated design tools for IEs toward better-performing architectural solutions in terms of daylighting illumination. In this context, building information modeling and performance simulations are identified as critical technologies to be integrated into performative architectural design. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a design science research (DSR) methodology involving an iterative process of development, validation and improvement of a novel and immersive tool, HoloArch, that supports design development during daylighting-informed design processes. HoloArch was implemented in a game engine during a spiral software development process. HoloArch allows users to interact with, visualize, modify and explore architectural models. The evaluation is performed in two workshops and a user study. A hybrid approach that combines qualitative and quantitative data collection was adopted for evaluation. Qualitative data analyses involve interviews, while quantitative data analyses involve both daylighting simulations and questionnaires (e.g. technology acceptance model (TAM), presence and system usability scale (SUS)). Findings According to the questionnaire results, HoloArch had 92/100 for SUS, a mean value of 120.4 for presence questionnaire (PQ) and 9.4/10 for TAM. According to the simulation results, all participants improved the given building's daylighting performance using HoloArch. The interviews also indicated that HoloArch is an effective design tool in terms of augmented perception, continuous design processes, performative daylighting design and model interaction. However, challenges still remain regarding the complete integration of tools and simultaneous simulation visualization. The study concludes that IEs hold promising potentials where performative design actions at conceptual, spatial and architectural domains can take place interactively and simultaneously with immediate feedback. Originality/value The research integrates building information modeling (BIM), performative daylighting simulations and IEs in an interactive environment for the identification of potentials and limitations in performative architectural design. Different from existing immersive tools for architecture, HoloArch offers a continuous bidirectional workflow between BIM tools and IEs.

However, there is a major dilemma in the design and development of compaction OSSs. On one hand, providing raw sensory data (i.e., temperature and compaction count) to the operator in a descriptive manner, can cognitively overloading the operators, i.e., infobesity problem. On the other hand, the over-processed data, which can be presented to the operators as prescriptive compaction guidance, e.g., a compaction trajectory, may give operators the sense of losing control of the operation and deprofessionalization of their trade. Therefore, there is an ongoing debate over the best strategy for the design and development of compaction OSSs. To put this usability aspect at the heart of the design and development strategy of compaction OSS, first, it is essential to systematically assess various OSS alternatives from the usability perspective. However, the conventional approach of usability testing, which relies on the use of physical prototypes, can be time-consuming and logistically difficult to execute. To address this issue, this research proposes and implements a Virtual Prototyping (VP) approach to analyze the usability of different compaction OSSs. In this approach, a Virtual Reality (VR) compaction simulator is developed and utilized to present 3 different alternatives for compaction OSS, which varies in the level of support they provide and receive feedback from the end-users. The results show that from the user perspective, semi-guidance compaction OSSs, which present the compaction priority, are preferred over both descriptive and prescriptive systems. The users tend to perceive this level of support as a middle ground solution that offers them a means for real-time strategy (re-)development without compromising their control of the process. It is also demonstrated that the VR simulator has the potential to serve as a powerful technology assessment platform that allows end-users to have an open and substantive dialogue about the system with researchers and machine designers.

Risk Allocation in US Public-Private Partnership Highway Project Contracts	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; Contract; Risks; Risk allocation; Highways; Content analysis	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; REAL OPTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; AGREEMENT; FINANCE	Risk is often discussed in connection with public-private partnerships (P3s), and risk allocation is likely a determinant of P3 success or failure. Despite being central to the delineation and allocation of risks, contracts have not been used directly to examine risks in P3s, particularly in the United States. Employing a systematic content analysis framework, the allocation of 31 risks in 21 U.S. highway P3 contracts was determined. These contracts represent the entire population of U.S. highway P3 projects from 2004 through first quarter of 2016 with the exception of one project whose contract was not made available. The results were internally validated through interrater testing and externally validated using bond offering statements. Hence, the investigation is unique in its approach and comprehensive scope. The allocation results demonstrate that some risks were retained by the public sector, but the majority of the 31 risks were either transferred to the private sector or shared. The former outcome is not unexpected because risk transfer is generally viewed as fundamental to the P3 value proposition; however, the prevalence of sharing in the United States market is greater than that conveyed in the literature examining risk allocation in other large markets such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Risk sharing arrangements uncovered ranged from deductible schemes to event mechanisms with the latter employed quite frequently; hence, contract designers rely on ex post remedies to address risks once an event, such as a change in law, occurs. Parametric analysis did not reveal any dominant trends in risk allocation, but examination by the most active jurisdictions (Florida, Texas, and Virginia) and source of risk (exogenous versus endogenous) illustrated that project context influences risk allocation. While some consistency was found in the treatment of the 31 risks, the variation in allocation is further evidence that project-specific factors and environments will continue to challenge efforts to create uniformity in P3 contractual provisions. Additionally, with the U.S. P3 market still evolving, the results provide practitioners implementing P3s or considering their implementation a comprehensive overview of risk allocation practices and contractual language across a variety of project characteristics. Consequently, the results can inform practitioner decisions regarding risk allocation and contract design.

Among the diverse applications of AM, construction applications have not yet seen a commercially available and widely used product in the market. Nevertheless, it has been a subject of interest to researchers in recent decades. There are evident challenges and risks for the integration of AM towards large-scale construction. Therefore, progress in their commercialization seems to proceed at a slow pace, as only a few 3DP trials for large-scale construction can be found in the literature. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based baseline along with progresses in relevant disciplines related to 3DP in construction, which will provide an opportunity to experts in all domains to understand the multidimensional constraints and to specify the future research directions in these sectors. The distinct merit of this article is that it provides, for the first time, a diverse review on literature in the field of construction 3D printing. It offers up-to-date and in-depth information of hindrances (from processes, materials, structural design and standards) which add up towards low pace of automation in construction sector, identify deficiencies in the current research and provides future research trends for researchers. The findings from intensive literature review will guide engineers, designers and investors from construction sector to grab research gaps and business opportunities. First of all, the development of different 3DP processes in built environment are presented to highlight the process constraints along with the commercial applications of these processes for industrialists and investors to identify the business opportunities. Secondly, process parameters and difficulties in optimization of material mixtures are presented as a guide to civil engineers following the discussion on materials urging the need for development of eco-efficient and environment friendly materials. Conclusions drawn from discussion in individual sections along with issues/constraints and challenges involved are explained separately.

From the building economic compactness index concept, it was studied the cost and environmental impacts (material consumption, embodied energy - EE and CO(2)emission). Design/methodology/approach The research strategy takes advantage of a case study aiming to investigate the relation between design characteristics related to area (m(2)) and building economic compactness index (%) with cost (Research Stage 1) and with environmental impacts: (Research Stage 2). The study involved real data from social housing projects, chosen in terms in terms of very similar features like size, area and constructive method (constants), however, with dissimilar compactness (variable). Findings The lack of direct relation between area and cost signs the importance of including the cost of vertical plans considered in the economic compactness building. The higher the economic compactness index, the lower the cost, the lower the amount of material, EE and CO(2)emission parameters. However, due to the wide range of EE and CO(2)values available, the reduction in the amount of materials achieved by increasing building economic compactness index may not be reflected in EE and CO(2)gains. Research limitations/implications As the limitation of this study, it must be taken into account a limited number of case buildings and the fact that the analysis is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the data provided by constructors and the available information of EE and CO(2)emission. As well discussed in the literature, the consistent database is a great challenge for the construction sector. Originality/value There might be alternatives to higher areas with relatively low-cost increments since results from buildings with the same area present different cost estimative and suggest a strong relationship with the economic compactness index. The large variation of EE and CO(2)emission data indicates that reductions obtained by compactness increase may be impaired if the construction materials are produced with high levels of EE and CO(2)emission. Thus, there must be an integrated effort on the part of designers (design and material specification) and manufacturers (material production), since isolated solutions may not be enough.

J	Kaminsky, J; Javernick-Will, A				Kaminsky, Jessica; Javernick-Will, Amy			Contested Factors for Sustainability: Construction and Management of Household On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Onsite wastewater treatment; Rural sanitation; Asset management; Factors; Delphi method; Organizational issues		On-site sanitation systems experience a high failure rate with resulting environmental and public health implications. In the United States alone, the EPA estimates that 10% of the 26million homes served by on-site systems have failed. If this failure rate is extrapolated to the 8% of the global population that the UN estimates have gained access to sanitation between 1990 and 2008, an additional 5million failed systems have been constructed. To address issues like this, development theory currently emphasizes a blend of hardware (e.g.,infrastructure, technology) and software (e.g.,knowledge, institutions, education) in an effort to achieve sustainable development. However, there is a lack of both theory that addresses this interaction and a definition of sustainable infrastructure. To begin to address this gap, an initial set of 40 factors that may contribute to sustainable on-site sanitation systems was identified from a literature review including the Web of Science, the Engineering Village, and the full record of ASCE from 2000 to July 2011. A panel of 14 experts including academics, regulators, international development practitioners, operation and maintenance (O&M) providers, and manufacturer/designers was then assembled to identify any additional factors that may lead to resilient on-site systems and to evaluate each one using the Delphi method. The panel evaluated each factor iteratively to develop a measure of its importance to the sustainability of on-site sanitation infrastructure. Experts were also invited to provide and review comments explaining or discussing the ratings they provided, and to identify the factors they perceived to be the most and least important. Of the initial list of factors, nine came to consensus as being important or very important, including factors such as owner occupancy, quality of installation or materials, and postconstruction follow-up programs. In addition, 10 factors provoked particularly diverse, or contentious, opinions with ratings that more than doubled the target criteria for consensus. These contentious factors are analyzed to identify trends and debates in expert opinion that showcase future research needs as well as issues that practitioners must address to build sustainable systems.

J	Zhao, XB; Wu, P; Wang, XY				Zhao, Xianbo; Wu, Peng; Wang, Xiangyu			Risk paths in BIM adoption: empirical study of China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design; Risk management; Building information modelling	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; LIFE-CYCLE; PLS-SEM; STRATEGIES; BUILDINGS; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTRACTORS; GUIDELINES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to model the paths of risks associated with building information modeling (BIM) adoption in the Chinese architecture, engineering and construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A total of 16 risks were identified from the literature review and grouped into nine categories. The data were collected through a questionnaire survey with 95 professionals in China. The partial least square structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings The results suggested the risk categorization was confirmed, and that 15 hypothetical risk paths were statistically significant, which formed 13 chains of risk paths. Inadequate relevant knowledge and expertise was the primary root risk category of all the 13 chains of risk paths. Additionally, technological issues, poor information sharing and collaboration, and liability for data input had direct effect on the cost overrun with BIM, while all the other risks indirectly influence cost via these three risk categories. Research limitations/implications Most of the respondents were designers because few clients and contractors have adopted BIM. In addition, the impact and likelihood of risks were accessed by respondents' judgment based on their experience, which is a common problem of risk management research. As this study focuses on the Chinese architecture, engineering and construction industry, there would be geographical limitation on the findings. Practical implications This study provides practitioners with a clear understanding of the risks associated with BIM adoption and enables practitioners to take measures to mitigate the root risks and assure the potential benefits of BIM. Originality/value Although there have been studies on the risks associated with BIM adoption, most of them lacked empirical evidence and failed to examine the interactions between risks. This study is different from these prior studies, because it focuses on the interrelationships between risks and identifies the risk paths and root risks using the empirical data. Therefore, this study expands the literature relating to both BIM and risk management. Also, this study enables practitioners to take measures to mitigate the root risks and assure the potential benefits produced by BIM, thereby contributing to the practice.

J	Barrow, L				Barrow, L			Elitism, IT and the modem architect opportunity or dilemma	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-In-Architecture (ACADIA 2002)	2002	Pomona, CA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture		modem architect; IT; architecture		Information Technology (IT) is impacting architecture dramatically in process and form. Currently, the transformation of architecture is difficult to analyze and, frequently, we see confusion and anxiety regarding uncertainties for the future of the architect as the project leader. The current potentiality for new exotic form (i.e. product) is mesmerizing; however, in the current context, less obvious issues and pertinent questions are emerging for the profession. What is the mission of the profession? What will keep us relevant in the mist of the new global society? In this paper, we will take an evolutionary perspective of technology in architecture and draw parallels between the Renaissance, which is the genesis of the modem architect, and the contemporary state of architecture. The modem architect was birthed during the Renaissance where we see the retraction of the architect from the building site and separation from direct involvement in the building process. Communications technology (i.e. representation in the form of freehand drawings, mechanical 2D orthographic drawings and 3D perspectives) enabled the decomposition of the master builder into three major components (i.e. artist-designer, practicing architect, and builder). Thus, we see technology enable the denigration and ultimate dissolution of the centuries old craftsman guilds and master builder system. The technology evolution of "drawings" enabled monumental change in the process of architecture over the past 500 years. The fission of the master builder, enabled by "drawings", resulted in disparate factions, which were the forerunners of the modem day litigious design-bid-build project delivery. We now increasingly see a return to the fusion of design and building where often the architect is not the project manager or leader. Thus, the question looms, will the 21st century architect lead or be led, and what are the ramifications for the profession? The historical Master Builder is re-emerging as a dynamically networked team of design and construction knowledge specialists. Bilateral knowledge exchange, enhanced with emerging IT, is occurring between owners, managers, architects, design specialists, engineers, builders, craftsman and machines. Technology is disrupting architecture, resulting in increasing specialization and compressed time frames, and may require reevaluation of the role of the architect as project-leader "integrative-generalist" or "design-specialist". Conclusively, the concept of 'cybernetic architecture' is proposed as an IT reference framework. Failure to appropriately respond to societal evolution, driven by technology, could result in the loss of professional status for the modem architect. Herein lies our dilemma, or opportunity, depending on the role choice of the modern architect. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sustainable Infrastructure Multi-Criteria Preference Assessment of Alternatives for Early Design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Decision support tool; Multi-criteria; Design strategies; Preference assessment; Utility function; Indifference curve; Expert elicitation; Infrastructure; Triple bottom line; Resilience	ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS; DECISION-MAKING METHODS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE; OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; BUILDINGS; SELECTION; SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY	The tradeoffs between the economic, social, and environmental aspects of infrastructures are not easily evident to decision makers and stakeholders in the initial design phase. This lack of insight, often leads to designs that compromise the social and environmental aspects of designs in order to reduce the initial construction costs of infrastructure awns. In addition to the lack of insight, currently available methods for analyzing alternative infrastructure configurations with respect to decision maker preferences: require analysis on a case-by-case (e.g., pairwise) basis; are not appropriate for the initial design phase (e.g., are time-consuming); and are not adaptable to a range of alternative design solutions (e.g., adding and removing alternatives might require a re-ranking from the decision maker). This paper presents a modular preference function development strategy that aims to address these issues, termed Sustainable Infrastructure Multi-Criteria Preference assessment of aLtematives for Early Design (SIMPLE-Design). The proposed strategy develops utility functions (indifference curves) for assessing decision maker preferences with regard to various tradeoffs of alternative design options, and leverages available data to provide decision makers with a consistent frame of reference for assessing alternatives. An illustration presented for a decision support tool using the Simple-Design strategy assesses decision maker preferences for commercial buildings with respect to initial construction costs, building damage and business interruption costs, casualty costs (due to the occurrence of natural hazard events), and CO2 emission costs. The designed decision support tool provides streamlined information to support preference assessment with reasonably low cognitive load. Ten out of the twelve decision support tool users stated that allowing the decision makers to define alternatives of equal utility (value) in a systematic manner, and providing information on the various cost types (decision criteria), are the most essential elements of the assessment strategy. The presented modular preference assessment framework, as well as the decision support tool itself, are generalizable and can be adapted to other infrastructure types. The contribution to the body of knowledge is a holistic preference assessment framework that allows decision makers to make more informed decisions and designers to better incorporate the preferences of the decision makers during the early design process.

J	Badi, SM; Pryke, SD				Badi, Sulafa M.; Pryke, Stephen D.			Assessing the quality of collaboration towards the achievement of Sustainable Energy Innovation in PFI school projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Alignment of objectives; Complex Product Systems (CoPS); Effectiveness of communication; Private Finance Initiative (PFI); Project-collaboration quality; Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI)	RENEWABLE ENERGY; CONSTRUCTION; USER; PARTICIPATION; TECHNOLOGIES; PARTNERSHIPS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; SYSTEMS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the quality of collaboration towards Sustainable Energy Innovation (SEI) in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects. While the capacity of PFI to encourage collaboration towards innovation is largely advocated by its proponents; however, it remains to be supported by empirical evidence. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting the Complex Product System (CoPS) innovation management model, the authors assess the quality of collaboration at the interface between the innovation superstructure of public sector clients and users, and the innovation infrastructure of private sector designers, contractors and operators. Two interactional elements are examined upon which the quality of collaboration is assessed: openness of communication and alignment of objectives. The authors apply the model to four new-built PFI school projects within the context of the UK government Building Schools for the Future Programme. Semi-structured interviews with total of 50 key stakeholders were used as the primary data collection method. Findings - PFI has introduced a number of problematic issues weakening collaborative efforts towards innovation in the project environment. Particularly, the study underlines the restricting internal contractual relationships within the integrated Project Company and the misalignment of Design-Construction-Operation sustainability objectives. It also highlights ineffective communication with public sector clients and users brought in by the restricted nature of PFI engagement processes as well as the misalignment of public sector-private sector sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative nature of the chosen research methodology limits the ability to generalise. The research findings need to be confirmed or rejected by means of quantitative research as representative of all PFI projects. Practical implications - The study emphasizes the public authority's role in relation to providing the necessary conditions for the creation of a collaborative environment conducive to SEI in PFI projects. Originality/value - The study was able to expand the understanding of innovation and collaboration management processes in PFI projects in three respects: First, addressing the limited attention to innovation in PFI research, the study is the first to examine the quality of collaboration in PFI projects towards the implementation SEI. Second, examining the quality of collaboration in PFI projects through the lens of CoPS provides a new understanding of sustainability innovation and strongly indicates that the CoPS model should be expanded to account for the dynamics of innovation processes in the procurement of sustainable CoPS. Third, the explorative nature of the study was useful in generating research hypotheses that can form the basis for future research on SEI in PFI projects.

J	Nicol, JF; Wilson, M				Nicol, J.

Firstly, it assembles existing information about optimizing thermal, air quality, acoustic and visual comfort so that designers can make energy calculations which embody all the best information about aspects of the environment that impinge on energy use. Secondly, it follows other standards in recognizing the different expectations occupants have of the thermal environment in mechanically and naturally ventilated buildings. Potentially this makes EN 15251 an important standard in the design and the evaluation of new and existing buildings. Therefore, it is essential to be clear about its strengths and weaknesses and to indicate ways in which future updates might improve on it. This paper considers the way in which the Standard is written, its underlying philosophy and purpose, and the ways in which it defines unacceptable thermal conditions and how they might be misunderstood. Questions are raised regarding the use of outdoor temperature to define indoor comfort as the basis for providing a comfortable indoor thermal environment. Suggestions are made for improving the Standard. La norme europeenne EN 15251 marque de nouvelles avancees. En premier lieu, elle rassemble les informations existantes relatives a l'optimisation du confort thermique, acoustique, visuel et lie a la qualite de l'air, de facon a permettre aux concepteurs d'effectuer des calculs energetiques qui soient l'expression du meilleur des informations relatives aux aspects environnementaux qui affectent l'utilisation de l'energie. En deuxieme lieu, cette norme suit les autres normes en ce qu'elle reconnait les differentes attentes qui sont celles des occupants en matiere d'environnement thermique dans des immeubles a ventilation mecanique et naturelle. Cela fait potentiellement de la norme EN 15251 une norme importante pour la conception et l'evaluation des immeubles neufs et existants. Il est par consequent essentiel d'en montrer clairement les points forts et les points faibles et d'indiquer les moyens par lesquels de futures mises a jour pourraient y apporter des ameliorations. Le present article examine la maniere dont la norme est redigee, la philosophie et le dessein qui la sous-tendent, ainsi que les facons dont elle definit les conditions thermiques qui ne sont pas acceptables et en quoi celles-ci pourraient etre mal comprises. Des interrogations sont soulevees concernant le fait de se baser, pour assurer un environnement thermique interieur confortable, sur l'utilisation de la temperature exterieure servant a definir le confort interieur. Des suggestions sont faites pour l'amelioration de cette norme. Mots cles: confort thermique adaptatif normes de construction immeubles utilisation de l'energie norme europeenne EN 15251 normes.

J	Hamida, A; Alsudairi, A; Alshaibani, K; Alshamrani, O				Hamida, Amneh; Alsudairi, Abdulsalam; Alshaibani, Khalid; Alshamrani, Othman			Environmental impacts cost assessment model of residential building using an artificial neural network	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Building envelope; Embodied carbon; Energy cost; Operational carbon		Purpose Buildings are major contributors to greenhouse gases (GHG) along the various stages of the building life cycle. A range of tools have been utilised for estimating building energy use and environmental impacts; these are time-consuming and require massive data that are not necessarily available during early design stages. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an Environmental Impacts Cost Assessment Model (EICAM) that quantifies both energy and environmental costs for residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to develop the EICAM. The model consists of six input parameters, including wall type, roof type, glazing type, window to wall ratio (WWR), shading device and building orientation. In addition, the model calculates four measures: annual energy cost, operational carbon over 20 years, envelope embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre. The ANN architecture is 6:13:4:4, where the conjugate gradient algorithm was applied to train the model and minimise the mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, regression analysis for the ANN prediction for each output was performed. Findings The MSE was minimised to 0.016 while training the model. Also, the correlation between each ANN output and the actual output was very strong, with an R-2 value for each output of almost 0.998. Moreover, validation was conducted for each output, with the error percentages calculated at 0.26%, 0.25%, 0.03% and 0.27% for the annual energy cost, operational carbon, envelope materials embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre, respectively. Accordingly, the EICAM contributes to enhancing design decision-making concerning energy consumption and carbon emissions in the early design stages. Research limitations/implications This study provides theoretical implications to the domain of building environmental impact assessment through illustrating a systematic approach for developing an energy-based prediction model that generates four environmental-oriented outputs, namely energy cost, operational energy carbon, envelope embodied carbon, and total carbon. The model developed has practical implications for the architectural/engineering (A/E) industries by providing a useful tool to easily predict environmental impact costs during the early design phase. This would enable designers in Saudi Arabia to make effective design decisions that would increase sustainability in the building life cycle. Originality/value By providing a holistic predictive model entitled EICAM, this study endeavours to bridge the gap between energy costs and environmental impacts in a predictive model for Saudi residential units. The novelty of this model is that it is an alternative tool that quantifies both energy cost, as well as building's environmental impact, in one model by using a machine learning approach. Besides, EICAM predicts its outcomes more quickly than conventional tools such as DesignBuilder and is reliable for predicting accurate environmental impact costs during early design stages.

These new regulations provide information for designers based on Brazil's climate requirements, with specific advice related to lighting systems, HVAC and the thermal envelope of buildings. Nevertheless, requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category without clear criteria. To address this, the paper proposes guidelines for naturally ventilated environments in which specific thermal and air movement acceptability goals must be achieved. The guidelines are based on results from field experiments in non-residential naturally ventilated buildings in different climatic zones as well as drawing on other studies. The proposed guidelines consider occupants' adaptive potential as well as thermal and air movement acceptability. Combining thermal acceptability with air movement acceptability is a key design challenge. Permissible operative temperature ranges are based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard, and minimum air velocity requirements within the occupied zone are specified. Considerations also included 'active' occupants and specific control over openings and fans. Le Gouvernement federal bresilien encourage depuis peu les initiatives en faveur des economies d'energie, et tout particulierement les initiatives << Performances Thermiques des Immeubles - Zones Bioclimatiques Bresiliennes et Directives de Construction pour les Logements a Faible Cout >> et << Reglementation Federale pour l'Etiquetage Volontaire des Niveaux de Rendement Energetique des Immeubles Commerciaux, Publics et de Services >>. Ces reglementations nouvelles fournissent aux concepteurs des informations basees sur les exigences climatiques du Bresil, et s'accompagnent de conseils specifiques relatifs aux systemes d'eclairage, aux systemes CVCA et a l'enveloppe thermique des immeubles. Neanmoins, les exigences relatives aux environnements interieurs a ventilation naturelle apparaissent comme une categorie ouverte sans criteres clairs. Pour traiter ce probleme, le present article propose des directives pour les environnements a ventilation naturelle dans lesquels des objectifs specifiques d'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air doivent etre atteints. Ces directives sont basees sur les resultats d'experiences de terrain menees dans des immeubles non residentiels a ventilation naturelle dans differentes zones climatiques, mais s'appuient egalement sur d'autres etudes. Les directives proposees prennent en consideration le potentiel adaptatif des occupants aussi bien que l'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air. Reussir a combiner l'acceptabilite thermique et l'acceptabilite en matiere de circulation d'air pose un probleme de conception essentiel. Les plages de temperature de service admissibles sont basees sur la norme de confort adaptatif ASHRAE 55, et les exigences minimales quant a la vitesse de l'air dans la zone occupee sont precisees. Ont egalement ete pris en consideration les occupants << actifs >> et les commandes specifiques des ouvertures et des ventilateurs.

J	El Hajj, C; Montes, GM; Jawad, D				El Hajj, Claudette; Martinez Montes, German; Jawad, Dima			An overview of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa developing countries	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modeling; BIM; Barriers; Limitations; Construction industry	INNOVATION; IMPLEMENTATION	Purpose In an attempt to attain a better understanding of the research work on building information modeling (BIM) adoption, this study aims to examine the criticality of BIM adoption barriers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) developing countries from the lens of the sociotechnical theory. Further, the study investigates the differences in the perceptions of various constructions players (owners, contractors and designers) to BIM barriers, as well as possible discrepancies in the perception of BIM users and non-BIM users to the significance of the perceived constraints. Design/methodology/approach To reach this aim, the study starts with a systematic evaluation and a critical review of the literature on BIM barriers. A set of 22 BIM adoption limitations was drawn from the literature which was used to design the survey. To capture a broad perception, a mixed approach was used, and data were collected through an interview study and a survey involving Architecture, Engineering and Construction professionals in the MENA construction sector. The collected data were analyzed using the mean score, standard deviation and nonparametric tests. The further principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the barriers to uncover the latent factors of BIM barriers. Findings The actors ranked the barriers as follows: lack of knowledge and BIM awareness, commercial issues and investment cost, lack of skills and BIM specialist, interoperability and lack of client demand. The examination of the PCA resulted in four underlying BIM limitation factors namely: human, technological, structural and financial. The analysis of the ranking indicated that 16 of the 22 barriers are considered critical in the MENA area. The results of the Mann-Whitney test indicated that there is a statistically significant difference in perceptions of BIM users and nonuser for seven barriers, pointing out that users care most about the financial barriers; however, nonusers are mostly concerned with structural and technological barriers. However, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there is no statistically significant difference in the perceptions of the three categories of stakeholders in ranking all BIM barriers. Practical implications The outcomes will back policymakers and construction participants with the knowledge to develop policy propositions that can positively affect BIM adoption in the construction industry. The significance of this study lies in being one of the very first explorative investigations that comparatively and empirically explored BIM adoption barriers across the whole MENA developing countries. Originality/value While several research studies have examined BIM adoption barriers in various countries, none to the best of the authors' knowledge have attempted to study the whole MENA region as one entity, and none highlighted the impact of user's roles on their perception of adoption barriers within their community. The results contribute to the discussion of the relationship among practitioners' level of involvement in BIM projects and their perception of adoption barriers which is underrepresented in extant studies. The above can assist with prioritizing the barriers that are considered to be more significant given the characteristics of the community under study. The result revealed the value of the structural and human attributes in prioritizing BIM adoption barriers within the MENA construction industry.

J	Hernandez, P; Kenny, P				Hernandez, Patxi; Kenny, Paul			Integrating occupant preference and life cycle energy evaluation: a simplified method	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						comfort; embodied energy; energy analysis; housing; life cycle; low-energy houses; occupant behaviour	THERMAL COMFORT; NATURAL VENTILATION; CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; BUILDINGS; CLIMATE	Building energy evaluation and assessment methods have evolved over the last decades towards sophisticated tools, which can support designers in minimizing building energy use. However, the majority of building energy performance evaluation methods and tools generally do not include a life cycle perspective, choosing to ignore the use of resources associated with the additional materials and systems employed to reduce the energy use of buildings in operation. Considerations of 'acceptable' or 'expected' levels of comfort or occupant preferences are also frequently ignored outside the research community. This paper describes a simple methodology which integrates life cycle energy analysis and comfort expectations with building energy evaluation. It discusses the potential contribution of the occupants' preferences not only in the energy use of buildings in operation, but also the embodied energy associated with equipment and systems. The method is demonstrated in a case study considering a house in a maritime climate with the options of either mechanical or natural ventilation, and some differences in thermal and ventilation preferences. In the study it is observed that as 'zero heating' demand is approached, the embodied energy of materials and systems becomes significant. The differences in occupants' expected temperature and ventilation levels can be important issues to consider when selecting heating and ventilation systems for minimum life cycle energy use. Les methodes d'evaluation energetique des batiments ont evolue au cours des dernieres decennies vers des outils evolues, qui peuvent aider les concepteurs a reduire au minimum l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments. Cependant, la majorite des methodes et des outils d'evaluation de la performance energetique des batiments n'integre generalement pas la perspective du cycle de vie, preferant ignorer l'utilisation des ressources associees aux materiaux et aux systemes complementaires employes pour reduire l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments en service. La prise en compte de niveaux de confort << acceptables >> ou << conformes aux attentes >> ou des preferences des occupants est egalement frequemment ignoree en dehors de la communaute des chercheurs. Cet article decrit une methodologie simple qui integre l'analyse energetique du cycle de vie et les attentes en matiere de confort a l'evaluation energetique des batiments. Il discute de la contribution potentielle des preferences des occupants, non seulement s'agissant de l'utilisation d'energie dans les batiments en service, mais egalement de l'energie grise liee aux materiaux et aux systemes. Une demonstration de cette methode est apportee par une etude de cas qui examine une maison sous un climat maritime offrant le choix d'une aeration mecanique ou naturelle et soumise a un certain nombre de differences concernant les preferences thermiques et d'aeration. Il est observe dans cette etude que, lorsque l'exigence d'un cout de << chauffage zero >> doit etre satisfaite, l'energie intrinseque des materiaux et des systemes devient importante. Les differences relatives aux attentes des occupants concernant les niveaux de temperature et d'aeration peuvent etre des points importants a prendre en compte lors de la selection des systemes de chauffage et d'aeration pour pouvoir obtenir une utilisation minimale d'energie au cours du cycle de vie.

J	Shrestha, PP; Batista, JR				Shrestha, Pramen P.; Batista, Jacimaria R.			Transition from traditional to alternative project delivery methods in water and wastewater project: executive decision-makers' perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Design-bid-build; Design-build; Design-build-operate; Construction manager-at-risk; Water and wastewater projects; Lessons learned	DESIGN-BUILD; PERFORMANCE	Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine the barriers and constraints executive decision-makers have to face during the delivery method selection stage of water and wastewater projects using alternative project delivery (APD) methods, e.g. design-build (DB), design-build-operate (DBO) and construction management-at-risk (CMAR). Design/methodology/approach Structured interviews were conducted with 18 executive decision-makers from public agencies to identify the reasons for transitioning to APD from the design-bid-build (DBB) method. Respondents were also asked about the major obstacles they faced during the decision-making process, as well as key positive and negative factors in using APD methods. The executive decision-makers were also asked about their lessons learned during this process. In addition, this study collected key steps in making APD water and wastewater projects successful. All of the findings from the interview phase were validated by seven public agency executive decision-makers of water and wastewater industries. Findings One major study finding was that executive decision-makers chose the APD method because it provided cost and schedule benefits and the owner could also choose the designer or builder based on qualifications. The study also found that the main obstacles executive decision-makers faced were: (1) difficulty in implementing APD methods because they do not follow the low-bid process, (2) reluctance to use DB/CMAR because of the status quo and (3) unfamiliarity of city councils/elected commissions with the DB/CMAR process. The validation survey found that most findings from the initial phase of interviews were confirmed by the executives who took part in validation phase. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this research is the small sample size. As the executive decision-makers are very hard to reach for interviews, the authors failed to get interviews from a large number of them, despite repeated efforts made by the authors. Another limitation of this study is that the authors contacted most of the executive decision-makers listed in the WDBC list. These executive decision-makers worked for public agencies and, therefore, the views from private agencies could not be included in this research. The authors understand that the validation of the study findings is very important. However, due to the scope and limited time available for the research, the authors could not validate the findings of this study with other public agencies. Practical implications Selecting APD methods instead of DBB methods in water and wastewater projects for public agencies is a crucial issue during the project planning phase. Agencies' executive decision-makers need to understand the advantages and disadvantages of APD methods, along with the transition process in order to smoothly deliver projects. The findings of this study will assist public agency executive decision-makers to mitigate risks, overcome obstacles and become more educated about the APD method process, so that these projects can be successfully delivered within budget and on time. Originality/value This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by identifying lessons learned related to various APD method issues, which can be utilized by municipal executive decision-makers to successfully complete future APD projects.
