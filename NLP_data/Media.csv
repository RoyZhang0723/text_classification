J	Tan, CH; Sutanto, J; Phang, CW				Tan, Chuan-Hoo; Sutanto, Juliana; Phang, Chee Wei			An Empirical Assessment of Second Life vis-a-vis Chatroom on Media Perceptual Assessment and Actual Task Performance	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chatroom; media theory; media perceptual assessment; second life; task performance	SOCIAL PRESENCE; COMMUNICATION MEDIA; INFORMATION; RICHNESS; IMPACT; SATISFACTION; SELECTION; VOICE; FLOW	The contribution of media in fostering communications and exchanges of idea is an enduring topic of investigation. However, our review of existing theories on media and human cognition suggests that there remain taunting contradictions in their theoretical assumptions and postulations with regard to computer-mediated communication (CMC) usage. Specifically, the social presence theory postulates that a rich medium could better facilitate the communication activity by promoting a greater "awareness" of the communicating party, which may then lead to better task performance. Yet, a richer medium could also distract an individual's focus of attention as suggested by the cognitive theory of distraction-conflict. To reconcile these contradicting perspectives, this study conducted an empirical comparison of two CMC tools, i.e., Second Life and online chatroom, in terms of users' perceptions of the media and their actual task performance in these media. The results suggest that a rich medium, such as Second Life, could lead to better perceptual evaluations of users in terms of telepresence, curiosity arousal, and immersion in media. However, the use of a lean medium, such as chatroom, could lead to better task performance in terms of users' recall ability, and the quality of ideas generated during the mediated interactions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Though the social media discovered as a vital tool to enhance DM all over the world, dearth of literature found for the context of Sri Lanka. Therefore, this research focuses on identifying the use of social media for the DM in the context of Sri Lanka and to increase the support given to the possible victims, related to DM through the adoption of social media. A comprehensive literature review has been carried out to investigate the concept of social media and its relationship with DM. Case study research strategy has been used for the data collection on identifying the benefits and limitations on usage of social media for DM in the Sri Lankan context. Collected data analysed using content analysis. Findings of the study revealed, early warning as the most common benefit of using social media for DM in the Sri Lankan context. It was also identified from this study that, there are limitations related to quality of information, public commitment towards social media and financial barriers, which hinder the application of social media in Sri Lanka.

In this way, this paper aims to explore how different purposes of social media use affect project performance from a project manager's perspective. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the mechanism-outcome-performance framework, this paper developed a research model to figure out the mechanism through which work-oriented and socialization-oriented social media use influences construction project performance. The empirical data were collected from a survey of 249 construction project managers, and the structural equation modeling technique was applied to test the proposed model. Findings Results indicate that both work-oriented and socialization-oriented social media use promote knowledge acquisition and project social capital, which both further positively impact the project performance. Additionally, the negative moderating role of information overload is identified on the relationship between social media use and knowledge acquisition. Originality/value This study fulfills the need for an in-depth investigation of social media use on construction project performance, contributing to the project management and social media literature. Furthermore, this study provides recommendations for project managers to advance social media applications in the construction domain.

The context is the consultation process on the construction of a new Crossrail 2 station in Chelsea, London, where there is resistance. Analysis of social media communication by the affected public groups and interviews with the opposing group shows different intragroup concerns, with stakeholders developing a strong identity enabled by social media. To reduce perceived lack of responsiveness, we recommend that project managers harness social media marketing principles for ongoing relationship building.

The use of social customer relationship management by building contractors: evidence from Tasmania	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Customer relationship management; customer-value segmentation; relationship marketing; social customer relationship management; social media	IMPACT; WEAK; CRM; STRENGTH; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; TRUST; MODEL; TIES	Despite its ever-increasing popularity with consumers and businesses, many organizations are still unsure how to effectively use social media in a marketing context. One way in which building firms can use social media is as a customer relationship management (CRM) tool to improve customer engagement and satisfaction (known as social CRM). In order to explore how social CRM (SCRM) can be used, and is being used by building firms, semi-structured interviews with accredited building practitioners were utilized to collect data on SCRM use in the sector. The data were analysed to determine the factors that influence social media use, the extent of SCRM use, and the ways in which building contractors are using SCRM. It was found that builders are using social media to manage client relationships, but to a limited extent due to the complex nature of the builder-client relationship and a lack of perceived trustworthiness. Building firms favoured a transactional approach to social media use, and preferred not to use formal social media strategies. Builders are also reluctant to use social media to assist them in segmenting customers by their value to the firm. For effective social media use, builders may consider two main issues: SCRM strategy and customer-value segmentation to develop profitable customer relationships.

J	Lee, Y				Lee, Youngjin			Re-informative design media in design emergence	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Design conversation; Reciprocal design media; Design process; Design emergence; Haptic cognition; CAD/CAM		Conversation among different types of design media is critical in providing haptic feedback within the architectural design loop. More attention needs to be given to creating a fully integrated design loop of digital architecture, where the gap between form in the virtual model and physical model is generally larger than it was in the pre-digital era due to the difficulty of the externalization of challenging forms via traditional methods. This study examines the significance of reciprocal relationships among different dimensions of design media including 2D drawings, digital models and physical models in design process. For a better understanding of the integrated design process, the characteristics and roles of these media are described particularly within the context of digital architecture. Three case studies of student work show a reconciled design conversation among three different types of media that contributed to the designer's haptic cognitive process offering not only visual serendipities but also suggestions on structure, material and assembly based on understanding the attribute's of each medium.

Evidence From Australian Small to Medium Enterprises	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						productivity; small to medium enterprises; longitudinal study; business skills; project management	MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; SUCCESS; PERFORMANCE; MEGAPROJECTS; INNOVATION; GROWTH; SMES	A fundamental assumption of project management practice and research is that using project management to achieve organizational objectives improves organizational performance. However, there is little published research that directly questions this assumption. This paper tests the hypothesis that using project management increases the productivity of small to medium enterprises, using data from two longitudinal surveys of Australian businesses with less than 200 staff members. These data were used to create models of the relationship between productivity and business skills using binary logistic regression. The models demonstrate that project management has a significant impact on small to medium enterprise productivity.

In this way, the purpose of this study aims to investigate the impact of social media use at work on construction managers' work performance based on the enabler-process-intermediate outcome-performance framework. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the knowledge seeker's perspective to empirically investigate the mechanism through which social media use at work impacts construction managers' work performance. Questionnaire survey was conducted with 210 construction managers to test the research model proposed in this study. A component-based structural equation modeling technique was employed to analyze the data. Findings Results show that social media use at work positively influences knowledge acquisition both internally and externally, and knowledge acquisition promotes task self-efficacy and creativity, which in turn improve construction managers' work performance. In addition, the interaction of task self-efficacy and creativity is found to negatively influence work performance. Originality/value These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding about the impact of social media use at work on construction managers' work performance. This research also provides informative insights for practitioners on how to improve work performance.

Management support was used as the representative social influence, and age, status, and ease of use represented individual attributes. An examination was also made on how e-mail use, individual attributes, and management support affected the perceptions of e-mail's information richness and e-mail productivity. Two different types of surveys, log sheets and perception-based self-reports, as wed as interviews and e-mail correspondences composed the data sources, Three hierarchical regression models were defined and tested for the hypothesis validation, Data analysis indicated that management support was a much more powerful indicator for teleworkers' media use than individual characteristics. Furthermore, although labeled as a relatively lean medium from the media richness theory perspective, e-mail could become an effective and richer communication tool through an active social construction process of management support . Finally, the management support and perception of e-mail as a rich medium were both highly influential in creating teleworkers' positive perception on e-mail productivity. This study rendered a strong indication that effective adoption of e-mail by teleworkers as an information-rich medium could benefit distributed work and distributed organizations through enhanced work productivity.

Design/methodology/approach The method comprised comprehensive data analytics using network link analysis and natural language processing tools to discover similarities and differences of social networks, topics of interests and sentiments and emotions on different social media platforms. Findings From the research, it showed that all clusters (construction company, construction worker, construction media and construction union) shared similar trends on follower-following ratios and sentiment analysis in both social media platforms. The biggest difference between the two countries is that public accounts (e.g. company, media and union) on Twitter posted more on public interests, including safety and energy. Research limitations/implications The research contributes to knowledge about an alternative method of data collection for both academia and industry practitioners. Statistical bias can be introduced by only using social media platform data. The analyzed four clusters can be further divided to reflect more fine-grained groups of construction industries. The results can be integrated into other analyses based on traditional methodologies of data collection such as questionnaire surveys or interviews. Originality/value The research provides a comparative study of the construction industries in China and the USA among four clusters using social media platform data.

Influence of the Adoption and Use of Social Media Tools on Absorptive Capacity in New Product Development	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						New Product Development; Absorptive Capacity; Social Media	FUZZY FRONT-END; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; CAPABILITIES; TECHNOLOGY	In this article, we discuss how the adoption and use of social media tools influences new product development (NPD). Our aim is specifically to consider how an organization's absorptive capacity is influenced by using social media tools. Based on a two-phase data collection process comparing the situation before and after adoption of social media tools in three organizations, we conclude that the amount of accessible knowledge and the number of ideas increases as an organization's ability to find and access various sources of intra-organizational expertise increases, thus, increasing knowledge acquisition and assimilation. Consequently, we infer that organizational absorptive capacity rises and is linked to improvement in new product development.

J	Chen, YD; Wang, Q; Ji, WY				Chen, Yudi; Wang, Qi; Ji, Wenying			Rapid Assessment of Disaster Impacts on Highways Using Social Media	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disaster management; Highway infrastructure; Social media mining	TRANSPORTATION; CLASSIFICATION; TWEET	A timely and reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is desired for executing evacuations, providing emergency services, and planning relief and recovery activities in disaster management. Although social media-a near-real-time and human-centered information source-has been increasingly investigated to assess disaster impacts on communities, the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is still less explored due to the lack of a systematic and reliable approach. To fill this gap, this research presents a social media-based approach to assess disaster impacts on highways. Two social media-based indicators, namely, the number of impact-related tweets (NIT) and the geolocation of impact-related tweets (GIT), are designed to indicate the severity and location of disaster impacts on highways, respectively. Disaster impacts on highways during Hurricane Harvey in Houston were studied to demonstrate the developed approach.

J	Yuan, FX; Liu, R				Yuan, Faxi; Liu, Rui			Mining Social Media Data for Rapid Damage Assessment during Hurricane Matthew: Feasibility Study	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Damage assessment; Social media; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Naive Bayes	TWITTER; INFORMATION; TWEETS	Previous research has employed social media index such as disaster-related ratio (DIRR) or damage-related ratio (DARR) and sentiment to estimate the damages during disasters. These studies mainly used predefined keywords to filter disaster- and damage-related social media data. However, many tweets containing predefined keywords (e.g., Hurricane Matthew) do not describe disaster events or their impacts. Meanwhile, previous sentiment analysis has not considered users' tweet frequencies, which can bring in data bias. These studies also lacked a baseline to reflect disaster impacts on the public's sentiment. Therefore, this research proposes to use supervised machine-learning approach to identify the damage-related social media data. It also analyzes users' tweet frequencies and introduces the annual average sentiment as the baseline to calculate the normalized sentiment. Compared with previous research, the authors' method has identified more damage-related tweets and demonstrated higher precision and recall. Correlation analysis is conducted between the social media index and the insurance claim data in Hurricane Matthew. The results show a strong and positive correlation between the DARR and claim data. A strong and negative correlation is found between sentiment and claim data. The adjusted R2 of the final regression model between damage and social media index demonstrates the feasibility of mining social media data for rapid damage assessment. The results can benefit crisis response managers in collecting real-time information and understanding timely situations during disasters. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Burns, SE; Zhang, M				Burns, SE; Zhang, M			Digital image analysis to assess microbubble behavior in porous media	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BUBBLE-GROWTH; AQUIFER	Air sparging is a commonly implemented technology for the remediation of volatile organic compounds from contaminated soil and groundwater. In the sparging process, air is pressurized into the soil/groundwater matrix through injection wells. The air then travels to the ground surface through buoyancy, acting as a collector for volatile chemicals. To date, the design and implementation of air sparging has been largely empirical, based on the results of pilot studies. This paper uses digital image analysis to examine the transport and coalescence behavior of microbubbles in porous media, one of the most important control parameters for contaminant removal in air sparging. This laboratory study compared the diameter of bubbles produced in aqueous systems with the diameters produced in uniform spherical particulate media (diameters of 14.5 mm and 27.0 mm) and in elliptically shaped particulate media (equivalent spherical diameters of 14.5 mm). Results showed that the presence of a particulate media increased the average diameter and also increased the range of diameters of bubbles produced during sparging. As the diameter of the particulate media increased, the size of the bubbles decreased, indicating less coalescence in media with larger pore space. In addition, the effect of trace concentrations of surface-active agents (surfactants) on the diameter and coalescence behavior of bubbles was examined. In both aqueous and aqueous/particulate matrices, the presence of surfactants significantly decreased the average diameter of the bubbles produced. Additionally, the degree of coalescence decreased in the surfactant systems, producing a very narrow range of bubble diameters in both aqueous and aqueous/particulate media.

Although many construction organizations have adopted social media technologies to improve project team processes, little is known about how social media use at work affects project team processes and project management performance. Against this background, employing the enabler-process-intermediate outcome-performance framework, this paper aims to explore the mechanism by which social media use at work affects project management performance with a specific focus on project team processes and project team efficacy. Based on literature research and theoretical analysis, the theoretical model with several research hypotheses is formulated. The empirical data are collected from 156 construction project managers, and the structural equation modeling technique is applied to test the theoretical model. The results show that social media use at work positively influences three team processes, specifically, effective communication, knowledge sharing, and coordination. The three project team processes then indicate different effects on project team efficacy. Furthermore, the project team processes enhance project management performance through project team efficacy. These empirical results reveal the benefits of social media use at work in construction project teams and provide valuable implications for practice.

We find that the effect of social factors, such as increased attention to a stock's volatility, is more significant than public sentiment. A prediction model is introduced based on social factors and public sentiment to predict stock volatility. Our findings indicate that the influence of social media data on the next day's volatility is more significant but declines over time.

J	Unwin, S				Unwin, Simon			Analysing architecture through drawing	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						analytical tools; architecture; artefacts; design practices; design process; drawing; representation; visualization		This paper reflects on drawing as a medium for acquiring knowledge and understanding of the possibilities and workings of architecture by analysing examples. Drawing has been much discussed as a medium for design and of communication in architecture, but the potential of its role as a medium for analysis, though recognized, has not enjoyed the same attention. The paper begins with a review of drawing's use as a medium of communication and as a medium for the generation, development and refinement of design; it then focuses on drawing's use as a medium for analysing examples. The paper discusses the relationship between drawing and architecture and uses some of the author's own photographs and drawings as illustrations. It argues that rather than being a distinct mediator between architecture ( the contribution of the mind) and building ( the physical realization of architecture), drawing involves both. Drawing, therefore, can be seen as a surrogate replication on paper of the intellectual ( architecture) and constructional ( building). In conclusion, the paper argues that drawing constitutes not merely an instrument of architectural production ( design and communication), but, as the envelope of both architecture and building, is the arena of architectural power.

Design media are intended to support the cognitive nature of design and, particularly, the exploitation of design knowledge in computational environments. Basic theoretical assumptions are presented which underlie the development of design media. A central assumption is that designers share common forms of design knowledge which can be formalized, represented, and employed in computational environments. Generic knowledge is proposed as one such seminal form of design knowledge. We then develop a cognitive model which relates to the internal mental representations, strategies and mechanisms of generic design. The paper emphasizes the theoretical foundations of design media. This theoretical discussion is then exemplified through case studies presenting current research for the support of visual cognition in design. We introduce an approach to design schema as a visual form of generic design knowledge. Secondly we present a conceptual framework for the support of schema emergence in visual reasoning in design media. Finally, some implications of schema emergence in design collaboration are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It is particularly interesting to study information exchanges in geographically distributed product development teams because of the highly interdependent nature of design organizations., Additionally, the use of electronic-based communication media has changed how development teams communicate. By studying the way product development teams use various communication media (face-to-face, telephone, and e-mail), we assess how the process of exchanging technical information is influenced by factors such as geographic dispersion, organizational bonds, and degree of team interdependence. We present a model that allows us to formulate several hypotheses about how these factors influence both communication frequency and media choice. We use empirical evidence from the telecommunications industry to test our hypotheses. We confirm previous results about the obstructive influence of distance on technical communication. However, we found that such negative effects may be mitigated by other factors such as the recognizing of highly interdependent team members, the existence of strong organizational bonds, and the use of electronic communication media.

J	Liang, YP; Ashuri, B				Liang, Yunping; Ashuri, Baabak			Challenges and enabling features of small and medium infrastructure public-private partnerships (P3s): a case study of the US P3 infrastructure market	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Enabling features; Small and medium projects; Public-private partnership; Infrastructure; Challenges		Purpose - In classical perspective, projects under a certain size are not feasible for P3. However, there is an emerging trend on using P3 to deliver projects which are frequently at small- to medium- size to meet ever-increasingly complex social needs, including enhancing lifecycle performance of existing facilities, designing and building for resilience and sustainability, ensuring cost effectiveness of public spending and fostering innovation. In contrast with the increasing implementation, small and medium P3s, especially those in the United States, receive little attention in existing studies. This study aims at answering the question: in the context of US, what features of those small- to medium- sized P3s with success records enable the selection of P3 as delivery method. Design/methodology/approach - By critically reviewing the literature, this study synthesizes and discusses the challenges in classical perspective. The authors use a framework drawn from the transaction cost to propose two types of enabling features that could contribute to the success of small and medium P3s. The proposed enabling features are supported by case study of twelve identified small- to medium- sized P3s which have reached financial closure as of 2018 in the United States. Findings- The results show how the identified enabling opportunities have been used in these cases to enhance the viability of the P3 model in the infrastructure market. The two types of features are high tolerance enabler explained by the expectations on indirect and non-monetary compensations, and cost reduction enablers including: (1) being in the sectors with well-established traditions on using private investments; (2) having developers with expertise on infrastructure finance; (3) being in the jurisdictions with favorable legislative environment and (4) having less-uncertain future project revenue. Originality/value - This study, for the first time, critically examines the enabling features of the P3 model for delivering small and medium infrastructure projects in the United States. This research sheds light on the credibility and viability of small- to medium- sized P3 and increases the confidence in policy makers to promote this model.

Deepening the Divide: Crises Disproportionately Silence Vulnerable Populations on Social Media	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TWITTER; DISASTER; HAZARDS; LOSSES; DAMAGE	In the last decade, crisis informatics has sought to produce and use actionable information from social media data. Although substantial progress has been made in discerning how the data can be used, there is a lack of research identifying possible inequities in that use. Previous research has shown that vulnerable populations use social media less in a disaster; however, the extent to which this social media usage disparity is predictable and the magnitude of that disparity has not been explored. This paper compared the covariance in Twitter activity and social vulnerability factors during a steady-state period prehurricane with that during the perturbed state period following Hurricane Harvey's landfall. These models showed that sociodemographic vulnerability factors better predict Twitter activity during a crisis than do infrastructural damage, that sociodemographic factors negatively influence Twitter activity, and that this phenomenon is strengthened by a crisis. The crisis-specific negative covariance indicates the need for increased consideration of vulnerability factors in social media data-driven management of urban resilience and resource distribution.

J	Al-Hasan, A; Yim, D; Lucas, HC				Al-Hasan, Abrar; Yim, Dobin; Lucas, Henry C., Jr.			A Tale of Two Movements: Egypt During the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Group cohesion; online activism; social media; social movement; text mining	LARGE SOCIAL NETWORK; WORD-OF-MOUTH; COLLECTIVE DYNAMICS; ONLINE; MEDIA; BEHAVIOR; SALES; NEWSPAPERS; REVOLUTION; EMOTIONS	Social media provides flexible platforms that play key roles in energizing collective action in movements like Arab Spring (AS) and Occupy Wall Street (OWS). By enabling individuals to display emotions broadly, social media amplify sentiments defined as shared collective emotion to supply the forces that drive change in society. This study describes how one platform, Facebook, contributed to these two different examples of political activism. Using social network analytics and text mining, we examine how Fan Page posts during the life of the movements influenced the formation of social ties by using sentimental messaging. We hypothesize a set of relationships between group cohesion and polarity of sentiments in explaining involvement. We find that the strength of social ties formed through exchanges of posts and comments influence participation, but its effect differs across two movements. We also find that negative sentiments are associated with more participation for Egypt during the AS than OWS. Our results suggest cultural differences play a major role in participation behaviors. Social media is important in engineering management, because someone who has a negative reaction to a project or a product can use these media to reach thousands of individuals and potentially turn sentiment against a project.

This research explored this assumption by testing whether the use of project management and IT skills have a positive affect on business' total sales and profitability. The research data was drawn from two longitudinal Government surveys of small to medium enterprises in Australia. Models were created to describe the relationship between project management, IT skills, profitability and total sales using multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression. The results show that when controlling for the influence of other business skills, project management and IT skills have a significant positive influence on sales and profitability.

Social Media Data Analytics for the US Construction Industry: Preliminary Study on Twitter	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction industry; Social media; Twitter; Big data; United States	MANAGEMENT	The increasing use of the Internet for many purposes is creating big data, many of which are generated from social media. These big data potentially could assist in obtaining valuable administrative information and even explore new social phenomena. Traditional ways of collecting data, such as questionnaire surveys, are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, the use of social media affords the opportunity to extract information that might be of benefit to the construction industry in a responsive and inexpensive manner. To this end, this paper explores whether information and knowledge that would be valuable in the construction domain can be generated by analyzing social media data. Twitter was selected for an initial trial analysis because of its wide usage in the United States. Because they represent a majority of the construction users in Twitter, the following four user clusters were selected and analyzed: construction workers, construction companies, construction unions, and construction media. For each user identified in the four clusters, the 3,200 most recent Twitter messages were collected, which were analyzed from the following aspects: sentiment analysis, topic modeling, link analysis, geolocation analysis, and timeline analysis. Different data-analysis methods were used for the specific themes, such as Stanford Natural Language Processing (StanfordNLP) for sentiment analysis. The detailed findings, benefits, and barriers to incorporating social media data analytics in the construction industry, as well as future research directions, are discussed in this paper. For example, the sentiment analysis results indicated that construction workers tend to have a higher proportion of negative messages compared to the other clusters, which may prompt more attention to emotional guidance and understanding by construction companies and the public. This paper benefits academia by testing an alternative way of studying the construction population, which could help decision makers gain a better understanding of real-world situations in the construction industry.

Design/methodology/approach The research methodology was based on taxonomic analysis to determine the coefficient of leadership potential in the following areas: financial growth of an enterprise, internal processes, human resources development and market potential. The examination process was grounded on the materials from small and medium-sized construction companies located in Russia and China. Findings Subgroups of companies with positive dynamics of indicators, an unstable situation and negative trends of leadership potential formation are identified. Russian small and medium-sized construction companies prioritize the development of sales policies and the management of internal business processes, while Chinese companies-human potential. The generated regression equations indicate a direct relationship between stakeholder engagement and the leadership potential of construction companies in both countries. Originality/value The scientific contribution of this study is the proposed methodological approach to assessing the development of the leadership potential of an enterprise and diagnosing the degree of stakeholders' influence on the latter. This is facilitated by comprehensive analysis, which includes an assessment of leadership potential based on the results of taxonomic analysis, construction of vector diagrams and regression analysis. This study can be useful for persons conducting research in the direction of small and medium-sized business management, forming a strategy for business development and competition policy to form a company's leadership position in the market.

The INVOLVE framework was developed to respond to the need for planning for collaborative tasks focused on the architecture, engineering, and construction industry when using virtual prototypes. This study presents the elements of the INVOLVE framework, then demonstrates the validation in team interaction when different media configurations are used for two different collaborative tasks, a schematic site plan development, and a four-dimensional schedule review. The team interactions were implemented through a series of quasi-experiments within a collaborative interactive workspace. Observational methods were used to quantify the timing and duration of different team and media interactions. The findings show that changes in media traits have a measurable effect on a team's communication and can shift the performance of certain tasks between a cooperative process and a collaborative one. The findings suggest INVOLVE provides an effective framework for determining and planning the needed infrastructure to improve engagement and communication to support collaborative tasks.

This article aims to assess the interplay between four of the key phenomena that has fuelled this development, namely crowdfunding, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and initial coin offerings (ICOs). By making use of social media analytics, public discussions on social media concerning crowdfunding, blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs have been systematically tracked in social media over three time periods between the May 6, 2017, and October 2, 2018. In doing so, a total of 197 770 captured posts across social media platforms have been collected and analyzed. The results illustrate that discussions on blockchain technologies dominated the interplay in the first analyzed time period, that discussions on cryptocurrencies and ICOs dominated the interplay in the second analyzed time period, while discussions concerning blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs highly converge in the third time period. By illustrating this shift over the analyzed time periods and by offering a systematic exploration of key characteristics of the interplay at hand, this article adds to previous literature on entrepreneurial finance by providing an empirical contribution which details the coevolution of these phenomena in recent years.

J	Chen, YD; Ji, WY				Chen, Yudi; Ji, Wenying			Enhancing Situational Assessment of Critical Infrastructure Following Disasters Using Social Media	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disaster response; Infrastructure resilience; Hurricane Irma; Electricity infrastructure; Topic modeling	DAMAGE ASSESSMENT	Social media, a near-real-time information source, has been widely used to provide timely infrastructure-related insights following disasters. However, most previous social media-based studies have been solely focused on assessing infrastructure damage, which leads to partial situational assessment lacking the other main types of infrastructure conditions, i.e., functioning and restoration. To bridge this research gap, the present study aims to examine the use of social media for systematically sensing infrastructure conditions following disasters. An efficient topic modeling-based approach is proposed (1) to model infrastructure condition-related topics through incorporating domain knowledge into the correlation explanation, and (2) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of topic engagement levels for systematically sensing infrastructure functioning, damage, and restoration conditions. To demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach, electricity infrastructure conditions within Florida following Hurricane Irma are studied. This research provides a systematic situational assessment of critical infrastructure following disasters, thereby enabling practitioners to make informed decisions in infrastructure management. Also, the proposed approach investigates the interactions between humans and infrastructure systems, which advances human-centered infrastructure management.

Project management can play a significant role in facilitating this contribution, but SMEs require less bureaucratic forms of project management than those used by larger, traditional organizations. We are undertaking this research to identify the nature of project management required by SMEs, and the results of the qualitative stage of our research are reported in this paper. We interviewed people from companies of the three sizes of SME, micro, small and medium, from a range of industries and from four countries. SMEs use project management both to manage operations, to deliver tailored or bespoke products to customers, and manage innovation and growth. We found similar project management approaches used for both purposes. The main differences occurred by size of company and country. Both Ireland and Sweden looked for more laissez-faire management styles, while people in Austria and Romania were willing to accept more autocratic styles. People in Sweden wanted more structure than people in Ireland. Also laissez-faire styles of management were more appropriate in micro and small companies, whereas more democratic or autocratic styles were needed in medium-sized companies. All three sizes of company wanted less bureaucratic versions of project management than traditional forms, but medium-sized companies, where people fulfil more specialist roles, need more structure than small and micro companies.

To identify the problems, the writers used a case-based approach and interviewed the chairman of one small- to medium-sized enterprise (SME). Findings derived from the interview were validated by further interviewing four members of the construction union in Taiwan, three government officials, and four managers of mortgage banks. The theory of constraints approach was used to examine the construction development process of the SME and indicate the undesirable effects that hindered it and needed immediate attention. The study results were systemized into a conceptual model for developers' future reference to improve management of the development process and identify the root causes of problems.

In recent years, much research into the development of computer-aided design has looked at the concept generation stage of the design process. Most of these applied studies have focused on the testing of computer systems. On the other hand, there are also many studies on the visual thinking and cognitive behavior of designers while sketching or drawing in the stage of concept generation. From the synthesis of the two aforementioned disciplines, we can find that there exists a point of deficiency. That is, the cognitive research about designers using computers as sketching media is absent. It is this area that is discussed in the current paper. The fundamental analytic data of this research is the visual process chronicled from the sketching of subjects. The analytic data is the verbal data from the questions that the subjects are asked after sketching. The data is analyzed using three coding schemes. The cognitive appearance while designers generating concepts with computers or conventional media are propounded and discussed in this research. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Sujon, M; Dai, F				Sujon, Mohhammad; Dai, Fei			Social Media Mining for Understanding Traffic Safety Culture in Washington State Using Twitter Data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic safety culture; Social media mining; Sentiment analysis; Topic modeling	SEAT-BELT USE; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS	Traffic safety culture has emerged as a significant factor in support of the recognition of existing traffic safety policies and programs and as a contextual variable to describe high-risk behaviors of drivers. However, it is an arduous task to understand people's beliefs and attitudes that collectively make up traffic safety-related influences. The growing acceptance of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have spurred great interest in massive data collection and its use in conducting a comprehensive analysis of people's viewpoints on a particular topic. This study applied social media mining to shed light on traffic safety culture in the state of Washington. To this end, the researchers collected traffic safety-related tweets over the past 4 years in Washington based on a set of keywords. After cleaning and reprocessing, the collected tweets were used in sentiment analysis using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to measure the public's beliefs and attitudes toward the importance of traffic safety, possibility of zero fatalities, usefulness of traffic law enforcement, and six types of high-risk behaviors, including impaired driving, speeding, distracted driving, unrestrained vehicle occupants, teenage drivers, and older drivers. Next, the topic modeling technique was applied to discover important latent topics related to traffic safety culture. This research, which capitalizes on social media mining, overcomes the limitations of the conventional survey method, which are time-consuming and costly. The generated information may facilitate understanding of the barriers to preventing fatal traffic accidents in Washington and around the country and developing solutions to overcome them.

J	Rosa, DV; Chaves, MS; Oliveira, M; Pedron, C				Rosa, Debora Virginio; Chaves, Marcirio Silveira; Oliveira, Mirian; Pedron, Cristiane			Target A collaborative model based on social media to support the management of lessons learned in projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Social media; Knowledge management; Lessons learned; IT/IS projects; Project Management 2.0	MIXED METHODS RESEARCH; WEB 2.0; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS LEARN; CONSTRUCTION; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGIES; PERSPECTIVE; NAVIGATION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a model of adoption of social media to assist project managers in the treatment of lessons learned (LL). Target, a collaborative model to foster learning in projects, approaches the problem of LL management from nearly a new light and perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted using a mixed methods approach with a research design denominated partially mixed concurrent equal status. In this design, both quantitative and qualitative elements were conducted concurrently in their entirety before being mixed at the data interpretation stage. These elements have approximately equal emphasis with respect to reaching the objectives of the research. Findings - The results indicate the most suitable social media that match each LL process. They show how to manage LL through processes made in any phase of the project life cycle. The LL processes most commonly used in the projects are raising awareness, collect and store. According to the questionnaire respondents, 54.5 percent of organizations make use of social media in project management, and among the interviewees, half of them use such tools in projects. In addition, 84.1 percent of the questionnaire respondents believe that social media can assist in the LL management. Research limitations/implications - This study did not get proven successful experience reports in the management of LL. Respondents and interviewees mentioned and recognized such importance, but in projects that use LL management there are no control reports of this learning in organizations in order to measure the gains from the practice of LL management, which indicates an area for future work. An empirical validation of the model proposed in this paper is one immediate research to be done. Another future work is to validate the model in projects from disparate sectors. Practical implications - The Target model could minimize the problem of knowledge drain, which is ineffective learning practices, resulting in knowledge hoarding, limited sharing and superficial LL practices. Thus, the use of processes supported by collaborative tools that promote discussion, with a familiar format for the user and with an efficient search engine, can generate greater involvement in projects. The usefulness is determined as practical and scientific. It is determined as practical use, because the model allows the selection of tools for each LL process and it can be applied to projects in organizations. Originality/value - This research proposes a new approach to the management of LL supported by social media. The Target model adds a theoretical contribution to LL processes associating them to social media. This research revisited the extant LL processes and methods in the literature, proposing a new process - raising awareness - that covers personal and interpersonal aspects for the management of LL. The theoretical contribution lies on incremental originality, since it is based on existing theories, processes, methods and tools in order to provide a solution to a known problem.

Using survey data from 72 industrial SME managers, the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) was applied to a model to measure Brazilian SMEs' competitiveness rates. The variables that influence their competitiveness were identified and structured in a decision tree with three levels: key performance indicators (KPIs), critical success factors (CSFs), and fundamental points of view (FPVs). It was possible to identify the KPIs, CSFs, and FPVs that are more important for SMEs' competitiveness and measure their competitiveness rates. The managerial decision-making processes in SMEs can be defined following the competitiveness standards in this research.	[Schaefer, J. L.; Furtado, J. C.; Nara, E. O.

This paper aims to analyze how firms in low and medium technology industries implement their OI strategy. In doing so, we explore common patterns in OI strategies by considering inbound, outbound, and coupled OI practices. We also examine whether there are differences in innovation performance among companies adopting a specific OI strategy. The study is carried out on a sample of 242 Spanish innovating companies. Based on the relevance of the different OI practices, we identify three types of OI firms: advanced open innovators, intermediate open innovators, and incipient open innovators. Our results reveal that advanced open innovators have a higher performance in product innovation, and that there are no differences among groups in process and organizational innovation.

J	Haider, H; Sadiq, R; Tesfamariam, S				Haider, Husnain; Sadiq, Rehan; Tesfamariam, Solomon			Risk-Based Framework for Improving Customer Satisfaction through System Reliability in Small-Sized to Medium-Sized Water Utilities	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Customer satisfaction; Risk analysis; System reliability; Small-sized to medium-sized water utilities; Root cause analysis; Failure mode effect analysis	PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CLIENT-SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY	Small-sized to medium-sized water utilities (SMWU) face severe challenges to maximize the customer satisfaction (CS) because of operational failures, limited trained staff, and financial issues. Conventional methods are based on performance benchmarking and interviews, which might not be feasible at all times for SMWU. A novel risk-based framework is developed for improving CS by improving the reliability of water supply systems operating in a utility. The framework is primarily based on comprehensive analysis of customer complaints and staff's observations on related complaints. Customer dissatisfaction is evaluated in terms of risk of not meeting CS, which starts when a customer reports a complaint; however, a complete evaluation of CS depends on the duration between the time of the report and the response until the complaints' full resolution. Different categories of complaints are identified from an exhaustive record of a medium-sized utility in Okanagan Basin (British Columbia, Canada). For risk management, root cause analysis and failure mode effect analysis are performed. To address inherent uncertainties associated with data limitations and vagueness in decision makers' perception, fuzzy set theory is employed. The results show that almost half of the cumulative risk can be reduced with inspection and maintenance interventions which are not very expensive; however, the remaining risk reduction requires large-scale infrastructure improvements.

A governmentality approach is used to account for these strategies. A metro rail megaproject in India provides the case for the study. The strategies were identified through a content analysis of 640 project and non-project based Tweets posted by the metro rail organization. We augmented this dataset with the community's response through social media, as well as through semi-structured interviews that captured the project teams' responses. The findings indicate that the megaproject used various strategies: promoting the organization, giving progress updates, appealing to the community, as well as targeting of specific sections of the population. The effect of these attempts at governmentality through branding were observed in community discourses on social media platforms that echoed the strategic discourses projected by the megaproject while interviews enabled us to access the project team's responses. For the project community, the effects included a positive brand image, creating community brand advocates and building support for the project during contentious episodes. For the project team, the effects included job attraction, enhanced job perception as well as the creation of project team brand advocates. The relation between the governmentality instruments and their corresponding effects are theorized in six propositions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Whilst achievement of zero defects was an ultimate aim, smaller construction firms identified the shorter-term need to deal effectively with defects during the post-construction phase. Project activities explored problems and identified ways of improving the management of the defects liability period. Proposed solutions ranged from simple modifications to management procedures, through innovative methods of working with tenants to more fundamental changes in design and construction processes. Construction firms and housing associations recognized the importance of working together to improve procedures. Small- and medium-sized construction firms can address performance issues in practical ways and have a potentially valuable role to play in promoting industry improvement. Action learning can support the process of change being instigated by Egan in 1998 and solutions generated by action learning have the potential for wider dissemination and use.

We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with a megaproject team and analysed their social media communications with the project community. The findings show three ICT practices used for managing external stakeholders: visualisation, simulation and social mediatisation. Taking a sociomateriality lens we demonstrate how these practices are used for diverse unintended uses to manage external stakeholders. Anchored in a dimensions of power framework, we discuss how these ICT practices were strategically used for persuading, framing and hegemonizing external stakeholders in megaprojects. Theoretically, we highlight the role of ICT for managing external stakeholders over the current use of improving the competitive advantage of internal stakeholders. Practically, social media is used to articulate practices in all the strategic roles, positioning it in a role as a critical ICT tool for external stakeholder management in infrastructure megaprojects.

J	Kock, N; Davison, R				Kock, N; Davison, R			Can lean media support knowledge sharing? Investigating a hidden advantage of process improvement	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						action research; Brazil; collaborative technologies; electronic communication; knowledge sharing; New Zealand; process improvement	ELECTRONIC MAIL; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATION; RICHNESS; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; COMMUNITIES; GROUPWARE	Is there a positive link between the use of collaborative technologies and knowledge sharing? The body of empirical evidence compiled so far suggests a negative answer to this question. Many explanations have been proposed, the most common being that current collaborative technologies do not yet have enough sophistication, or do not yet provide enough media richness, to enable knowledge sharing. This paper presents evidence that not only suggests that this explanation is wrong, but also that simple collaborative technologies can have a positive effect on knowledge sharing in organizations. This paper shows that, when combined with appropriate social processes, collaborative technologies may foster knowledge sharing. It does so by focusing on process improvement as a group process, and showing that: 1) process improvement is a catalyst to knowledge sharing and 2) a lean communication medium, namely e-mail conferencing, has a positive impact on knowledge sharing when used to support process improvement initiatives.

Mobile social media like WhatsApp and WeChat emerge as new-generation collaboration tools in such endeavors. Based on a literature review, this study posits that how well team-tool, task-tool and team-task relationships are handled shape virtual collaboration effectiveness. The conceptual framework, validated with the interviews from inter-organizational project team members in China and the USA, leads to a research model. The results of a larger-scale survey confirm that tool usability, task fit and team connectivity contribute to virtual collaboration effectiveness, which affects project management success and team appreciation. In addition, there are noticeable cross-country differences, especially the opposite moderating effects that degree of use imposes on the relationship between virtual collaboration effectiveness and project management success. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study is to identify the potential impacts of the WHS Act 2011 on safety management in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the NSW construction industry. In particular, the objectives of the research are (1) to identify the major changes resulting from the Act; (2) to measure the current level of awareness of these changes among SMEs; (3) to establish the potential of the changes to affect SMEs safety management in the NSW construction industry. Seven key changes were identified. Questionnaire results show a particularly low level of awareness in relation to these seven major changes. This is disconcerting given the strong potential for the changes to positively affect SMEs' safety management. This study is significant as it shows that SMEs in the NSW construction industry require more exposure and education at times of legislative changes in order for them to ensure legislative compliance is implemented and maintained.

Magnetic resonance measurements of a porous medium allow the determination of necessary parameters to evaluate permeability and porosity of the medium and the type of hydrocarbons present in the pore fluid. This information is of particular importance in evaluation of hydrocarbon transport in contaminated soils. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study intended to evaluate the robustness of the magnetic resonance imaging technology using well-characterized laboratory specimens of porous material containing hydrocarbon liquids. First, a dry uniform sand pack impregnated with an aqueous coal tar mixture was imaged to evaluate discernable hydrocarbon distribution in the pore space of the sand column. Then, packed columns of glass beads of various sizes, permeated with distilled water and trichloroethylene, were imaged. The discernable images of the pore space and the interface of the two liquids in the pore space indicated that magnetic resonance imaging could be a viable tool to determine spatial distribution and mass fraction of hydrocarbon liquids in contaminated subsurface.

Low-cost internet of things (IoT) for monitoring and optimising mining small-scale trucks and surface mining shovels	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); Fleet information system (FIS); Fleet management systems (FMS); Mining equipment; Material handling	INDUSTRY 4.0; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; TECHNOLOGY	This paper discusses the design and deployment of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) in medium-scale open pit mines to optimise the performance of their mining small-scale trucks and surface mining shovels. Low-cost IoT can be implemented in medium-scale operations to automate the collection of process management information that is currently measured manually, replicating part of the results delivered by commercial Fleet Management Systems (FMSs) such as the calculations of the number of truck cycles per shift, the shovel loading time, truck and shovel positioning, tonnes moved per day, truck speed and average fleet efficiency. The process of developing mining benches can also be monitored. By monitoring these tasks, FMSs in the mining industry allow mine operators to maximise productivity, reduce the number of equipment required to accomplish production targets, minimise material re-handling, supply the plant as planned and meet ore blending objectives for better metallurgical recoveries. In the case of large-scale mines, these mining operations are prepared to invest in the high cost of a typical FMS (of the order of $100,000/ month depending on fleet size) because they enable mine operators to ensure that their capital-intensive fleets operate at peak productivity, generating maximum return on investment. By contrast, many medium-scale mines cannot afford the installation and ongoing costs associated with a commercial FMS. Medium-scale mines typically have low capitalization, rented mining fleet and are run on a day-to-day basis, with staff being employed or laid off on an almost continuous basis. The emergence of low-cost IoT promises widespread and access to sensors and data that can be used for operational decision-making. This paper presents a trial of a low-cost, under $100, IoT-based Fleet Information System (FIS). The system does not attempt to replicate the functionality of a full FMS but delivers key management information to the mine operators while having low capital and running costs and no requirement for IT or technical skills for installation or maintenance. In a test case in Chile, the FIS was used to inform operational management changes that resulted in a reduction of loading time, optimisation of mining truck routes and truck speed control for better safety without an increase in the mining cost. The low cost of the solution allows medium-scale mines access to tools that can enable them to mirror the performance improvements of their bigger competitors. For medium-scale mines, that means longer life-of-mine, more local employment and a longer positive impact in the community.

The Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) 2009 is used to assess the current state of the English building stock in terms of its vulnerability to overheating. The English Housing Survey 2009 provided data for 16 150 dwellings which are weighted to represent the housing stock. SAP predicts 82% of dwellings are currently at slight' risk of overheating and 41% at medium to high risk. If summer temperatures become 1.4 degrees C warmer, then 99% of properties are predicted to have a medium to high risk of overheating. Several potential adaptations to the housing stock were considered to reduce overheating. Although ventilation strategies had the largest positive effect, the use of solar shading and shutters which allow secure ventilation could reduce vulnerability to overheating in the current climate. In a warmer climate, although some dwellings would still be at slight risk, the results suggest that solar shading strategies could reduce the percentage of those at medium to high risk to 6%. Future energy efficiency programmes will need to include adaptation measures to prevent overheating.

Empirical Assessment of Internationalization Strategies for Small and Medium Construction Companies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internationalization; Small and medium construction companies; Entry mode; Evolutionary paths; Foreign experience; Cultural effects	JOINT VENTURES; ENTRY MODE; FOREIGN ENTRY; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; TRANSACTION; SURVIVAL; CULTURE; CHOICE; COST	In the wake of increased globalization, more small and medium construction companies (SMCCs) are expanding into the global market. However, the international construction industry is different from the domestic with respect to resource, regulations, culture, entry strategies, and risk levels among other factors. This paper explores various ways and modes of internationalization for SMCCs under 13 key hypotheses that are relevant to the issues of internationalization from the perspective of SMCCs. To verify these hypotheses, this study used actual data from 560 cases of SMCCs' overseas projects performed between 1990 and 2007. It was found that SMCCs' entry scheme as prime contractors was more rewarding than in the case of subcontractors. Moreover, SMCCs are likely to evolve from subcontractors engaged with home-country contractors to subcontractors engaged with foreign contractors. Also, cultural distance is positively related to performance, but the effects of cultural properties are not as strong compared to the international manufacturing industry. The results are expected to help SMCCs build internationalization strategies by determining promising entry modes, proposing possible evolutionary paths to enter overseas projects, and assessing cultural effects in reference to SMCCs' successful performance.

An alternative set of maps based on interpreted degree-days is presented and can be used for regulation and design strategies. A dataset of 21 years of hourly, 0.05-degree data was used to produce a map with discrete heating and cooling degree-day classes. The resultant zones are therefore not derived from only the dominant climatic characteristics, but from simultaneous annual heating and cooling demands. The advantage is that the new map enables adaptive building design for climates with significant diurnal or annual temperature swings, making it useful for regulators and designers. A good correlation exists between the developed degree-day indices and building energy. The majority of South Africa was found to fall within the medium heating/medium cooling zone as expected; however, the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region is within the medium cooling zone and not the expected high cooling zone. This may be due to the humidity levels that are not accounted for.

The modeling environment is designed to represent complexity in subsurface features, sensor models, and the integration of the sensors with the subsurface environment. The ability to model complex subsurface environments and any potential random distribution of subsurface properties allows for realistic modeling of heterogeneous subsurface environments such as bridged deck/pavement systems. Many applications can benefit from the modeling, simulation, and interpretation capabilities in the new modeling environment that supports improved understanding of system behavior through simulations to evaluate the ability of a particular modality to detect defects. While numerous modeling packages exist to simulate different wave-based modalities, the integrated sensor and media modeling environment is developed to, in a straightforward manner, physically represent the complex subsurface civil infrastructure environment. Physical modeling capabilities enable the object-oriented programming environment facility portability to other application domains as a generic volume serves as the boundaries for internal elements modeled to represent realistic changes in material properties and buried objects. Model development is demonstrated on a realistic bridge deck example.

Examination of the difficulties of implementing RM in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK construction industry has been relatively untouched. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - As part of on-going research to facilitate RM processing aimed at improving the competitiveness of SMEs, the difficulties in RM implementation were identified through a literature review of RM implementation in SMEs. Postal questionnaire were sent to SMEs who have experience of construction management. Findings - Of the 153 of SMEs responding, most highlighted that the main difficulty experienced is how to scale RM process to meet their requirements. None of the available standards explain the fundamental principle of applying RM to the situations that SMEs find themselves in. This difficulty is further exacerbated by a lack of management skills and knowledge in the adoption of RM tools or techniques to identify and analyse the business' risks. Originality/value - The identified difficulties can be considered to develop a process to facilitate RM process within SMEs.

The hazard from ground excitations should be properly assessed to mitigate their action on building structures. This study is concerned with medium risk seismic regions. Specifically, the heavily populated capital city Dhaka in Bangladesh has been considered. Recent earthquakes that occurred inside and very close to the city have manifested the city's earthquake sources and vulnerability. Micro-seismicity data supports the existence of at least four earthquake source points in and around Dhaka. The effects of the earthquakes on buildings are studied for this region. Rubber base isolation is selected as an innovative option to lessen seismic loads on buildings. Case studies have been carried out for fixed and isolated based multi-storey buildings. Lead rubber bearing and high damping rubber bearing have been designed and incorporated in building bases. Structural response behaviours have been evaluated through static and dynamic analyses. For the probable severe earthquake, rubber bearing isolation can be a suitable alternative as it mitigates seismic effects, reduces structural responses and provides structural and economic benefits.

Thorough investigation is needed for buildings located in those regions, to be incorporated with base isolator and then dynamic analysis to carry over. This research provides incorporation of Lead Rubber Bearing and High Damping Rubber Bearing as base isolators in addition to focussing on the changes of structural parameters for isolating effects in those vicinities. Nonlinear models of Lead Rubber Bearing and High Damping Rubber Bearing have been built up. The design of base isolators for building construction is covered along with structural feasibility. Linear static, free vibration and nonlinear dynamic time domain analyses are performed for both isolated and non-isolated buildings under site specific bi-directional earthquake. The automated Newmark-beta time integration approach has been adopted for solution in time domain. The nonlinearities, arising due to base isolated bearings and seismic forces are duly considered. The study reveals that for medium rise building construction, isolation can significantly reduce seismic response in soft to medium stiff soil. The reduction of overturning base moment due to isolation indicates that the building becomes more stable compared to the fixed base structure. Modelled non-linear bearings have been found to be suitable to cope with the precise nonlinearities. The building experiences more flexibility even when using the same structural element configuration. In addition, the flexibility of the structure envisages some sort of savings due to reduced structural responses through incorporation of the isolator. In seismic vulnerable areas where the main concern is the mitigation of the seismic instability with the support of critical components, the study shows the effectiveness of the base isolation system in terms of lessening structural responses under seismic loading.

The system mitigates lateral action of tremor hazard providing flexibility of structures. Implementing base isolation on buildings in the soil and seismic condition of medium risk seismicity is currently an important issue. A thorough investigation is of burning need for buildings to be incorporated with base isolator and to carry out dynamic analysis. The study provides incorporation of rubber-steel bearings and focuses on the structural changes. Designs of base isolation bearings are performed along with structural viability check. Lead rubber bearing (LRB) and high damping rubber bearing (HDRB) have been inserted on the corresponding structural bases. In finite-element approach, link element simulates the bearing. Bi-linear hysteretic behaviour is presented for LRB and equivalent linear model simulated HDRB. Linear static, free vibration and dynamic frequency-domain analyses are performed for both isolated and non-isolated buildings under bidirectional site-specific earthquake. The study reveals that for multi-storey buildings, isolation can drastically reduce seismic responses. Furthermore, flexibility of buildings predicts some structural savings for reduced responses. Good agreement has been achieved through rapid solution in frequency-domain approach. In medium risk earthquake-prone area, rubber-steel bearing isolators can be beneficially inserted.	[Islam, A. B.

A characterization has been carried out on the perception of Guatemalan construction company managers regarding, the risk of accidents exist for the different activities they perform. The characterization has been carried out on a representative sample of the business population via a questionnaire. A preliminary data analysis was performed followed by a Descriptive and a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Companies are characterized as "medium-size" companies, with an average of 81.1 construction workers per year and average annual turnover of 1.29 million euros. 4 clusters of construction activities occur with similar accident weightings. Companies in Cluster 1 are associated to the variables grouped with a Low risk weighting, with a medium to high number of on-site workers and with a turnover of more than 100,000 euros. In contrast, those in Cluster 2 are associated with the variables grouped as having a Medium risk weighting, with a low number of on-site workers and a turnover of less than 100,000 euros. The companies in Cluster 3 are only associated with High risk weighted. And those of Cluster 4 with Not applicable risk-weighting variables.

Higher education is an industry that well-placed to assist the AEC industry to move towards digital transformation. Given the popularity of Facebook among generations Y (ages 28-42 years old) and Z (ages 13-27 years old), Facebook could be an innovative learning and teaching platform in higher education. Although research on Facebook usage has been studied extensively in the past, users' behaviour tends to evolve with the emergence of new social media and new features. Hence, this study aims to explore the current state of Facebook usage among civil engineering undergraduate students. Data was collected through a questionnaire survey. Results of questionnaire discovered that Facebook usage among civil engineering students could be categorized into four groups, namely: 'Fulfill basic needs of psychological health', 'Personal enhancement/life long learning', 'Maintaining social connectivity' and 'Engaging for academic achievement'. In conclusion, Facebook is a viable and preferable choice of a learning and teaching platform among younger generations. Educators can consider exploring further the benefits and limitations of using Facebook in improving students' learning experience and collaborative skills in civil engineering programme in the digitalization era.

Given a conceptualization of business strategy through Miles and Snow's typology (prospectors, analyzers, and defenders), the aim of this research is threefold. First, one seeks to identify the performance outcomes of strategic alignment in terms of the productivity and profitability of medium-sized enterprises (ME). Second, this research aims to verify if these outcomes are valid for all strategic types or only for some. Third, to find out what manufacturing strategy is the most appropriate for each business strategy type. A research model and hypothesis are tested with survey data obtained from 150 Canadian MEs. Significant performance outcomes of alignment are found, thus validating the research model and confirming the main research proposition. Differences between strategic types are also found in terms of performance outcomes. Results indicate that each type of business strategy deploys advanced manufacturing systems (AMS) differently by assimilating and integrating various types of manufacturing technologies. Results suggest that ME owner-managers must assess their firm's level of AMS assimilation in light of their strategic objectives.

Operations strategy in project-based operations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Operations; Strategy; Projects; Project-based operations; Strategic intent; Focus; Fit; Resource configuration; Theory extension	COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; TRADE-OFFS; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS	This paper describes the application of an Operations Strategy (OS) approach to project-based operations (PBOs), defined as low to medium volume and medium to high variety operations. The OS approach has been extensively and beneficially used in high and medium volume operations. By examining the development of OS from its genesis in manufacturing operations, we identify four aspects of the OS approach strategic intent, focus, fit and resource configuration. These elevate the discussion of how to configure resources to gain competitive advantage from PBOs, to the level of business leaders. The four aspects are then analysed in greater detail, with a view to determining the adaptations required for application in a PBO. The results of this engaged study indicate that the approach delivered significant new insight for the organisation involved in the study. The contributions of this paper are identified for both practice and theory. For practice we demonstrate an alternative to a reliance on standards and process compliance to an opportunity to gain competitive advantage from PBO. For theory, we have extended OS into PBOs and provide a basis for future theory testing. We conclude that there is a significant opportunity for further practical and theory development through using an OS perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Aminbakhsh, S; Sonmez, R				Aminbakhsh, Saman; Sonmez, Rifat			Pareto Front Particle Swarm Optimizer for Discrete Time-Cost Trade-Off Problem	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Scheduling; Costs; Optimization; Algorithms; Multiple objective analysis; Project management	CONSTRUCTION TIME; GENETIC ALGORITHM	Intensive heuristic and metaheuristic research efforts have focused on the Pareto front optimization of discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP). However, very little success has been achieved in solving the problem for medium and large-scale projects. This paper presents a new particle swarm optimization method to achieve an advancement in the Pareto front optimization of medium and large-scale construction projects. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer (PFPSO) is based on a multiobjective optimization environment with novel particle representation, initialization, and position-updating principles that are specifically designed for simultaneous time-cost optimization of large-scale projects. PFPSO brings several benefits for the discrete time-cost optimization, such as an adequate representation of the discrete search space, fast convergence properties, and improved Pareto front optimization capabilities. The computational experiment results reveal that the new particle swarm optimization method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of the number of Pareto front solutions and computation time, especially for medium and large-scale problems. A large number of nondominated solutions are achieved within seconds for the first time, for a problem including 720 activities. The proposed Pareto front particle swarm optimizer provides a fast and effective method for optimal scheduling of construction projects. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Until 'realized', a design is essentially a figment of the designer's imagination, although his or her ideas may be laid down and conveyed to others via specialized design media. In this way, impressions of the design may be shared with clients, colleagues or other 'actors' in the design process. Such products of the designer's imaging process can be relatively abstract or begin to approach future reality. Form & Media research can be 'revealing', stimulating insights concerning preferences, working processes and the effects of products of the designer's imagination. In the past 10 years, we have gained considerable practical experience with both virtual and tangible (scale) models. We have compared different techniques in conference workshops, within educational settings and in our Form & Media research laboratory. The research projects ranged from the development of practical techniques and working methods to protocol analyses of designing architects. This contribution draws comparisons between different computer-aided modelling techniques, with an indication of their perspectives, making use of the experience gained from various experiments in an educational context, and will highlight the potentials for different combinations of digital and physical modelling techniques.

The problem may be even critical for Chinese SMEs in emerging economies characterized by institutional instability. This article draws on multiple theories to examine antecedents and consequences of the effectiveness of three important interorganizational governance mechanisms, namely, contractual-based and relational-based governance and vendor-specific investments. The results of a survey on 83 software outsourcing projects indicate some interesting patterns that Chinese SMEs use to manage their outsourcing relationships. We found that contractual governance is found to be the only effective mechanism when the outsourcing firm (client) perceives technological uncertainty. On the other hand, with the transaction-specific investments, relational governance, and reciprocal-specific investments by IS vendor would be preferred as effective mechanisms by the outsourcing firm. Our analyses also show that Chinese SMEs in emerging economies would rely on multiple governance mechanisms to enhance outsourcing success. Overall, the findings are in line with the studies stressing the importance of building partnership-style relationships and seeking reciprocal actions in sourcing exchanges.

A conceptual framework of the impact of NPD project team and leader empowerment on communication and performance: An alliance case context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project team and leader empowerment; Alliance-based new product development projects; Intensity and media-richness of communication	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; MOTIVATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORK; SUCCESS; DESIGN; MODEL	New product development (NPD) in an alliance context crosses organizational boundaries and therefore makes team and leader empowerment and communication an ever more important topic for the successful accomplishment of NPD goals. We developed a conceptual model that addresses some key questions: Under what circumstances should the project team and leader be empowered? How much empowerment? And what effects does this have on communication and NPD performance? Using case study research, we developed a conceptual model portraying the impact of NPD project team and leader empowerment in the 'alliance focal company' (AFC - the lead company in the alliance) on the communication with a project's strategic partners, and the subsequent effects on project performance. Our model suggests that the efficiency of the development project (shortest, cheapest, and highest quality possible) is contingent upon how well the actual intensity level and the degree of media-richness of communication fit the required ones. Conversely, the actual intensity level and degree of media-richness of communication are enabled by a varying extent of team and leader empowerment, ranging from limited to significant.

We focus on a country context where such an emerging e-commerce model is particularly prevalent, i.e., China. Key to leveraging this model is to attract consumer attention and stimulate their actions both online and offline, which may be achieved through information technology (IT)-enabled promotional approaches, such as administering banner adverts and digital coupons. The former focuses on communicating product attribute information, whereas the latter focuses on communicating incentives. Building on a collectivism cultural perspective, word-of-mouth (WOM) communication motives framework, and digital advertising literature, we hypothesize their different effects online (generating produce review) and offline (inducing sales). We first conducted a survey comparing consumers in China with their U. S. counterparts, and show that a cultural perspective is pertinent and valuable. We then collaborated with China's largest O2O social media website for restaurant reviews, and conducted a field investigation of consumer responses to the two promotional approaches. Our findings afford important insights for retail businesses seeking to leverage O2O commerce, and provide research implications to the areas of e-commerce and digital advertising.

Determinants of the Use of Fintech Finance Among Chinese Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Research and development; Finance; Peer-to-peer computing; Technological innovation; Internet; Banking; China; family firms; fintech; small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)	SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE; FAMILY FIRMS; INNOVATION; OWNERSHIP; GROWTH; EQUITY; STATE; PRODUCTIVITY; CONSTRAINTS; INFORMATION	FinTech, the merging of finance and modern Internet-based technology, has rapidly presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. In this article, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by R&D activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms.

There is still a need to investigate this issue by looking at stakeholders higher in the supply chain, particularly the ones who have the economic power to facilitate safety implementation. As such, this research has investigated the roles of construction clients on influencing safety performance. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys from employees working in small and medium construction projects in Australia. The findings of the research have not only confirmed the importance of clients in implementing safety, but also determined specific client roles that influence the development of safety climate in construction projects. It is recommended that clients should focus on the following six safety roles: participate in site-based safety program; review and analyze safety data; appoint safety team; select safe contractors; specify how safety is to be addressed in tenders; and perform regular checks on plant/equipment. Some clients may not consider safety as important as other traditional objectives, such as time, cost, environment, and quality. As such, they need to recognize the economic benefit of safety, thus becoming willing and committed to integrating safety into day-to-day business decisions.

These platforms, which integrate social networking services into their services, adopt either an advertising strategy or a freemium strategy. Thus, four strategy combinations that include two strategic substitute cases in which both platforms use either an advertising strategy or a freemium strategy and two strategic complement cases in which the platforms adopt different strategies are possible. We find that the advertising (freemium) strategy is dominant for each platform when its premium service quality is too low (high). Two equilibria in which both platforms adopt advertising and freemium strategies coexist, while the former one derives more profit. Moreover, we study the symmetric platform competition in which platforms use an advertising strategy or a freemium strategy simultaneously. Interestingly, we find if the strength of social effects is medium, the freemium strategy is also dominant when the quality of the premium service is too low. Finally, a win-win outcome that benefits customer surplus and platforms may arise under some conditions under which the basic service quality is too low (high), the premium service quality is too high (low), and a freemium (advertising) strategy is used.

Thus, this study aims to develop a Capability-Based forecasting model for innovation development in SMCFs. Built on 157 questionnaires, the model was tested using partial least squares (PLS) technique of structural equation modelling (SEM). The practicality and robustness of this model was then validated by 12 experts. Findings affirm SMCFs making use of multiple Capability-Based approaches would be able to secure their performance via innovation activities. For academia, the new model contributes to the stream of construction innovation management by integrating both technological and organizational innovations in a single framework. For practitioners and policymakers, the model offers valuable input for continuing growth of SMCFs via innovation.

Following the logic of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) and incorporating organizational learning culture (OLC), this study reveals the formation mechanisms underlying SMCEs' ICT adoption behavior. The behavioral model was empirically tested through a hierarchical regression analysis of 177 questionnaires completed by top managers of SMCEs in China. The results indicated that mimetic pressure (MP), strategic value judgment (SVJ), and behavioral control capability (BCC) can drive adoption behavior directly. Although normative pressure (NP) and efficiency value judgment (EVJ) do not exert direct effects on adoption behavior, their indirect effects on adoption behavior are fully mediated by adoption intention. The impact of coercive pressure (CP) on adoption intention and adoption behavior was not supported. In addition, OLC was found to be a positive moderator for the relationship between adoption intention and adoption behavior. This study extends the explanatory context of TPB and provides the feasibility for the industry to guide SMCEs to adopt ICT from multiple paths of intention and behavior.

This valuable contribution demonstrates that modern image analysis techniques are superior to conventional methods in which film photographs or x-rays are used to track target markers. With digitial image analysis, target markers need not be embedded in the soil, and many more measurement points can be established in the model. We wish to share some of our own experiences validating a similar image analysis system (White et al. 2003; White and Take 2002) and describe methods by which the accuracy, or more correctly the precision, of the measurements presented by the authors' technique can be improved.

Communication is the medium through which team members share the information required for successful amalgamation. In this work, we postulate that both high and low levels of team communication can impede team performance, thus leading to a curvilinear relationship between team performance and team communication. To test this hypothesis, the relationships between face-to-face, e-mail, and telephone communication and team performance were examined for 60 cross-functional project teams. E-mail and face-to-face communication were curvilinearly associated with performance, but telephone communication was not. Further analysis of the communication frequency between colocations showed that e-mail is the only medium for which usage increased with distance.

In the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) literature, the emerging variant multivalue QCA (mvQCA), one of the few techniques to tackle the above four features is in need of multivalue theory applications. Thus, these two seemingly unrelated literature hold the key to fill each others gap. To address the gaps, we leveraged the unique public research institute (PRI) to small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) transfer context in Singapore. We collected 188 responses from three stakeholders [i.e., research scientists and engineers, public research institutes (PRIs), and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)] who are involved in technology transfer. Our analysis suggested one necessary and six sufficient PRI-SME configurations that enhance the commercialization potential of the transferred technology. Furthermore, we identified three sufficient PRI-SME configurations that hinder the commercialization of technology transfer activities. Not only does our paper establishes the validity of pretransfer matching framework, but also introduces the mvQCA method to management scholars.

There is currently much interest in the area of PSS; however, studies of sustainable PSS involving SMEs are lacking. The purpose of this research was to identify those organizational aspects that can contribute to develop sustainable PSS in SMEs. Four main areas were explored: sustainable awareness, use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), design process, and business strategy. This study was carried out in cooperation with the Colombian Ministry of ICTs and highlights their desire to find new routes to encourage transformation of companies toward competitive and sustainable industrial sectors. A significant finding is that the integration between design process and ICTs appears to be a key mechanism in developing sustainable PSS in SMEs. Finally, further work in this field of research is discussed and highlighted.

The system enables designers to locate and retrieve information from distributed resources. There are three types of agents in the proposed model. The 'user agents' consist of designers, engineers, and technicians. The 'information agents' include various knowledge domains as legislation, codes, previous cases, expert domains. The 'communication agents' that identify and match agents are based on the goals and agent's interest. The communication agents working over the Web use sketches as a collaboration medium in the conceptual phase of the design process. The results of the empirical study showed that the design domain and variables; and design strategies and activities are not independent of each other. The quality of a project increases as the communication increases among collaborators during the conceptual design phase and the Internet provides a suitable medium for communication through sketches.

This study provides a summary of the results from research on the effects of multimedia-based safety education conducted by the M. E. Rinker Sr. School of Building Construction at the University of Florida. The findings are presented along with their related statistical test results. The findings indicate multimedia-based, self-paced learning offers very distinct advantages over traditional, instructor-led classroom learning. Overall, both the high-school and university student groups involved in the study exhibited superior retention rates when learning from the multimedia-based materials. Higher scoring students in the classroom showed little difference in either media, while students who tended to score at the low end of the grading scale uniformly scored higher on multimedia-based materials. The reduced variation in student performance based on test scores in the CD-ROM instruction indicates the positive effects of multimedia-based instruction.

These businesses may hold important keys to unlocking vital globally game changing technologies to tackle climate change. This article provides an overview of recent academic literature and proposes a research agenda for early stage Cleantech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) finance. With growing interest in how to support innovations that tackle the climate emergency, there is a need for evidence that can assist the private sector, civil society organizations and policymakers in finding more effective ways to encourage impact investing and other finance for early stage Cleantech SMEs. This research agenda will therefore contribute to sustainability transitions in key sectors and the development of a sustainable low carbon economy.

We conducted an ethnographic action research with an industrial partner that implements information technologies on its construction sites, with a strong preference for home-made applications. Results show that the development of such applications faces difficulties and that multiple iterations and versions are necessary before achieving the expected goals because the required competencies are lacking among internal development teams. Moreover, initial needs evolve considerably throughout the application's development and evaluation process. However, notwithstanding the difficulties encountered during the different application development phases, the industrial partner believes the decision to be worthwhile because of the desire to have internal control over the project data and the need to consider certain specificities related to business processes.

J	Bevan, EAM; Yung, P				Bevan, Emma A. M.; Yung, Ping			Implementation of corporate social responsibility in Australian construction SMEs	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Ethics; Construction industry; Environmental management; Corporate strategy	CSR; CITIZENSHIP; BENEFITS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) related activities in small to medium sized construction enterprises within Australia. Reasons behind the implementation level are also evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative and qualitative company level data from 28 Australian small to medium sized construction enterprises were collected using an in-depth questionnaire. Levels of CSR implementation in three aspects, namely, environmental, social and ethical, were measured. Each aspect was broken down into sub-areas and implementation scores were aggregated and normalised. Awareness level and concern for economic aspect, the two hypothesised reasons for level of implementation, were also measured. Non-parametric correlation analyses were used to examine the hypotheses. Findings - The findings suggest small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) incorporate some aspects of CSR into their business activities even though they do not refer to the practices as CSR, as none of them have a formal CSR policy in place. Most SMEs in the construction industry implement ethical and economic aspect of CSR; however implementation across environmental and social issues is limited. Non-parametric correlation analyses show that higher awareness of CSR issues leads to higher levels of implementation and that concern about economic aspect is not a reason why CSR is not implemented into business practices. Research limitations/implications - Everett Rogers' diffusion paradigm can also be applied to CSR implementation, but more research works are required to theoretically and empirically examine the relationships between CSR implementation and economic aspect. Originality/value - It is apparent that there is a significant gap in the research regarding Australian SMEs and sustainability issues as the majority of the literature is focused upon large organisations even though the approaches taken by SMEs towards CSR are very different to those of large corporations. The SME business sector is a significant sector in terms of its environmental, economic and social impacts. Hence recognition of this sector is growing and is now becoming the focus of an agenda to promote the implementation of CSR practices in SMEs. This paper aims to provide useful and detailed information to add to what is currently an underdeveloped body of knowledge in this area.	[Bevan, Emma A.

Under plane strain condition, the coupled finite-infinite elements to represent the near and far field stress distribution and thin layer interface element was employed to model the interfacial behavior between sleepers and ballast. To account for the relative debonding, slipping and crushing that could take place in the contact area between the sleepers and ballast, modified Mohr-Coulomb criterion was adopted. Furthermore an attempt has been made to consider the elasto-plastic material non-linearity of the railway track supporting media by employing different constitutive models to represent steel, concrete and supporting materials. Based on the proposed physical and constitutive modeling a code has been developed for dynamic loads. The applicability of the developed F. E code has been demonstrated by analyzing a real railway supporting structure.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in two stages. First, data from a sub-set of construction industry workers were extracted from a large scale survey of workers in Victoria, Australia (the VicWAL survey). The survey measured work-life interference using the Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI). Next a subset of survey respondents was identified and interviewed to gain more detailed explanatory information and insight into work-life experiences. Findings - The survey results indicated that respondents who reported working for a construction firm with between 16 and 99 employees reported significantly higher AWALI scores (indicating high work-life interference) than workers in organisations employing 15 or less or more than 100 workers. The follow-up interviews revealed that workers in small construction organisations were managed directly and personally by the business owner/manager and able to access informal work-life supports that were provided on an "as needs" basis. In comparison workers in medium-sized firms perceived higher levels of work pressure and an expectation that work would be prioritised over family life. Research limitations/implications - The research shows that the findings of work-life balance research undertaken in large construction organisations cannot be generalised to SMEs. Organisation size should also be treated as an important variable in work-life balance research in construction. Practical implications - The research suggests that a better understanding of how workers in SME construction firms experience work-life balance is important in the design and development of work-life balance programs. In particular the challenges faced by workers as companies grow from SMEs require careful consideration and management. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on the work-life balance experiences of employees in large construction firms. Little was previously known about the experiences of workers in SME construction firms. The research provides new insight into the work-life experiences of construction workers in organisations of varying sizes.

Understanding the requirements of such projects can be a painstaking endeavor, and without a structured process to guide decision making, such projects often fail to deliver on their intended benefits. This paper examined how the use of utility theory (UT) and quality function deployment (QFD) can serve as a useful basis to support the delivery of such benefits. The research examined a social housing project in Brazil to focus on contextual influences on understanding, structuring, and delivery of benefits. The approach adopted QFD for requirements management, whereas utility theory assessed utility decision making in ranking the housing models on the basis established user requirements and derived design requirements (DRs). A medium-low-income model is preferred; the next preferred models are very low, medium low, and medium high, in that order. The analysis indicated no transitivity in preference from an end-user perspective. The novelty of the paper is in representing quantitatively a process of requirements management that supports the delivery of project benefits on a utilitarian basis in social housing design. The method is able to account for interdependencies between design and user attributes in supporting social housing design decision making in an integrated process. This understanding can be key to the delivery of the correct social projects that reflect context-specific end-user needs.

J	Fan, C; Jiang, YC; Mostafavi, A				Fan, Chao; Jiang, Yucheng; Mostafavi, Ali			Social Sensing in Disaster City Digital Twin: Integrated Textual-Visual-Geo Framework for Situational Awareness during Built Environment Disruptions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EVENT DETECTION; MEDIA; RESILIENCE; TWITTER; INFORMATION; RISK	This paper proposed and tested an integrated textual-visual-geo framework to enhance social sensing techniques in smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Effective and efficient disaster response and recovery require reliable situational awareness regarding infrastructure disruptions and their societal impacts. Due to the rapid unfolding and evolution of events in disasters and emergencies, typical data sensing techniques (such as remote sensing and satellite images) are not sufficient to gain reliable situational awareness about disruptions that affect communities at a local scale. Social sensing enables gathering and analyzing massive user-generated data from various sources (social media, in particular) to monitor unfolding of localized events such as infrastructure disruptions and community needs. To advance social sensing methods and their integration into digital twins of cities, this study proposes an integrated framework for detecting infrastructure disruptions based on three information elements embedded in social media content: images, texts, and geo-maps. The framework consists of three main methods: a graph-based approach for detecting critical tweets, an image-ranking algorithm for selecting important images, and a kernel density estimate for estimating the geographical scales of the disruptions. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study of water release from flood control reservoirs in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The findings illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework for capturing the critical situational information and interpreting the results for situational awareness and disruption response. The proposed framework can enhance integration of social sensing elements into smart city digital twins in the context of disasters. Accordingly, the proposed framework can improve the ability of community members, volunteer responders, residents, and other stakeholders in coping with built environment disruptions in disasters.

Skillful knowledge management can bring significant benefits including labour productivity growth, an increase in quality of provided services and also a strengthening of the competitive position of an enterprise. This paper presents an IT model of a knowledge Map which supports knowledge management in a construction enterprise. The model was developed on the basis of the results of surveys and analyses carried out in small and medium sized construction enterprises in Poland. The process approach in management was included in the proposed model and it involves analysis of an enterprise activity as a set of processes. The model contains processes occurring at enterprise level and also in the widely considered investment process in the construction industry. This assumption made the proposed knowledge Map universal and able to be applied in construc- tion enterprises operating in both the design and executive field.

The experimental programme was conducted using the standard CEN Cup test method. In total, four representative materials - plasterboard, phenolic foam insulation, plywood and medium density fibreboard (MDF) - were tested at a minimum of three different temperatures. At each temperature, four relative humidity gradients were applied which enabled the variation of moisture permeability with relative humidity to be described mathematically using the concept of differential permeability. For each test condition, six samples were tested to provide adequate information for statistical analysis. Results indicate that the temperature influence on permeability is not only related to relative humidity but also depends upon the properties of the materials themselves and the proportion of liquid to vapour flow. For the plasterboard and phenolic foam insulation, the temperature effect was found to be minor. However, a significant difference in the differential permeability for the plywood and MDF was observed, particularly in the critical high humidity (liquid dominated) regime.

J	ASTEBRO, T				ASTEBRO, T			THE EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL-INTERACTION ON THE INTRAFIRM DIFFUSION OF ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEMS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CRITICAL MASS; IMPLEMENTATION; TECHNOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; MODELS; MEDIA; EQUIVALENCE; INNOVATION; ATTITUDES; COHESION	Can management affect the rate by which organizational members adopt a new computer based communication medium? The question is addressed by comparing the rate by which employees start to use an electronic mail system (EMS) and case descriptions across four departments during a five year period in a large Swedish manufacturing company. Data on EMS use are fitted to a model describing the spread of use as a function of social and management influence. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of new users of EMS can be influenced by both department-level management and peers. Faster growth in use occurred when department-level management exercised implementation efforts. The rate of growth increased significantly when a local Information Center (IC) was established. The more resources the local IC was supplied with the higher the rate of growth in EMS use, Management of the implementation process may be especially preferred when introducing end-use network technologies in organizations due to interdependent demand among users.

J	Azhar, S; Riaz, Z; Robinson, D				Azhar, Salman; Riaz, Zainab; Robinson, David			Integration of Social Media in Day-to-Day Operations of Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							COLLABORATION; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS; FACEBOOK	Social media (SM) has introduced substantial changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals. This study examines the current usage of SM within the construction industry. It also analyzes the potential risks and rewards and the collaborative and innovative aspects of these online applications. To understand this, an SM log was developed to track activity on popular SM platforms for 10 construction organizations. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from construction organizations that were familiar with SM as a company resource. The main finding was that traditional SM platforms are being used within the daily operations of construction companies. Popular sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are being used to share industry events with the communities of followers. LinkedIn, on the other hand, is being used to develop professional networks and assist in recruitment. However, conventional forms of communication, e.g., emails and telephone calls, continue to be the preferred methods of connection with vendors and subcontractors. Uses of SM for collaborative and innovative initiatives outside the organizations' boundaries are minimal. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

IT-based solutions have been employed by large businesses; however, they are not affordable to small-to-medium businesses (SMB). This paper proposes a cost-effective materials management and tracking system based on a cloud-computing service integrated with RFID for automated tracking with ubiquitous access. The current workflow of a SMB contractor was investigated and system requirements were analyzed in order to enhance it. As a low-cost solution to fulfill the requirements and improve supply chain visibility, the proposed system was developed on the cloud and integrated with RFID technology. A simulation study was conducted to show the potential impact of the system on performance of the SMB. Finally, usability and environmental studies were conducted to show the feasibility of the system implementation in the real work environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These approaches, however, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Organizations adopt IT both to achieve efficiency and in response to a variety of environmental and internal pressures. Consequently, there is a clear need for an integrated model that incorporates both institutional pressures and goal-oriented behavior. We develop, operationalize, and empirically test a model that explains the intention of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) brokerages to adopt electronic trading systems (ETS). This model integrates the rational factors driving goal-oriented behavior with the internal and external pressures to which these brokerages are subjected. The model is parsimonious, yet explains 67% of the variance in the intention to adopt ETS. The theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed.

Distant Search, Technological Diversity, and Branding Focus: Incremental and Radical Innovation in Small- and Medium-Sized Consignees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Branding focus; contract manufacturing; distant search; innovation; technological diversity structure	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; DIVERSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; COLLABORATION; EXPLORATION; TRANSITION	Small- and medium-sized consignees (SMCs), due to the contractual nature of their manufacturing processes with their consignors, may find it difficult to innovate. Drawing on theoretical frameworks of recombinant search and absorptive capacity, we assess how the distance of technological search, technological diversity, and brand focus (the ratio of own products to consigned products) mitigate the negative effects of contract manufacturing on incremental or radical innovation. Using patent data from 86 SMCs in the Yuci household appliance cluster of China over the period of 2006-2011, the results indicate that distant search is positively associated with radical innovation when the ratio of related technological diversity to technological diversity (RTD ratio) is low, but not when RTD ratio is high. In addition, a stronger positive relationship exists between distant search and the incremental innovation in SMCs under strong branding focus and low RTD ratio compared with other configurations of branding focus and RTD ratio.

East Asian latecomers are transitioning from a catch-up phase toward becoming leaders, and they are engaging in open innovation activities to drive this transition. This research quantitatively analyzes three kinds of open innovation activities-outside-in, inside-out, and coupled-to investigate their influence upon technological capabilities, while also considering the effect of R&D intensity. Data from 75 South Korean medium-sized firms were analyzed, and two major findings are reported. First, technological capabilities are enhanced by some open innovation activities and by R&D intensity. Second, R&D intensity negatively moderates the impact of open innovation activities on technological capabilities. Therefore, it may be concluded that firms with relatively low R&D intensity will gain the most benefit from increasing their open innovation activities.

The design and production process is complex, dynamic, interconnected and dependent upon greater information mobility, requiring seamless exchange of data and information in real time. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, specialty contractors, can utilise cost-effective collaboration technologies, such as cloud computing using software as a service, to help in the effective transfer of information and data. The system dynamics (SD) approach gives a better understanding of the dynamics of complex systems. SD methodology is used as a modelling and analysis tool to understand and identify the key drivers in the absorption of cloud computing for SMEs. The aim is to determine how the use of SD can improve the management of complexity of information flow, leading to improved performance for SMEs. SD is shown to be a viable tool to manage information complexity using cloud computing for performance improvement in construction.

Mostafa			Impacts of Culture on Innovation Propensity in Small to Medium Enterprises in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture; Innovation; Small to medium enterprises (SMEs)	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; LEADERSHIP; TRUST; DETERMINANTS; CAPABILITY; INDUSTRY; PROJECTS	Research suggests that the cultural context in which a business operates influences the level of innovation. However, research on the links between cultural factors and innovation in construction remains limited. The aim is to examine the underlying relationships between cultural factors and innovation propensity in small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in the construction sector. Innovation propensity is the degree to which an organization is inclined to achieve a state of innovativeness by design. In contrast, cultural factors manifest through the beliefs and values related to the various organizational aspects. The theoretical model and, subsequently, the survey instrument were developed from a review of the literature. The model was tested using survey data from SMEs in a regional area of Australia. The partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed to test the model. The results suggest that cultural factors account for 41% of the variance in innovation propensity. Specifically, market orientation focused on dealing with competitors had the strongest influence on innovation propensity. Other factors include business relationships based on trust and workforce capacity acquired through regular technology development for solving problems. However, the role of leadership, especially concerning championing projects, does not have a statistically significant impact on innovation propensity. A large proportion of construction SMEs, specifically in regional areas, will have a relatively small number of employees (up to four) and a flat organizational structure that reflects a short-term business orientation. In this context, the cultural notion of leadership does not have a significant direct relationship on innovation propensity. Therefore, policies encouraging market orientation, building relationship networks, and expanding workforce capabilities might be more effective in improving innovation propensity in construction SMEs than policies directly and solely focused on developing leadership skills.

Additionally, identifying efficient and effective use of resources has been a challenge. The study sought to identify intangible resources that will enhance the profitability strategies of small construction firms. Purposive sampling was used to identify professionals who were Owners/managers. Relative Important Index was used for ranking and Kendall's coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement of the ranking among the professional groups. Employer's experience, client trust, employee experience, patent and copy-right, networking were the key intangible resources. There was a high degree of agreement between the selected professionals on the ranking. Small construction firms are encouraged to improve their understanding of the political and economic environment in which they operate. This study highlights intangibles resources that parties in the building construction industry should be conscious of. It further provides an opportunity for researchers in construction management to interrogate the impact of these resources within the wider industry as the study was limited to building professionals.

This is done by demonstrating the ease of application and computational efficiency of infinite elements. Specifically, this paper introduces a comprehensive set of coordinate and field variable mapping functions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional infinite elements and the computational steps for the solution of the affiliated combined finite-infinite element models. Performance is then benchmarked against various parametric models for deflections and stresses in two examples of solid, unbounded problems: (1) a circular, uniformly-distributed load, and (2) a point load on a semiinfinite, axisymmetrical medium. The results are compared with those from the respective closed-form solution. As an example, when the vertical deflections in Example 2 are compared with the closed form solution, the 45% error level generated with fixed boundaries and 14% generated with spring-supported boundaries is reduced to only 1% with infinite elements, even with a coarse mesh. Furthermore, this increased accuracy is achieved with lower computational costs. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Given the socio-economic importance of SMEs and their need to manage risks to ensure the success of their strategic and innovative projects, this research aims to investigate how to adopt PRM in SMEs with a positive cost-benefit ratio. Design/methodology/approach This study presents an exploratory and explanatory research conducted through multiple-case studies involving 10 projects performed in Spanish and Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings The results obtained highlight how project features (commitment type, innovativeness, strategic relevance and managerial complexity) and firms' characteristics (sector of activity, production system and access to public incentives) influence PRM adoption, leading to different levels and types of benefits. Originality/value The paper offers practical indications about PRM phases, activities, tools and organizational aspects to be considered in different contexts to ensure the project's success and, ultimately, the company's growth and sustainability. Such indications could not be found in the literature.

Local Information Access for Search and Rescue Using Wireless Data Storage Mediums	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data collection; Data processing; Disasters; Earthquakes; Buildings; Construction industry; Probe instruments		After a natural disaster strikes buildings, it is vital to immediately retrieve the related local information for efficient search and rescue (S&R) operations. Although it seems convenient to store the required local information (e.g., information about neighborhood, buildings) in a centralized database, S&R teams usually cannot access centralized databases because the information infrastructure is usually damaged or overloaded immediately after a disaster. This paper describes the search and rescue data access point (SR-DAP) system that was designed for storing and retrieving the required local information in/from data storage units that are deployed at buildings. In the paper, the developed approach is presented, and two key technologies (i.e., radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes) that are used as local storage mediums in SR-DAP are empirically evaluated. The results of the field experiments show that current technologies can be effectively utilized in the developed system. However, comparison of the technologies highlights the fact that the current wireless sensor technology is advantageous over RFID technology. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000093.

As the paradigm begins to shift from using paper-based media to electronic media, the difference between structured and unstructured data becomes more prominent as computers are more adept at handling structured data or information. The challenge is the effective management of both types of information in a fragmented data environment. To maintain efficiency and flexibility for project participants, this paper discusses a method by applying metadata modeling to the creation of views towards unstructured information related to building components, construction process or project management information. By using this method project participants may be able to quickly locate relevant information needed to understand and process a construction document such as an Request for Information (RFI). This study finds that by utilizing industry standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) it is technically feasible to develop such a method. However, further studies are needed to validate the idea and the system in practice. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, they also entail increased design information complexity. To achieve a simplified and efficient design process, this study proposes to develop a common library of prefabricated structural components using graphic media mapping. The study integrates digital graphic information of building information modeling (BIM) with engineering and production data. Based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data standard, semantic data related to the geometry, processes, resources, production costs, construction sites, and other design information relevant for prefabricated components are assigned to a component's graphic representation. Thus, the visible geometric representation and the background engineering information are integrated into a unified database. A collection of common structural components forms a library that can be reused in prefabricated design projects. The development of a component library and its application to a more efficient design process is demonstrated through a case study of an urban viaduct project.

Construction automation: Research areas, industry concerns and suggestions for advancement	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction automation technologies; Cluster mapping; Text mining	QUALITY ASSESSMENT; BIM; FABRICATION; PROJECT; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; METHODOLOGY; GENERATION; ELEMENTS; SITE	Construction automation has shown the potential to increase construction productivity after years of technical development and experimenting in its field. Exactly how, and the possible benefits and challenges of construction automation, though is unclear and missing from current research efforts. In order to better understand the comprehensive potential of construction automation for increasing construction productivity and the associated possible ramifications, an objective and data-driven review of the use of automation technologies in construction was done. The review was accomplished by using text mining methods on publically available written documents, covering a wide range of relevant data including scientific publications and social media. The text mining software VOS Viewer and RapidMiner Studio were used to determine the most promising areas of research through the analysis of scientific publications, and the main areas of concern of industry through the analysis of text on social media, respectively. These research areas and concerns are summarized in this paper, and based on them suggestions for industry are made to help advance the uptake of automation in construction.

Based on micro data of German firms in the electrical engineering and machinery industry, we show that innovation-related variables follow the predictions of our hypotheses. Research and development (R&D) intensity exhibits an inverse U-shaped relationship on the likelihood to join alliances. The positive relation suggests that SMEs aim to access the knowledge of larger firms whereas the negative relationship indicates that SMEs exceeding a certain threshold of R&D activity are reluctant to participate in standardization because their knowledge is too essential to disclose to competitors. The importance to access external knowledge via standardization committees is underlined by a positive correlation with the relevance of incoming knowledge spillovers and a negative correlation with the relative size of companies' patent portfolios. Besides these variables, we also explore the traditionally considered factors for alliance formation and show that firm size and export intensity are positively correlated with participation.

Group members, being in an everyday face-to-face contact and using the same terminology in an atmosphere of common problem solving, can create the core competence necessary for corporate success. The usual ways to assign specialists of different professions in interdisciplinary project teams endanger this by removing the individual from the source of competence, Use of the Resource Box model for information structuring with full-media communication enables establishment of virtual teams for project work, Then the team members can provide the total knowledge of the competence group without leaving it, The structure of operative Resource Boxes as a basis combined with supporting Resource Boxes and Decision Boxes can build a network organization, It relies on a communication system in three levels providing valuable information of high quality, This organization concept is based on deep studies for several years of a high-tech Swedish product development organization.

J	Gardiner, PD; Simmons, JEL				Gardiner, PD; Simmons, JEL			Conflict in small- and medium-sized projects: Case of partnering to the rescue	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								It is well known that project and other temporary organizations have special characteristics that can result in a higher incidence of dysfunctional conflict than their ongoing organizational counterparts. In this paper, qualitative data collected from a selection of retrospective UK-based construction projects of between approximately $2,000,000 and $8,000,000 show that the occurrence and effect of dysfunctional conflicts in projects remain a cause for concern despite changes in project management organization design. This paper provides a brief review of the more important mechanisms leading to dysfunctional conflict within these projects and illustrates the important role of people rather than procedures or systems in this process. In a later section of the paper, examples are drawn from one case in particular where interorganizational team building was included as a component of project organization design. The outcome of this case is consistent with the hypothesis that interorganizational team building, whether acknowledged as part of a formal partnering arrangement or not, can be used at the start of small-and medium-sized construction projects to reduce conditions of latent conflict and help engender a culture of cooperation and conflict resolution between the client, designers, utilities, and construction organizations.

When architects maintain their activities as small-medium enterprises (SMEs), they are the owner of that firm and lead the organizations. Therefore, they are both entrepreneur and leader of their foundation. Effective leadership is necessary for construction projects. As an owner and leader of the organization, a major task of the entrepreneur is to provide effective leadership throughout the life construction process. From the point of this view, defining the leadership styles and entrepreneurship orientations, determining whether the relationship between leadership styles and entrepreneurship orientations or not, identifying the effect of demographic variables on leadership styles and entrepreneurship orientations of architect SMEs at construction industry are aimed. To reach these goals, data are obtained from 50 architect SMEs at construction industry by using Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-5X) and Entrepreneurship scale. As a result, most adopted leadership is individualized consideration and entrepreneurship orientation is proactiveness of architect SMEs. Gender, age and experience at construction industry are significant variables on leadership styles and finally there is statistically significant relationship between leadership styles and entrepreneurship orientation.

In this study, such techniques through Structure From Motion (SFM), Clustering Views for Multi-View Stereo (CMVS), Patch-based Multi-View Stereo (PMVS), and Poisson surface reconstruction were smoothly integrated into a 3D reconstruction system with comparative efficiency in computation. The system can be applied to regular images taken by amateur cameras, smart phones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices, without need of a priori internal and external camera parameters. To verify the ability of the established reconstruction system, indoor and outdoor objects at various scales, such as a helmet (a small object), a corridor (an indoor medium object), an arbor (outdoor medium object), and a building (outdoor large object) were tested. Through tracking and registration, the reconstructed 3D models were loaded in an AR environment to facilitate displaying, interacting, and rendering that provides AR applications in construction design and management for better and qualitative communication in economical and handy ways.

Existing research on construction safety management mainly focuses on the safety of construction personnel within the construction site, however, what the world perceives as safety failure in the construction industry is broader. This paper seeks to understand whose safety concerns are currently ignored and aims to explore the different strategic uses of safety in the construction industry. To address these objectives, this study uses naturally occurring news article data regarding construction safety in India. The paper discusses the safety of construction personnel, the safety of the project, and the safety of externalities. It was seen that safety was used strategically for branding, for political motives, as well as for awakening the community of the importance of construction safety. This study makes a case that safety management in construction is not just the prevention of accidents, but also impression management. Thus, this article argues that safety is not a neutral and easily measurable concept, but a sociocultural concept laden with meaning.

Understanding the Antecedents and Outcomes of Facebook Privacy Behaviors: An Integrated Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Privacy; Calculus; Facebook; Limiting; Media; Complexity theory; Facebook; privacy; privacy behaviors; privacy calculus; uses and gratifications	SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; SELF-DISCLOSURE; CALCULUS MODEL; E-COMMERCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PERSONAL INFORMATION; INTENTION; GRATIFICATIONS; MEDIA; TRUST	Privacy in online social networking (OSN) is more complex than in traditional online environments, such as e-commerce. In addition to simply limiting self-disclosure, OSN users can also use privacy settings and manage their network size to ensure privacy. This complexity calls for an enhanced OSN privacy model that more completely explains privacy behaviors. Combining the privacy calculus model with part of the uses and gratifications approach, this paper proposes an OSN privacy model that depicts both antecedents (i.e., privacy concern, trusting beliefs, and personal interest) and outcomes (i.e., gratifications obtained) of perceived privacy and use behaviors. Using an Empanel survey sample collected from U.S. Facebook users, results show that privacy concern influences network size, trust influences privacy setting use and use frequency, and personal interest influences each privacy and use behavior. Findings also show that the privacy behaviors' influence on gratifications obtained is complex in nature. A three-way interaction influences enjoyment and habit gratifications, and a two-way interaction influences bonding social capital. This paper provides opportunities for future research regarding OSN privacy behaviors, and it discusses practical implications.

J	Liu, YF; Castronovo, F; Messner, J; Leicht, R				Liu, Yifan; Castronovo, Fadi; Messner, John; Leicht, Robert			Evaluating the Impact of Virtual Reality on Design Review Meetings	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODELS	With the help of virtual reality (VR), architectural design can be visualized interactively and at full scale. Viewers of VR models also gain an additional sense of spatial depth and volume. These capabilities make VR a unique design visualization media, and have attracted research interests in applying VR for design reviews. For example, previous research has studied the application of VR for evaluating the designs of courtrooms, nuclear power plants, patient rooms, and educational buildings. This research extends contributions reported in existing literature that aims to explore the value and impact of VR on design review meetings. This research performs a detailed analysis of a large number of design review meetings, including 13 meetings conducted on building construction projects. A novel design review evaluation methodology, designed to leverage video analysis techniques was adopted to allow for higher consistency of the evaluation results and reducing the impact of user bias caused by the novelty effect of VR. This methodology provides systematic rules and metrics to analyze design review meeting quality. The research has also extended the analysis of the impact of VR-based design review meetings to those that involve occupants and facility maintenance staff, which is a type of VR-based review that has not been extensively studied in the previous literature. The results of this research show that VR alone is not necessarily better than traditional media, such as drawings, in facilitating active discussions of design issues. Instead, the authors find that design review meetings yield more effective discussion and better meeting efficiency when VR is orchestrated with, and supported by, other design visualization media, such as drawings, digital models, renderings, and maps. This paper also summarizes six strengths and four weaknesses of VR to support design review meetings when compared with 2D drawings. To help project teams decide if VR should be used for their design reviews, the authors recommend the consideration of three criteria: (1) the reviewers' exposure to the design, (2) the scope of the review, and (3) the project complexity.

Secondary data sourced via the World Bank Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF)/Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Project Database for the period 1994 to 2013 and Energy Commission for the period 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze Ghana's power generation statistics using descriptive, exploratory data analysis and polynomial prediction models. Results reveal that reform has stimulated independent power producer (IPP) investment, particularly in thermal generation capacities to complement hydro alternatives. It is predicted that in the medium term the electricity tariff will continue to rise while electricity generation will decline if additional investments in power infrastructure are not made. This paper provides a case study that critically appraises Ghana's power sector reform; exposes the gap between policy implementation and policy objectives attainment; and proposes a simple yet novel polynomial prediction model that can facilitate short-to-medium term planning of generation and tariff management.

However, the impact on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is not always clear as the resources required to implement such a strategy in an SME often falls beyond what is considered to be acceptable risk. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the issue of whether SMEs truly know how to effectively operate in an environment driven by customization. This paper introduces and demonstrates, through two case studies, how the principles of MC have been adopted by SMEs within the context of manufacturing agility and product flexibility. The paper explores the issues of product configuration, component similarity and the set of tools and measures of performance developed to steer the MC implementation process. The paper examines how the reuse of common components in product families can reduce internal variety. Coefficients that measure the similarity of products within a family are presented. These consider the factors of product structure, cost, volume and contribution. The "product-component matrix" is introduced to represent product families and calculate the similarity coefficients.

The research utilizes a competitive dynamics perspective (CDP) as the theoretical lens and analyses data collected from 135 SMEs using Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to provide a richer insight into levels of BIM implementation maturity. Findings reveal that there is no meaningful association between BIM implementation maturity within SMEs and their organizational attributes, such as size and level of experience. A paucity of solid evidence to support a reasonable return on investment (ROI) was also identified as a key barrier to using BIM in higher levels of maturity. In practical terms, the study focuses on pertinent issues associated with mandated BIM in Australia from SMEs' perspectives, pointing out potential consequences and challenging the pressure for mandating. The research concludes by outlining industrial implications and providing pragmatic recommendations designed to accelerate the pace that Australian SMEs move across a BIM trajectory from nonadoption to higher levels of maturity.

Home energy monitors: impact over the medium-term	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Captology; energy demand; energy management; energy monitor; Home Energy Management System (HEMS); housing; occupant behaviour; smart metering	CONSUMPTION INFORMATION-SYSTEM; CONSERVATION; FEEDBACK	Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS), e.g. energy monitors, are intermediary products that can visualize, manage, and/or monitor the energy use of other products or whole households. HEMS increasingly receive attention for their role in energy conservation in households. A literature review and a case study examine the mid-term effectiveness (more than 4 months) of HEMS. The case study presents the results of a 15-month pilot with a domestic energy monitor in the Netherlands. It explores the extent to which participants manage to sustain their initial electricity savings over time, with a special focus on the development of habitual energy-saving behaviour. The results show that the initial savings in electricity consumption of 7.8% after 4 months could not be sustained in the medium- to long-term. A second finding is that certain groups of people seem more receptive to energy-saving interventions than others. These participants quickly develop new habits and exhibit larger savings than other participants. Obviously, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach for home energy monitors cannot be justified. For HEMS to be effective, a deeper understanding is needed that embraces social science, contextual factors, usability, and interaction design research.	[van Dam, S. S.; van Hal, J. D.

J	Kinuthia, J; Snelson, D; Gailius, A				Kinuthia, John; Snelson, David; Gailius, Albinas			SUSTAINABLE MEDIUM-STRENGTH CONCRETE (CS-CONCRETE) FROM COLLIERY SPOIL IN SOUTH WALES UK	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coal; mining; waste; colliery; stabilization; wastepaper; sludge; ash	PAVING BLOCKS; AGGREGATE; SLUDGE	This paper reviews one way in which colliery spoil can be utilized in low-strength concrete. Colliery Spoil (CS) (minestone), a by-product of coal mining, is abundant in most parts of the world. It has potential as a construction material but it has not been fully appreciated. This is partly because colliery spoil is not easy to utilize, due a number of drawbacks. The major problems identified in attempts to utilize CS in construction include excessive wear, expansive behaviour, leaching of heavy metals and even radioactivity. Thus, to date, the bulk of the CS utilization is limited to isolated cases of highway embankments, backfilling of mines, quarries and other surface tips, or in extreme cases subjected to marine and other disposal. This paper reports on the scope of technological benefits of utilizing colliery spoil (CS) in low to medium strength concrete. There has been intermittent pursuance of the benefits of utilizing colliery spoil in the United Kingdom. However, there is still no well-accepted and/or positive feedback on any colliery-based technology and/or construction material, apart from that relating its use for bulk fill. This research was triggered by proximity of large supplies of both CS and stag in South Wales, UK, as well as the authors' interest in advances in sustainable construction. Two fractions of colliery spoil were mixed in equal proportions and used for concrete where the binder was PC, or novel binders comprising of either Wastepaper Sludge Ash (WSA) or WSA combined in equal proportions with Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), themselves industrial wastes or by-product materials. Compressive strength of compacted cube specimens was monitored for a period of up to 56 days of curing. Results indicate that the performance of systems incorporating CS and WSA were of very poor workability, but the resultant strength was within the low to medium category usable for blinding concrete and or for use in bound granular fill or foundations.

J	Ma, GF; Jiang, S; Jia, JY				Ma, Guofeng; Jiang, Shan; Jia, Jianyao			Investigating the adoption of social media in the construction industry: empirical evidence from project teams in China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction project teams; Social media; Adoption; Project fit; Communication effectiveness	CLOUD COMPUTING ADOPTION; COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT; USAGE; PERSPECTIVE; COLLABORATION	Purpose A lack of reliable and effective communication tools poses major barriers impeding the performance of construction projects consisting of diverse participants. Although some construction project teams (CPTs) begin to apply social media (SM) as an available approach for project management the entire mechanism of SM adoption in this specific context remains understudied. Therefore, this study aims to adopt a CPT's lens to investigate the critical antecedents and associated effects underlying SM adoption in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theory, a conceptual model was proposed and tested by empirical data collected from 159 CPTs in China. Structural equation modeling technique was employed for data analysis. Findings The results demonstrate that all the five extracted TOE-based antecedents including two technological factors (i.e. compatibility and expected cost), one organizational factor (i.e. top management support) and two environmental factors (i.e. project partner collaboration and project fit) are crucial to the adoption of SM in CPTs. Besides, SM acceptance is found to mediate the relationships between organizational and environmental factors and SM use. Moreover, SM use significantly predicts the communication effectiveness of CPTs. Research limitations/implications A questionnaire study based on cross-sectional data from China may only unveil the logic of SM adoption in the context of Chinese construction industry within a shorter time interval. It is recommended that future research could develop longitudinal studies among various construction practitioners in different countries to further specify and generalize the current findings. Originality/value This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of SM adoption in the construction industry by exploring the preadoption antecedents and postadoption effects from the perspective of project teams. The empirical findings advance the current web-based project management literature and afford new insights for construction practitioners into better managing SM application to reap its full capabilities in projects.

J	Bermudez, J; King, K				Bermudez, J; King, K			Media interaction and design process: establishing a knowledge base	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-in-Architecture	OCT, 1998	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture				Integrating computers in architectural design means to negotiate between centuries-old analog design methods and the new digital systems of production. Analog systems of architectural production use tracing paper, vellum, graphite and ink, clipboard, clay, balsa wood, plastic, metal, etc. Analog systems have also been termed "handmade", "manual", "material" or "physical". Digital systems of architectural production use scanning, image manipulation, visualization, solid modeling, computer aided drafting, animation, rendering, etc. Digital systems have also been called "electronic", "computer-aided", "virtual", etc. The difficulty lies in the underdeveloped state of the necessary methods, techniques, and theories to relate traditional and new media. Recent investigations on the use of multiple iterations between manual and electronic systems to advance architectural work show promising results. However, these experiments have not been sufficiently codified, cross-referenced and third party tested to conform a reliable knowledge base. This paper addresses this shortcoming by bringing together reported experiences from diverse researchers over the past decade. This summary is informed by more than three years of continuous investigation in the impacts of analog-digital conversations in the design process. The goal is to establish a state-of-the-art common foundation that permits instructors, researchers and practitioners to refer to, utilize, test, criticize and develop. An appendix is included providing support for the paper's arguments.

A review of the literature identifies major problems in relation to the fairness and equality of the risk allocation process. However, most existing studies have been conducted from the client's perspective rather than that of contractors or consultants and do not focus specifically on risk misallocation. This paper aims at determining the factors involved by a questionnaire survey of the perceptions of contractors and consultants of the main issues in relation to medium to large commercial construction projects in South East Queensland, Australia. The findings are generally consistent with existing research results in that approximately half the respondents feel that their contractual risk allocation is unfair. In addition, there is a lack of use of formal risk management methods, and the arbitrary passing down of risks from the client has increased in recent years. A better understanding is provided of the issues contributing to unequal risk allocation, decision-making and management that will help promote fairness and equality between the contractual parties in the current process of risk management.

The current framework is based on understanding that products are the results of processes, which are performed by actors. Such frameworks are influenced by the available technology. The Internet of today is supporting also other kinds of human activities: communication and social interactions among humans. The construction industry uses them as well but without having a proper understanding of their role. There is a gap in the current framework. In this paper, the relevant theories to specify this gap in terms of what could exist in theory and what is offered by technology are analysed. As a result, a new framework of construction information activities that fills the gap is proposed. The key concepts and relations among them are identified and elaborated within the existing framework. The framework introduces the third major integrative element of the otherwise fragmented construction information activities - the social network - the existing two being the physical building and its digital twin. The framework provides a theoretical and conceptual basis for designing, planning, creating, monitoring and evaluating construction-related online services that include a strong social component and use social media services.

A DECISION-MAKING MODEL FOR ADOPTION OF ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING TOOLS BY SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZE CONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATIONS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Enterprise resource planning; construction information technology; decision making model; small-to-medium size construction organization	SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT	Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) utilization in the construction industry has been limited to large organizations. Significant numbers of construction organizations that have either failed in their efforts to adopt this technology or are not familiar with it are the Small-to Mid-Size Construction Organizations (SMSCOs). Failure in or refusal to adopt ERP by this group, despite all its potential benefits, was the problem addressed in this research. We propose a decision-making model which organizations could utilize to adopt Enterprise Resource Planning Systems. After a careful review of existing technology models, a new ERP Adoption Model (EAM) has been formulated and projected. This model has incorporated new elements that have been set as its new decision-making core. Furthermore, we identified and ranked the prohibitive criteria that were at play and prevented SMSCO members from successfully adopting and implementing ERP systems in order to increase the understanding of their impact on EAM's processes. Finally, we conducted a case study to analyze the decision-making process of EAM implementation by SMSCOs. ERP Adoption Model (EAM) provides a decision-making tool that construction organizations can use as a road map.

Health and Safety Management within Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Developing Countries: Study of Contextual Influences	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction health and safety; Contextual influences; Ghana; SMEs	STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY	Considerable attention has been focused on addressing construction health and safety risks in developed economies. Sadly, the same cannot be said of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where accident figures are extremely high. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the contextual environment within which Ghanaian construction small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage occupational health and safety (OH&S). A questionnaire survey was administered to construction SMEs to better understand the health and safety management practices and associated problems followed up by field interviews to explore key issues identified by the survey. The results of the study highlight the institutional structure for implementing OH&S standards, prevailing economic climate, and extended family culture as challenges to the management of OH&S. The study identifies low literacy levels, low socioeconomic status of workers, owner/managers' ignorance of their OH&S responsibilities, commitment to extended family obligations, and ineffective OH&S administration as key factors limiting the capacity of construction SMEs to manage OH&S effectively. The study concludes that effective institutional structure and an enabling socioeconomic environment are needed to enhance the OH&S performance of SMEs and advocates for more proactive OH&S management that take into consideration the work cultures of SMEs.

J	Dezi, L; Ferraris, A; Papa, A; Vrontis, D				Dezi, Luca; Ferraris, Alberto; Papa, Armando; Vrontis, Demetris			The Role of External Embeddedness and Knowledge Management as Antecedents of Ambidexterity and Performances in Italian SMEs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Technological innovation; Couplings; Organizations; Mathematical model; Ambidexterity; exploitation; exploration; external embeddedness; innovation; Italian small and medium enterprises (SMEs); knowledge management (KM); performance		Sourcing and leveraging knowledge from an external network is only half the battle for firms that would become more successful. In fact, the mere access and acquisition of the knowledge itself through embedded ties does not secure to perform exploration and exploitation activities, and consequently, to achieve better performance because knowledge has to be managed. Firms' knowledge management (KM) orientation may help in the process of knowledge acquisition, sharing, and transfer, consequently, improving firms' ambidexterity and competitiveness. Thus, this paper proposes that the KM plays a key role in determining the outcomes of firms external embeddedness, i.e., the characteristics and ties of the external network, on the ambidexterity and performances of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). An empirical analysis has been developed by using structural equations modeling with data collected from CEOs in 119 Italian SMEs in the ceramic tile industry. Findings show that the KM plays a significant role in mediating the effects of the external embeddedness on the firms ambidexterity that in turn enhances the performances of Italian SMEs in our sample. Based on our results, implications for academics and managers and future line of research are proposed.

J	Abu Awwad, K; Shibani, A; Ghostin, M				Abu Awwad, Khaled; Shibani, Abdussalam; Ghostin, Michel			Exploring the critical success factors influencing BIM level 2 implementation in the UK construction industry: the case of SMEs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modelling (BIM); critical success factors (CSFs); small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); United Kingdom (UK)	INFORMATION; ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION	The implementation of BIM Level 2 in the United Kingdom (UK) construction sector has increased significantly in the last decade, particularly after the UK government mandated the use of BIM in all public projects by 2016. Despite this, there are many indicators that BIM implementation is a main concern for large companies, while Small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind in adopting and implementing this new technology. This slow adoption, has led to a competitive disadvantage for SMEs in public projects and possibly private projects, which is exacerbated by the limited research focusing on the implementation of BIM Level 2 within SMEs. Therefore, the aim of this study is to bridge this gap and explore the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) influencing BIM Level 2 implementation in SMEs, as well as identifying their importance throughout the implementation process. To achieve this aim, a qualitative research approach was adopted involving 25 semi-structured interviews with BIM experts in three SMEs in the UK. The study concluded by identifying 15 factors, which includes 3 new factors and 12 factors previously mentioned in the literature. All 15 factors were then given an importance level based on how influential they were during the implementation process.

The aim of this study is to identify factors and variables that could contribute to the successful implementation of energy retrofit measures in buildings with the goal of achieving net zero energy. A database of 34 small- and medium-sized commercial building retrofit projects was developed for this analysis, which was derived from the New Buildings Institute's Net Zero Energy Building Database. Five factor categories were investigated: physical, technical, environmental, economic, and policy. A total of 11 variables from the 5 categories were analysed. The results show that success stems from a combination of certain variables: the number of floors, the climate zone, and the building cost. In general, the results indicate a trend: compact buildings with a construction cost range between $19/m(2)and $42/m(2)in a mild climate have a higher likelihood of achieving a net zero energy goal. Also, the analysis provides new evidence toward the importance of understanding a building's physical characteristics in an existing building energy retrofit.

The constructs are employee's awareness and perception of tacit knowledge sharing, functional areas benefited from tacit knowledge sharing, company-wide efforts for promoting tacit knowledge sharing, organizational culture, networking and the communities of practice, and the choice of a means and ICT implementation. To accomplish the objective, this study surveyed practitioners using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, and t-test to compare three cohorts of respondents. All respondents consider tacit knowledge an important asset and are willing to share their knowledge. To improve the current practice, companies should establish formal procedures, provide more training opportunities, allow time for participation in sharing and the codification of knowledge, and invest in enhancing internal communication and collaboration for knowledge sharing. The findings of this study are expected to assist practitioners effectively in creating an organizational ecology for advanced tacit knowledge sharing in the workplace.

This study examined the nature of relationship as well as influence of TQM practices and strategies for continuous improvement on different measures of performance among large- and medium-sized construction companies in the Nigerian construction industry. Unlike earlier studies, the research gives specific thought to how the relationship between TQM practices and performance is mediated by strategies for continuous improvement. The study was conducted using sequential mixed methods. In-depth structured interviews were first conducted which formed the basis for cross-sectional survey that subsequently followed. One hundred and twenty-eight valid questionnaires from well-structured questionnaires that were self-administered to 155 medium- and large-sized construction companies were received. Based on the factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modelling that were carried out, the study revealed that TQM practices have significant effects on organizational performance. However, the mediating roles of strategies for continuous improvement are necessary to ensuring better organizational performance. Therefore, it is imperative for organizations that are craving for competitive advantage to place high premium on TQM practices while ensuring that the right strategies for continuous improvement are put in place.

A key factor that most investors in the construction sector consider in project selection is cost which has escalated over the years. Therefore, we examine the co-movements and causality in the time and frequency domains between the prime building cost index (PBCI) and its disaggregates on one hand and inflation and exchange rate on the other hand in Ghana. The findings revealed that the degree of co-movement between PBCI and inflation was significant at the 5% level and occurred over the long-run, indicating that construction cost drives inflation. The degree of co-movement between the prime build cost index and exchange rate occurred within the short term. These co-movements have policy implications for substituting inflation and exchange rates in project costing by investors in Ghana. The co-movement between the PBCI and inflation in the medium to higher frequencies suggests that inflation risk-averse investors should consider short-term projects. Again, the short to medium frequency co-movements between the PBCI and exchange rate indicates that investors should consider exchange rate risk in long-term projects.

Case Study of Knowledge Management Implementation in a Medium-Sized Construction Sector Firm	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge-based systems; Construction management; Information systems; Project management; Information technology (IT)		The transient nature of project teams and the competitive environment in which construction organizations operate require an effective mechanism to manage and reuse the knowledge created in the projects without straining its resources. A methodology for "live" capture and reuse of project knowledge was developed for the purpose and encapsulated into a software tool. A study was conducted of a medium-sized UK-based construction sector firm to investigate the use the software tool as the central strand of its knowledge management (KM) framework. The tool was subsequently designed to integrate with a staff profile system and an e-forum. The new system was intended to bridge the communication gap between the company's geographically dispersed offices by connecting the people together and, hence, facilitating the timely sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. Top management's commitment was found vital in the successful implementation of knowledge management and the nurturing of the desired supportive knowledge-sharing culture. To get the most through the implementation of knowledge management, the various knowledge management practices and relevant information systems of a construction organization need to be strategically integrated to improve the location, capture, and sharing of critical knowledge.

J	Denny-Smith, G; Loosemore, M				Denny-Smith, George; Loosemore, Martin			Integrating Indigenous enterprises into the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Procurement; Small enterprises; Labour utilization; Social progress	PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; COMPETITIVE FORCES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BARRIERS; STRATEGY; HEALTH; VIEW	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the barriers to entry for Indigenous businesses into the Australian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - A national survey was conducted with 33 Indigenous businesses operating in the Australian construction industry. Findings - The findings show that Indigenous enterprises face similar challenges to many small non-Indigenous enterprises wishing to enter the industry. These include adjusting to unique construction industry cultures and practices, breaking into existing business networks and building social capital and being under-cut by industry incumbents and competitors when tendering for projects. These barriers are similar to those faced by other non-Indigenous social enterprises, although Indigenous enterprises do appear to experience relatively greater difficulty in starting-up their businesses and in securing sufficient capital, finance and assistance to enable them to scale-up and tender for normal work packages at a competitive price. Research limitations/implications - The results are limited to Australian Indigenous businesses. The survey does not allow a comparison of non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses, although comparison of results with existing non-Indigenous research into small to medium-sized firms in construction does allow some tentative insights. These need to be explored further. Practical implications - These results indicate that there are significant barriers to be addressed within the Australian construction industry if government indigenous procurement policies are to achieve their stated aims of increasing the number of Indigenous firms in the industry. The results also have important implications for Indigenous businesses and for non-Indigenous firms operating in the Australian construction industry. Social implications - This is an important gap in knowledge to address if countries like Australia are to redress the significant inequalities in income and health suffered by Indigenous populations. Originality/value - In countries like Australia, with significant Indigenous populations, governments are seeking to address persistent disadvantage by using new social procurement initiatives to create quasi construction markets for Indigenous enterprises to participate in the construction industry. While there is an emerging body of research into the barriers facing mainstream small to medium-sized enterprises and, to a lesser extent, social enterprises in construction, the barriers to entry facing Indigenous construction enterprises have been largely ignored.

Project-Based A/E/C Firms' Knowledge Management Capability and Market Development Performance: Does Firm Size Matter	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge management; Knowledge-management capability; Market development performance; Project-based; A/E/C firms; Construction industry	ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; SUCCESS FACTORS; INNOVATION; ENABLERS; CONCEPTUALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; MECHANISMS; ADVANTAGE; MATURITY	Project-based architecture, engineering, and construction (A/E/C) firms' survival depends largely on their market development performance. Given the knowledge-intensive nature of their offerings, A/E/C firms that can develop and leverage their knowledge bases are likely to enjoy superior market positions. Based on empirical data collected from 108 A/E/C firms in Vietnam, this study investigated the effect of A/E/C firms' knowledge-management capability (KMC) on their market development performance, and the moderating role of firm size in this relationship. The results revealed that A/E/C firms' KMC positively affects their market development performance, and this positive effect is stronger in small/medium-sized A/E/C firms than in large firms. These findings provide empirical evidence for small/medium-sized A/E/C firms to invest in their knowledge-management infrastructure (e.g., organizational values/norms, policies/procedures, employee development, and information infrastructure) and processes (e.g., socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) to secure superior market positions. Theoretically, this research broadens and deepens understanding of the link between KMC and organizational performance (i.e., market development performance) and the contingent contextual factors (i.e., firm size) in the project-based construction industry.

Several models based on systematic surveys are available in the literature to formulate the BIM adoption decision-making process. It is still, however, not clear whether the decision parameters in these models are universally important. This study examines the main attributes of the BIM adoption decision-making process in China and Australia. An adoption model developed earlier for Australia is tested for Chinese data collected from 103 small and medium construction companies (SMEs). By highlighting model fitness issues, the model is then reconstructed for comparing BIM adoption in cross-cultural contexts. Data are analyzed using a logistic regression to understand the main factors impacting BIM adoption. Structural equation modeling based on multigroup analysis is also adopted in the analysis. The analysis indicates that Australian construction SMEs adopt BIM to solve organizational collaboration problems and improve workflow efficiency, whereas Chinese construction SMEs adopt BIM to improve organizational technical ability. The results of this study highlighted the Chinse companies tend to be more careful during the implementation of new technology to minimize uncertainty, whereas BIM adoption decision makers in Australian companies are more focused on change management and empowering subordinates.

Digital media help to integrate and expand the content of courses in drafting, construction and design. This paper describes computer-based exercises that intensify the student's experience of construction in several courses from sophomore to senior level. The courses integrate content from drafting and design communication, construction, CAD, and design. Several techniques are used to strengthen students' awareness and ability in construction. These include: Virtual design-build projects in which students construct 3D CAD models that include all elements that are used in construction, Virtual office in which several students must collaborate under the supervision of a student acting as project architect to create a 3D CAD model and design development documents. Virtual sub-contracting in which each student builds a trade specific 3D CAD model of a building and all of the trade specific models must be combined into a single model. Construction simulations (4D CAD) in which students build 3D CAD models showing all components and then animate them to illustrate the assembly process. Cost estimating using spreadsheets. These techniques are applied and reapplied at several points in the curriculum in both technical laboratory courses and design studios. This paper compares virtual construction methods to physical design-build projects and provides our pedagogical arguments for the use of digital media for understanding construction.

J	Zhu, YM				Zhu, Yimin			Exploratory Study on Value of Information Systems to Electrical Construction Companies: Resource-Based View	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TECHNOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGY; COSTS	Many practitioners and researchers believe that the application of information systems in the construction industry lags behind that of other industries such as the manufacturing industry, because the construction industry is mainly composed of small to medium size companies. Besides, to many people, the value of information systems to their business is vague and elusive. Existing studies on the value of information systems are not specifically focused on small to medium size specialty contractors such as electrical contractors. In addition, with an intention to demonstrate the value of information systems to the improvement of operations or business of all relevant companies, those studies typically do not look into the impact of information systems on the competitive advantage of individual companies. This paper argues that such a generalization of the value of information systems, although valuable to both practitioners and researchers, may have overlooked the fact that the value of information systems needs to be reflected through improved competitive advantage of a company and the competitive advantage is company specific. Thus, the examination of different effects of information systems on individual companies can generate useful insight into the value of information systems because such a strategy leads to a better understanding of the relationships between information systems and the competitive advantage of individual companies. With such a perspective, this study applies a case study strategy to study five small to medium size electrical construction companies based on the resource-based view theory. The case studies show that the observed electrical construction companies are well equipped in terms of physical information infrastructure in relation to their business objectives regardless of company size. However, their capabilities of strategically integrating information systems with their business plans and with their external business partners are general lacking, compared with their physical information system infrastructure. This is partly because many electrical contractors do not fully understand that there are many different forms of information systems that have different impacts on gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. This paper then conjectures that the existing imbalanced application of information systems may not lead to the improved competitive advantage of electrical construction companies, which in turn prevent many contractors from clearly seeing the value of the information systems. Thus, the paper further points out that a plan for the systematical implementation of information systems in a company is very important. However, the successful development of such a plan depends on a better understanding of electrical contactors on the concepts of information system capabilities, competitive advantage, and their relationships.

Measuring SMEs Propensity for Open Innovation Using Cognitive Mapping and MCDA	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; Companies; Tools; Decision making; Collaboration; Choquet integral (CI); cognitive mapping; decision support; multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA); open innovation (OI); organizational ambidexterity; small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)		Open innovation (OI) has captured increasing interest over recent decades as this approach is linked to higher level organizational ambidextrous strategy, and has become a prerequisite for achieving competitive advantages. Assessing firms' propensity for OI has, however, turned out to be an increasingly challenging endeavor. This is particularly true for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to themyriad of factors that influence these companies' capability for innovation. To overcome this challenge, this paper sought to integrate two operational research/management science techniques-cognitive mapping and the Choquet integral (CI) (a nonadditive measure and information aggregator)-to identify and prioritize relevant criteria for evaluating SMEs' propensity forOI, and improving their organizational ambidexterity. To facilitate a real-world application, information was first collected from SME managers and entrepreneurs who agreed to participate in face-to-face group meetings, allowing realism to be incorporated in the decision-making process. The results were validated by both the panel members and project director of COTEC Portugal-a leading think-and-action network for advancing technology diffusion and business innovation cooperation. The findings include that cognitive mapping facilitates the identification and understanding of cause-and-effect relationships between the determinants of OI in SMEs. The CI, in turn, introduces realism into the construction of value functions and the respective assessments of SMEs. The limitations and implications of the proposed system are also discussed.

J	Jafari, KG; Noorzai, E				Gharouni Jafari, Kobra; Noorzai, Esmatullah			Selecting the Most Appropriate Project Manager to Improve the Performance of the Occupational Groups in Road Construction Projects in Warm Regions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project manager competencies; Performance; Occupational groups; Engineer; Technician; Worker; Road projects; Construction phase; Project size; Decision-making	COMPETENCES; LEADERSHIP; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; AGENCY; MODEL; AHP	This research proposes a framework to determine the most appropriate project manager (PM) to enhance the performance of occupational groups (POGs) in large, medium, and small road construction projects in warm regions. The occupational groups (OGs) in road projects were divided into three categories: workers, technicians, and engineers. Using the Pareto principle, 14 critical project manager competencies (PMCs) were extracted from a 70-item list developed by performing a comprehensive literature review. Two indexes were ranked in each size of road project using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique: which OG's performance improves the most when the PMCs identified are implemented, and the importance of each PMC in improving the POGs. The results showed that in small projects, a PM with strong communication skills is needed to maximize the performance of all three OGs, whereas negotiation skills in medium projects and project management knowledge in large projects are the most critical PMCs that a PM should possess to increase engineers' performance. The findings can help road construction firms to select the most appropriate PM to improve the POGs for road projects by project size, eventually leading to project success. The principal distinction of this research is its investigation of the correlation between PMCs and the POGs across different road project sizes. The main limitation of this research is that the research scope was limited to warm zones.

Systematic Literature Review of Convergence: A Systems Perspective and Re-evaluation of the Convergence Process	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						Convergence; Integrated circuits; Industries; Bibliometrics; Systematics; Taxonomy; Scholarships; Bibliometrics; convergence process; digital convergence; driving markets; industrial convergence; industry convergence (IC); informetrics; market convergence (MC); market-driven; media convergence; scientific convergence (SC); scientometrics; systematic literature review; taxonomy; technological convergence (TC); technology convergence; typology	TECHNOLOGICAL CONVERGENCE; INDUSTRY CONVERGENCE; COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS; INNOVATION; MEDIA; CHINA; PERSISTENCE; INEQUALITY; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES	This article examines convergence by providing a systematic literature review using scientometric method. Despite the steady growth of convergence literature, we still have an incomplete understanding of convergence concepts as well as the processes of industry convergence (IC). Our systematic review highlights several key findings. First, our review highlights six clusters of research on convergence. Second, our analysis suggests that the process of convergence does not necessarily progress in the three- to four-step supply-side process as postulated in the literature, i.e., from scientific convergence, technology convergence, market convergence, and finally to IC. Although existing literature suggests that IC occurs as a result of supply-side convergence, we expand on this proposition and put forth market-driven convergence processes. Third, we provide a typology of the convergence concepts to bring clarity and avoid indiscriminate use of the various convergence concepts. Finally, our article offers new debates on the literature of convergence, providing scholars with research directions that extend beyond the standard convergence processes. Our systematic review is relevant to scholars and managers as the study highlights a taxonomy of convergence scholarship, a typology of convergence concepts, and a re-evaluation of the IC process model to drive the research forward.

J	Koutamanis, A				Koutamanis, A			Digital architectural visualization	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the eCAADe 97	SEP 17-20, 1997	UNIV VIENNA TECHNOL, VIENNA, AUSTRIA	eCAACe, Vienna Univ Technol	UNIV VIENNA TECHNOL	visualization; representation; analysis		The democratization of computer technologies is changing architectural visualization in two significant ways. The first is that the availability of digital media promotes wider and intensive application of computer visualization. The second concerns the extension of architectural design to visualization in information systems. The transition from analogue to digital visualization relates to fundamental questions ranging from the role of geometric representations in architecture and the relationships between analysis and visualization to the structure of abstraction. In addition, it requires technology and knowledge transfer also from areas other than computer science. The integration of such transfers suggests a flexible, modular approach that contradicts the holistic, integral principles of computer-aided architectural design. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A Logit Model is used to calculate the probability, for a company to innovate based on collaboration, learning, and public policy support programs. The results illustrate that collaboration with multinational companies, suppliers, inter-organizational cooperation for worker training, and formal participation in business associations promotes innovation. The companies' promotion of learning and training processes to improve business capabilities also plays a central role; however, public policy programs have a major impact on innovation in software small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The number of parties involved compounds this complexity. So too the iterative nature of design whereby information flow and decision rules are typically nonlinear. Hypermedia is therefore suggested as an appropriate medium as well as a tool to model this process. By reviewing the refurbishment of mechanical and electrical (m and e) equipment within a shopping center, the appropriateness of a hypermedia paradigm is examined. In this way, primary information elements and relations between such elements are identified. These form the basis for the development of the hypermedia model described in this paper.

The analysis focuses on construction market attractiveness - a measure obtained by combining opinions about the rate of growth, profitability and openness to foreign competition - and construction industry competitiveness with respect to both services and materials. The results of the survey Yank attractiveness of construction markets by country and city. The analysis of competitiveness of construction services and materials largely points to the same countries and indicates some important medium-term trends in the international construction market.

Extant literature acknowledges the diversity of project-based organizational forms, but neither the particular configurations of organizational design dimensions nor the reasons behind their differences are widely addressed. Based on interviews in 12 project-based organizations in various sectors, this study identifies three common organizational design configurations of project-based organizations. It further discusses a range of internal and external factors, which can influence the choice of configuration. The findings are summarized in five overriding conclusions.

J	Konno, Y				Konno, Yukiko			Analysing Japanese contractor activity on the basis of panel data	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Small to medium-sized enterprises; Default; Construction management; Empirical study; Exit; Panel binary logit	FINANCIAL RATIOS; FAILURE; PREDICTION; RISK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing defaults and exits from public works by prime contractors of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Japanese construction industry. By analysing the data for several years as panel data, this study determines the extent of influence of changes in company characteristics on the defaults and exits. Design/methodology/approach - Using construction company evaluation (Keiei Jikou Sinsa or Keisin) data and by employing the panel binary logit random effect model, this study empirically analyses the construction industry. Findings - This study shows that defaulting and exiting companies have different characteristics. The result shows financial performance indicators, non-financial performance indicators and Keisin scores to significantly affect defaults and exits. In particular, this study finds non- financial performance indicators, such as whether a firm draws insurance, to significantly affect its likelihood to default or exit and the influence varies on the basis of insurance type. Originality/value - The feature of this study is that its analysis focuses not only on defaulting companies but also on exiting companies, defined as those that stop operating as prime contractors for public works but otherwise stay in business. In contrast to existing research, this study distinguishes between defaults and exits and analyses the factors that influence a firm following one of these two outcomes. Moreover, although Keisin data are usually used to determine whether companies qualify to enter bids for public works, they can be applied for an attribution analysis of corporate defaults and exits.

As a result of these blasts all over the world, demand of safe constructions with less vulnerability to explosions is rising. A large number of office buildings are built each year in many countries, housing large numbers of staff and clients, and due to specific nature and function, activities and services, these buildings are usually centrally located. Their architectural form being vital, therefore the article attempts, firstly, to present indices depicting the building form from the viewpoint of vulnerability to explosion. Secondly, the article presents such indexes as: capability to reduce blast effects, economic factors, simplicity of implementation, relationship among spaces in the crisis condition, and creating the least unusable space. The model of rapid assessment of vulnerability of office buildings forms to blast, SMART (simple multi attribute ranking technique) procedure is used and, applying the SWARA method, the weight of each major index and sub-index is arrived at. The model presented in the paper shows the assessment systems using figures between zero and a hundred, and four levels of vulnerability: weak, medium, good and excellent. The closer the figure to a hundred, the lower the vulnerability of the office building forms to blast. Swiss Re Tower case study was presented in the article rating of vulnerability of this building against explosion. It was found to be equal to 62.11%, and its standing was at medium level.

Frugal Processes: An Empirical Investigation Into the Operations of Resource-Constrained Firms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technological innovation; Supply chains; Systematics; Bibliographies; Companies; Databases; Economics; Base of the pyramid; bottom of the pyramid; emerging markets; frugal innovation; process innovation; small; and medium-sized enterprises; supply-chain management; sustainability; sustainable operations	OF-THE-ART; BUSINESS MODELS; MEDICAL DEVICE; INNOVATION; BASE; FRAMEWORK; PRODUCT; MARKETS; SMES	The severe resource constraints that characterize markets at the bottom of the world's economic pyramid have forced firms to innovate both their products and processes. However, discourse in frugal innovation literature on how firms can design frugal processes in response to the resource constraints they face remains relatively sparse. Based on a systematic literature review, in this article we consolidate existing work on the process echelon of frugal innovation. We outline three ways frugal processes that have been conceptualized in the literature thus far, and distill their key characteristics. Based on an exploration of the supply chains of 87 small- and medium-sized enterprises, we show how firms configure these characteristics to overcome resource constraints at each stage of their supply chain. Ultimately, we propose three archetypes of a frugal supply chain that firms can strategically adopt. Firms with the primary goal of increasing consumer access to affordable products opt for a supply-chain structure that favors traditional economies of scale, and postpone any decentralization as further downstream as possible. In contrast, firms aiming to provide consumers with greener alternatives can adopt a hyperdecentralized structure throughout their supply-chain, which is made economically viable through low-cost approaches to distributed manufacturing.

J	Algan, T; Lauri, K; Aziz, Z				Tezel, Algan; Koskela, Lauri; Aziz, Zeeshan			Current condition and future directions for lean construction in highways projects: A small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Lean construction; SMEs; Construction management; Project management; Highways; Deployment; Civil; Implementation; Innovation; Supply chain management; Project governance	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; JUST-IN-TIME; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ON-SITE; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; AGILE; COMPETENCES; FRAMEWORK; THINKING	The aim of this study is to identify the parameters defining how Lean Construction (LC) is being implemented (current condition) and how LC can be further promoted (future direction) from a Small-Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) perspective. Although SMEs constitute the largest group in construction supply chains, LC, as an emerging phenomenon in civil construction project management, has been rarely investigated from an SMEs perspective. Also, overlooking the more macro factors like project governance and supply chain management, LC deployments have been mainly discussed from a production process perspective to date. After a review of the extant literature and 20 interviews with managers from the highways sector, a list of 31 current condition and 40 future direction statements were produced, classified under the delivery, process, training, project governance and supply chain related headings and used in a questionnaire survey with 110 responses. The current condition highlights problems like a short-term relations structure, competitive tendering mechanisms, fragmentation, problems in engaging with SMEs for LC, unstandardised LC techniques, and issues with convincing SMEs to deploy LC by demonstrating the business case on mutual benefits. Action items relating to the current project delivery structure were given the highest importance by the supply chain, alongside the LC training and project governance issues for the future of LC at highways SMEs. Additionally, a statistically significant correlation was identified among many future action items. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Difficulty and reasons for sustainable roadway design - the case from Taiwan	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						level of difficulty; sustainable design; roadway project; difficulty reason	CONSTRUCTION; INDICATORS; ECODESIGN; BARRIERS; EXAMPLE; GREEN	To accomplish sustainable design, it is essential to understand its barriers or limitations. This study investigated difficulties and their reasons for sustainable design using roadways as an example. A checklist of 60 sustainability items for roadway design was used to interview roadway designers to identify levels of difficulty, reasons for difficulty and proportions of difficulty reasons when designing these sustainability items. The results were analyzed and compared among sustainable items and design work. The difficulties of incorporating sustainability into designs are classified into three levels as compared with conventional design: equal, medium and high. The average difficulty for sustainable roadway design is between low and medium level; 28 of the 60 items were found to be at the same level of difficulty as conventional design. The technical items are regarded more difficult to adopt than material items. Nine reasons were identified for sustainable roadway design difficulty in which four are in the pre-design stage and five are in the design stage. The proportions of difficulty reasons in the pre-design and design stages are 63% and 37%, respectively. This implies that more difficulties will be encountered in the pre-design stage, and the designers can try to overcome or reduce difficulty in design stage. The top three reasons are natural preconditions; criteria and specifications; and owner, policy and law, which cause 33%, 20% and 14% of the difficulty, respectively. This study pointed out the difficulties and reasons for sustainable roadway design. Having a comprehensive understanding of the difficulties allows a designer to more accurately determine potential limitation, and to make better choices as to which sustainable items a particular construction project should pursue.

However, research has demonstrated that projects constantly fall short of providing valuable outcomes in the medium- and long-term. The value outcomes start to appear in the latter stages of a project, yet, they have a link back to the project definition phase, where value outcomes can be purposely designed for the long-term. Value outcomes per se have been historically researched from a supplier and financial perspective. However, the research around the client perspective has been scarce, particularly the exploration of the co-creation of value outcomes for the long-term. To this end, the Service-Dominant Logic is an established framework to analyse the co-creation of value outcomes in the long-term from a client perspective. Thus, this framework is being used in this research to analyse six project case studies from two public sector client organisations in the United Kingdom. The results show eight managerial value interactions, which may enhance a set of five value outcomes from a client perspective in the medium- and long-term. Additionally, tensions around the co-creation process have been identified, which require management attention to secure and to defend the value outcomes. Overall, this study may prompt project practitioners to undertake a set of co-creation practices in order to formulate projects as service provision, as well as to avoid negative financial impacts to business models.

J	Zhu, YM; Mao, WH; Ahmad, I				Zhu, Yimin; Mao, Weihua; Ahmad, Irtishad			Capturing implicit structures in unstructured content of construction documents	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In a paper-based paradigm, whether construction information is presented in structured or unstructured format is not a critical issue because human beings are good at processing both types of information. However, the paradigm shift from using paper-based media to electronic media requires better handling of unstructured information, as a computer is more adept at processing structured information. It is observed by the writers that many existing information systems in the construction industry simply mimic paper-based construction documents, not just in presentations but also in data structures, such as request for information (RFI) forms developed by many existing software vendors. The writers thus question whether enough attention has been put into understanding the impact of the paradigm shift on data management for construction documents. This paper argues that a construction document such as a RFI is usually used by construction professionals to serve particular business purposes, which restricts the content of such a document. Consequently, some types of unstructured information make references implicitly or explicitly to certain types of information that are often well structured such as building or project management information. Further, the occurrence of such cross references is constant and stable among different instances of the same type of documents. A major challenge is to properly capture, represent, and utilize such knowledge in order to improve information processing for construction professionals. Text analysis and statistical analysis are applied by this study to determine the patterns of the occurrences for certain types of concepts that are related to building components, contract documents, or project management in unstructured content. With the identified patterns, this paper further discusses the potential use of metadata models as a method to support processing unstructured content in those documents.

A.; Sepasgozar, Samad; Akbarnezhad, Ali			BIM adoption model for small and medium construction organisations in Australia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology; Decision support systems; Building information modelling; Construction planning; Information and communication technology (ICT) applications	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; INNOVATION; TECHNOLOGY; PROJECTS; SYSTEM; FIRMS; SMES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a model for building information modelling (BIM) implementation at small and medium-sized construction contractor organisations (SMOs). The proposed BIM adoption model assesses BIM implementation benefits, costs and challenges faced by SMOs. Correlation between BIM adoption in SMOs and the associated impacting factors, including knowledge support and BIM adoption motivation, is captured through the model. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of BIM adoption in construction was first presented. Research data, collected from 80 SMOs in Australia through a conducted survey, are then analysed. Descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate SMOs' understanding of BIM, and to qualify the correlations among the proposed latent variables impacting BIM implementation at SMOs, respectively. Additionally, this study used chi(2) test to compare differences between BIM users and non-BIM users regarding BIM understanding, interested applications and attitudes towards implementation benefits and challenges. Findings Potential benefits associated with BIM implementation are a major motivation factor when it comes to BIM adoption at SMOs. In addition, existing staff's capability in using BIM tools positively affects the establishment of an organisational knowledge-support system, which determines the decision of adopting BIM eventually. Ultimately, there is a need for further emphasis on staff engagement in the implementation process. Originality/value Results of this study provide an insight into the adoption challenges of BIM in SMOs, given that the focus of previous studies has been mostly placed on BIM adoption in architectural firms and large contractors.

J	Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ				Love, PED; Irani, Z; Edwards, DJ			Industry-centric benchmarking of information technology benefits, costs and risks for small-to-medium sized enterprises in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						benchmarking; benefits; construction; costs; evaluation; IT; risks; SMEs	SYSTEM	The evaluation of information technology (IT) is a perennial problem for businesses as they seek to improve their performance and sustain a competitive advantage. While businesses are increasing their expenditure on technology to keep abreast of competitors, organisations in the construction industry have become 'technological laggards'. Both the Federal and State Governments in Australia have recognized the pivotal role that IT can play in improving industry performance and consequently firms are being, encouraged to embrace IT. In obtaining performance improvements, the benefits, costs and risks of IT should be identified and subsequently managed and controlled. Yet, there is an absence of anchor measures that managers can confidently employ to monitor the performance of their IT investments. This paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey that sought to determine the benefits, costs and risks of IT investments from 126 small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Australian construction industry. The questionnaire findings revealed three key findings. First, different organisation types significantly differ in the amount they invest in IT but this is not influenced by firm size (i.e., in terms of turnover and number of employees). Secondly, strategic benefits vary with different organisation types. Third, the way in which employees adapt to change as a result of IT implementation differs with firm size. Based upon the reported findings a series of benchmark metrics for benefits, costs and risks of IT were propagated. These metrics can serve as a reference point for initiating benchmarking, which should form an integral component of the IT evaluation and learning process. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A selected series of student experiments, from 1992 to the present, illustrates this transformation from Pythagorean concepts of mathematics and geometry to the symbolic representation of space and non-linear time. The time concepts, native to film, have been adapted to the architectural medium to create an added design dimension. The dimensional expansion of space, from xyz to xyz+t (time), represents a tactical and strategic opportunity to incorporate multisensory design variables in architectural practice, as well as in its pedagogy.

Research was first conducted to identify the aspects of pipeline planning and pipeline-network design that could benefit from a computer-assisted approach. The barriers described in this study are as follows: hydraulic-analysis programs that are difficult to use; inadequate media for geographic/spatial information; and insufficient supporting tools for design refinements. Building upon these findings, a cohesive computer environment was designed and developed to integrate the hydraulic analysis and geographic information processing with a graphical user interface (GUI) in order to improve the effectiveness of pipeline-design functions. A system prototype was implemented and is currently being applied in real-world pipeline-network planning and design for municipal and industrial water conveyance.

Results from a field study with managers on the client side suggest that both process and product performance positively influence the confirmation of expectations; however, process expectations do not, which might be due to the normality of budget and schedule overruns. Furthermore, client-vendor communication wields an important influence on client satisfaction.

By building on the information processing view and the stakeholder salience framework, our study shows how stakeholder communication practices vary among the impersonal, personal, and group modes of communication. We also show how these practices depend on stakeholders' salience and project life cycle phase. The results indicate that a dynamic approach is required to understanding stakeholder management; different communication practices are required over the project's life cycle, which can be explained by the varying degrees of stakeholder salience.

Despite the existence of multiple methods and techniques for measuring firms' intangible assets, few practical applications are described in the literature, particularly in the context of SMEs. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a modular, multi-purpose, forward-looking tool and test it in three small firms in Italy. The results of our analysis show that the model's application in the companies was useful in enhancing managers' awareness about intangible assets and in improving the management of these assets.

J	Cheng, EWL; Li, H				Cheng, EWL; Li, H			Analytic network process applied to project selection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							COST	Owing to the complexity of a construction project, the analytic network process (ANP) is helpful to deal with interdependent relationships within a multicriteria decision-making model. This paper demonstrates an example to illustrate how to empirically prioritize a set of projects by using a five-level project selection model. A questionnaire was filled by a group of construction professionals of a medium-sized local developer and scores were computed for prioritizing the potential projects. The paper is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers. Industry practitioners may adopt the weighted criteria for direct project selection or apply the ANP method to prioritize their own set of selection criteria. Researchers may rely on this paper as a point of departure for exploring other uses of ANP.

This paper utilizes the unit price of the design variables as a medium for negotiation between autonomous and self-interested design participants represented by design agents (DAs). An artificial agent-the facilitator agent (FA), maximizes the overall utility of the design as a function of the prices of the design variables, and guides the design toward global feasibility. By relating the FA's price space to the DAs' design space through price-variable curves, a negotiation platform is developed and tested.

It is necessary to pay enough attention to public opinions that generally have a significant impact on megainfrastructure's performance. As the longest sea-crossing bridge in the world, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) receives extensive attention from both the industry of bridge construction and the general public. Every individual is a potential user of this megaproject. Ignorance of public opinion may inhibit the final success of the HZMB. Based on two dimensions of stage and region, this study aims to devise an analytical framework for topic modeling and sentiment analysis of the megainfrastructure in the data-rich era. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a flexible generative probabilistic model was adopted for topic extraction, and the measure of perplexity was used for determining the optimal number of topics in every stage or region. Rule-based sentiment analysis was conducted for identifying sentiment polarity and calculating sentiment intensity values of the validated data set. The results denoted that topics varied in four stages and three regions directly connected to the bridge. Positive comments occupied the largest proportion in every stage or region. According to sentiment polarity and intensity, the proposed approach for sentiment analysis had a higher ability to recognize positive comments from four stages and three regions. This study contributes to public opinion analysis of megainfrastructures within the context of sufficient social media data, which provides new opportunities for data-driven infrastructure management and governance. Management recommendations can be obtained to guide similar infrastructure's public opinion management in future.

Characterizing Partially Saturated Compacted-Sand Specimen Using 3D Image Registration of High-Resolution Neutron and X-Ray Tomography	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Granular media; Imaging techniques; Soil compaction; Pore water; Nondestructive tests; Image registration	INTERPOLATION ARTIFACTS; POROUS-MEDIA; MICROTOMOGRAPHY; MAXIMIZATION	Partially saturated compacted-sand specimens were characterized by using three-dimensional (3D) image registration of dual-modal (neutron and X-ray) tomography data. Neutron and X-ray imaging provide complementary information for precisely identifying the three phases (silica sand, air, and water) of a compacted sand specimen that is partially saturated. Neutron tomography provides high contrast of the water phase, whereas X-ray tomography provides high contrast of the silica sand phase due to different fundamental interaction mechanisms of neutron and X-ray with matters. X-ray interacts with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, whereas neutron radiation interacts with the nucleus of an atom. In this paper, a computational technique was developed to unify digital images of dual-modal data obtained at different image resolution and specimen orientations based on the maximization of the normalized mutual information to combine the information from the water phase inferred from a neutron image and information from the sand and pore phases obtained from an X-ray image. The combined microstructure obtained from registered X-ray and neutron images can thus be analyzed in 3D to precisely differentiate silica, air, and water distribution spatially. Microstructure information for granular assembly including pore size distribution and coordination number was determined from X-ray tomography data due to higher precision in identifying solid particle boundaries. Local values of saturation along the height of the specimen are obtained from the pore and water phases segmented from the registered neutron and X-ray images. Image registration of neutron and X-ray images provides the ability to obtain the microstructure of partially saturated sand in terms of the detailed variation of solid particles, air, and water phases spatially.

J	Singh, M; Rathi, R				Singh, Mahipal; Rathi, Rajeev			Empirical Investigation of Lean Six Sigma Enablers and Barriers in Indian MSMEs by Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Lean Six Sigma; Enablers; Barriers; Analytical Hierarchy Process; FUZZY-DEMATEL; Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises; Continuous Improvement; Decision Making & Risk Management; Engineering Management Profession; Organization Development & Change	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES; MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS; SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION; HYBRID APPROACH; DEMATEL METHOD; PERFORMANCE; AHP; ENTERPRISES; SUSTAINABILITY	Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is an inclusive approach based on the concept of waste and variation reduction to achieve quality and sustainability. The successful adoption of any approach depends upon the awareness and readiness measures of a particular one. This paper contributes toward Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to adopt a comprehensive LSS approach in their existing system through the identification, analysis, and prioritization of LSS enablers and barriers. In the present study, 25 enablers and 21 barriers of LSS adoption are identified through literature review and are validated by using questionnaire-based survey. The screened enablers and barriers are further formulated into logical groups using factor analysis. These formulated groups are prioritized through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and compared the obtained results with the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (Fuzzy-DEMATEL). The result reveals that among the main group of enablers, "management-based factor" is the top-ranked followed by "training- and education-based factor" and "technology-based factor" with AHP weights 0.4008, 0.2742, and 0.1465 respectively. On the other hand, among the main groups of barriers, "training and education based factor" is at first rank trailed by "management-based factor" with AHP weights 0.4780 and 0.2915 respectively. The outcomes of current research will facilitate the MSMEs to make a favorable environment toward the LSS approach for increasing productivity and profitability dynamics. An engineering manager can use this paper to enhance social sustainability through the incorporation of LSS approach in the communities where they work. Moreover, this study provides a guiding reference for practitioners and academicians to undertake similar nature of problems into other industrial sectors.

Non-linear optimization of track layouts in loop-sorting-systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Collision detection; Design optimization; Relaxed problem; Multi-stage approach		Optimization used for enhancing geometric structures is well known. Applying obstacles to the shape optimization problem is on the other hand not very common. It requires a fast contact search algorithm and an exact continuous formulation to solve the problem robustly. This paper focuses on combining shape optimization problems with collision avoidance constraints by which a collision detection algorithm is presented. The presented method is tested against the commercial loop-sorting-system used for sorting of medium sized items. The objective is to minimize price and footprint of the system while maintaining its functionality. Contact constraints are in this context important to include as various obstacles may surround the loop-sorting-system. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bored piles installed by the dry process commonly are used for low- to medium-rise buildings in the metropolis. However, the installation of bored piles is time consuming and labor intensive, and requires skillful supervision, quality control, and the disposal of excavated spoils. The soil-cement screw pile (SCSP), a composite piling system which incorporates a soil-cement column (SCC) and a screw pile (SP), is an innovative alternative piling solution. This paper presents the ultimate load, time and cost analysis, and suggested effective design method for this piling system in soft Bangkok clay. The load capacity predictive equations for the SCSP were proposed and validated based on the field static pile load test results. These equations were used successfully for the installation of this piling system in construction projects on soft Bangkok clay. The unit cost of the SP was found to be the highest, and the unit cost of the SCSP and bored pile was found to be the lowest and almost similar. As a result, the application of the full SCSP and bored pile is more economical than the partial SCSP and SP under the same ultimate load design. However, the partial SCSP and SP have more advantages in terms of construction time and are suitable for a time-constrained project. The SCSP has higher efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness than the traditional dry-process bored pile. The outcome of this research will lead to the development of guidelines and a code of practice for SCSP in soft clay, which will be useful for the construction industry, particularly pertaining to the scheduling and cost performance of SCSPs in construction projects.

J	Sacilotto, J; Loosemore, M				Sacilotto, J.; Loosemore, M.			Chinese investment in the Australian construction industry: the social amplification of risk	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Australia; China; foreign investment; opportunity; perceptions; risk		Chinese companies are investing heavily in overseas construction and property assets. In Australia, and in many other countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, this has generated an emotive and polarized debate about the risks and opportunities posed to local industry and to wider national interests. To explore the social and cognitive mechanisms which people are using to make sense of this new global phenomenon, Kasperson's Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) was mobilized, through semi-structured interviews with senior Australian construction industry leaders. The results show that the SARF is a valuable lens to explore perceptions of risk and opportunity associated with Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), although it represents a rather linear view and underplays the importance of power, collaboration and social media in forming perceptions. They also show that senior practitioners in the Australian construction industry are taking a highly rational, commercial and pragmatic approach to increasing FDI. Despite some concerns around non-compliant materials, labour standards and safety standards, Chinese FDI is seen as inevitable and crucial to the development of Australia's construction industry. Surprisingly, given negative media coverage of Chinese FDI in Australia and a lack of experience in working with Chinese investors, we found little evidence for the social amplification or attenuation of risk. Knee-jerk regulatory reactions which are advocated by many groups are generally seen as risky and we conclude that the nature of Chinese - Australian business experiences over the near future will have a major effect on whether those perceptions eventuate as negative or positive. It is recommended that the best way to mitigate any risks and maximize the opportunities is not to withdraw and oppose Chinese FDI but to build collaborative links to improve direct interactions between Australian and Chinese firms, underpinned by targeted risk and opportunity management protocols.

Several environmental management measures were put in place by international organisations to reduce these impacts on humans and the entire ecosystem. Sadly, such environmental management measures are not widely embraced in the construction industry of developing countries. This contributes to the poor quality of life of construction stakeholders, amongst other outcomes. Therefore, this study investigated the drivers to facilitate an environmental management system (EMS) in the Nigerian construction industry (NCI). Design/methodology/approach questionnaires retrieved from construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises were used to conduct both descriptive and inferential statistics, namely, mean score, standard deviation, Kruskal-Wallis H test, post hoc test and factor analysis. Findings The analyses show that the drivers of EMS implementation in the NCI could be grouped into intellectual enhancement strategies, documentation and cultural strategies, and motivation and tracking strategies. The study concluded that training and education of relevant stakeholders, tracking compliance levels of organisations and recognising firms acting in compliance with stipulated "environmental" policy are essential. It was recommended that the collaboration of all construction stakeholders be upheld to aid EMS implementation in the NCI. Originality/value This paper investigated the drivers of EMS with the opinions of construction professionals in the mainstream of the NCI through survey using to ensure wide coverage of respondents. Investigating the view of construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises helped determine possible significant differences. Thus, practical implications of the study were also provided in a systematic manner.

J	Matteucci, P; Cepolina, F				Matteucci, Paul; Cepolina, Francesco			A robotic cutting tool for contaminated structure maintenance and decommissioning	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Cutting tool; Diamond wire; Contaminated structures; Safety robotics; Decommissioning; Nuclear power plants		With the global dependency on fossil fuels being undermined by growing prices and environmental concerns, nuclear power is returning as a solution for energy demands, however the increased cost of maintaining and updating ageing plants could render them nuclear alternative counter-economic. The development of tools specifically targeted at the maintenance field is vital to ensure the longevity and safety of existing power plants. This paper proposes a robotic tool capable of remotely cutting composite material structures. With design and engineering focused on the safety of the operator and automation, the proposed machine presents sufficient flexibility to be utilised in both maintenance and decommissioning of structures with low to medium levels of radioactive contamination.

J	Chastain, T; Elliott, A				Chastain, T; Elliott, A			Cultivating design competence: online support for beginning design studio	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-in-Architecture	OCT, 1998	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture				A primary lesson of a beginning design studio is the development of a fundamental design competence. This entails acquiring skills of integration, projection, exploration, as well as critical thinking-forming the basis of thinking "like a designer". Plaguing the beginning architectural design student as she develops this competence are three typical problems: a lagging visual intelligence, a linking of originality with creativity, and the belief that design is an act of an individual author instead of a collaborative activity. We believe that computation support for design learning has particular attributes for helping students overcome these problems. These attributes include its inherent qualities for visualization, for explicitness, and for sharing. This paper describes five interactive multi-media exercises exploiting these attributes which were developed to support a beginning design studio. The paper also reports how they have been integrated into the course curriculum.

Developments in three-dimensional (3D) computer aided design (CAD), mobile computing and 3D printing provide opportunities for engineering deliverables in new mediums at the face of the work. However, they are not being utilized to their full potential. This research examines the influence that the format of engineering deliverables in the form of two-dimensional (2D) plan sets, 3D CAD via mobile computing, and 3D printed models have on craft performance in completing tasks within a controlled setting. This research discovered that the format of engineering deliverables do influence craft performance while controlling for spatial cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, previous studies have shown that specific, difficult goals produce better performance than any of medium, easy, or do-your-best goals; or no goals. However, notwithstanding its potential for productivity improvement, attempts to apply goal setting to construction projects have been limited due to the inherent charactersitics of the construction industry and the associated difficulties in implementation. Based on results obtained from two widely different studies, many of the obstacles for successful implementation of goal setting in the construction industry are explicitly identified, suggestions for dealing with them are advanced, and productivity is shown to increase from 10% to more than 20%.

Implementing organizational learning in engineering cultures can be difficult due to a focus on technology instead of people and imbalances among cultures within an organization. A project to transform a medium-sized engineering organization into a learning organization is reported, and the degree, nature, and causes of its success are evaluated. An implementation team developed skills in five disciplines of a learning organization. However the underlying organizational learning concepts were not embraced by the organization at large or incorporated into regular operations. Success was constrained by the organization's ability to share and utilize the knowledge acquired by the implementation team to generate organizationwide commitment to organizational learning. The dominance of the engineering culture and the lack or organizational learning infrastructures and development process experimentation suggest that organizations with a balance among cultures may be more likely to succeed than those dominated by a single culture.

We also examine if new product development in new and mature firms leads to equivalent growth rates. Empirical results obtained from a survey of small-and medium-sized technology-based manufacturing firms in Korea show that while relative exploration generally remains lower in mature firms than in new firms, it more rapidly increases in mature firms when they operate in adverse environments. Interestingly, our results show that mature firms achieve lower growth rates through new product development than new firms in adverse environments. These empirical findings advance our understanding of the age-dependent antecedents and consequences of new product development.

But it requires the additional power of heating system. It is determined that the most effective solution for energy savings is to enlarge the heating power approximately by 50% for most of buildings. The simulation has showed that for buildings with a medium thermal inertia (time constant tau = 144 h) the expenses by employing the intermittent heating (reduced temperature period: 12 h on working days and 48 h at weekends), pays back after one year. By designing the heating system we must pay attention to thermal inertia of building. Our research showed that for various thermal inertias of building, the adequate modes of intermittent heating must be chosen.

As the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, blockchain has numerous benefits, such as decentralization, collective maintenance, tamper-resistance, traceability, and anonymity. The potential of the blockchain technology (BT) is widely recognized in the financial field. Although some scholars have proposed the combination of blockchain and supply chain finance (SCF), the details of this combination is rarely mentioned. This study first analyzes the coupling between SCF and blockchain technology. Second, the conceptual framework of blockchain-driven SCF platform (BcSCFP) is presented. Third, the operation process of three SCF models on the BcSCFP is proposed. Finally, a case study combined with actual events is conducted. This paper has a positive practical significance in the operation and management of banks and loan enterprises.

Robust conception of Six Sigma is taken as one option of flexible approach used in construction industry for risk management. High level of risk on the operations management is very important feature in comparison between construction industry and other economy branches. This problem is connected with very restricted level of automation and robotics, influenced environment, etc. Hierarchical culture with fragmentation of activity and low cost preferences as typical approach in construction industry seems to be important reasons of problems in Six Sigma implementation process.

Statistical considerations for predicting residual value of heavy equipment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DEPRECIATION; TRACTORS	Residual value needs to be considered in owning cost calculations for used heavy construction equipment. Its dependency on factors such as manufacturer and model, equipment age, and condition rating can best be examined by analyzing real market data from equipment auctions. Macroeconomic indicators can also be included to examine any potential influence of the overall economy on auction prices. This paper discusses statistical considerations for performing such a residual value analysis. Considerations include the study type, data properties, identifying outlier observations, regression assumptions, and formulating and selecting an appropriate regression model using the adjusted coefficient of determination. A second-order polynomial of equipment age with additive factors appears promising as the final regression model. Adjusted confidence and prediction intervals are created to correctly display residual value. Cross-validation using randomly split halves of the dataset is performed. Actual data for medium track dozers are used to illustrate the validity of the methodology.

A major issue is how to integrate existing operations from different business processes to streamline service and exploit economy of scales. Standard methodologies are often not adequate in these situations and there is a need for a new methodology to focus on consolidation of processes. We develop a mathematical model of the problem and show that the integration problem can be solved by quantitative techniques such as optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. We study general properties of the model and apply it to the consolidation of the contract review system of a particular company. We show that our approach not only improved the overall performance of this company but also can be used for other companies in similar situation.

For this qualitative study, we conducted a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with 36 NTBFs. Consequently, we discovered a set of practices that are applied in the new product development (NPD) process and, based on entrepreneurs' perceptions, link them to the success dimensions of NTBFs. Our findings indicate that entrepreneurs apply Lean startup and agile approaches to project management to a large extent. Moreover, we identify key contingencies for approach selection and propose a framework for NPD in an entrepreneurial context. The study contributes to the literature by integrating project management, new product development, and entrepreneurial perspectives.

However, IPD depends heavily on "big room" collaboration, which requires the constant presence of nearly all participants and is particularly difficult for small or medium projects. To overcome this problem, this research aims to develop a dedicated collaboration platform for IPD to achieve more efficient collaboration and replace the highly resource-consuming "big room". Based on requirement analysis and design of the system architecture, a prototype system is developed and tested in a virtual IPD project. When combined with a few meetings, this collaboration platform can replace the "big room". This will significantly reduce the difficulty associated with implementing IPD projects and thus promote the adoption of IPD.

J	Schein, J				Schein, J.			An information model for building automation systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						building automation; direct digital control; energy management system; information model		An information model of a building automation system (BAS) was created. It encapsulates several views of the system: the device list, network topology, points list, and sequences of operation. The model allows a single persistent representation of a BAS to be maintained from system specification through design to operation and maintenance. It will also allow other applications such as energy simulations, maintenance management systems, and building commissioning applications to extract information about the BAS. The model is not intended to represent control application programs; however, it would be possible to develop a software tool to parse the information model, then create the required configuration database and control application programs as output. The model was tested by creating an experimental implementation based on a BAS installed in a medium-sized office building. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ROI was analyzed using the 709 individual design errors found during the BIM design validation of the six high- and medium-rise buildings in the D3 City project in Seoul, Korea. Each design error was categorized according to its cause and the likelihood of detecting it before construction. The likelihood of detecting errors in the ROI analysis made a large difference of a factor of four to fifteen. An additional analysis on the potential impact of design errors on the schedule shows that costs associated with schedule delays has a much larger economic impact than rework costs.

With the pre-program. adiabatic hydration curves, which are used to determine the internal heat generation, are calculated. An artificial neural networks approach is used for this purpose. Adiabatic hydration curves, which were included in the learning set, were determined by our own experiments, using the adiabatic calorimeter which uses air as the coupling media. The main program is implemented in the finite element code. This program allows concrete structure designers and contractors to quantify and evaluate the effects of some concrete initial parameters on the adiabatic hydration curves and corresponding temperature development at an arbitrary point in the concrete element. Some examples are also presented and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that only a few variables have a significant direct impact on the management system. The paper focuses on system variables in the emerging modem engineering and technology-based medium- and large-sized organizations such as contracting firms, consultants, developers, and the U.S. Army. This paper studies the interrelations among the system variables and their total effect on the management system. It examines the organizational system through a study of organizational variables-planning measures, power bases, conflict management, role pressures, organizational structure, team management, and strategies for success. It establishes that three variables-planning measures, team management, and strategies for success-have higher relevance than others in the complex environment of organizational variable interrelationships. Their higher significance on the management system makes them both important and sensitive. Other variables affect the system directly to a lesser degree, and indirectly through their interrelation with the most relevant three.

However, DB has been especially criticized by the public sector for practicing subjective evaluation, for requiring excessive resources, and for providing only limited accessibility to small and medium-sized contractors. In Korea, similar critiques have been raised, as these qualities have prevented public owners from benefiting from the potential advantages of DB. In order to address these challenging issues, the present research systematically analyzes the characteristics of the DB delivery system in Korea. Based on industry surveys and an extensive literature review, a qualitative system dynamics model is developed and used to propose and test hypothetical DB policy alternatives which are expected to enhance DB performance. Furthermore, after the appropriate customization processes, these research findings can also be applied to the industry settings of different countries.

Visual representations as 'artefacts of knowing'	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						artefacts and practice; situated knowledge in design; visual representations	KNOWLEDGE; OBJECTS	How does the manipulation of visual representations play a role in the practices of generating, evolving and exchanging knowledge? The role of visual representation in mediating knowledge work is explored in a study of design work of an architectural practice, Edward Cullinan Architects. The intensity of interactions with visual representations in the everyday activities on design projects is immediately striking. Through a discussion of observed design episodes, two ways are articulated in which visual representations act as 'artefacts of knowing'. As communication media they are symbolic representations, rich in meaning, through which ideas are articulated, developed and exchanged. Furthermore, as tangible artefacts they constitute material entities with which to interact and thereby develop knowledge. The communicative and interactive properties of visual representations constitute them as central elements of knowledge work. The paper explores emblematic knowledge practices supported by visual representation and concludes by pinpointing avenues for further research.

By providing new rail connections between London, Birmingham, and Manchester, this project is highly complex as it is embedded in a network of stakeholder relationships that may support or oppose the project. Data drawn from Twitter were analyzed using Social Network Analysis and inductive analysis of user profiles and content. Findings indicate that the majority of online stakeholders oppose the project and form stable clusters. Larger clusters within this network may attempt to deploy power directly in the form of a manipulation strategy, whereas smaller clusters may seek to ally themselves with more powerful groups, a pathway strategy. Overall, the methodology is a useful complement to existing methods and may provide real-time insights into the complex, evolving discussions around megaprojects.

The case study method is used to compare theory to reality from different perspectives, building explanations from a Spanish contractor observed over a three year period. Findings suggest that innovation management can be standardized, which leads to an organizational improvement for the company, and at the same time this improvement facilitates organizational problem-solving on a regular basis, increasing technical capabilities, knowledge management, business profit, and client satisfaction. The framework described in this research aims to provide guidance for managers, thus they can innovate in a systematic way; however, this exploratory study has still to be validated by empirical investigations on a larger scale through a significant number of certified companies, which is currently not yet the case in the Spanish construction industry.

Optimal Design of Bundled Layered Elastic Stress Wave Attenuators	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Layered structure; Wave propagation; Genetic algorithm; Optimization	REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; FLEXURAL DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION	This paper describes the development of new material architectures for mitigating the effects of impulsive loadings using layered structures. The underlying concept explored in this research relies on stress wave attenuation associated with geometric dispersion phenomena in layered structures. When an incident stress pulse passes through a layered structure, a reduced stress amplitude and elongated pulse duration can be obtained with proper selection of layer materials and dimensions. Consequently, an optimal design procedure is proposed to obtain effective material architectures. The optimization involves tuning material properties and adjusting the length of each layer, along with the total length of a multilayer structure. Attenuation of elastic stress waves propagating through the proposed simple and bundled one-dimensional elastic media are investigated by considering various layered structures situated between free and fixed surfaces.

Of these, only early supplier involvement was significantly related to the perception of an increased contribution by the supplier. In addition, we found that the supplier's contributions to product development had little practical influence on the overall project technical success. The findings suggest that more research is needed to understand how to use suppliers effectively to improve product-development outcomes.

J	Mohamed, S				Mohamed, S			Scorecard approach to benchmarking organizational safety culture in construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						safety; construction; bench marks; organizations		This paper promotes adopting the balanced scorecard tool to benchmark organizational safety culture in construction. It argues that this tool has the potential to provide a medium to translate the organization's safety policy into a clear set of goals across four perspectives: management, operational, customer, and learning. These goals are then further translated into a system of performance measures that could effectively communicate a powerful strategic focus on safety to the entire organization. Four perspectives have been developed to represent all stakeholders, thereby ensuring that a holistic view of safety is used for strategic reflection and implementation. The paper argues that by selecting and evaluating the appropriate measures, in each perspective, requirements can be identified, and actions to the identified goals can be aligned and facilitated. The proposed balanced scorecard approach should therefore enable construction organizations to pursue incremental safety performance improvements. Work-in-progress is briefly reported to give insight into the potential applicability of this approach.

These theories are important for many areas of study including the investigation of the hygrothermal performance of building envelopes. This paper highlights the difficulties of obtaining separate values for the material vapour and liquid transfer coefficients, a knowledge of which is essential if combined heat and mass transport models are to be accurately solved. The determination of these individual coefficients is not possible using existing measurement methods which enable only a total moisture permeability to be measured with the liquid and vapour flux components combined. The possibility of carrying out measurements under varying barometric pressures to obtain this data is investigated and experimental results using particle board as a test material are reported and compared with results from a previously developed analytical approach.

In a world where most mega infrastructure projects fail, the T5 project was not only on schedule, it was on budget. At its official opening by the Queen it was being trumpeted as the 21st century gateway to Britain. But Multiple problems emerged on the opening day culminating in the cancellation of numerous flights and thousands of lost bags requiring manual sorting before being returned to their owners. What should have been an occasion for celebration turned into a national disaster. Using accounts drawn from the media, from a House of Commons Transport Committee report and material from research into the construction phase of the project, this paper examines the episode via two theoretical lenses - normal accident theory and high reliability theory.

The perceived importance and distribution of basic research, precompetitive strategic research, and applied research within a corporate R&D portfolio are examined through a comparative analysis of survey data. The results suggest that Japanese firms tend to place great emphasis on basic and precompetitive strategic research, although applied research still retains its importance. They recognize that basic research is critical to achieve long-term competitive advantages in the marketplace. Australian firms also realize the importance of basic research and the use of portfolio approach in R&D management. However, research work in Australian firms tends to focus on applied research with only a limited involvement in medium- and long-term research. Finally, it is concluded that Japanese firms utilize a portfolio approach to corporate R&D management more systematically than do their Australian counterparts.

The analytic model and numerical analysis approach are used to compare solutions in the three scenarios. The results indicate that the optimal amount of shared knowledge and the optimal payoff under the CDMC are both the highest. Besides, the leader will offer part of the knowledge sharing cost for the follower if the leader gets more than one-third payoff of the system. Compared with the NCSC, the system payoff under the CSC increases greatly, which is much larger than the payoff increment from the CSC to the CDMC. Furthermore, empirical evidence on major findings are provided. This research contributes to the literature on knowledge sharing in joint ventures.

Entropy application to improve construction finance decisions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision making; entropy; financial management; fuzzy sets; weighing devices	FUZZY	In financial decision-making processes, the adopted weights of the objective functions have significant impacts on the final decision outcome. However, conventional rating and weighting methods exhibit difficulty in deriving appropriate weights for complex decision-making problems with imprecise information. Entropy is a quantitative measure of uncertainty and has been useful in exploring weights of attributes in decision making. A fuzzy and entropy-based mathematical approach is employed to solve the weighting problem of the objective functions in an overall cash-flow model. The multiproject being undertaken by a medium-size construction firm in Hong Kong was used as a real case study to demonstrate the application of entropy. Its application in multiproject cash flow situations is demonstrated. The results indicate that the overall before-tax profit was HK$ 0.11 millions lower after the introduction of appropriate weights. In addition, the best time to invest in new projects arising from positive cash flow was identified to be two working months earlier than the nonweight system.

Green Supply Management Strategies in Spanish Firms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environment; green supply management (GSM); Spain; sustainable supply chains	MEDIUM-SIZED SUPPLIERS; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; DRIVERS; COLLABORATION; CAPABILITIES; PRESSURES; ADOPTION; IMPACT	Although the literature on environmental sustainability is rapidly increasing, many studies suggest that this problem needs to be dealt with by considering a broader perspective, i.e., supply chains. In this paper, we put forward the idea that different practices for greening suppliers can be combined to shape different green supply management (GSM) strategies. More specifically, the following research questions are posed. 1) How do firms combine managerial practices to form GSM strategies? 2) What are the variables that affect this decision? 3) What are the results of the different GSM strategies? Drawing on a survey among Spanish firms, we performed a cluster analysis that identified three main GSM strategies. In the second step, we contrasted these clusters using environmental drivers, context, and performance variables. The results show that there are several approaches to "greening" the supply chain, with different results and company profiles.

A major barrier is that such, a CCR system must be relatively easy to access to ensure that (i) contractors' information is constantly updated (by contractors), (ii) contractors' performance is reported promptly (by project teams and occupiers), and (iii) the latest analyzed information is available to any authorized clients anytime anywhere. A centralized multiclient cooperative contractor registration (CMCCR) system is proposed using web-based technology, which provides a powerful communication medium with a high potential for satisfying the above requirements. The conceptual framework of the proposed CMCCR system is presented, and the concept is illustrated through a prototype based on information collected in Hong Kong. The initial observations indicate that web-based technology is suitable for the proposed CMCCR system, and that the development of a fully functional web-based CMCCR is both feasible and useful.

The shrinking product lifecycles and multitude of competing products emphasize the need for measurement of viral success. Current studies focus on a single measure and for only freely available online information. This paper develops a multimeasure viral phenomenon measurement methodology and empirically measures the robustness for tangible products (purchased with monetary value). The viral phenomenon factors of product performance and rate of growth are developed, taking four measures of virality, namely spikes, peak, magnitude, and exponential growth. Two products under the umbrella of Apple, namely iPod and iPad, are studied, using sales data and the related buzz created in social mediums like Twitter. The methodology successfully differentiates a genuine viral froma case of hype or popularity. New insights into iPod and iPad technology trajectory emerge as well.

Research shows that these teaching techniques are considered almost obsolete by a many students specially those who are visual learners or team workers. Also, the influence of visual and social media has changed student perceptions and how they expect the instructional materials to be presented in a classroom setting. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical tool that uses remote videotaping, augmented reality (AR), and ultra-wide band (UWB) locationing to bring live videos of remote construction jobsites to the classroom, create an intuitive interface for students to interact with the objects in the video scenes, and visually deliver location-aware instructional materials to them.

J	Simondetti, A				Simondetti, A			Computer-generated physical modelling in the early stages of the design process	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						computer; physical modelling; design process		This paper illustrates some of the opportunities arising from the introduction of computer-generated physical modelling(1) in the early stages of the architectural design process. The use of this technology in the design process differs from previous research and practise in that it looks at the use of computer-generated physical modelling recursively in design process rather than as a means to create a final presentation model [W.J. Mitchell, M. McCullough, Digital Design Media, Van Nostrand Reihnold, New York, 1994]. Previous research in the field by the author identified recursive strategy in the design process as the area in which computer-generated physical modelling offers unique opportunities to the designer. Three unique advantages in the use of computer-generated physical modelling technology are illustrated by three case studies. These advantages are: (1) understanding kinetic design, (2) understanding design involving complex geometry and (3) understanding design at the interface with the human body.

However, the existing techniques and algorithms only partially satisfy needs of complex environments (e.g. outdoor construction sites) mainly because of poor and/or unpredictably changing visibility conditions frequently encountered there (weather phenomena, mud and silt, partially buried objects, burst of intensive illumination, etc.). In this paper, we discuss principles of two methods that can significantly improve performances of vision system in such difficult conditions. The first method (based on gated imaging) is a specialized image acquisition technique while the second method addresses an important problem of object detection in complex environments. Both methods have been tested using images captured under visual conditions typically expected in such environments (e.g. many images are captured in high-turbidity water). The methods can be incorporated into more complex sensing systems, depending on needs and constraints of particular applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ESTABLISHING A COORDINATION SYSTEM FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ORGANIZATIONS BY SIMULATING HUMAN BODY CIRCULATORY SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coordination system; circulatory system; coordination needs and supply; construction projects	MEDIA RICHNESS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Construction projects are highly fragmented with many participants and activities involved during construction, so coordination is complicated and critical for project organizations. The physiological functions of the human body such as the circulatory system are natural and effective. This study established a coordination system for construction projects by simulating the circulatory system to improve work effectiveness. The contractor has to coordinate the owner and suppliers, that is, like the heart does to the brain and various organs. A procedure was also developed and illustrated through a case study to use the system practically. The contractor engineer acting as a receptor evaluates coordination needs derived from project uncertainty and equivocality and collect time spent on coordination with various parties. Coordination time or amount is adjusted when coordination supply does not meet needs. This procedure can be applied on construction project organizations to plan and execute coordination work.

However, little is known about the behavioral aspects of project managers' communication competency especially as they relate to crucial outcomes in virtual environments. This article reports on a survey-based research study of 564 respondents from the Chief Project Officer Web site that validates and extends a research model of project managers' competencies in decoding and encoding communication, the satisfaction and productivity of their team members, and the degree of virtuality present in the project. The findings indicate that project managers' competencies in decoding and encoding communication significantly contribute to team member satisfaction and productivity. In addition, geographic dispersion plays an unexpected and significant role in how project managers' competency in decoding and encoding communication impacts team member satisfaction and productivity.

J	Cooper, I				Cooper, I			The UK's changing research base for construction: the impact of recent government policy - Factors are identified which may destabilize the capacity and capability of the UK construction R&D base	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						R&D; research policy; research infrastructure; research funding; public policy; trends; privatization; UK		Recent government policy on construction R&D in the UK is presented as having been a contradictory amalgam involving, simultaneously, government intervention and disengagement. Confusingly, both parts of the policy appear to have been aimed at the same purpose - increasing the responsiveness of the sector's R&D activities to market forces. Given the noted reluctance of the UK's private sector to assume responsibility for such activities over the past two decades, there is little to suggest that this policy will prove successful. A more likely outcome, in the short to medium term at least, is that the speed and extent of apparent government retreat from funding could, in combination with other current changes, destabilize bath the capacity and the capability of Britain's construction R&D base.

What is missing is a sense of how the use of these 'things' is patterned across both industrial settings and time. This research addresses this gap with a particular emphasis on visual materials. Practices are analysed in two contrasting design settings: a capital goods manufacturer and an architectural firm. Materials are observed to be treated both as frozen, and hence unavailable for change; and as fluid, open and dynamic. In each setting temporal patterns of unfreezing and refreezing are associated with the different types of materials used. The research suggests that these differing patterns or rhythms of visual practice are important in the evolution of knowledge and in structuring social relations for delivery. Hence, to improve their performance practitioners should not only consider the types of media they use, but also reflect on the pace and style of their interactions.

The process equations have been obtained from an analysis of the partial equations of mass, electric charge, momentum, energy, and entropy inequality. The experimental testing reported is related to a theoretical model which determines changes of ion concentrations in the pore solution of the cover, as a result of the realkalization. On the basis of the test results, the process equations have been simplified and formally transformed into the form of an equation for the OH(-) ions flow, coupled with the Na(+) ions transport. By solving the converse problem of this equation, the determinant OH(-) ions electro-diffusion coefficient is calculated and then, after taking the experimental test results into account, its numerical values, the range of stable solutions and the influence of the process non-stationariness are determined.

Validation of IoT Infrastructure for the Construction of Smart Cities Solutions on Living Lab Platform	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Smart cities; Scalability; Technological innovation; Resilience; Protocols; Internet of Things (IoT); modularity; resilience; scalability; smart city		The use of Internet-of-things (IoT) applications (solutions) in the real world has increased exponentially. In smart cities, networked IoT devices are collecting data from the physical medium to optimize the decisions to improve city services to citizens. One way to evaluate this services solution is the use of the living labs, shown as a good option to evaluate previous real applications. However, when this is implemented in the real-world cases, most of them are no scalar to the complexity of the city. One of the factors is that it is assumed an IoT infrastructure designed to meet the properties of the scalability for a smart city. This article proposes a validation methodology for the scalability compliant infrastructure: modularity, interoperability, and resiliency properties. The proposed methodology is based on the best practices achieved during a living lab of the Smart Cities Innovation Center in the Universidad de Guadalajara implementation.

We, therefore, adopted a configurational approach and performed fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to a data set of 292 employees nested into 10 Chinese medium-sized firms. This inductive analytic approach enabled us to explore configurations of conditions of different levels of antecedents. Results identified four equifinal configurations of antecedents leading to knowledge hiding in project teams, in addition to six different configurations restraining this behavior, generating propositions to be tested by future research in a deductive manner. Our study may guide firms to better counteract and manage knowledge hiding behavior in teams by suggesting different pathways and solutions that can minimize knowledge hiding behavior among project team members.

This paper aims to develop a RMC assessment model for subway project contractors and to assess the current overall RMC of subway project contractors in mainland China. To achieve the objectives, a questionnaire survey was conducted and data were collected from 58 respondents. The empirical research findings showed that the overall RMC of subway project contractors can be regarded as between "low" and "medium". In addition, currently in subway projects' area, contactor's risk analysis capability is relatively more mature than other capabilities. However, contractors' risk management attitude is relatively less mature than other capabilities. Assessing the current RMC of subway project contractors can be used to identify the priority or weakest areas needed for improvement. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	MILLER, R; BLAIS, RA				MILLER, R; BLAIS, RA			MODES OF INNOVATION IN 6 INDUSTRIAL SECTORS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGIES	This paper examines patterns of innovation in 43 firms selected from six industrial sectors in Canada. The sample is representative of large, medium, and small-size firms and of sectors of varying degrees of R & D intensity, technological sophistication, sales performance, and innovativeness. The sectors are: 1) pharmaceuticals, 2) financial services, 3) software services, 4) pulp and paper, 5) metallic products, and 6) apparel. Modes of innovations were found to be differentiated and sector specific. Most firms innovate in predictable ways, according to the logic of innovation prevailing in their industrial environment. A few firms, however, seem to use modes of innovation copied from other industries. In addition to industrial context, modes of innovation are influenced primarily by the firms' competencies, business opportunities, and managerial preferences. A taxonomy of modes of innovation extending beyond industry lines is presented. Four configurations emerged from the data analysis: 1) science-based product innovators; 2) entrepreneurial fast-track experimenters; 3) global cost leaders; and 4) conventional reliance on information technology and process adaptation.

One each of 114 mm (4 in.) diameter standard dimension ratio (SDR) 17 HDPE pipe, 219 mm (8 in.) diameter SDR 17 HDPE pipe, and 324 mm (12 in.) diameter SDR 17 HDPE pipe were installed in a cohesionless soil medium. Various testing parameters were captured during the pullback phase of these three installations. These testing parameters consisted of utilizing pressure transducers to capture the pullback and rotational pressures on the drilling rig, installing linear potentiometers inside the HDPE pipe to measure the axial strain on the pipe, and applying an external load cell to quantify the loading on the pipe during the pullback phase. Comparisons of the pullback and rotational pressure on the drilling rig, loading on the HDPE pipe, and average and maximum strain experienced by the HDPE pipe are presented with respect to the installed pipe diameter.

Our laboratory is interested in "collaborative design" with designers, clients, and citizen. We discovered that there are two major problems, initiatives and timing, and have found new solutions using network technologies. This method have solved these problems, but we have found major problems in "collaborative design" that occur during many practical architectural design projects. This paper presents these problems and some of the solutions and research that our group has accomplished, or is pursuing, in the field of "collaborative design" using some of the latest technologies in hypermedium and networking. This paper presents the requirements for collaborative design system, the new technologies and the thought of system architecture, the prototype system in practical design project, and the evaluation of prototype system.

Today, the only approved way to assess such damage is the gravimetric Darr method, which is essentially destructive. Substantial progress has been made using the geophysical complex-resistivity method, which can be applied non-destructively and provides spatial information along two-dimensional sections, rather than punctual along one borehole. Considerable advantages of complex resistivity are its sensitivity to textural properties, as well as the pore-fluid chemistry of wet, porous media. In a comprehensive laboratory study, and later in field scale experiments, it could be shown that complex resistivity may even be able to distinguish between salt content and saturation degree in a single measurement. A comparison with complementary nondestructive testing techniques points to the benefit and further research to be explored in multimethodical approaches. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000053.

Research into high reliability organisations (HROs) has shown that it is possible to avoid, trap and mitigate the risks inherent in complex socio-technical systems. Studies of HROs originally focused on the operation of high risk technologies but have begun to explore other situations that present a similar need for reliable performance. One such environment is the IS programme. By comparing and contrasting the salient features of programme environments and HROs and presenting an in-depth case study with two embedded units of analysis (two troubled IS programmes), we aim to contribute to the ongoing debate about IS programme failure and to the theoretical development of programme reliability.

Since efficient debt markets depend upon banks' adequate knowledge to make investment decisions, the mechanisms by which knowledge is transferred become particularly salient. Using information richness and structural embeddedness theories, we examined knowledge transfer within this context. We used survey data from 914 firms and found a positive association between firms' use of rich communication modes with the bank and a banks' knowledge about the firm. We unexpectedly found no significant relationship between firms' assumptions of aligned self-interest and knowledge transfer to banks but did find a strong positive association between firms' relational trust in banks and knowledge transfer. We also found that as communication forms become richer, self-interest becomes positively associated with knowledge transfer while and relational trust has a weaker positive association with knowledge transfer.

Even though they are all capable of creating immersive digital worlds, the only one capable of merging the real world with a holographic 3D modelby letting the user interact intuitively and naturally with the project is MR. In this paper, 42 participants were divided into two groups and analyzed an original architectural renovation design. They assessed the effectiveness of design review using Mixed Reality (MR) versus traditional 2D methods. The results show that MR based design review can effectively communicate 85% of the information to the client versus 70% provided by 2D media. At the same time, it has the potential to enhance the client's comprehension of the aesthetic characteristics of materials, giving the possibility to replace physical samples during the finishing stage of construction.

However, little research has been conducted to explore the learning nature of RM from the perspective of contractors. Based on a longitudinal case study of three construction projects, this paper aims to present a holistic analysis on the RM learning process from the experience of a small-to-medium (SM) general contractor (GC) in China to explore the underlying facts determining the effectiveness of RM practices. It was found that a variety of causes led to rework in the three projects, which highlighted the importance to enhance GC's learning capacity to effectively reduce rework. A conceptual RM learning framework (CRMLF), which consists of people, approach, process, tool and project environment, was developed based on the analysis of influential factors of successful learning within the RM domain. This paper is valuable for practitioners and academics to understand the inherent nature of RM to continuously improve the project performance.

The model was used to identify and compare the level of safety perceived by Taiwanese construction managers including safety managers, contractor managers, public works managers, design and audit managers, owner audit and control managers, and others. Analysis reveals that safety managers have the highest perception of safety while owner audit and control managers have the lowest. Surprisingly, public works managers and design and audit managers have lower levels of perceived safety than do contractor managers. Apparently, reinforcing the perception of safety between these two types of construction personnel is important to reducing construction accidents in Taiwan.

J	Davidson, CH				Davidson, CH			Technology watch in the construction sector: why and how?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						innovation; public policy; R&D; SMEs; technology transfer; technology watch		'Technology watch', like 'innovation', is a process term. Large corporations in high-tech industries use technology watch regularly to facilitate the adoption of innovations, where it is associated with parallel 'watch' activities in social, legal and environmental areas. The information (yielded by technology watch) is either unrefined or refined to give it added value for decision making. The technology watch process involves steps of collection, analysis and dissemination, implicating a watch team and domain experts. In small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly in the construction sector, special problems arise because of the lack of interest in innovation and because of the shortage of resources, suggesting the creation of 'relay stations' in the technology watch process. Current changes in the organization of the construction process, however, are changing the industry's structure, suggesting that there may be a new need for the kinds of information that technology watch can provide.

J	Leglise, M				Leglise, M			Computer-stimulated design: construction of a personal repertoire from scattered fragments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7uropIA 98 International Conference - Cyber Design	NOV 25-27, 1998	PARIS, FRANCE			architectural design; interpretation; design learning		This paper describes some possibilities of creating and structuring a personal digital memory capable of facilitating architectural design and design learning. The raw materials of this memory are different representations that can be found on the Web. Having interpreted these representations. one is able to construct a meaningful memory, educated and personal, which can be called upon subsequently during the design phase, as long as one has a medium that can represent this memory and put it to good use. As a practical, effective application of this process, we will describe part of a configuration geared towards the learning of architectural design. This configuration is composed of various elements, precisely arranged in space and time in a set of interrelations and interactions. The design student is placed at the centre of the arrangement, from where he or she can call on a broad spectrum of possibilities from the Web as provider of image documents. When necessary, students can use specially developed software that allows them a verbal and pictorial interpretation stimulated during particular phases of the learning process. In this way, through pictorial material presented on the network, the students can build up a digital library appropriate to their own understanding of architecture and their own representation of the world. At this point, they can abandon the universe of digital documents and media and return to the world of materials and shapes in intensive design studio sessions, where slowly maturing ideas can at last find concrete form. Thus, we deal with the relationship between the public, shareable aspect of the documents, and the private aspect: the individual interpretation of these documents. In the same way, we show how, within the framework of the teaching programme that has been set up. and without interference, this relationship between public and private can be linked into a dimension of the work of learning which is at times personal, at times collective. The conclusion attempts to outline the issues raised by this sort of configuration, and to show how thoughtful use of computers and networks can stimulate and enrich design rather than just "aid" it, as is generally accepted.

We analyze institutional logics and work practices in a complex project, Lucca Comics & Games, which is the biggest festival dedicated to fantasy culture in Italy. Our results, based on archival research, media coverage and interview data, reveal the recursive interplay between institutional logics and work practices for institutional maintenance. We argue that the study of festivals is essential to understanding key aspects of project based organizing more generally. In this regard, the maintaining of institutions must be distinguished from stability or the absence of change and consideration of historical and contextual analysis, and multiple tensions that occur due to competing institutional logics can open up new ways of thinking for prospective research. We also demonstrate that future research can use institutional work practices for understanding institutional maintenance in recurring temporary organizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA.

Companies need to systematically analyze and interpret online commentaries to enhance in-house research and design activities. To this end, a framework is proposed using a design science approach to enable automatic analysis of the content of online opinions and comments in connection with specific products, using a web lexicon established for this purpose. Furthermore, this framework is applied to an automobile as a proof-of-concept. Several nicknames for the car brand studied were created by web users, some with irony and sarcasm. A few metaphorical expressions were also used to describe product features. Engineering practitioners should recognize the importance of stylized online expressions in order to have a better understanding of customer needs and expectations through the application of this framework, which incorporates an evolutionary web lexicon.

This investigation divides factors that affect truck dispatching of RMC plants into intrinsic and imposed constraints, where intrinsic constraints refer to limits that must be satisfied during the concrete distribution process; imposed constraints are those that should be fulfilled to the greatest extent possible during dispatching. The results will help concrete plant dispatchers of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) determine a cost effective and reliable day-to-day distribution scheme and achieve better customer service.

J	Pitts, A; Liao, HW				Pitts, Adrian; Liao, Hanwen			An assessment technique for the evaluation and promotion of sustainable Olympic design and urban development	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						environmental assessment; evaluation framework; Olympic Games; sustainable design; urban development		A response is presented to the dilemma of hosting resource-intensive large-scale sporting events at a time when requirements for sustainability and sustainable development must also be met. A framework was devised for judging development and design issues for future planning, one which is based upon extant historic evidence from host city experiences as well as previous event outcomes. It offers potential to compare plans against best/optimal practice. The technique for appraisal arises from a detailed analysis of Olympic Games held since 1896. Data associated with venue design, construction and usage, athletes' accommodation, and the facilities for officials, the media and visitors/spectators, were amassed and reviewed. An evaluation technique was produced which demonstrates how the organizers of a modern Olympic Games can assess and reflect upon planning, design and development decisions associated with their own city from an early outline stage. This should permit less wasteful, more appropriate and more sustainable Games' infrastructures to be considered before complex detailed development occurs.

J	Bin Ismail, ZA				Bin Ismail, Zul-Atfi			Improving contractor social networking on IBS infrastructure maintenance projects: a review	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Innovation; Technology; Integration	CONSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; BRIDGES; DEVICES; MEDIA	Purpose - A key factor adversely affecting contractor social networking performance is the improper handling and information management of contractor's services delivery on websites. Contractor social networking is particularly problematic on industrialised building system (IBS) infrastructure maintenance projects where contractor's certified quality product and firms are not matched with maintenance specialisation services. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reports on the early stages of research which is developing a new information and communications technology (ICT)-based approach to managing contractor social networking on IBS infrastructure maintenance schemes. As a precursor to this work, the paper reviews current contractor social networking websites practices on IBS infrastructure maintenance projects and explores the ICT tools and techniques currently being employed on such projects. Findings - The findings reveal the need for more sophisticated contractor social networking websites solutions which accord with the needs of IBS infrastructure maintenance schemes. Originality/value - The paper concludes by presenting a research framework for developing such a system in the future.

This work aims to study the influence of the nature of release agent and the quantity of fine elements on the chemical interactions at the concrete/oil/formwork interface. Five concretes were prepared at 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36% of paste to study the influence of paste volume on the friction between formwork and fresh concrete. The friction tests were performed using an apparatus which can reproduce the same conditions of construction sites. In addition, a physicochemical investigation was achieved to identify the effect of fine elements on the ability to form the interstitial mediums at the interface. The formation of soap in the vicinity of the formwork surfaces was also studied as a function of the content and the nature of oils. The results showed that the friction between fresh concrete and formwork depends on the pore solution content present at the interface.

J	BESSANT, J; RUSH, H				BESSANT, J; RUSH, H			GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF MANUFACTURING INNOVATIONS - 2 COUNTRY-LEVEL CASE-STUDIES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Note								It is generally recognized that some measure of state support for innovation is necessary in order to preserve a position of international competitiveness. During the 1980's, governments of most advanced industrial economies introduced a range of programs designed to facilitate the introduction of advanced manufacturing technologies. This paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of these policies from the literature on the transfer of technology and outlines the pattern of policy evolution that has occurred as policymakers have become more aware of the determinants of the diffusion process. The paper illustrates the principal features of typical government programs in Europe with case studies from the United Kingdom and (West) Germany. These cases are presented as a means of illustrating how different governments have translated basically similar principles into alternative policy mechanisms for promoting the transfer of technology. The paper argues for the continuing need for government support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for firms in more traditional sectors and concludes with some reflections on lessons learned during the 1980's that might usefully inform future policy development into the 1990's.

By anticipating scenarios such as a 'post-carbon' world and a 'pre-adaptive' landscape, it offers an alternative pathway to prepare for medium-term incremental and step changes. The focus is on the regional scale with a planning process to move from an unstable state (i.e. due to external impacts of climate change) towards a state of higher adaptive capacity. It increases the flexibility of spatial systems in two ways: assisting change in spatial land use over time; and catalysing the emergence of autonomous and more resilient developments. Swarm planning theory is used in two pilot designs and compared with regular planning processes. The results are presented in the form of new landscapes: the 'Zero-Fossil Region', where the design provides a spatial framework for a complete renewable energy supply, and the 'Net Carbon Capture Landscape', in which adaptation and mitigation strategies are designed to become carbon positive. The comparison illuminates the potential advantage of swarm planning to tackle climate change threats.

The collaboration framework incorporates a web collaboration service, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, a building blackbox system (BBS), a geo-database, and a geographic information system (GIS). Through the integration of these technologies, the framework provides a collaboration medium for first responders, including civil engineers, to cohesively respond to disasters. Access to critical building information, such as construction documents, through the BBS supports assessments of building integrity during disaster response. Building assessment information is stored on RFID tags, which are accessible to first responders through digital devices via a wireless ad hoc network. With on-site assessment information shown on a digital map, decision makers locate, collect, and distribute critical resources through the GIS to first responders. In addition, the decision makers at distributed locations evaluate the incident through discussion sessions, hosted by the web collaboration environment, for integrated decision making. Test-bed simulations for the framework have been carried out with encouraging results at the training ground of the Illinois Fire Service Institute.

The progress in China's development is considered in the context of energy efficiency in the built environment, including policy, technology and implementation. The key research challenges and opportunities are identified for delivering a low-carbon built environment. The barriers include the existing traditional sequential design process, the lack of integrated approaches and insufficient socio-technical knowledge. A proposed conceptual systemic model of an integrated approach identifies research opportunities. The organization of research activities should be initiated, operated and managed in a collaborative way among policy-makers, professionals, researchers and stakeholders. More emphasis is needed on integrating social, economic and environmental impacts in the short, medium and long terms. An ideal opportunity exists for China to develop its own expertise, not merely in a technical sense but in terms of vision and intellectual leadership in order to flourish in global collaborations.

South Africa has made housing a cornerstone of its social development policies, but there is significant dissatisfaction expressed by the residents of the housing schemes built to date. To address this, a small survey was undertaken to identify what established (existing) residents of low-cost housing in South Africa regard as important or of value. These established residents' views vary from other studies due to the ability to identify medium and long-term needs and problems. The survey identified nine concepts that can be used to evaluate housing scheme design using conjoint analysis or stated choice methods to quantify residents' values. Future quantitative research is suggested into the measurement of the requirements of residents. Development of econometric models of the already investigated urban form is advocated, along with the potential for 'densification' strategies to address some of the issues raised by residents.

However, bridge repair and rehabilitation needs far exceed the resources available to maintain them. Prediction of future bridge network conditions is essential to bridge asset management because it provides valuable information for budgeting and medium- to long-term planning. This paper focuses on the use of tensor factorization, an advanced data analysis approach, as a tool that can be used for both exploratory analysis and prediction of network-level performance of bridges in states across the United States. The network-level performance indicators in this work are defined as a percentage of bridges that are structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, or both. These indicators are calculated based on bridge areas and counts. The tensor decomposition approach decomposes multidimensional data into lower-order forms while preserving variation over time. Prediction of future bridge network conditions was done using the compressed time factor matrix, which yielded mean absolute error (MAE) values indicating promise for this new approach.

This study also verifies the influence of critical crowdsourcing project characteristics, such as project mode, project purpose, project type, and number of participants, on crowdsourcing project risks. On the basis of the quantitative data collected from 403 crowdsourcees and crowdsourcers through an online survey in China, results of cluster and multivariate analyses of variance indicate that the mean level of each risk dimension consistently moves with the change in cluster risk levels. Technical-related risks are more critical than social-related ones in crowdsourcing projects. Task risk is the most significant risk dimension. All risk dimensions (i.e., crowdsourcer, relationship, crowdsourcee, complexity, requirement, and task) are negatively associated with crowdsourcing project performance. Each risk dimension is considerably influenced by various characteristics of crowdsourcing projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Using interviews with five of the top 20 UK contractors and one medium-sized contractor, this study explored how main contractors manage the H&S influence of subcontracting with a focus on their in-house measures. Some in-house measures found are: restricting the layers of subcontractors on projects; working with a regular chain of subcontractors; implementing a H&S reward scheme for subcontractors; and insisting on non-working subcontractor foremen who have direct responsibility for the safety of workers in their trade. These measures appear to be influenced by clients, industry peer groups, and the moral justification for occupational H&S, and they offer inter-organisational learning opportunities for contractors in devising measures to mitigate the H&S influence of subcontracting. These findings should also allay concerns that removing some of the legislative hurdles in connection with ongoing red tape debate will result in poorer H&S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Multiple crews means that an activity can be performed simultaneously in several units by hiring additional crews, whereas fixed logic indicates that for each activity the units assigned to the same crew must be performed by a fixed construction sequence. Existing research works use heuristic methods to solve the problem without formulating an explicit model for further analysis. In this paper, we adopt the mixed-integer programming approach to construct an exact model. To handle large-size problems, an approximate model with reduced number of constraints and variables is further presented. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the exact model is capable of finding optimal solutions for medium-size problems in a reasonable amount of time, and the approximate model produces good feasible solutions for large-size problems in an accepted length of time.

Starting with the concept of growth and capacity underinvestment archetype, a new and operational systems thinking model is developed. The conceptual systems thinking model includes a set of causal structure that can explain various modes (including the growth and failure modes) of business performance of small and medium construction companies. Mainly the three components - projects, finance and capacity - and the understanding of their nexus (or causal inter-relationships) are found to be sufficient to reveal different performance modes in construction business. Further, the three operational aspects, namely, the business growth or decline process; the situation of financial and other capacity resource consumption; and the management of projects, finance and other capacity resources have been identified as the interrelated core and integral aspects of construction business. The three inter-related core aspects could actually include and explain different possible range of business situations, policies and practices in a construction company.

The peculiarities of microstructure changes in the fiber and castable matrix contact zone, channel formation, and changes of cold crushing strength of fiber additives, which have a refractory castable matrix under temperature treatment, were investigated. The investigation results allowed to predict that using a mix of fibers more effective than using them individually. The influence of fiber additives on the mechanical characteristics and thermal shock resistance of the refractory castable with fiber additives was tested. It was found that the addition of carbon fiber has a positive impact on the thermal shock resistance of the investigated castable, which is confirmed by the results obtained by thermal cycling, as well as by the values calculated for thermal shock resistance R-4 and R-st. In addition, the results of the investigation of thermal cycling show that the value of the thermal shock resistance was highest when a mixed fiber additive (CF+PP) was used.

Exploring Coordination Goals of Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coordination goal; Goal achievement; Coordination method; Replacement possibility	MEDIA CHOICE; DEVELOPMENT TEAMS; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; RICHNESS; DESIGN	Effective coordination has been regarded in both theory and practice as a critical factor of success in construction projects. Previous coordination studies have focused on the time spent on coordination, its frequency, and its relationship with performance. However, coordination goals have received less attention, and their relationships with coordination methods and performance are not known. This paper studies coordination methods and goals for construction projects to identify what coordination goals are adopted and to what extent goals are achieved. In the research process, eight coordination methods and six goals were derived. A questionnaire was designed accordingly and sent to seven contractors for survey. Follow-up interviews were conducted with three or four managers and engineers from each contractor. The analysis results indicate that most coordination methods have multiple goals; written coordination methods such as plans, schedules, reports, and contract documents tend to have appropriate goals; and projects performed well by using coordination methods effectively to achieve the coordination goals.

This research investigates the role of information quality in transitioning retail consumers to complete the purchasing process online, thereby replacing physical channels with online channels. This research makes three contributions: 1) it highlights the importance of information quality and its influence on a consumer's choice to use e-channels to purchase online; 2) it supports the premise that high-quality information can convert experience attributes into search attributes; and 3) it identifies four antecedents that increase perceived information quality: higher telepresence, screening capability, channel trustworthiness, and lower cognitive overhead. Data from 309 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling and regression. Implications and future research avenues are discussed.

Entropic Risk Analysis by a High Level Decision Support System for Construction SMEs	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Entropy; Risk	SELECTION; CRITERIA; MODEL; TIME	The method of entropy has been useful in evaluating inconsistency on human judgments. This paper illustrates an entropy-based decision support system called e-FDSS to the solution of multicriterion risk and decision analysis in projects of construction small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is optimized and solved by fuzzy logic, entropy, and genetic algorithms. A case study demonstrated the use of entropy in e-FDSS on analyzing multiple risk criteria in the predevelopment stage of SME projects. Survey data studying the degree of impact of selected project risk criteria on different projects were input into the system in order to evaluate the preidentified project risks in an impartial environment. Without taking into account the amount of uncertainty embedded in the evaluation process; the results showed that all decision vectors are indeed full of bias and the deviations of decisions are finally quantified providing a more objective decision and risk assessment profile to the stakeholders of projects in order to search and screen the most profitable projects.

Forty-five government and industry agencies associated with water security were identified. Existing WVA methodologies were compared to the EPA's six-step WVA guidance and an expanded version of the hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) framework for the hardening of water systems, a technique previously used for assessing vulnerability of infrastructure. Neither the AWWA Water System Security Field Guide, nor the Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment Guide for Small Drinking Water Systems were in complete agreement with the EPA's WVA guidance. Inclusion of HHM risk scenarios in the assessed methodologies ranged from 64 to 95%. Fifty-nine of the 112 HHM risk scenarios were not included in at least one, and 34 risk scenarios were not included in at least two WVA methods. No method emerged as a "best practice" technique for small and medium sized water systems. Consistent standards for WVA methods are needed.

In an attempt to enhance the general practice of layout planning of construction sites, the paper introduces a novel approach for producing the sought layouts. This approach integrates the highly sophisticated graphical capabilities of computer-aided design (CAD) platforms with the robust search and optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms (GAs). In this context, GAs are utilized from within the CAD environment to optimize the location of temporary facilities on site. The functional interaction between GAs and CAD and the details of the GA-based layout optimization procedure are presented. A fully automated computer system is further developed to demonstrate the practicality of the chosen approach. In order to evaluate the system's performance, a local construction project with a 24,000m(2) site is used. The automated system produced highly satisfactory results and showed notable flexibility through its CAD-based input/output media. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A great majority of construction SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are not familiar with risk assessment concepts and methods. In particular, SMEs are very likely to have difficulty finding the qualified personnel or time to carry out a proper risk assessment. The method introduced in this paper has some distinct features. The method introduces a new method of risk assessment, replacing the traditional definition of probabilities with control levels because they are easier to implement and yield more accurate risk scores. The method was practically applied on 22 construction SMEs. From the practical application, it was observed that the method was found to be user friendly and the SMEs found it easy to update their risk strategies during various construction stages in their projects. The proposed risk assessment method introduces a powerful and practical control level strategy which would develop a safer, healthier and more competitive workplace for construction SMEs.

The superstructure members have been represented by means of three-node isoparametric beam elements with three degrees of freedom per node. The soil mass is idealized by eight node isoperimetric quadrilateral element at near field and five node isoparametric infinite element to simulate the far field behavior of the soil media. The non-linearity of the soil mass has been represented by using the Duncan and Chang hyperbolic model. The applicability of this model was demonstrated by analyzing a single span IAB. This study has shown that the soil nonlinearity has significant effect on the response of the structure, where the displacement that have been obtained on basis of nonlinear analysis is 1.5-2.0 times higher than that obtained from linear analysis. The stress magnitudes in the nonlinear analysis are also higher where in some point the difference reached almost 3 times.	[Noorzaei, Jamaloddin; Abdulrazeg, Aeid.

J	Lowe, R				Lowe, Robert			Defining absolute environmental limits for the built environment	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; building sustainability assessment; environmental assessment; environmental performance targets		The question addressed is whether it is possible to define working limits on environmental impacts from the built environment in terms of global carrying capacity. The main focus is on energy-related impacts, since these are global and relatively well-understood. Four possible approaches to defining limits are explored: static equilibrium, asymptotic, integral of excess and planned future. The conclusions that emerge from this exploration are that global environmental constraints are very tight, but also that they are dynamically and strongly influenced by the trajectory of social and technological development over the coming century. Their use as the basis for practical, quantitative metrics of sustainability, therefore, involves a large measure of subjectivity. A fifth approach - the developmental approach - is identified, which instead of focusing on long-term external constraints to human activity, focuses instead on the internal, short-to medium-term dynamics of the built environment itself. It appears likely that the developmental approach, guided by qualitative conclusions from the analysis of global carrying capacity, is likely to be most fruitful.

In this paper, we argue that successful computer-mediated collaborative design (CMCD) does not necessarily mean emulating close-proximity environments. In order to investigate this view, we carried out experiments examining the effect and significance of different communication channels in collaborative sessions between architects. The experiments were conducted in different environments and classified into three categories. The first category is FTF. The second, CMCD sessions with full communication channels, CMCD-a. The third category was conducted also through CMCD sessions but with limited communication channels, CMCD-b. A custom coding scheme is developed using data, external and theoretically derived coding categories as a base. Examples of how the proposed coding scheme works are given from all three categories of experiments. The coding scheme provides the basis for modelling and understanding communication in collaborative design. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A functional architecture for an e-Engineering hub	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						collaborative project planning; e-Hub; e-Engineering services; workflow		Many Information Technology (IT) tools now exist to support collaborative working between engineering organisations. These often address operational issues rather than tactical or strategic issues. In particular, there are no effective tools for collaborative project planning between project partners. An electronic engineering hub (e-Hub) is considered useful in this regard. This paper presents the functional architecture of the e-Hub - a major research result of the EU funded e-HUBs project (e-Engineering enabled by Holonomic and Universal Broker Services). The e-HUBs project developed a universal collaboration platform for engineering outsourcing with focus on supporting collaborative project planning process. The e-Hub offers an extended set of functions to engineering service providers (mostly Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) such as application hosting and definition and development of collaborative engineering workflows. The paper discusses the theoretical background and the supporting technologies for the development of the functional architecture and presents the deployment of the engineering e-Hub prototype in a construction scenario.

Design/methodology/approach Information and communication technologies (ICT) developments for the construction industry are increasing the scope for more efficient planning and monitoring of refurbishment projects. The analysis is based on the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology model. After a short initial survey, a Swedish web/postal questionnaire has received 78 responses from refurbishment site managers, implying a 34 per cent response rate. Findings Managerial choices related to ICT depend more on perceived performance expectancy than on effort expectancy. Large projects and larger firms are associated with more extensive ICT use. Site managers see little need to link to refurbishment clients' ICT systems. Performance expectancy and age are found to influence ICT choices. Originality/value Much has been written about ICT support for new construction practices, but not much attention has been paid to refurbishment site managers' media choices.

A total of seven medium-scale RC beams without stirrups were constructed. The beams measured 150mm wide, 250mm deep and 1700mm long. The test variables included: three different longitudinal reinforcement ratios (0.91%, 1.21%, and 1.82%) and two different corrosion levels (3% and 10%). Four beams were subjected to artificial corrosion whereas three beams acted as control un-corroded. Following the corrosion phase, all beams were tested to failure in three point bending. Corrosion crack widths and cracking patterns were recorded at different stages of corrosion. The effect of different longitudinal reinforcement ratios on the rate of corrosion was observed. Test results revealed that the beams with higher reinforcement ratios experienced slower corrosion rate compared to beams with lower reinforcement ratios. All control beams failed in shear whereas corroded beams failed in bond. There was a significant reduction in the load carrying capacity of the corroded beams without stirrups compared to the control beams.

To find out, we analyzed 250 firms from four countries (Germany, Italy, Japan, and USA). We found the two factors to be complementary, i.e., both direct and interaction effects of speed and market knowledge on product success were found. In particular, the strong effect of market knowledge competence on product success is noteworthy because building market knowledge competence is a strategy that management can proactively utilize to cope with market uncertainty, which has been argued to moderate the time performance relationship in NPD. The implication is that both measures of effectiveness (matching needs) and efficiency (speed) need to be considered complementarily when managing for successful NPD.	[Johnson, William H.

J	Polesie, P				Polesie, Pim			The view of freedom and standardisation among managers in Swedish construction contractor projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction projects; Construction management; Freedom; Project processes; Standardisation		It has been suggested that standardisation improves productivity. Simultaneously, construction contractor project managers are given freedom to run projects as if they were independent firms. If this is a motivating factor for the managers, firms may have to find other ways to improve productivity than to increase standardisation to be able to stimulate their most skilled managers. It could prove important to recognise their need for freedom before they start looking for alternative places of employment. The purpose of this article is to inquire how standardisation may or may not conflict with contractor project managers' sense of freedom. Interviews with 15 contractor project managers from Swedish medium-sized construction contractor enterprises indicate that standardised processes do not necessarily conflict with their sense of freedom and work motivation as long as their ability to overview the production process is preserved. Based on the findings it is argued that standardisation should be implemented and developed with respect from top managers using a bottom-up approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Autonomous bucket-filling is an open problem since three decades due to difficulties in developing useful earth models (soil, gravel and rock) for automatic control. Operators make use of vision, sound and vestibular feedback to perform the bucket-filling operation with high productivity and fuel efficiency. In this paper, field experiments with a small time-delayed neural network (TDNN) implemented in the bucket control-loop of a Volvo L180H front-end loader filling medium coarse gravel are presented. The total delay time parameter of the TDNN is found to be an important hyperparameter due to the variable delay present in the hydraulics of the wheel-loader. The TDNN network successfully performs the bucket-filling operation after an initial period (100 examples) of imitation learning from an expert operator. The demonstrated solution show only 26% longer bucket-filling time, an improvement over manual tele-operation performance.

Therefore, research on permeable pavement, with the goal of reducing runoff, has been growing in popularity. This study uses experimental and numerical approaches in the hydrologic design of a permeable-pavement system. The concepts of fluid flow are used to represent water flow in permeable media, and a numerical analysis is used to solve the differential equation. Thickness and porosity are the main variables in the simulation. Using a time-space model, the study finds that varying these factors has a significant effect on the characteristics of water discharge, which is illustrated using a cumulative hydrograph. The relationship between base layer properties and the initial flow delay is linear while that between storage capacity and water loss is nonlinear. Finally, a mathematical function is generated from simulation results that represent the water flow conditions, given various base layer properties of the permeable-pavement system, and can be used as a predictive function.

Despite its practical relevance, solution methods to solve this problem are scarce in the literature. The proposed algorithms combine the flexibility of an activity with the flexibility of a resource to select the next activity to be scheduled. Several priority rules from the literature were tested, and the best heuristic was selected. The proposed heuristics' performances were compared with the mathematical formulation solved by an optimization software within a time limit, and the probabilistic constructive heuristic found optimal and near-optimal solutions for small instances. For medium and large instances, it obtained better results than the optimization model in about 20 times lower computational time. The heuristic was also compared with existing solution methods and was applied to a construction practical example, with good overall performance.

Recent efforts in producing learning objects that are reusable and sharable were not very successful due to the lack of interoperability between different learning systems. Semantic Web technologies together with ontologies provide rich medium for facilitating e-learning via the semantic annotated learning objects and shared repositories. However, Semantic Web technologies have not yet been applied widely to deliver learning objects. This paper introduces enabling technologies for developing next-generation learning object repository for construction. Semantic Web, ontology, reasoners, and associated technologies are discussed within the paper. This paper also demonstrates how the ontologies and Semantic Web technologies can be used to develop and deliver intelligent, sharable and dynamic learning objects. The paper also outlines the development of repository using the ontology-driven Semantic Web approach and discusses the construction education ontology and semantic databases. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Integrated Performance Assessment Model for Water Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Water networks; Performance assessment; Performance indicators; Performance index	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; DECISION-MAKING; INDICATORS; UTILITIES; PROJECTS; AHP; SUSTAINABILITY; RELIABILITY; SIMULATION	Most water distribution systems worldwide are deteriorating rapidly, while their rehabilitation costs are on the rise. Maintaining water networks in a proper condition under a tight budget puts extra pressure on municipalities and triggers the need for a proper performance assessment. This research therefore aims at developing an Integrated Water Networks Performance Assessment (I-WNPA) model to assess the performance of water networks. It also presents a functional (physical, operational, quality of service, and environmental) and global (or total) performance index scale of different performance states, the description of each state and recommended intervention actions (long term, short term, or immediate). The model encompasses three main phases for utilizing the fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) to calculate the weights of functional performance criteria of the components in the first phase. It also uses both the preference ranking organization method of enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and the simple multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) to compute the functional and global performance indices of the network components. Then, the probability-of-failure-based integration method is developed to integrate the component indices and to obtain the segment performance index (SPI). The topological clustering is adopted to integrate SPI to obtain the entire network index, using the topological chart of the network and the connectivity ranked matrix. In this research, data are obtained from questionnaires and case study databases. The proposed model is demonstrated via the data covering water subnetwork in the city of Montreal. The results are well aligned with Montreal water services assessment as follows: Excellent for 16 pipes and 49 accessories, good for 32 pipes, medium for 5 pipes and 8 accessories, and poor for 21 accessories. The results also show that the analyzed subnetwork is in a medium state. These results are used to identify and prioritize the most vulnerable components, subnetworks, or the entire network, and subsequently to identify the performance improvements required. The model can be linked to other models, such as rehabilitation planning and budget allocation. This approach suits any unidirectional (one-way flow) water network, and it can be adopted to support the performance assessment of any water network by considering hydraulic analysis and automation means. It can also be adopted by other infrastructure systems, such as sewer networks and subway systems, when suitable indicators are defined.

Both the companies and regulatory authorities consistently commit resources to improve their integrity management programs (IMPs) and safety culture maturity (SCM). Internal and external audits, public surveys, and benchmarking techniques are being used for discretely assessing both the IMPs and SCM. A novel risk-based benchmarking framework establishes logical relationships between IMP components and their contributions toward SCM attributes using failure mode effects analysis (FMEA). The framework evaluates 88 small, medium, and large-sized O&G companies operating in British Columbia (Canada) using the data from compliance audits for the period between 2011 and 2016. The results revealed that effective communication, updated protocols, and strict follow ups by the regulator with the operating companies improve both the IMP and SCM. The framework identifies the underperforming components for effective improvements and is a paradigm shift from the conventional twofold auditing process to a more efficient and time-saving practice.

The methodology can be readily applied to any country, region, or even the entire global construction sector. Findings indicate that companies from Western EU countries have higher ROE compared to companies from Eastern EU countries, but the latter offered higher ROA. Inverse of short-term debt has a high explanatory capacity in the long run. Investment productivity and labor productivity are also instrumental in explaining the variance of inverse of long-term debt. These findings indicate that companies should increase their productive investments when faced with a crisis. The majority of findings are consistent with recent research. The results are important for academics, investors, and managers because knowledge about variables, factors, and mutual influences allows better forecasts and better short-term and medium-term actions and strategies.

In this study, we use an extensive state-of-the-art method to clarify the BIM adoption process and the factors that can influence the success or failure of BIM adoption, particularly during the implementation stage, which are not frequently found in the literature. As an innovation, the lexical field allocated to the spread of innovations is assigned to BIM (diffusion, adoption, and implementation). After recalling the definition of relevant terms and then removing the resulting inconsistencies in vocabularies, we investigate various studies to identify factors that influence BIM adoption and then unify all these studies in one coherent and consistent BIM adoption process model. We focus on factors that play a role in the adoption of BIM in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because SMEs constitute the majority of companies in the construction sector. This research highlights and intends to fill in some gaps found in the current BIM adoption literature.

Addressing Sustainability in Benchmarking Framework for Indian Urban Water Utilities	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SERVICE; QUALITY	Studies on benchmarking in water sector are very scarce particularly in the Asian region. None of the studies conducted so far have estimated and aggregated multidimensional performance of urban water utilities that incorporate important sustainability parameters. This paper attempts to fill this gap and evolve suitable sustainability based benchmarking framework to assess aggregate efficiency of 18 Indian urban water utilities using data envelopment analysis approach. The proposed benchmarking framework may be used by the state regulator/operator to rank the utilities, set targets for productivity improvements, and provide performance linked incentives in order to enable sustainable water supply services. The performance analysis of water utilities against the six identified sustainability parameters based on average technical efficiency scores suggests the need for greater attention toward service adequacy, service reliability, and business viability parameters. The analysis on aggregate technical efficiency (TE) and scale efficiency (SE) suggests significant scope for improvement in technology and operational scale and hence cost savings. The study also shows significant scope for reduction in unaccounted for water, i.e., water loss, staff size, and electricity expenditure. Efficiency analysis based on city sizes presents higher TE for medium-sized utilities and higher SE for small-sized utilities.

J	Gluch, P; Raisanen, C				Gluch, Pernilla; Raisanen, Christine			Interactional perspective on environmental communication in construction projects	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						communication; construction projects; engagement; environmental information; mediators; social context; workplace effectiveness		Drawing on theories of social interaction, a critical discourse analysis approach is used to examine the resources and constraints on environmental-communication practices in four construction projects in Sweden. The assumption is that talk and action work together to construct, maintain and change organizational structure, social practices, and contractual arrangements. The empirical data were collected through in-depth interviews and field observations where photo documentation was extensively used. The study showed mismatches between information and action, both within the project and between the project and its stakeholders. The mismatches were not caused by a lack of information, but rather by inconsistencies between the communication cultures, the status of the communicator, and the tools used to mediate the information, e.g. the media, discourses and genres used. These discrepancies resulted in a lack of engagement in environmental work in the projects. If environmental and other performances in construction projects are to be improved, more effort needs to be exerted on understanding the dynamics of the social context, human interaction, and the mediating tools used to communicate. This paper suggests an approach that can enhance such an understanding.

Moreover, customers are demanding more value from their suppliers. The management of a project portfolio and the corresponding customer relationship portfolio implies a link between PPM and relationship management. By combining the fields of PPM and marketing, this study hypothesizes a connection between relationship value and project portfolio success. Because both parties need to extract value from a relationship, relationship value is divided into relationship value for the customer and relationship value from the customer. The results are based on a cross-industry sample of 174 German, Swiss, and Austrian medium-sized and large companies and rely on two informants from each firm. We find a significant relationship between relationship value and project portfolio success as well as moderating effects of portfolio interdependency, portfolio size, and technological turbulence.

For each specific project, the system creates an organisational document structure to be downloaded to the stakeholders' PCs or servers and also to the web-based project management system (WPMS) that is being used to manage the entire project. A survey was conducted in Spain to define new user requirements in which the need for set rules on how to organise all the information related to a project was identified. The survey revealed that SMEs need to improve document management for large-scale projects. Based on the requirement studies, a concept model of information flow was developed and implemented in a web-based tool designed according to current standards and theories of classification and organisation of information related to construction. This system was evaluated by an independent panel of experts: academics, construction company representatives and software vendors. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The aim of the study was to identify the nuances associated with the dominant health and safety management systems within these organizations and to categorize them into types. A qualitative descriptive research methodology was adopted, and data was collected through semistructured interviews involving safety managers, health and safety (H&S) advisors at employers' associations, and consulting firms. An analysis of the data revealed that the broad spectrum of health and safety management systems within contractor organizations in South Africa can be categorized into three distinct types. Defining features of the three HSMS types across three thematic areas were distilled. The position of the health and safety professional, legislative requirements, supply chain demands, and subcontracting practices of the organization are identified as factors that shape each HSMS type to varying degrees. The categorization and characterization outcomes of this study enables a subsequent objective evaluation of effectiveness and provide explanations for successes and failures of construction HSMS.

The rate of fatalities, however, has recently increased. Human factors, like fatigue, strongly relate to fatalities. The prediction of fatigue would allow for an early intervention, thus mitigating safety risk. The literature suggests several potential predictors of fatigue onset; however, each of these was mainly studied in isolation, in laboratory settings, and their predictive validity in the construction industry remains unknown. The authors hypothesized that a set of measurable factors can predict construction worker fatigue. A field study of 252 US construction workers was conducted in which potential predictors and fatigue levels were assessed, and the first fatigue predictive models for construction workers were created. The models presented low to medium predictivity, demonstrating that laboratory research and results obtained from other occupations do not directly apply to the construction industry. Furthermore, fatigue predictive models showed to differ among trades. These models will serve the industry to better manage fatigue; however, further research in this area is needed.

BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						communication; diffusion; environmental behaviour; `green' building; knowledge exchange; professional magazines; trade magazines; Sweden	ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; COMMUNICATION; BEHAVIOR; COVERAGE; ATTITUDE	The influence of the media is explored in terms of what images of 'green' building are mediated to practitioners by Swedish construction trade magazines. These textual images may influence practitioners' knowledge and values about green building as well as their motivation for complying with pro-environmental behaviour. A quantitative content analysis and a qualitative textual analysis of 1324 articles were undertaken. Findings show that 'green' building is often presented in general terms using abstract nomenclature characterized by indistinct and ambiguous terminology. The majority of trade magazine articles transmit information that lacks objectivity and critical reflection, thus reinforcing the idea that environmental challenges could be solved by technical solutions and/or controlling measures. Moreover, the protection of the natural environment is rarely referred to as a motive for proenvironmental behaviour. Consequently, since practitioners are not encouraged to problematize environmental aspects, they may end up accepting the simplified version presented to them by the trade press. A link is established between trade magazines' conveyed image of 'green' building and possible implications on practitioners' actual environmental behaviour.

Hybrid ANN-CBR model for disputed change orders in construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction management; litigation; disputes; change orders; AI; ANN; CBR	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM	The purpose of this paper is to provide a method that can be used to solve potential lawsuit problems caused by change orders in construction projects. A hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, the Hybrid ANN-CBR Model (HACM), is developed utilizing the AI branches of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR). The research is based on the litigation archives collected by the Supreme Courts and appellate courts in 48 states and one district of the USA. The accuracy of the HACM prediction rate reaches 84.61%, not only for predicting litigation likelihood by using the ANN approach but also utilizing the CBR approach to yield warnings and display litigation information related to past cases. After evaluating 31 cases it is confirmed that the model HACM performs well especially for those medium sized construction projects. it can be concluded that it is feasible to link ANN and CBR together to provide a tool with a relatively high rate of prediction accuracy and a conceptual model to solve potential severe disputes cased by change orders.

J	Sadek, S; Iskander, MG; Liu, JY				Sadek, S; Iskander, MG; Liu, JY			Accuracy of digital image correlation for measuring deformations in transparent media	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SOILS; MECHANICS; SILICA; SAND	Experimental models to measure spatial deformation patterns within a soil mass are typically limited by the fact that soil sensors do not provide a continuous image of the measured continuum. Additionally, soil sensors exhibit static and dynamic characteristics that are different from those of the surrounding soils and therefore can change the response of the measured continuum. The fundamental premise of this research is that transparent synthetic soil surrogates can be used to overcome these difficulties using digital image correlation (DIC). A system consisting of a laser source and a line-generating lens was used to optically slice the transparent synthetic soil models. A digital camera was used to capture images of the slices before and after deformation. This paper presents a new technique for quantifying spatial deformation throughout transparent synthetic soil models using DIC. The accuracy of the DIC technique was evaluated based on a scheme of predefined digital movement of synthetic soil images. Finally, a model consisting of a strip footing on a synthetic transparent soil is presented. The spatial deformations in the model are evaluated using the proposed DIC methodology and compared with the result of finite-element analysis.

However, deepwater hydrocarbon exploration in China started late and mainly concentrated in the South China Sea (SCS) with low level of researches. Although there are some achievements, there are even more challenges. For this reason, this paper reviewed the history of deepwater exploration in China Seas and summarized the current exploration situation. The future directions of deepwater hydrocarbon exploration mainly consist of five aspects: establishing key technology system of complex structure and reservoir seismic acquisition and processing in deepwater areas of SCS, clarifying the development mechanism of high quality source rock and establishing matching assessment technology, studying the formation conditions of favorable reservoir and creating reservoir identification technology, improving accumulation theory of large and medium-sized oil and gas field of deepwater, deepening the researches of petroleum geology conditions of middle and south part of SCS. Simultaneously, the concept of portfolio should be utilized in the exploration process, with economic benefits considered. These understandings will help guiding the future deepwater hydrocarbon exploration in China Seas.

These factors were evaluated in this Study by surveying the executives in charge of international construction of large United States based contractors. The information was collected by means of two rounds of a Delphi survey, the results of which were used as input in an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The findings indicate that track record, specialist expertise, project management capability are the most important company strengths; loss of key personnel, shortage of financial resources, and inflation and currency fluctuations are the most important threats relative to international markets; and increased long term profitability, the ability to maintain shareholders' returns, and the globalization and openness of the markets are the most important opportunities available in international works. This study is of relevance to practitioners as it systematically highlights the factors that affect international construction for the benefit of executives of medium-to-large size construction companies who are considering expanding into overseas markets. It is of relevance to researchers too as it demonstrates the successful use of the combined Delphi and AHP.

It uses major electrical power outages as the context for understanding how extreme events (within or external to the power system) lead to failures of other infrastructure systems, given a major electrical power outage. The paper takes an empirical approach by examining the patterns of IFIs that occurred in three kinds of events: the August 2003 northeastern North American blackout, the 1998 Quebec ice storm, and a set of three 2004 Florida hurricanes. Data sources include media reports and official ex post assessments of the events. The results characterize IFIs in terms of the sectors affected, and the consequences for society. We developed scales to characterize the consequences of IFIs in terms of impact and extent indices. A comparison is provided of IFIs arising in all five events discussed in the paper, as a basis for considering priorities for risk mitigation. The most significant IFIs in all five events included effects on HVAC in buildings; effects on water systems; effects on health systems, including hospitals and public health efforts, and effects on road transportation systems.

Complementarities Between Advanced Manufacturing Technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT); complementarity; supermodularity	SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; ADVANTAGES; SYSTEMS; ISSUES; FIRMS	During the past decade, manufacturers have invested heavily in the use of advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTS). The results of these investments have been mixed, as some organizations have seen significant returns while others have experienced major problems in implementation. As yet, the returns and complementarities between AMT have not been determined. Using complementarity assumptions developed by Milgrom and Roberts [P Milgrom and J. Roberts, "Rationalizability, learning, and equilibrium in games with strategic complementarities," Econometrica, vol. 58, no. 6, pp. 1255-1277, 1990.], [P Milgrom and J. Roberts, "Complementarities and fit - strategy, structure, and organizational-change in manufacturing," J. Accounting Economics, vol. 19, no. 2-3, pp. 179-208, 1995], combined with the Survey of Advanced Technology in Canadian Manufacturing (a comprehensive AMT survey), a model of manufacturing plant productivity was developed. Constrained regression analysis reveals that the effective use of AMT depends on the types of AMT used in combination and that analysis done with a high level of aggregation of either size classes or industries will result in ambiguous conclusions. Insight into the impact of complementarities on optimal AMT adoption strategies is provided through solution lattices for medium plants and the vehicle industry.

The study reported in this paper is part of a large-sample survey examining the acquisition and management of telecommunications technology by small and medium sized organizations. Three important sectors-public administration, financial services, and manufacturing-are compared in this study with respect to their telecommunications acquisition practices. The three sectors are compared on a number of variables pertaining to the role and management of telecommunications technology, the process of acquiring telecommunications technology, and the outcome of this process. Findings indicate that information technology plays a more important role in the service-oriented sectors than in manufacturing. The acquisition process for telecommunications appears to be more elaborate in the public sector organizations than in private firms. In a relative sense, public sector and financial service organizations are more likely to opt for service solutions for their telecommunications needs as compared to manufacturing organizations that rely mainly on equipment-based solutions.

The Dissemination Project employs a workstation specially designed to focus on four weather hazards: flash floods, fire danger, severe weather, and disruptive winter storms, The system uses high-resolution weather data sets produced by analysis and prediction models, as well as the WSR-88D radar, which provides mesoscale derail about rainfall distribution that is mot available from rain-gauge networks. Specific to the workstation is MeteoAssert, a subsystem that extracts weather assertions from gridded dal-a using territory, time, and parameter models and organizes them into descriptions-coherent chunks of related assertions. Both the original data sets and the assertions are visualized on different media: images, maps, graphs, tables, text, and sound, The first application developed on the workstation was the Basin Rainfall Monitoring System, designed to assist emergency managers in evaluating flash-flood situations.

However, the available area for exploration is diminishing and the cost of exploration is rising. The field changes and ever increasing difficulties of exploration bring new challenges technically and economically. Therefore, for effective exploration of shallow-water oil and gas in offshore China, it is necessary to center on the general requirements of becoming a powerful marine country and the ideas of value exploration, initiate key research projects in the fields of China's offshore stratigraphic-lithologic reserves, Paleogene reserves, buried-hill reserves, high temperature and pressure reserves and hydrocarbon-rich sags, and form geological theories and explorative technologies of large and medium size oil and gas field in offshore China. The measures regarding the challenges include: (1) Innovating theoretical understanding and optimizing new exploration fields, (2) developing technical capabilities and improving the success rate of exploration, and (3) enhancing management level and deepening value exploration.

Even though it encompasses the approach for assessing sustainability adopted by the Spanish Structural Concrete Code (EHE), the model can also be applied to concrete structures designed according to other structural codes. The EHE model serves to estimate the Structure's Contribution to Sustainability Index (ICES) and constitutes the first sustainability model included in a structural code. The ICES crisp model is inadequate in terms of managing the structural sustainability objective of medium and high uncertainty projects. In such cases, a method not only has to assess the potential sustainability index at the end of the project, but also the degree of uncertainty affecting compliance with the sustainability objective laid down by the client or promoter. The paper compares this model with a Monte Carlo simulation method conceived for the same purpose. The fuzzy method could be a better solution in specific cases of limited time or budget for creating the model.

Intelligent navigation aids are needed if designers wish to access the information they generate with ease. We present a comprehensive approach to support information navigation in requirement-driven generative design systems, which gain their power form explicit representations of design requirements, which in turn add to the information generated by the system. Our approach takes into account studies dealing with human spatial cognition, wayfinding in physical environments, and information navigation in electronic media. We structure the information to be accessed in terms of a five-dimensional design space model that applies across generative design systems of the type considered here. The model structure supports basic generic navigation operations along its five dimensions. We validated the model in the context of the SEED-Layout system and used it to extend the built-in navigation tools of the system through novel ones, which we subjected to a limited usability study. The study suggests that these tools have promise and warrant further investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, this research develops a dynamic physical model system for volume simulation of buildings or a city based on 3D digital models. The developed system consists both of a hardware module which packed 105 (15 x 7) lifting rods into a grid and a software which calculates the height of each rod from the 3D data and controls lifting the rods. Each rod represents the minimum representation unit. The height of rods could be changed individually by stepper motors. Using the prototype system for various case studies, physical urban models of several scales could be rapidly produced from 3D digital data within an acceptable error range. The potential of the proposed approach for real-life design scenarios was explored, and the proposed approach was proved as feasible and effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact Assessment and Remediation Strategies for Roadway Construction in Acid-Bearing Media: Case Study from Mid-Appalachia	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Highway and road design; Highway and road construction; Mine wastes; Remedial action; Watersheds; Water chemistry; Water resources		The likelihood of encountering land impacted by current and/or historic coal mining activities is high when constructing roadways in the Mid-Appalachian region. Through additional disturbance of these lands, environmental impacts Such as acid and dissolved metals loading and subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna will ensue. Consequently, it is necessary to affect a paradigm shift in roadway design and construction to account for the presence of factors that compound the already difficult task of working in a region characterized by steep topography and aggressive geochemistry. In this study, assessments of the water chemistry and biological impacts of a waste pile containing spoils from previous mining and the presence of an exposed coal mine bench were made as representative microcosmic examples of typical conditions found in the region. Based on quantitative measurements of water quality and biological conditions, recommendations are presented for the assessment and avoidance of impacts prior to construction through acid-bearing materials and suggestions are offered for postconstruction remediation at previously impacted sites.

Representatives from 75 companies were interviewed. Survey data were analyzed through 56 items, grouped into three sub-categories of intellectual capital: human capital, structural capital, and relational capital. This study provides insight into how the fruit industry in a developing country perceives intellectual capital and demonstrates the use of developed models from other industries in the food industry. The novelty of this approach was the dimension reduction of intellectual capital factors into two distinct directions, namely, customer quality' and stakeholder quality', confirming quality as a dominant basis for both customers and stakeholders. Micro companies and non-certified companies are focused on customers, while medium-sized and certified companies are focused on satisfying requirements from all stakeholders. This study provides insight for engineering managers engaged in using intellectual capital models in the food/fruit industry. The presented model explores the potential of intellectual capital in determining quality improvement opportunities and improving company performance.

However, allocating limited renewal funds among numerous asset components represents a complex optimization problem. Earlier efforts using genetic algorithms (GAs) optimized medium-sized problems, yet exhibited steep performance degradation as problem size increased. In this research, data compression is first used to cluster and abstract the large data of a network-level problem. Optimizing compressed models, however, did not result in high quality solutions. To address large size problems, a GA with segmentation approach was introduced. Segmentation breaks down a large-scale network-level problem into segments, allocates budget based on the relative criticality of the segment, and combines the results of all segment optimizations. The proposed GA with segmentation mechanism has been tested on different sized problems and was able to optimize very large problems with no performance degradation. The proposed GA with segmentation method is simple and logical; furthermore, it can be used on variety of asset types to improve fund allocation for infrastructure renewal.

Empirical Study to Investigate the Difficulties of Implementing Safety Practices in the Repair and Maintenance Sector in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Accidents; Injuries; Occupational safety; Hong Kong	DELPHI; WORK	Repair, maintenance, minor alteration, and addition work (RMAA) has become more and more important in developed societies, but its safety performance is alarming. For example, RMAA projects accounted for 53.2% of the total construction market and the percentage of RMAA accidents to all construction accidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) increased considerably in 2007. The RMAA sector has a huge potential for safety improvement. This study aims to explore and evaluate the difficulties of implementing safety practices in RMAA work. The mixed methods approach was adopted, and semistructured interviews and a two-round Delphi survey were conducted for the data collection. Major difficulties were identified, including limited safety resources for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), difficulty in changing the mindset of RMAA workers, and difficulty in performing safety supervision. These obstacles for implementing safety practices in the RMAA sector, if successfully removed, could significantly improve the safety performance of the RMAA sector and the construction industry as a whole.

J	Hao, HY; Wang, Y				Hao, Haiyan; Wang, Yan			Assessing Disaster Impact in Real Time: Data-Driven System Integrating Humans, Hazards, and the Built Environment	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Crisis informatics; Disaster impact assessment; Resilience; Real-time data analytics; Geovisualization	SOCIAL MEDIA; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Current disaster impact assessments are conducted within days after an event and usually with limited workforce and resources. Although many recognize the valuable information attainable in this way, the evidence is likely to be disturbed, and collecting information rapidly is critical for timely disaster response. Many proposed approaches use either physical- or social-sensing data, and are not implemented in real time, and therefore cannot assess disaster impacts holistically and timely. It also is challenging to integrate multisource data with disparate data modalities and resolutions, and to accommodate large-volume, high-rate input data for real-time computations. Therefore, we propose an assessing disaster impact in real-time (ADIR) system which harnesses cutting-edge computation and geovisualization platforms. ADIR processes heterogeneous data for humans, hazards, and built environments, and outputs multiscale disaster impacts. The usefulness and effectiveness of ADIR were demonstrated in the city of Houston, which was affected by Hurricane Harvey. ADIR provides a platform for multiagent coordination during community response and recovery, which contributes to more-resilient communities by potentially reducing life and property losses.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate how small, medium and large urban construction projects perform in terms of cost and time. Moreover, different types (road or building) and nature (new or renovation) of construction projects are considered in this research. This study looks at the urban construction projects in Karaj, the capital of Alborz Province, Iran. In this study, 72 urban construction projects are surveyed by reviewing their documents and their real performance. To analyze the collected data, the statistical analyses including class range analysis, independent-sample T-test and correlation analysis are used. This study shows that large urban construction projects are faced higher cost overruns and delay. Moreover, the time- and cost-performance of the new-build projects in overall is better than renovation projects. Furthermore, the cost-performance of urban road projects is better than building projects. The findings offer descriptive statistical cost and time performance information to support realistic time and cost estimation in urban construction projects.

The prediction process usually consists of classifying sections into families and then developing prediction curves or models for each family. Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning algorithms, provides a medium to investigate techniques that address these management concerns. This paper presents a two-stage model to classify and accurately predict the performance of a pavement infrastructure system. First, sections with similar characteristics are classified into groups using a support vector classifier (SVC). Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) uses the classification results from the first stage in addition to other performance-related factors to predict performance. A case study using the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnRoad) test facility database shows that the proposed model is a good classification decision support system, has better prediction results than the single-stage RNN model, and captures all underlying effects of the different variables. The significance and a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters are also presented. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Guler, M; Edil, TB; Bosscher, PJ				Guler, M; Edil, TB; Bosscher, PJ			Measurement of particle movement in granular soils using image analysis	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The flowing behavior of granular soils in the form of localized deformations and shear bands is a difficult phenomenon to define explicitly in the modeling of soil-structure interface problems. However, for development of accurate numerical solutions for these problems, an estimation of particle movements is important in determining the nature of displacement fields within the granular media. Video images from direct shear tests were used to capture the movement of individual grains relative to the movement of a ribbed structural surface. Two different algorithms have been developed to determine particle displacements in an image sequence of the interface during a direct shear test. BMAD employs a block-matching algorithm using unit patterns of images to determine two-dimensional particle displacement vectors. MATCH, on the other hand, computes displacements based on centroid locations of segmented particles that are matched using a four-level filter algorithm in successive image frames. Measured hardware dependent noise was reduced during image acquisition by means of a frame averaging technique implemented in BMAD. BMAD was successfully employed to determine particle displacements in Ottawa sand images obtained during shearing on a ribbed surface. The results were verified with MATCH using the same image frames.

In decreasing the numbers of safety incidents, society's perception of construction workers, who are the central part of the occupational health and safety issue, can be an important learning tool for these workers in terms of self-criticism. Therefore, society's perception of the responsibility of workers for occupational health and safety is presented by means of cartoons. For this objective, seven cartoons exhibited in the International Construction Accidents Cartoon Contest held in Turkey are examined through the General Theory of Verbal Humour, a semiotic analysis method. As the main finding, construction-based occupational health and safety perceptions of countries were found not to change significantly. Consequently, these results can have a function in guiding workers and worker unions to revise and manage the general perception of society about them. Moreover, such cartoons can be used as a lingua franca for occupational health and safety training in international construction projects where multinational migrant workers are employed.

J	BETTS, M				BETTS, M			SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PROJECT-MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								There is increasing evidence that the nature of corporate planning in business is moving toward external strategic concepts of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). There is some evidence that this is beginning to happen in the larger contracting and development enterprises in construction. The construction sector in most economies is still largely dominated by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). There has been little evidence of SCA being applied by SMEs. It is argued by some that such concepts are inapplicable to the SME segment of the construction industry. This case study documents the results of a strategic-planning workshop undertaken for an Australian project-management consultancy. The paper describes the background to the company and gives full details of the strategic-planning discussions and assessments made. These resulted in a business strategy being identified. The extent to which this strategy was implemented and whether it resulted in an SCA for the company is considered in light of events at the strategic-planning session. The result is a detailed example of the way that strategic-planning concepts can apply at the SME level and an evaluation of the extent of their success in implementation.

In a sample of 749 publicly traded U.S. manufacturing firms from 2003 to 2012 and using 2008 as the recession year, we find that for LMT firms, while the newness of operational assets or operational hedging has no effect on the market value (Tobin & x0027;s Q), increasing the production efficiency limits the decline in the market value. Conversely, for high-tech firms, the newness of operational assets has a negative influence, increasing the production efficiency has a positive influence, and operational hedging has no influence on the market value. The findings provide a much-needed understanding of the value of operational response during the 2008 recession.

As one of the important functions of management decision-making, evaluation has been given more functions and application space. Exploring the applicable evaluation methods in the big data environment has become an important subject of research. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview and discussion of systematic evaluation and improvement in the big data environment. We first review the evaluation methods based on the main analytic techniques of big data such as data mining, statistical methods, optimization and simulation, and deep learning. Focused on the characteristics of big data (association feature, data loss, data noise, and visualization), the relevant evaluation methods are given. Furthermore, we explore the systematic improvement studies and application fields. Finally, we analyze the new application areas of evaluation methods and give the future directions of evaluation method research in a big data environment from six aspects. We hope our research could provide meaningful insights for subsequent research.

J	Derakhshan, R; Mancini, M; Turner, JR				Derakhshan, Roya; Mancini, Mauro; Turner, John Rodney			Community's evaluation of organizational legitimacy: Formation and reconsideration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Local community; Legitimacy; Organizational behaviour; Institutional theory	ATTRIBUTION THEORY; PROJECT; STAKEHOLDERS; MEGAPROJECTS; PERSPECTIVES; LESSONS; NIMBY	With the aim of delving into the legitimacy formation mechanisms used by communities to make judgements about project organizations, this research studied the local community and surrounding environment of four oil extraction projects located in three developing countries. The results of the cross-case analysis suggest that communities' negative perceptions from government and media can influence their judgement of organizational behaviour. Additionally, this research proposes that local communities' anticipation of the consequences of protesting against the organization can make them decide not to take any action. According to institutional theory, when community individuals arrive at a legitimacy verdict about an organization, their future perceptions will mainly be influenced by this decision rather than conscious consideration of the conditions. Accordingly, this research recommends that organizations aiming to recover their reputation need to adopt compensation activities with a substantial influence on the improvement of conditions. It is only in such conditions that communities will consciously evaluate organizational legitimacy. Trivial changes in organizational behaviour will only result in adding new evidences in support of the illegitimacy of organizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, K				Liu, Ke			The Major Root Causes of Smog in China and Technologies and Solutions to Reduce It	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						smog; emissions; coal refining; coal utilization; solutions		This paper discusses the two major root causes of smog in China. The first one is the distributed coal combustion in many small and medium sized boilers which have no emission control systems installed. To resolve this problem, there are several ways, such as increasing the centralized coal combustion for heat and power cogeneration; or converting coal to SNG in areas where there is enough water resource and removing the pollutants of the coal in the centralized coal to SNG plant, or refining the coal and making it cleaner first before combustion. The second major cause of smog is the low quality diesel and outdated diesel engines used in China. To solve this problem, there are some ways, such as improving the diesel quality to meet the national V standard, and meanwhile, enhancing the law enforcement to eliminate these outdated diesel engines that do not meet the national emission standards; in addition, combusting cleaner and cheaper fuel such as methanol or DME in the diesel engines is also an option for certain areas where there are abundant alternative fuels such as methanol to replace diesel.

Assessing the Long-Term Performance of Cross-Sectoral Strategies for National Infrastructure	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure; Assessment; Decision making; Uncertainty principles; Sustainable development; United Kingdom; Robust decision making; Infrastructure systems	INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL	National infrastructure systems (energy, transport, digital communications, water, and waste) provide essential services to society. Although for the most part these systems developed in a piecemeal way, they are now an integrated and highly interdependent "system of systems." However, understanding the long-term performance trajectory of national infrastructure has proved to be very difficult because of the complexity of these systems (in physical and institutional terms) and because there is little tradition of thinking cross-sectorally about infrastructure system performance. Here, a methodology is proposed for analyzing national multisectoral infrastructure systems performance in the context of uncertain futures, incorporating interdependencies in demand across sectors. Three contrasting strategies are considered for infrastructure provision (capacity intensive, capacity constrained, and decentralized) and multiattribute performance metrics are analyzed in the context of low, medium, and high demographic and economic growth scenarios. The approach is illustrated using Great Britain and provides the basis for the development and testing of long-term strategies for national infrastructure provision. It is especially applicable to mature industrial economics with a large stock of existing infrastructure and challenges of future infrastructure provision.

The scope of this effort included a list of 96 risk events, categorized and prioritized first by impact, then by frequency. The most relevant ones are related to issues such as an inadequate prequalification system, insufficient training of public servants, or political considerations prevailing over real needs, among others. A total of 117 potential risk responses were identified, categorized, and prioritized by potential efficiency and difficulty of implementation. Each risk event was associated to a set of potential responses. The paper includes the top 15 risk events with its main potential responses, including qualitative assessments. A survey was carried out among Spanish public servants working in construction projects, to validate risk identification and to obtain a qualitative assessment. Moreover, a Delphi analysis was developed to validate the risk response identification and obtain a qualitative assessment. One of the conclusions is that small and medium-sized Spanish civil service agencies should work toward increasing their maturity in managing projects and, mainly, project risks.

J	Sexton, M; Barrett, P; Aouad, G				Sexton, M; Barrett, P; Aouad, G			Motivating small construction companies to adopt new technology	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						innovation; organizational capabilities; small construction companies; small- and medium-sized establishments (SMEs); technology transfer; UK	TACIT KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGY; FIRMS	Construction companies are increasingly being challenged to transfer and use new technology. However, little investigation has been undertaken on technology transfer from the perspective of the small construction company. A contribution to this underdeveloped area is based on results from an interview survey of seven small UK construction companies. The results stress that the technology which small construction companies tend to transfer more successfully is that which can contribute to the business in a quick, tangible fashion, and which can fit into existing organizational capabilities. Any technology that is too far removed from this 'comfort zone' is seen to require too much investment and to contain too much risk, and thus tends to be intuitively and swiftly sifted out. This is in marked contrast to the relevant literature that depicts large companies operating in more complex networks, drawing upon them for new tacit and explicit technologies that support more long-term, formal technology strategies, and which often complement some form of specialized internal research and development capability. The implication for policy is that any technology transfer initiatives need to appreciate and actively manage the different motivations and capabilities of small and large construction companies to absorb and use new technology.

However, its full functions are yet to be explored for the performance of government-sponsored infrastructure projects due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties that arise from their unique socioeconomic perspective in developing countries. Therefore, this research investigates the dimensions of project governance (i.e., portfolio direction; sponsorship effectiveness and efficiency; and disclosure and reporting) effects on project performance through the correlation of stakeholder management. Based on the stakeholder theory, a moderation model was proposed and a survey questionnaire was designed to get feedback from the respondents of the government policy and planning departments of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was the core statistical technique for testing the hypotheses. The findings of moderation analysis show that project governance has a positive relation with project performance at medium and higher regression coefficients values of stakeholder management. Inversely, at low regression values, this relationship is negative and insignificant. This research contributes to the literature as the significant interaction of stakeholder management could amplify the effect of project governance, subsequently enhancing the performance of public infrastructure projects.

J	Xu, GY; Li, M; Chen, CH; Wei, YC				Xu, Gangyan; Li, Ming; Chen, Chun-Hsien; Wei, Yongchang			Cloud asset-enabled integrated IoT platform for lean prefabricated construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Prefabricated construction; Cloud asset; Internet of Things (IoT); Lean construction; Sharing economy	DESIGN SCIENCE; INTERNET; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; METHODOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Prefabricated construction has become increasingly popular over the recent years, given its benefits including higher construction speed, lower cost, and improved quality. To facilitate the operations of prefabricated construction, various technologies have in parallel been introduced. However, due to its project-based feature and the involvement of numerous Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the adoption of information technologies is insufficient and varies between SMEs, thereby hindering the improvement of the efficiency of prefabricated construction. Considering these issues and aiming at realizing lean prefabricated construction, this paper proposes an integrated cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform through exploiting the concept of cloud asset. Its operation model has also been worked out to enable SMEs to adopt IoT technologies economically and flexibly. Besides, to make the platform compatible and scalable on managing diverse physical assets in different companies and scenarios, a unified cloud asset data model is proposed. Furthermore, an IoT service-sharing module is developed to support different levels of service-sharing on the platform. Finally, a real-life prefabricated construction project in Hong Kong and several lab-based LEGO construction models are adopted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform.

While clients strive hard to make the best decisions in selecting the right contractor for the right job, a clear understanding of the underlying attributes associated with contractors' selection in the context of achieving, successful project outcomes is critical. In an attempt to understand these pre-emptive qualification criteria and their links to contractors' performance on a project, a hierarchical structural model is established. By employing the structural equation modelling technique, the model adapts a total of 29 technical attributes across five confirmatory factors namely, soundness of business and workforce (SBW), planning and control (PC), quality performance (QP), past performance (PP) and overall project success (OPS). Based on the survey data collected across medium size construction projects in Australia, the results of the model confirmed that technical planning and controlling expertise of contractor is key in achieving success on projects. With a clear understanding of the significance of these factors in the context of contractors' performance, these findings could potentially contribute to the development of a company's procedures or to enhance existing knowledge of contractor prequalification practices.

J	Bachman, LR				Bachman, Leonard R.			New Professionalism: the post-industrial context	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; education; professionalism; public institutions; public interest; universities		Definitions and perceptions of professionalism are continually challenged and transformed by public need, government interaction and institutional organizations. When the goals of those three entities are focused on near-term results, this poses a significant threat to the integrity, value and relevance of professional services. When the individual and corporate professional's profit margin, corporate shareholder responsibility and news media sensationalism are factored in, this short-termism dynamic is greatly magnified. Built environment professions are seen as particularly vulnerable to this threat, given that investments in buildings and infrastructure have long-life and high-performance service expectations. This commentary responds to the Building Research & Information special issue entitled New Professionalism' (2013, volume 40, number 1) and situates the predicament of built environment professionals within an emerging historical transition: that of the post-industrial information society with its characteristic knowledge workers and cybernetic bases of production. Long-term virtues of the built environment mission such as sustainability, public good and evidence-based design are shown to be reflections of the transition from industrial era short-termism to post-industrial systemic foresight. This commentary supplements the special issue papers with a discussion on the broader academy's potential role in breaking the stranglehold of contemporary short-termism in the built environment professions.

J	Chi, HL; Kang, SC				Chi, Hung-Lin; Kang, Shih-Chung			A physics-based simulation approach for cooperative erection activities	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Cooperative erection activities; Rigid body dynamics; Forward kinematics; Construction crane; Physics-based simulation; Erection planning; Virtual reality; Robotics	VISUALIZATION	Cooperative erection activities are critical to projects which involve the erection of heavy loads or the installation of special equipment. Detailed simulation on computer prior to construction can identify constructability problems, and subsequently avoided during actual erections. This paper describes an integrated approach for simulating the detailed motions of cranes. This research develops a physics-based model that follows the principle of closed-form forward kinematics and constraint-based dynamics to present the dual-crane mechanism mathematically a non-trivial task. This model can be used to analyze the inputs from the users (i.e. virtual crane operators) and simultaneously compute the cables sway and reaction of collisions. We also implemented the model on computer and developed a simulation system, Erection Director, to render realistic cooperative erection activities. A demonstration of simulating two-crane lift has been built and three performance tests including a small building (840 elements), a medium building (1937 elements) and a large building (2682 elements) validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The test results indicate that Erection Director can support real-time and physics-based visualization of cooperative erections. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is assumed that construction contractors and subcontractors play a great part in adopting or neglecting an innovative technology due to different factors. We believe this reluctance attribute would be a common factor between these two groups of construction actors and it would further be an indication of sort of behavior these groups have in common. This study intends to make a major contribution to the body of knowledge by investigating BIM feasibility for SMEs. The research method consists of application of a structured online questionnaire distributed Online, out of which 70 responses from the industry were collected and analyzed. Inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing were applied to check the associations among categorical variables via Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Mann-Whitney U Test. The factors between contractors and subcontractors in terms of organizational, technological, economic, and social attributes were compared. Further, contractors were grouped in terms of BIM and software usage, firm size, and partnership by Cluster Analysis. The results show the rankings for contractors were different from the rankings for subcontractors with respect to technological feasibility and the rankings of contractors were all higher than those of subcontractors when partnership was introduced as a differentiating variable.

They provide a good medium to the development of macroscopic vegetation which causes irreversible and physical damage to stone structure. Infrared thermography (IRT) measurements have been performed in laboratory scale to investigate the applicability of this non-destructive technique to an early detection of microbial biofilms on stone surface. Detecting biofilms before stone soiling is important in Cultural Heritage conservation to avoid both irreversible damage and building restoration costs. Active IRT was set up on a French limestone used in many French buildings and monuments. Samples were collected after six-months of exposure in an outdoor biofouling test during which they were colonized by microbial biofilms. They have been compared with controls with no biofilm. Experimental set-up has been carried out in dry and damp conditions to simulate different climatic conditions. First results displayed a different thermal response: stone surfaces with biofilm reached higher temperatures and they cooled down faster than row stones. Biofilm entailed a change of the stone thermal behaviour similar to a monolayer. IRT detected biofilm with a better efficiency in dry than in damp condition.

In the next several years, all major vehicle manufacturers will introduce PEVs, either as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), such as the Nissan Leaf, or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with a dual powertrain, such as the General Motors Volt and the Toyota Prius. This new generation of vehicles relies on electricity as a power source and a battery as an energy storage medium. Naturally, for PEVs, refueling occurs when the battery connects to an electrical outlet linked to a distribution network. The primary objective of this paper is to study optimal locations for building facilities (i.e., smart garages) that will maximize integrated benefits from the transportation system (i.e., parking fee) and the electric power system [i.e., revenue from vehicle-to-building (V2B) services]. A deterministic smart garage development problem (SGDP) is formulated and modeled as a bilevel program and solved by using a genetic algorithm. The results of a simple numerical example show the sensitivity of the model results with respect to parameters, including PEV penetration rate and battery capacity.

J	Teo, EAL; Chant, SL; Tan, PH				Teo, Evelyn Ai Lin; Chant, Swee Lean; Tan, Peh Hua			Empirical investigation into factors affecting exporting construction services in SMEs in Singapore	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The Singapore government is encouraging construction enterprises to venture abroad for exporting their services and become global players since the local construction pie is shrinking and the global market is growing. The Building and Construction Authority of Singapore has revamped the contractors registration system with the hope of bringing about merger and acquisition of companies for improving the local contractors' standing in the global construction scene. To diversify into new markets in a new environment, which is very different from local environment, requires diversification vis-a-vis exporting strategy. This study examines the attitudes and views of contractors, operating in Singapore (excluding foreign contractors), on how the strategic move should be focused for diversification vis-a-vis exporting services. The aim of this study is to establish the survival skills necessary for Singapore's construction small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to venture abroad. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted and the results show that local construction SMEs who have diversified have reaped the benefits derived from diversification into new markets abroad. The main conclusions are that construction SMEs have to export their services in order to survive and they can enhance their export capabilities by forming a consortium with the help of local government.

ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Standardization; Organization Size; Economic Effects; Technical Effects; Innovation Effects; Social Effects; Multi-Criteria Analysis; PROMETHEE-GAIA; Continuous Improvement; Leadership; Organizational &amp; Performance Assessment		Increments in economic efficiency resulting from the application of standards generate economic benefits for both producers and consumers. As a result, it is of the utmost importance for organizations to be aware of the benefits that standards bring to their operations. This paper deals with specific categories of standardization effects that organizations can achieve in the processes of formal standardization. The goal was to rank organizations by size, based on the effects that they can gain by getting involved in formal standardization. The data gathered from a survey of experts from the Institute for Standardization of Serbia form the basis of our multicriteria analysis of standardization indicators for micro, small, medium-sized, and large organizations. The final ranking for determining the achievement of standardization effects in different-sized organizations was performed using the PROMETHEE-GAIA method. Our analysis showed that micro organizations were the best performers since they are more flexible than the other size categories of organizations. In contrast, the other types of organizations have lower significant preferences concerning all the criteria. Finally, one of the conclusions is that all observed organizations have the potential to achieve the effects of standardization, although they may differ.

Construction Risks: Single versus Portfolio Insurance	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk management; Bootstrapping; Options theory; Insurance	MORAL HAZARD; REVENUE INSURANCE; MANAGEMENT; MARKETS; VARIABLES; OPTIONS	Risks and uncertainties are naturally inherent in the construction industry and negatively affect contracting parties and executed projects. This paper explores the possibility of insuring against construction risks, which are beyond the control of contractors and not covered by surety policies, through single and portfolio insurance strategies. Accordingly, the writers programmed Iman and Conover's bootstrapping method for inducing correlations using Microsoft Excel and consequently, developed a technique for pricing insurance premiums as an exotic option using Monte Carlo simulation. The aforementioned methodology was applied on a data set of five defined risks that were collected from small, medium, and large scale projects in California. Pursuant to this study, the calculated premiums for insuring against the defined risks are in line with the premiums available in market for other insurance policies. Moreover, the estimated premium for the proposed portfolio insurance product is more advantageous to contractors in both risk coverage and cost because it is well below the estimated premiums for single insurance products covering individual risks. It is foreseen that this research could open horizons for new construction related insurance products, which would significantly contribute to the efficiency of the risk management process in the construction industry.

Furthermore, a process has been developed insuring that the output produced conforms to customer satisfaction without violating any environmental, health, and safety rules and regulations. An effective QES program not only assures a quality product but also reduces costs, and enhances productivity. It is a top down process, i.e., top management together with line management and other employees develop the program and motivate all personnel to accept the process. Important functions to take under consideration are (1) explain and clarify the quality, environmental, and safety performance expected; (2) involve employees in decision-making and problem solving; (3) describe the consequences of poor quality and unsafe/unhealthy work conditions; (4) establish QES goals and provide feedback on performance; (5) provide a self-monitoring system; and (6) recognize and reinforce good performance and develop a reward system. This paper presents a discussion of the development of a portion of a QES management system which has been employed by a medium to large size construction company. In particular, Items 1-4, listed above, are described in detail.

J	Syben, G				Syben, G			Contractors take command: from a demand-based towards a producer oriented model in German construction	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						project coalition; institutional change; tendering; construction business system; client; architect; contractor; Germany		The construction process in Germany is traditionally dominated by the client and its agent - the architect. This results in severe problems for the construction companies which do not enter into the process until all the important decisions have been made. In particular, the rate of utilization of their facilities is more or less fully dependent on other actors rather than themselves. Recently, the larger construction companies with nationwide and international activities have initiated changes to take over the construction process and assume the leading position within the project coalition. This has been achieved by integrating parts of the construction project that have been under the command of other actors. At the beginning of the process, this concerns part of the work traditionally performed by the architect on behalf of the client, at the other end it concerns the function of the client itself. So it is the producer who - inside a deep crisis which affects the whole of the industry over the last few years - takes command inside the construction process. This will result in restructuring the entire industry and will cause severe problems for other actors, in particular the small and medium construction companies degraded to subcontractors only.

Fuzzy systems in the digital management of heritage timber buildings in South Chile	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Digital management; fuzzy logic; vulnerability; heritage timber buildings; South Chile		In the protection of heritage buildings, computational models are an innovative technology for the implementation of effective preservation strategies. These models can manage both data obtained from the buildings and data from the knowledge base of professional experts. The preventive conservation of heritage buildings requires cooperative efforts, where the professional experts' opinions are paramount, to analyse multidisciplinary knowledge. In this respect, the incorporation of new protocols, which can help decision makers prioritize interventions and avoid restoration actions that are unnecessarily invasive or might cause irreparable loss of the properties, is urgently needed. The aim of this study is to establish a new approach concerning a digital management system that is based on artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic). Application of the model reveals that the sample (42 buildings) was classified into two vulnerability conditions: (i) medium-level affections and (ii) high-level vulnerability affections. The results obtained in this study will be useful to stakeholders who are responsible for the maintenance of heritage buildings, since this methodology allows reducing their probability of failure. This new digital management tool will help in the establishment of possible mitigation strategies that are focused on preventive future maintenance programmes of a set of heritage buildings in South Chile.

Recently, machine learning is one of the most widely used algorithms to train data to optimize systems. The advances in machine learning has enabled us to develop a complex application. This paper demonstrates the ability of using one of the most popular machine learning frameworks TensorFlow to build an image classifier. This classifier has the ability to classify the dust amounts on gravel roads into four major levels (None, Low, Medium, and High). This classifier is based on the aspect of optimizing one of the deep neural networks models Inception-v3 model. This model contains a pretrained package used to extract and recognize dust patterns from dust images automatically. In this paper, a data set of 4,000 images of gravel roads were collected. For training, 80% of the data set was used, and 20% was used for testing. Furthermore, a prediction accuracy plot was generated, and it was found that this classifier achieves a prediction accuracy of 72%.

Design/methodology/approach A new theoretical framework of stakeholder influence strategies was proposed and applied. The research design is a multi-case study, comprising four cases in the construction industry in Vietnam. Findings Seven specific strategies were found, including inputs withholding, inputs compromising, communication, direct action, coalition building, conflict escalation and credibility building. When possessing project inputs, stakeholders can affect a project directly via a withholding or compromising strategy. Communication is available to those who have basic communicating skills; however, direct action is only employed by groups that include a large number of members. Objectors must have common interests or goals with their potential allies for using coalition building. Conflict escalation is restricted to communities having distinctive characteristics which can be used to create new problems sensibly, while credibility building is used by parties possessing adequate resources and expertise.

J	Beringer, C; Jonas, D; Gemunden, HG				Beringer, Claus; Jonas, Daniel; Gemuenden, Hans Georg			Establishing Project Portfolio Management: An Exploratory Analysis of the Influence of Internal Stakeholders' Interactions	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						project portfolio management; project portfolio stakeholders; stakeholder management; stakeholder theory; stakeholder behavior	ROLE AMBIGUITY; ROLE-CONFLICT; ROLE CLARITY; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; SUCCESS; TEAM; FOUNDATIONS; FRAMEWORK	Project portfolio management [PPM] is viewed as a management innovation that must be further established and professionalized in many firms. Stakeholder behavior and stakeholder management are key success factors for project portfolios. Furthermore, stakeholder management must not only focus on single stakeholders but also account for stakeholders influencing one another in fairly complex interactions of multiple and potentially interdependent stakeholders. Our quantitative study of internal key stakeholders' engagement in the PPM process is based on a survey using 223 project portfolios from medium to large firms in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. We investigate the intensity of stakeholders' engagement in the three phases of the PPM process compared with expectations from PPM standards and role descriptions. Further, we analyze the interdependencies between the levels of stakeholder engagement and identify patterns of stakeholder behavior. Our study assists in explaining the relevance of stakeholders to PPM. We further integrate stakeholder theory with a highly relevant management approach (PPM) and thus enhance the explanatory value of stakeholder theory. Finally, the current findings enable managers to address stakeholders more effectively through an increased understanding of stakeholder behavior and its consequences.

The sliding contact produces wear on the conductor rail and wear plate, which results in malfunctions of the electricity supply. A track management system (TMS) is usually adopted to facilitate track operation; one key component of such systems is the performance model. Generally, there are three types of performance models: empirical, mechanical, and mechanical-empirical (ME). However, there are no studies on ME-based wearing performance models for conductor rail systems at present. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an ME-based wearing deterioration model. In this study, relevant material properties such as hardness and tensile strength, train operating parameters such as train speed, electric current, and lateral acceleration of the collector shoe, and quarterly inspection data on the wear plate and conductor rail were collected. Two ME-based wearing models were proposed, one for the wear plate and one for the conductor rail. The results showed that the performance model for the conductor rail had higher accuracy than the model for the wear plate. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Loosemore, M				Loosemore, Martin			Building a new third construction sector through social enterprise	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Employment; entrepreneurship; innovation; people; small to medium sized enterprises; social enterprise	NETWORKS	Social enterprises are profit-making businesses which trade for a social purpose. They bridge the gap between welfare and work, providing employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups often excluded from employment in the construction industry. Social enterprises are a fast-growing part of a larger third economic sector. However, compared to other industries, there are relatively few social enterprises operating in construction and little is known about the challenges they face in doing so. In-depth interviews at 12 UK social enterprises reveal that many of the challenges faced by social enterprises in the construction industry are similar to those faced by social enterprises operating in other industries. These include: building trust, managing hybridity; securing finance; measuring social impact; and achieving scale. However, in addressing the lack of sector-specific insights in social enterprise research, challenges unique to construction are also identified. These include: procurement practices which favour industry incumbents; costly tender bureaucracy; established supply chain relationships; lack of experience of working with social enterprises; disingenuous corporate social responsibility practices; and fear that social enterprises will reduce competitiveness. Recommendations are made to resolve these challenges, enabling the construction sector to create an ecosystem where social enterprises can thrive. Questions to guide future research into this unexplored area are also proposed.

J	Kang, JLH; Gandhi, J				Kang, Julian H.; Gandhi, Jasdeep			READABILITY TEST OF RFID TEMPERATURE SENSOR EMBEDDED IN FRESH CONCRETE	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						RFID; Concrete Maturity		Concrete maturity technology is used to predict the strength of concrete being cured and make an informed decision for stripping the formworks. However, the current concrete maturity method uses temperature sensors that require an extensive wiring, which is not often acceptable on construction site due to harsh working environment. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology provides a solution for the wiring issue because of its ability of sending data wirelessly. An RFID tag integrated with a temperature sensor and placed within fresh concrete may be able to read temperatures of concrete and transmit them to an RFID reader wirelessly in real-time. It may then enable construction professionals to use concrete maturity technology to make an informed decision for stripping the formworks without having to worry about wiring issues on construction site. However, the previous research indicated that the RFID signal gets dispersed in liquid medium. One may speculate then how well RFID signals can travel through fresh concrete with high water content. Would water content of fresh concrete affect the readability of RFID tags? Would the tag's burying depth within fresh concrete affect its readability? This paper presents the results of our investigation on the readability of RFID tags placed in fresh concrete in the early stage of the curing process.

A project-oriented data warehouse for construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						database; information system; decision support system; construction; data warehousing		A construction organization generates a great amount of operational data that are distributed across various functional systems to support its daily operations. Although those data may be potentially useful for future projects, they are not widely collected and centrally stored in the organization. This research presents a Project-oriented Data Warehouse (PDW) for contractors. PDW is designed with dimensional data models consisting of 26 tables. Sixteen of the tables are dimension tables for storing general descriptive information, and the other ten are fact tables for detailing various facts that are captured in the lifecycle of construction projects. PDW can be directly populated with data from existing operational systems, such as P3 files, MS Access, P3/e databases, and Excel files. It maintains each data in the context of its associated project so that a user can retrieve a specific piece of information plus any background information of the related project. PDW has been populated with three sample project data. Through the user interface, a user can generate interested query reports as needed. The presented warehouse structure and data models are scalable. They may be adopted by medium or large contractors for developing company-level data facilities. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM				Zheng, DXM; Ng, ST; Kumaraswamy, MM			Applying pareto ranking and niche formation to genetic algorithm-based multiobjective time-cost optimization	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRADE-OFF PROBLEMS	Time-cost optimization (TCO) is one of the greatest challenges in construction project planning and control, since the optimization of either time or cost, would usually be at the expense of the other. Although the TCO problem has been extensively examined, many research studies only focused on minimizing the total cost for an early completion. This does not necessarily convey any reward to the contractor. However, with the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are more concerned about the combined benefits and opportunities of early completion as well as cost savings. In this paper, a genetic algorithms (GAs)-driven multiobjective model for TCO is proposed. The model integrates the adaptive weight to balance the priority of each objective according to the performance of the previous "generation." In addition, the model incorporates Pareto ranking as a selection criterion and the niche formation techniques to improve popularity diversity. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype system has been developed in Microsoft Project for testing with a medium-sized project. The results indicate that greater robustness can be attained by the introduction of adaptive weight approach, Pareto ranking, and niche formation to the GA-based multiobjective TCO model.

Researchers have not previously investigated the potential health impacts of different connectors. This paper proposes a framework to correlate the specification of CLT connectors to the potential risk of exposure to hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). We also propose an innovative adaptation of the Location-Based Management System flow line by adding a health risk dimension. The usefulness of the proposed framework is tested using a cutting-edge case study building, the tallest timber building in Scotland. The contribution of this research is a novel appreciation of the impact on installers' Health & Safety based on the specified type of CLT connectors. With the methodology outlined in this paper, a HAVS variable can be added to design analysis to increase social sustainability in the built environment alongside other sustainability pillars. The findings are relevant to structural engineers, architects, key industry stakeholders, and researchers in the built environment.

Drawing on the information processing view and contingency theory, this paper develops a research model linking business analytics to organizational DME. The research model is tested using structural equation modeling based on 740 responses collected from U.K. businesses. The key findings demonstrate that business analytics, through the mediation of a data-driven environment, positively influences information processing capability, which in turn has a positive effect on DME. The findings also demonstrate that the paths from business analytics to DME have no statistical differences between large and medium companies, but some differences between manufacturing and professional service industries. Our findings contribute to the business analytics literature by providing useful insights into business analytics applications and the facilitation of data-driven decision making. They also contribute to managers' knowledge and understanding by demonstrating how business analytics should be implemented to improve DME.

J	Ibem, EO; Laryea, S				Ibem, Eziyi O.; Laryea, Samuel			E-tendering in the South African construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-tendering; construction industry; questionnaire survey; South Africa	PROCUREMENT; PERFORMANCE	E-tendering is gaining recognition in the construction industry in many countries across the world. However, there is a limited understanding of the extent of its adoption in construction in African countries. Therefore, this research investigated the state of e-tendering in the South African construction industry using data derived from an online questionnaire survey involving 593 respondents, and oral interviews with selected construction clients, professional consultants, contractors and supply chain managers conducted in 2014 in South Africa. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analyses. It was found that 26% of the respondents were involved in e-tendering, and that 72.4% of them used e-mail, while 21% used web-based systems to support the execution of e-tendering activities. It was also revealed that the main benefits were reduction in transaction cost, and turnaround time of the tendering process, while the barriers to e-tendering in construction were slow Internet connectivity; resistance to change; expensive Internet services; and the inability of small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) to afford the technology, training and skills needed to engage in e-tendering. The paper concludes by suggesting ways for ensuring a critical mass uptake of e-tendering and maximising its benefits in the South African construction industry.

Overheating in Scotland: contributing factors in occupied homes	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building evaluation; building performance; design; houses; low-energy buildings; occupant behaviour; overheating; Passive House; Scotland	THERMAL COMFORT; DWELLINGS; PERFORMANCE	There is growing awareness of the overheating risks in new-build properties in the UK. However, this tends to be considered a problem principally for the southern regions in the UK, only becoming a serious issue in the north of England in the medium-term and in the long-term for Scotland. This notion tends to be largely predicated upon climate change predictions, differences in latitude and summer air temperatures. This paper describes the results from Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) studies over a two-year period from 26 occupied new-build homes across Scotland which demonstrated incidences of overheating. Results suggest that low-energy buildings are susceptible to overheating despite northerly latitudes, with 54% of houses studied overheating for more than six months annually, and 27% of homes overheating for less than 10% of the year. Evidence indicated that commonly used prediction tools do not appear to anticipate overheating adequately. This paper maps common overheating causes due to design and the role of occupants, identifying the risks due to the regulatory system, prediction and procurement processes, and design and construction. A common finding was that design and occupancy factors appear to have a greater impact on overheating more than location and climatic factors.	[Morgan, C.; Foster, J. A.; Poston, A.; Sharpe, T.

This article explores how statistical classification can support partner selection at the example of the Fraunhofer Society in Germany, Europe's largest public organization for applied research. We use internal cooperation data and feature sets based on unstructured data, i.e., text and industry codes, both of which describe business activities of firms. An important advantage of this data is that it is available for most companies in Germany, even small and medium enterprises, which allows for an almost complete screening of the market, in contrast to using other data sources, e.g., patents. In addition, we also include economic variables linked to firms, as turnover, number of employees/managers and firm age. We report the performance of various classification techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests in our dataset for diverse combinations of feature sets. Results showthat simple methods with fewer parameters remain competitive in comparison to complex ones. Overall, the performance of most classifiers is high enough to support the decision process of finding new industry partners for public research.

Through the use of Fuzzy set approach from a questionnaire survey on project teams of mass housing projects, this study highlights the level of communication performance among mass housing project teams using a nine (9) factor criteria attributes in communication performance. The findings indicate good performance in the accuracy, distortions, barriers and underloading in the communication task functions among mass housing project teams. In the measure of timeliness of communication, the performance was deemed as being satisfactory. However, on overloading, understanding, gatekeeping and procedure, the teams' performance was poor. The study further revealed that, the overall communication performance of the project team in mass housing project delivery emerged as being satisfactory. Given the need for effective communication to engender improved task function, collaboration, cooperation and team effectiveness in mass housing delivery, the insight given by the study may help mass housing project teams to focus their attention on the necessary aspects of multi-team interactions and communication and evolve bespoke media, tools and strategies especially in improving timeliness, overloading, understanding, gatekeeping and procedure.

J	Turk, Z				Turk, Ziga			Structured analysis of ICT adoption in the European construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Information and communication technology; technology adoption; construction platforms; construction industry; digital platforms; construction 4.0	BIM; INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; BARRIERS	Construction is trailing other industries in the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT). A major European project Digiplace is investigating if this problem could be addressed using digital platform technology. In the context of this project the current state, future goals and barriers in between have been researched through literature studies, surveys, and interviews. Several similar studies have been done in the past; however, the barriers are still there. The paper, therefore, introduces a novel framework to study technology transfer. It identifies three key vectors of transfer: standards and regulation, software, and people. Along these vectors, it identifies elements that pull and elements that push technology, but which need to overcome the various frictions and barriers. These are then structured according to the PESTEL approach. This approach encourages the holistic study of factors beyond technology. The paper concludes that there is a need for a better way of deployment, organizing, marketing, and learning about new technologies which would mostly benefit small and medium enterprises which lag most in the use of ICT. This could be implemented in the form of industrial digital platforms as a part of the Industry 4.0 strategy.

J	Ogbu, CP				Ogbu, Chukwuemeka Patrick			Survival practices of indigenous construction firms in Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bid strategy; factor analysis; firm survival; indigenous construction firm; Nigeria; Niger Delta; organizational culture; survival practice	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; CULTURE	All over the world, small and medium-sized (SME) construction firms are prone to high mortality rates. Indigenous construction firms (ICFs) (mostly SMEs) must adopt practices that support their survival. However, firm-level practices that are supportive of ICFs' survival have hardly been holistically identified and reduced into a more meaningful set of fewer practices for ease of implementation in the Nigerian context. This paper studied the survival practices of ICFs in Nigeria. Its objective was to summarize identified survival practices (n = 83) of ICFs in the area using a data reduction technique. A structured questionnaire administered on 420 ICFs (146 consultancy and 274 contracting firms) in the area provided data for factor analysis. The reliability test of the questionnaire instrument yielded Cronbach's alpha value of 0.983. The study revealed that seven survival practice factors - human resource management, marketing, bid strategy, financial management, organizational culture, smart work methods and firm strategy factors - account for most of the survival practices adopted by the ICFs. Cumulatively, the seven factors explain 69.07% of the variance in the variable set. This study has helped to reduce the survival practices of ICFs into a fewer number of practices for ease of implementation.

Based on a modified theoretical framework, we conducted a multiple-case study to explore common combinations and sequencings of specific actions that these stakeholders take to affect construction projects. Seven specific influence strategies were found: (i) inputs withholding, (ii) inputs compromising, (iii) communication, (iv) direct action, (v) coalition building, (vi) conflict escalation and (vii) credibility building. Stakeholders combined the last five strategies in three pairs persuading decision makers to take action. Coalition building - communication was the most prevalent combination that stakeholders use to influence decision-makers. The combination of communication and credibility building was found in cases having environmental disputes. Direct action and conflict escalation were exerted together in projects affecting the locals adversely. Some common patterns of stakeholder strategic actions were also observed. First, direct action came into existence after communication, followed by conflict escalation. Second, after establishing their credibility via persuasive evidence, experts' judgements and the like, stakeholders used those outcomes to communicate to decision-makers. We emphasize the need for full and honest engagement with stakeholders to prevent their adverse influence on construction projects.

At the same time, despite property development being frequently linked in the mass media with unaffordable housing prices, bribery, and poor construction quality, many large developers have instituted programmes to improve their CSR presence. However, the perceptions of property development organisations of what CSR means to them are as yet unclear. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to better understand the way CSR is seemingly perceived by property developers in China. This is undertaken by analysing CSR disclosure and prioritising information from CSR corporate reports by developers in the housing sector. Three attributes of CSR disclosure information type, responsibility type, and stakeholder type are used to construct an analytical framework for testing of 44 published company reports by content analysis. The findings indicate a greater emphasis on management approaches and ethical responsibilities than commercial goals, with industry and ownership differences pointing to the need to be recognised by the public and future decision-makers.

As the construction industry has an increasingly multicultural and multilingual workforce, conventional written and verbal safety communication is of limited effectiveness. CodeSafe Solutions, has developed an innovative method of communicating H&S information to field-based workers using digital media. The potential of the system was explored and two organizations in the Australian construction industry were used. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews of safety managers and workers involved in system implementation and quantitative data such as incident reports and video usage were analysed. Managers perceived the CodeSafe system to be beneficial and well received by workers. In one organization, the introduction of the CodeSafe system coincided with a reduction in injury rates. However, causal inferences about the impact of the system cannot be made. Workers involved in making the films believed films would be an effective communication tool. However, barriers to implementation of the technology include workers' reluctance to use personal smart phones, limited internet connectivity, and organizational and national regulations on mobile phone use on construction sites.

Codification Challenges for Data Science in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Codification; Artificial intelligence (AI); Automation; Data science; Machine readability; Construction	BIM ADOPTION; INFORMATION; QUALITY; DESIGN; INTEROPERABILITY; OPPORTUNITIES; INDUSTRY	New forms of data science, including machine learning and data analytics, are enabled by machine-readable information but are not widely deployed in construction. A qualitative study of information flow in three projects using building information modeling (BIM) in the late design and construction phase is used to identify the challenges of codification that limit the application of data science. Despite substantial efforts to codify information with common data environment (CDE) platforms to structure and transfer digital information within and between teams, participants work across multiple media in both structured and unstructured ways. Challenges of codification identified in this paper relate to software usage (interoperability, information loss during conversion, multiple modelling techniques), information sharing (unstructured information sharing, drawing and file based sharing, document control bottlenecks, lack of process change), and construction process information (loss of constraints and low level of detail). This paper contributes to the current understanding of data science in construction by articulating the codification challenges and their implications for data quality dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, accessibility, consistency, timeliness, and provenance. It concludes with practical implications for developing and using machine-readable information and directions for research to extract insight from data and support future automation.

It can be achieved through real time communication flow between all, In present scenario, it call be achieved through adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Construction industry primarily comprises small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Also, ICT adoption has been slow in the industry. Research is required to assess the factors that affect ICT adoption at the three levels of industry, organization and people, With focus oil SMEs, This paper discusses a component of the research undertaken to study these factors and issues in the context of Indian Construction industry. A questionnaire Survey was conducted and through quantitative data analysis the extent of adoption of formal Project Management processes, ICT adoption for these processes and factors including perception based factors affecting ICT adoption were studied. Results of data analysis includes identification of issues that require action at the three study levels. The results can be generalized for other countries with due considerations, specifically for countries where the construction industry is similar to Indian construction industry in terms of working methodologies or for large countries.

Range images acquired with such systems often require registration. This paper describes an automatic method to rapidly locate spheres and perform a registration based on three pairs of matching points (centers of fitted spheres) in two range images. The proposed method is directly applicable for regularly gridded datasets obtained with instruments that are typically used for construction applications and whose maximum ranges are greater than 50 m. A lab was scanned from two locations at three different scan densities. Four spheres were located in the lab, and the total number of points hitting the four spheres was a small fraction (<0.01%) of all the points in the dataset. At the highest scan density, the registration of two datasets with 6.4 x 10(6) and 3.4 x 10(6) points is obtained in less than 30 s. At the medium scan density, two range images with 1.6 x 10(6) and 0.8 x 10(6) points can be registered in less than 2 s. Published by Elsevier BY.

Factors associated with the influence of service quality (SQ) on construction client satisfaction and how it affects their behavioural intentions in Cambodia are investigated. A theoretical structural model was developed to investigate the influence of five SQ factors on CS and their links to the future behavioural intentions of the client. A partial least square approach of the structural equation modelling technique (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse data collected from a questionnaire survey of 227 participants comprising the clients of small and medium size projects. The structural model adapts 22 attributes across five SQ factors, namely: reliability; responsiveness; assurance; empathy, and tangible factors. PLS-SEM outcomes confirmed that the future behavioural intentions of the client are influenced by their satisfaction over the service excellence provided by construction companies. Moreover, treating every client individually and demonstrating an approachable attitude towards their needs will increase their satisfaction with the experience they had with a contractor. Findings and recommendations of the study may be useful to construction companies who are seeking ways to improve CS in developing countries.

J	Serpell, A; Ferrada, X; Rubio, NL				Serpell, Alfredo; Ferrada, Ximena; Larissa Rubio, Norma			FOSTERING THE EFFECTIVE USAGE OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						risk; management; construction; projects; knowledge; application; system	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; PROJECT; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	The effective management of risk is critical for construction projects. However, research findings show that risk management is either not used or done ineffectively in domestic construction projects. One of the primary reasons for this appears to be the lack of risk management (RM) capabilities and knowledge. A study aimed at developing a system for supporting the effective use of RM is presented. The system has been designed so as to provide the required functionality to assist owners and contractors to develop their capabilities to manage risk effectively, including: a) to assess the existing RM organizational maturity and to report on the existing gaps, b) to propose recommendations for improving the organizational RM capabilities in the light of the detected gaps, and c) to help companies with the implementation and improvement of RM within the organization. The system prototype has been successfully applied in several companies that served as initial case studies. It is anticipated that the system will assist clients and contractors to advance effective risk management capabilities and to improve their project risk management performance in the medium range. The system can also be applied in other countries that face the same RM difficulties.

J	Jiang, HC; Lin, P; Qiang, MS				Jiang, Hanchen; Lin, Peng; Qiang, Maoshan			Public-Opinion Sentiment Analysis for Large Hydro Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Public opinion; Large hydro projects; Project management; Information technologies	3 GORGES PROJECT; SOCIAL MEDIA; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; ALGORITHMS; ATTITUDES; POLARITY; REVIEWS; CHINA; DAM	Public opinion is becoming increasingly involved in feasibility studies, construction, and post-evaluation of large hydro projects. Recently, with the rapid development of social network services, sentiment analysis can provide officials and managers with fresh perspectives on public-relation problems in project management. An effective sentiment analysis method can enable projects to gain from public participation. In this paper, a project sentiment analysis (PSA) system using a lexicon-based method is proposed. This system collects user opinions from social network sites, establishes emotion dictionaries, and builds basic rules that calculate those sentiment values embodied in a collection of messages. The Three Gorges project (TGP) was used as a case study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PSA. Sentiment analysis results show that about half (47.7%) of the collected messages expressed negative emotions towards the TGP, while the other messages were positive or neutral. The case study is of help to Chinese government and project managers in future decision-making regarding the TGP. The PSA system provides a new theoretical perspective and a practical method to assess public opinion during the whole life-cycle of a large hydro project.

On the macroeconomic level, the goals of sustainable construction are being implemented most actively in industrial countries in which the share of construction output is decreasing. However in both less developed and newly industrialized countries, the share of construction output is increasing, but the goals of sustainable construction are more difficult to implement. On the mesoeconomic level, the construction sector depends on the implementation of the goals of sustainable development across the national economy as a whole. Supply chains feeding the construction sector are long and intertwined, making it difficult to assess the effect of different materials, components and procedures. On the microeconomic level, buildings are created with shorter time horizons in response to being a demand-derived commodity and increasingly dominated by mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment. Their finance is being adjusted to the short and medium term which is in conflict with sustainable construction, whose goals rely upon the long term. Two broad approaches for meeting the economic challenges of sustainable construction are considered: governance through standards, legal and regulatory practices; market-oriented policies which influence the costs of particular forms of construction. Both approaches have a role, but it is argued that the market-oriented measures will be more effective at the strategic level.

In this paper a new hybrid optimization method is presented to achieve an advancement in optimal planning and scheduling of large-scale construction projects with multiple duration/resource execution modes and resource constraints. The proposed method consists of a novel heuristic and unique genetic optimization algorithm. The heuristic is designed to achieve schedules with efficient resource utilizations through dynamic selection of modes. A genetic optimization algorithm is integrated to the proposed optimization method to further improve the quality of the solutions obtained in the heuristic phase. The computational experiment results reveal that the new hybrid method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves high-quality solutions in significantly less computation time, especially for large projects. The main contribution of the proposed hybrid optimization method is that it enables significant savings by optimal planning and scheduling of medium- and large-scale construction projects with multiple duration/resource execution modes and resource constraints.

In contrast, this paper presents a statistical model that can support a more dynamic form of safety control, by utilizing real-time tracking data to control the exposure of construction workers to safety risks that accumulate and change over time, The model addresses risks that are the result of concurrent activities on the construction site, and provides proactive alerts in case of an increasing risk exposure for a worker or crew. Statistical zones that are related to medium risk areas on the site are defined in the model. A number of statistical rules are then used to identify deviations from a predefined maximum allowable risk exposure for workers located in the statistical zones. The model can thus prevent potential accidents from occurring, without unnecessarily affecting the efficiency of the activities carried out on site. Laboratory tests of the model were carried out, using a Wi-Fi-based RTLS. The results of the tests demonstrate that the model can identify an excessive exposure to risk for workers, support an initial analysis of the causes for the excessive risk exposure, and compensate for errors in the RTLS measurements.

Weekly data capturing the number of hours worked, satisfaction with work-life balance and capacity to complete required tasks at work and at home were collected for 25 consecutive weeks. Data was subjected to time series modeling procedures and weekly work hours were found to significantly predict participants' overall satisfaction with work-life balance, and capacity to complete tasks at work and at home. The occurrence of 'long weekends', i.e., a period of three days away from work arising as a result of a public holiday coinciding with a 'rostered day off', was also found to predict workers' capacity to complete tasks at home. An evaluation workshop explored workers' experiences of a work-life intervention. Participants' were generally positive about the organization's support of their work life balance, however areas for improvement were identified, such as the need for better communication of work-life strategies and to address the 'long hours' culture within the organization. The research presents a participatory framework for improving the work-life balance of project-based construction workers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

In 2016, a large-scale DDoS attack, named Dyn, caused massive damage to several well-known companies. One effective countermeasure is observing previous network traffic information or abnormal behavior determined by the host machines and determining the latest DDoS-attack IP addresses. Because of the lack of a fair exchange mechanism, most security operation centers (SOCs) are unwilling to share their real-time DDoS data. In this article, we propose a decentralized DDoS data exchange platform, namely SOChain, using blockchain technology to overcome the trust and fairness issues. The platform incentivizes SOCs through the DDoS_coin token. The more DDoS information an SOC contributes, the more coins it earns. To confirm the validity of uploaded information, we enlist a content verifier to examine uploaded abnormal IP addresses. Moreover, the verifier is incentivized by the DDoS_coin. To decrease the management effort, the entire flow is automatically executed in smart contract deployed onto the blockchain system. To address the issue of privacy in smart contracts, we devise a novel dual-level Bloom filter to enable efficient searches with privacy protection. Herein, a verifiable method is designed without revealing the information to public.

We derive equilibrium decisions on product quality levels and identify the conditions under which the manufacturer outsources production. We first study the case of symmetric outsourcing where the manufacturer outsources both high-end and low-end products, and obtain the following managerial insights. Symmetric outsourcing tends to enlarge product differentiation within a product line, quality levels under symmetric outsourcing are lower than those under symmetric insourcing when the manufacturer's marginal quality cost is medium, and the size of the product line decreases with both the subcontractor's production cost under outsourcing and the manufacturer's production cost under insourcing. When allowing asymmetric sourcing where the manufacturer outsources one product and insources another product, we find that the sourcing strategy reverses the effect of the manufacturer's nonquality cost on quality levels where nonquality cost represents marginal production cost independent of quality level, and asymmetric sourcing may be taken when the manufacturer's nonquality cost is low and symmetric outsourcing should be taken when the manufacturer's nonquality cost is high.

In light of the inaccuracy of the tracking system, buffer areas are defined as statistical zones, at some distance from potential workplace hazards. Statistical alerts are created according to predefined rules when the hazard exposure of workers in those zones crosses a certain threshold. The results of tests of the method demonstrate that the model is able to successfully process the location data in order to compensate for its inaccuracy. This is done without necessitating a significant increase in the areas that are defined as being of high risk, and therefore off-limits for most workers on site. The model can thus ensure the efficiency of the construction work by restricting the size of the areas on site that are off-limits for most workers, while at the same time ensuring the safety of workers. The method can also ensure that alerts will not be ignored by using statistical rules to avoid an excessive number of alerts, and by discerning who should be the client of an alert.

This paper presents the concept of a telematic digital workbench. a horizontal tabletop user interface integrating mobile computing and wireless communication to facilitate synchronous construction site to office collaboration. We demonstrate the capabilities and potentials of this system concept for construction defect management. The on-site crew uses a handheld mobile device to collect defect information and transfers the information to the design office through wireless communication by sending the information to a database listener. The digital workbench application monitors the database and synchronizes the location of the visual information on the site with the 3D model on the server. Integrated with 3D viewing capability in a CAD system, designers can interact with the combined model/site data using a horizontal and vertical screen. A case study compared the telematic digital workbench against paper-based and Pocket PC-based methods for defect management in a controlled laboratory experiment. The case study results show that the telematic digital workbench has the potential to improve the accuracy of matching site data to digital data and reduce information loss between site and office collaboration.

Original visualization and roadmaps for selected nanotechnologies are showcased. The creation of roadmaps was preceded by technology mapping and the selection of priority technologies, for which technology characteristics sheets were developed. Human resources (skills), financial resources, and tangible assets were a basis for the creation of the roadmaps specifying the development of priority nanotechnologies in the studied region (Podlaskie, Poland). The development of the technologies described in the roadmaps is stimulated by the R&D domain, which constitutes one of the roadmap layers. Potential technology application areas form the background for the "market" layer of the roadmaps. Segments related to the general development of a particular technology in time are additional elements enriching the roadmaps. All layers were presented in three-time perspectives. The conducted analysis served as a basis for the integration of the selected priority nanotechnologies into four nanotechnology development scenarios of the region.

J	Radopoulou, SC; Brilakis, I				Radopoulou, Stefania C.; Brilakis, Ioannis			Patch detection for pavement assessment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Patch; Detection; Pavement assessment; Pavement defect; Automatic detection; Image processing	CRACK DETECTION; RECOGNITION; TRACKING; SYSTEM	Pavement management systems rely on comprehensive up-to-date road condition data to provide effective decision support for short, medium and long term maintenance scheduling. However, the cost per mile of the existing condition data collection methods allows only for periodical surveys. This leads to long gaps between inspections and a focus on major roads over rural ones. Therefore, pavement condition monitoring systems that provide inexpensive frequent updates on the road condition are necessary. Such systems would require robust and automatic defect detection methods using low-cost sensors. In this paper, one such method is proposed for detecting road patches from video data acquired by the car's parking camera. A patch is initially detected based on its visual characteristics, which are: 1) it consists of a closed contour and 2) its texture is the same with the surrounding intact pavement. The patch is then passed to a kernel tracker in order to trace it in subsequent video frames. This way redetection is avoided and each patch is reported only once. The method was implemented in a C# prototype and tested with video data consisting of approximately 4000 frames collected from roads in Cambridge, UK. The results show that the suggested method has 84% precision and 96% recall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Thomas, HR; Ellis, RD				Thomas, H. Randolph; Ellis, Ralph D., Jr.			Contractor prebid planning principles	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Planning is an essential function of project management. Yet, many small- and medium-sized contractors do a relatively poor job of operational planning. Better prebid plans will reduce costs, shorten schedules, and improve labor productivity. Unfortunately, the published literature offers little guidance for smaller contractors on what constitutes effective planning. Most papers describe planning as a macrolevel process for owners. Most emphasize scope definition for industrial projects. This paper describes a microlevel planning process for contractors. It consists of eight steps which are: (1) assess contract risks; (2) develop a preliminary execution plan; (3) develop site layout plans; (4) identify the sequences that are essential-to-success; (5) develop detailed operational plans; (6) develop proactive strategies to assure construction input into design; (7) revise the preliminary plan; and (8) communicate and enforce the plan. The entire process is illustrated with a case study project and is fully illustrated with figures which show how to integrate the work of multiple contractors, keep key resources (crews or equipment) fully engaged with no downtime, provide time buffers so the work of follow on crews can be efficiently done, expedite the schedule using multiple work stations and concurrent work, ways to communicate the work plan to the superintendent and foremen, and how to assess the feasibility of various work methods. The steps are easy to understand and implement. They will yield immediate positive results.

Resilience-Based Design of Natural Gas Distribution Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Resilience; Disaster resilience; Vulnerability; Gas networks; Damage assessment; Lifelines; Serviceability; Natural gas; Distributed systems; Resilience-based design	SEISMIC RESILIENCE; EARTHQUAKE; PIPELINES; SYSTEMS	The concept of disaster resilience has received considerable attention in recent years and is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamic response to natural disasters. In this paper, a new performance index measuring the functionality of a gas distribution network has been proposed, which includes the restoration phase to evaluate the resilience index of the entire network. The index can also be used for any type of natural or artificial hazard, which might lead to the disruption of the system. The gas distribution network of the municipalities of Introdacqua and Sulmona, two small towns in the center of Italy that were affected by the 2009 earthquake, has been used as a case study. The pipeline network covers an area of 136 km(2), with three metering pressure reduction (M/R) stations and 16 regulation groups. Different analyses simulating different breakage scenario events due to an earthquake have been considered. The numerical results showed that the functionality of the medium-pressure gas distribution network is crucial for ensuring an acceptable delivery service during the postearthquake response. Furthermore, the best retrofit strategy to improve the resilience index of the entire network should include emergency shutoff valves along the steel pipes.

J	Nourzad, SHH; Pradhan, A				Nourzad, Seyed Hossein Hosseini; Pradhan, Anu			Vulnerability of Infrastructure Systems: Macroscopic Analysis of Critical Disruptions on Road Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							COMPLEX; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; LINKS; ROBUSTNESS	Networked infrastructures serve as essential backbones of society. In particular, road transportation networks have a principal role in people's everyday lives because they facilitate physical connectivity. External factors, such as disasters and failures, may degrade the performance of road networks. For example, severe flooding may disrupt a large area of a network, leading to cancellations and delay of several trips over the network. In addition, the collapse of a bridge could render certain nodes and links ineffective, thereby affecting traffic flow conditions. The authors formalized and developed a computational framework to assess vulnerability of road networks due to critical artificial or natural disruptions. The framework is built upon recent developments in interdisciplinary domains, such as network science, computational science, and transportation engineering. Using the proposed framework for the Greater Philadelphia road network, the network was divided into several high-critical, medium-critical, and low-critical clusters. The clustering results varied based on the time and severity of disruption. For instance, during the p.m. peak, disruption of roads within the city of Philadelphia was more critical than other roads of the region. However, during the a.m. peak, the roads surrounding the city of Philadelphia were more critical. The framework was validated using real-world observations and simulated traffic results.

Mere Nuisance or Growing Threat? The Physical and Economic Impact of High Tide Flooding on US Road Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; COSTS; DAMAGES; SURGE	High tide flooding (HTF) already affects traffic in many US coastal areas, but the issue will worsen significantly in the future. While studies show that large storm surge events threaten to be ever more costly, less damaging, but more frequent HTF events remain understudied and potentially carry a comparable economic impact. This study advances our understanding of the risks and impacts of HTF on vulnerable traffic corridors using hourly tide gauge water levels, sea-level rise projections, and link-level spatial analysis. It is the first study to estimate HTF economic impacts for varying levels of intervention, including reasonably anticipated driver-initiated rerouting and ancillary protection of adjacent property. The 2020 annual national-level costs of $1.3 to $1.5 billion will increase to $28 to $37 billion in 2050 and $220 to $260 billion in 2100 for medium to high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios, respectively. Total costs over the century are $1.0 to $1.3 trillion (discounted 3%). Additional cost-effective protection by building sea walls or raising road surfaces could significantly reduce 2100 costs to $61 to $78 billion, but there remain many barriers to adopting least-cost adaptation decisions, and these gains may only be realized with careful planning and information sharing.

Studies have investigated the measurements of various IT benefits, but a comprehensive review of the benefit analysis methods used to produce quantifiable measurements of IT benefits in the built environment to provide evidence is still lacking. The study's aim is to systematically review the benefits analysis methods used to produce quantifiable evidence of IT benefits in the built environment. Through a three-stage review process, relevant papers were selected and examined based on the benefits analysis methods and the results produced. The findings show that nine benefit analysis methods are used to measure the benefits of IT which could be tangible benefits or intangible benefits. The results indicate that the benchmarking and weighted scoring models are the most popular analytical method used to produce quantifiable results of benefits measured. The shortfalls of the benefit analysis methods are discussed, and future research agenda is recommended to ensure comprehensive results from benefit measurements, Further, a conceptual integration model is developed to guide future research when addressing the shortfalls of the respective benefit analysis methods through the stages of implementation of IT.

J	Arduino, P; OpdenBosch, A; Macari, EJ				Arduino, P; OpdenBosch, A; Macari, EJ			Geotechnical triaxial soil testing within virtual environment	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper presents a computer-based innovative instructional approach for training potential users of the geotechnical triaxial device. The proposed approach provides the user with a tool to gain a thorough understanding of soil testing as well as the resulting soil behavior. The proposed approach is based on the concept of virtual reality environments and attempts to ''realistically'' simulate many of the essential characteristics of a real laboratory setting. The particular virtual environment being employed is referred to as the interactive visualizer (IV), which was developed by researchers at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The concept of machines, cameras, lights, and medium are described as the entities that, when properly combined, create a virtual world. In this context a geotechnical triaxial laboratory has been developed that models the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of soil specimens. Soil properties and confinements levels constitute the initial settings that are controlled by the user, followed by the shearing stages of the test that also respond to the interactive participation of the user. The mechanical response of the virtual soil specimen is displayed in a graphical format using the concept of a ''classroom'' blackboard. This initial version of the virtual laboratory has shown some very promising results. Additional planned developments will further enhance the usefulness of this application that, in turn, will benefit the geotechnical engineering educational community.

Using augmented reality video in enhancing masonry and roof component comprehension for construction management students	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Augmented reality; Construction management; Education; Construction assemblies; Construction processes; Spatio-temporal constraints	OPPORTUNITIES; EDUCATION	Purpose - New methods to introduce topics in classrooms are needed to enhance the construction management educational experience. One of these new methods is showing real time videos that highlight the various elements of concern in the classroom lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal constraints of various construction processes. The superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to visualize context and hidden processes otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom lectures. Design/methodology/approach - A significantly improved perception of reality is created through the combination of the learners' ability to understand the complexity of construction products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by viewing the real environment augmented with computer-generated information layers. Findings - Testing the ART video in a classroom with undergraduate construction management students showed that students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding assembly more effectively than those who were not. Originality/value - ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they combine traditional classroom lectures with ART enabled media.

Mitigating CO2 emissions from energy use in the world's buildings	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; climate change; CO2 reduction; design; energy efficiency; mitigation; policies	EFFICIENCY; INVESTMENT; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; SAVINGS; LOAD	An overview of climate change mitigation opportunities in the world's buildings is presented, based on the key building-specific findings of the Fourth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. Buildings and the building stock can play a major role in mitigating climate change in the short- to medium-term, since substantial reductions in CO2 emissions from their energy use can be achieved over the coming years. A significant portion of these savings can be achieved in ways that reduce life cycle costs, thus providing reductions in CO2 emissions that have a net negative cost. There are indications that the building stock has the highest share of negative- and low-cost greenhouse gas reduction potential among all sectors. Based on 80 collected national or regional studies estimating CO2 mitigation potential in five continents, the global potential for CO2 reductions through buildings is analysed and estimated. The co-benefits associated with the implementation of these measures are also substantial, helping policy-makers justify actions even in the absence of a strong climate commitment. Since the barriers to unlocking the high potentials in the residential and commercial sectors are especially strong, no single instrument can make a large impact. Instead, portfolios of targeted policies tailored to local conditions, combined with strong compliance and enforcement regimes, are needed.

Using data from the Kauffman firm survey, for ventures in high-tech industries, relative to ventures in low-tech industries, the decline in performance is stronger for founders who founded a greater number of businesses prior to the current venture or for those who have startup experience in the current industry. The differences in survival between high-tech and low-tech ventures is negligible when founders have more start up experience in the same industry. Furthermore, ventures in high-tech sectors with high credit risk have a greater performance decline relative to those in low-tech industries with high credit risk, and ventures in low-tech sectors with higher perceived competitive advantage have higher odds of failure. The findings add to our understanding of the influence of technology regimes on the limited efficacy of entrepreneurial human capital and stronger effects of credit risk on venture survival and performance.

Nevertheless, how favourably the contractor views the risk allocation has a bearing on the project outcome. This research identifies the pertinent risks in the Zambian context and establishes how they are allocated in terms of types of contract clauses used and response mechanisms employed. A mixed-sequential approach was followed, comprising 15 semi-structured interviews, 198 questionnaire-survey respondents and document analysis (eight projects using various standard forms of contract). The respondents comprised of clients, consultants and contractors involved on medium- to- large-scale building projects. Findings show the pertinent risks in the industry were due to shortcomings of the design team and clients' shirking. Using a Pareto analysis, a pervasive propensity was found for passive risk acceptance and wanton risk transfer by the client. Modifications were found, aimed at negating the clients' responsibility for risk. The originality of this research lies in its methodological approach and its focus on how risks are allocated. Findings can help practitioners to better allocate risk and promote the achievement of desired project outcomes through careful selection and utilization of mechanisms, allocation of risk and use of contract clauses.

However, one of the major drawbacks of wood are its flammability. In case of fire in wooden buildings or constructions made of timber structures, the most noticeable feature of combustion is charring these structures. This property is important for identifying the cause of a fire. Therefore, it is necessary to relate charring timber structures with certain significant effects of fire such as its duration or temperature. It is also particularly important to identify whether timber has been treated with fire retardant solutions before the fire break-out. The values of electrical capacitance and conductivity for the media obtained from char resulting from natural wood and that treated with fire retardant solutions and dispersed in distilled water depending on heating time have been determined. Moreover, it has been stated that the electric conductivity of char resulting from natural wood is 100 times lower, and the electrical capacitance of such char is 1000 lower than those resulting from treated wood. The regression analysis of the obtained data has been performed. The empirical equations have been derived. The results of the conducted research have been summarised. Priority has been given to the application of the method evaluating electrical conductivity.

Motiar			Barriers of Implementing Modern Methods of Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Preassembly; Industrialized building; Modern methods of construction; Barriers; Prefabrication; Modular construction	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION	Modern methods of construction (MMCs) offer many benefits, but their uptake is low. Their contribution to the construction industry is also low. As such, this study examined the importance of various barriers to wider adoption of MMCs. Results are presented from statistical analyses of 160 questionnaire responses from the U.K. and China. The results validate the importance of 26 factors out of 29 used in the survey. Cost related issues are the most important barriers to implementing MMCs, although respondents from the two countries clearly disagree on the relative importance of different factors. Clients have consensus on the importance of fewer barriers than contractors and consultants, which is expected to help adopt MMCs. Large organizations displayed fewer consensuses than medium-sized organizations, who also displayed fewer consensuses than small organizations. This was interpreted to help the industry in adopting MMCs, because larger organizations control smaller organizations in most cases. Moreover, respondents with experience in MMCs consider that there are far less barriers to adopting MMCs than those with no experience in MMCs. Factor analysis surfaced seven interrelated components, suggesting the need for an integrated and holistic strategy to overcome the barriers. These outcomes are expected to allow policymakers to precisely identify the issues relating to the low uptake of MMCs and to devise appropriate strategies for their wider adoption.

Iskander, and Jinyuan Liu	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material								The writers would like to thank the discussers for the interest in our work and for sharing their related research with Geo-PIV. Measurement of deformation using digital image correlation is becoming an invaluable tool in civil engineering. Digital image correlation (DIC) is a classic pattern recognition technique in which two images are compared to obtain the relative displacement between them. DIC is widely used in many engineering fields to obtain spatial deformation patterns, albeit with several names. It is also known as particle image velocimetry (PIV), image cross-correlation, block or region matching method, surface displacement analysis, and subregion scanning computer vision. In geotechnical engineering, DIC has also been used by Horii et al. (1998), Guler et al. (1999), and Rechemnacher and Saab (2002). PIV utilizes DIC in measuring flow pattern and velocity distribution by embedding small particles referred to as seeds in the flow path. Measurements are performed using the cross-correlation function on two consecutive images of these particles. PIV often uses flourescent seeds along with a laser source to identify flow characteristics in specified orientations. We believe that the term PIV is a suitable description for DIC application in fluid dynamics, and that surface deformation analysis in geotechnical engineering should be referred to by the umbrella term of the technology, i.e., DIC.

The profilometer is integrated with an 8.5-ton medium-size excavator's machine control system with pose calculation. Accordingly, the point cloud was transformed to a work coordinate system. We used a recently developed pulsed time-of-flight laser light detection and ranging profilometer, which makes possible simultaneous depth measurements to 256 directions in an angle range of +/- 20 degrees and measurement range from 1 m to 8 m with a frame rate of 25 frames per second under sunlight conditions (approximate to 50 Klux). The analysis is based on a 4D map, which consists of 3D data (XYZ) and intensity information. The XYZ coordinates give the position of an object, and the intensity data can be used to roughly identify materials and recognise surface markings, such as texts. An analysis of the results shows that the detection accuracy of the profilometer is better than +/- 10 mm. The main advantages of our method are accuracy, high update rate, compact size, real-time measurement and a construction without moving parts. Our technique has a great potential in construction applications, where accurate measurements of a surface shape are needed.

Decision Support System-Enhanced Scheduling in Matrix Organizations Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Planning; Scheduling; Project management; Algorithms; Decision support systems; Organizations; Planning; Scheduling; Project management; Heuristics; Decision support systems; Organizations; Quantitative methods	MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; AHP	This paper presents a conceptual approach to scheduling multiple projects in a matrix organization with rapidly changing and sometimes competing objectives using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) within a decision support system (DSS). This approach increased the analytical capabilities and scheduling efficacy of traditional scheduling processes in a medium-sized electric utility company. The purpose of this paper is to establish a logical framework for scheduling multiple projects with competing priorities while taking into account all known corporate organizational constraints. Traditional scheduling techniques such as the program evaluation and review technique and critical-path method are heavily based on time constraints and resource availability, neglecting factors such as customer satisfaction, organizational financial objectives, political risks, and other intangible parameters that greatly influence scheduling processes. The primary contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework that offers a platform to incorporate tangible and intangible variables into a decision support system using AHP for scheduling multiple projects with competing objectives in matrix organizations. The results of the application showed that, when compared with traditional scheduling methods, this DSS model with integrated AHP showed improvements in prioritizing in accordance with political risks, cash-flow demands, and crew allocation. It appears to be a superior solution for solving prioritization issues in matrix organizations.

However the excavators are still working with low fuel efficiency and bad exhaust. So, new technologies are urgently needed to further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Researchers have begun to focus on hybrid technology of hydraulic excavators. This paper systematically analyzed the performance of the powertrain hybridization of hydraulic excavator and compared the main performance among the parallel, the series and the conventional configurations based on a 5-ton excavator. The data of the conventional excavator used for analysis were gathered from the real working process, while that of the hybrid configurations were got from the model simulation. The data used as the load input of the model were also gathered from the real working process. The model of the hybrid powertrains were built with the reliable lookup-table approach, which provides deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena. The presented results indicate that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the other two configurations in heavy mode and light mode, whereas both the series and parallel hybrid powertrains feature better fuel economy in medium mode. Considering the performance and cost synthetically, the parallel powertrain is the best configuration for hybrid excavators at present. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A carefully planned and executed restructuring of the industry will provide the enterprise with a competitive advantage. Making the optimal restructuring decisions, however, is not easy because: 1) the decisions involve qualitative measures within a complex and uncertain environment, 2) the alternatives include up to 31 administrative regions, and 3) there are astounding differences in the economic development among the 31 alternatives. The orders-of-magnitude approach of the analytic hierarchy process (OM-AHP) could be a useful method to tackle the first and second challenges. However, this approach does not currently explain how to address the large differences between small items in a cluster and big items in a cluster when there are no medium items between them. A model of OM-AHP with a dummy pivot is proposed to tackle this particular challenge. This approach is then applied in a multicriteria decision making problem to both demonstrate how the proposed approach works and provide a solution for the restructuring of the steel industry in China.

These transformed expectations and interactions have created a perception gap about service delivery and are challenging agencies to respond quicker, be more transparent about programs and processes, and provide a better overall customer experience. This article uses the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) in the District of Columbia as a case study of how one agency developed a strategy to address this perception gap. The strategy is based on a three pronged approach: rebalancing the workload to be less reactive, reducing the amount of reactive work and the amount coming in through customer calls by adopting proactive measures, and rapidly responding to service requests. The strategy was implemented through a series of initiatives including business process enhancements through the infusion of technology, adopting a data-based decision making approach, innovative contracting, smart asset management, and a better aligned communication strategy and proactive customer outreach. DDOT saw positive outcomes as a result of these initiatives, including reduced service requests, more proactive work, quicker response times, and overall increase in customer satisfaction.

The current strategy is to mandate the use of BIM for government projects as a way of integrating the design, construction and operation of publicly procured buildings. This aspiration represents a partial turn away from a focus on managerialist agendas towards a belief in the power of digital practices to achieve the aspiration of integrated working, collaboration and innovation, a trend that is being reflected globally in relation to both national and firm-level policy interventions. This paper subjects this so-called BIM revolution' to critical scrutiny. By drawing on theories of the digital divide, a critical discourse is developed around the ways in which political reform agendas centred on BIM might not stimulate innovation on a wider scale, but could act to disenfranchise small firms that are unable (or unwilling) to engage with them. This critical analysis presents important new research questions around the technocratic optimism that pervades the current reform discourse, the trajectory of industry development that it creates and the policy process itself.

Little was known about the marketing practice in architectural firms in Singapore. Attempts were made to determine the realities of formalized marketing approaches and their importance to architectural firms in Singapore through a questionnaire survey (where 95 architectural firms participated) and follow-up interviews. A total of 34 usable responses were collected. This was investigated using the Architecture Business Development Process' as a framework, which found evidence to suggest that marketing has been recognized as an important component of architectural practice in Singapore. The results show that the adoption of the marketing concept' in the architecture profession is still in its formative stages. Architectural firms - and small and medium ones in particular - need to fully capitalize on this area of business knowledge in order to influence, command and understand the market for them to remain financially viable as a practice. Despite little attention being paid to measuring the performance of marketing outcomes, almost all the respondents and interviewees acknowledged its increasing importance. With greater corporate governance, these firms are beginning to realize the significance of marketing, and are evaluating their practices to ride the market for success. This move indicates a positive step in bridging the disparities between architecture practice and design.

J	Osman, H; Baki, MF				Osman, Hany; Baki, Mohammed Fazle			A Cuckoo Search Algorithm to Solve Transfer Line Balancing Problems With Different Cutting Conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Auto industry; cuckoo search (CS); goal programming; production; scheduling	OPTIMAL-DESIGN; SPINDLE HEADS; MIP APPROACH; OPTIMIZATION; DECOMPOSITION	An automated transfer line balancing problem is investigated in this paper. The line produces a complex part at a high volume, such as cylinder heads, and incorporates identical machines that can be operated under different cutting conditions. The selection of cutting conditions significantly influences productivity and the cost of the transfer line. The production of cylinder heads requires machining different operations within a given takt time and satisfying precedence, inclusion, and exclusion relationships. The operations are located on different faces of the cylinder head and are processed by different cutting tools. The line balancing problem is studied to identify the optimal cutting conditions, number of machines and tools, and machining sequence of operations. The objective is to design a balanced transfer line at a minimum machining and tooling cost, and also with minimum nonproductive time. The problem is represented by a goal-programming model and solved for small transfer line configurations through linearization. An improved cuckoo search algorithm via Levy flight is developed to solve large-scale instances. Results of the cuckoo algorithm are promising since it reached optimal and close-to-optimal solutions to small problems and surpassed the results of a random local search approach for instances of medium and large problems.

J	Ibrahim, R; Rahimian, FP				Ibrahim, Rahinah; Rahimian, Farzad Pour			Comparison of CAD and manual sketching tools for teaching architectural design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Conceptual design; VR 3D sketching; Design collaboration; CAD; Protocol analysis	ORGANIZATIONS; KNOWLEDGE	Communications for information synchronisation during the conceptual design phase usually require designers to employ more flexible and intuitive digital design tools. In developing such support tools, a case study research was initiated to first understand the current state of communication among novice design team members. The main purpose of the study is to understand the novice designers' collaboration culture when working on conceptual architectural design projects. The overall case study research involves 1) ethnography for data collection and 2) artefact and protocol analyses for data analysis. This paper presents the latter data analyses based on the earlier ethnography results about novice designers' conceptual design and technology design synthesis strategies. Data analyses on the characteristics of utilised external representation tools indicate that although conventional manual sketching is beneficial for providing rich intuitive design concepts, they have limitations when novice designers need to oversee complicated design problems. The study also found that although current conventional CAD tools are advantageous for detailed engineering design articulation, they do hinder novice designers' creativity due to their intuitive ideation limitation. Based on these results, this paper discusses the identified advantages and challenges of current design media and then proposes an alternative VR-based design interface for enhancing cognition and communication among designers during the conceptual design phase.

Thomas			Synergising R&D initiatives for e-enhancing management support systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction supply chains; Hong Kong; ICT; Information and Knowledge Management; management support systems; performance; R&D		Many R&D projects aim at developing Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) systems for enhancing productivity and performance levels in certain operations within specific segments of construction supply chains e.g. for improved collaborative design management, enhanced material control systems, and streamlined communications management. It is proposed that related R&D outputs now need to be brought together, and efforts made to align future inputs towards a consolidated cluster of systems and tools that could be applied to management support systems across the entire construction supply chain in general. In this context, two ongoing exercises to develop IKM based management support systems for large clients and small and medium contractors respectively are described, and a suggestion made for eventually linking and synergizing the two systems on specific projects through an e-platform for project-based collaborative IKM. This provides an example of the potential synergies in aiming for a convergence of some of the many hitherto parallel (or even divergent) R&D endeavors in construction academia and industry. This should help to overcome some of the obstacles impeding progress towards e-enhanced transactions across the entire supply chain, aiming at efficient e-procurement and e-delivery of construction projects.

An empirical study of consumer perceptions and comprehension of web site privacy policies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-commerce; end user computing management; healthcare; privacy management; privacy policy; trust; user computer interaction	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE; INTERNET PRIVACY; ONLINE; SECURITY; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; TRUST; USERS; MEDIA	The U.S. legislation at both the federal and state levels mandates certain organizations to inform customers about information uses and disclosures. Such disclosures are typically accomplished through privacy policies, both online and offline. Unfortunately, the policies are not easy to comprehend, and, as a result, online consumers frequently do not read the policies provided at healthcare Web sites. Because these policies are often required by law, they should be clear so that consumers are likely to read them and to ensure that consumers can comprehend these policies. This, in turn, may increase consumer trust and encourage consumers to feel more comfortable when interacting with online organizations. In this paper, we present results of an empirical study, involving 993 Internet users, which compared various ways to present privacy policy information to online consumers. Our findings suggest that users perceive typical, paragraph-form policies to be more secure than other forms of policy representation, yet user comprehension of such paragraph-form policies is poor as compared to other policy representations. The results of this study can help managers create more trustworthy policies, aid compliance officers in detecting deceptive organizations, and serve legislative bodies by providing tangible evidence as to the ineffectiveness of current privacy policies.

J	Lam, KC; Oshodi, OS				Lam, Ka Chi; Oshodi, Olalekan Shamsideen			Using Univariate Models for Construction Output Forecasting: Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Econometric Techniques	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Box-Jenkins; Forecasting; Construction output; Support vector machine	PROPERTY PRICE; HONG-KONG; DEMAND; INVESTMENT; MARKET	Forecasting of the volume of construction works plays an important role in ensuring that stakeholders (contractors, consultants, government, etc.) formulate policies for strategic long-term planning in the construction sector. In construction economics, research efforts targeted at construction output forecasting have been limited due to the lack of availability of quantitative data. To address this problem, the current study explores the use of univariate modeling techniques in construction output forecasting. Three univariate modeling techniques [namely, Box-Jenkins, neural network autoregression (NNAR), and support vector machine (SVM)] were used to predict output of various construction sectors. In the literature, the Box-Jenkins model is considered a benchmark univariate method due to its simplicity, sound theoretical basis, and predictive performance. Out-of-sample forecasting was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. The results of the study revealed that the SVM model can reliably and accurately predict residential, maintenance, and total construction output in the medium term. The univariate models reported here can be implemented using historical data on construction output in other countries; this is particularly useful in cases where data are inadequate for multivariate models. The developed SVM model can serve as a tool for estimating future trends in construction output.

By analyzing decision making within a given case context, this paper describes the nature of the investment through the lens of behavioral economics, causality, input-output (IO) equilibrium, and the general notion of depletion of executive energy function. To explore the interplay between these elements, the authors structure the case context via a morphological field in order to construct a fuzzy cognitive map of decision-making relationships relating to the multidimensional and nonquantifiable problems of IT/IS investment evaluation. Noting the significance of inputs and outputs relating to the investment decision within the case, the authors assess these cognitive interrelationships through the lens of the Leontief IO energy equilibrium model. Subsequently, the authors suggest, through an embodied energy audit, that all such management decisions are susceptible to decision fatigue (so-called "ego depletion"). The findings of this paper highlight pertinent cognitive and IO paths of the investment decision-making process that will allow others making similar types of investments to learn from and draw parallels from such processes.

This distinctive opportunity has lead the authors to explore a form of design brief and virtual design studio (VDS) format not well addressed in the literature. Instead of sharing the same design brief, students in this alternative format design a project in the other students' city and do not collaborate on the same design. Collaboration with other students takes the form of teaching each other about the city and culture served by the design. The authors discovered these studios produce a focus on site context that serves our pedagogical objectives - a blend of architectural, landscape architectural and urban design knowledge. Their students use a range of commercial CAD and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) software common to that used in many VDS experiments reported on in the literature. However, this conventional use of technology is contrasted with a second distinctive characteristic of these studios, the use of custom software tools specifically designed to support synchronous and asynchronous three-dimensional model exchange and linked attribute knowledge. The paper analyzes some of the virtual design studio (VDS) work between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the University of Toronto, and the University of Melboume. The authors articulate a framework of VDS dimensions that structures their teaching and research.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was carried out with the support of the PMI Sao Paulo Chapter. Findings - The research brought new evidence which, added to the identification of the main gaps and deficiencies found in the theory. The model then deals with project communication and reflects the advances in administration and organizational communication, enabling evolution in the area of project communication. Research limitations/implications - The fact that this work offers the view presented by just a part of one of the PMI Chapters is a research limitation. The model proposal offers a new approach for the understanding of the PCM process, structured and integrated into the organization. Practical implications - This new vision allows better alignment of projects with the organizational structure of communication. Social implications - This study enables use for media professionals in organizations, enabling better communicability between people. Originality/value - The model contributes to the understanding of communication in projects as a process with several dimensions, facilitating work in a structured integrated way, enabling a better degree of communicability in projects.

One-stop-shop (OSS) is an innovative Product-Service System model that can enable MSEs to offer comprehensive renovation packages instead of existing fragmented solutions. We have applied a conceptual framework for innovation adoption in organizations and conducted an interview of 21 construction MSEs in three different geographical areas in Sweden to examine their perceptions and preparedness to adopt the OSS business concept. Findings showed that the examined MSEs are positive towards OSS as it could address the needs for the comprehensive renovation of detached houses. However, presently, are not prepared to take the coordinator's role in such a concept mainly due to the perceived business risks, the lack of flexibility to organizational restructuring, and lack of resources and management competency to coordinate multiple tasks and actors. Those organizations lacked awareness of existing policy support and access to funding mechanisms to try new business models. As a solution, they proposed an external coordinator to be the provider of OSS, on the trial phase, whose role and characteristics need to be further examined.

For this purpose, three groups of dolomite from north western Iran, with the same mineral composition but different grain size, were selected; fine grain, medium grain and coarse grain. Three sets of laboratory experiments are performed on 32 samples: first; petrography tests for determining mineral composition and their percentage, and microstructure of rock containing grain size and grain size distribution, second; experiments to determine the physical properties of the rocks included density, compressional and shear wave velocity, and the third category of experiments included uniaxial compressive strength test, Brazilian tensile strength and point load strength. According to the results; there are significant positive correlation between grain size and uniaxial compressive strength (r = 0.89), point load strength (r = 0.58), Brazilian strength (r = 0.69), and average Young's modulus (r = 0.64). Also, with increasing grain size, density decreases (r = -0.77). There is strong correlation between compressional wave velocity and shear velocity (r = 0.88). There are also a strong correlation among the uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength and point load strength.

Developing reliable and accurate predictive models is vital to implementing effective response strategies to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations. The purpose of this paper is to compare the accuracy of two univariate forecast models, i.e. Box-Jenkins (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)) and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR). Design/methodology/approach - Four quarterly time-series data on the construction output of Hong Kong were collected (1983Q1-2014Q4). The collected data were divided into two parts. The first part was fitted to the model, while the other was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. Findings - The NNAR model can provide reliable and accurate forecast of total, private and "others" construction output for the medium term. In addition, the NNAR model outperforms the ARIMA model, in terms of accuracy. Research limitations/implications - The applicability of the NNAR model to the construction industry of other countries could be further explored. The main limitation of artificial intelligence models is the lack of explanatory capability. Practical implications - The NNAR model could be used as a tool for accurately predicting future patterns in construction output. This is vital for the sustained growth of the construction industry and the economy. Originality/value - This is the first study to apply the NNAR model to construction output forecasting research.

It is important to maintain accurate and up-to-date information stored in a BIM so that it can become a reliable data source throughout the service life of a facility. Laser scanning technology is able to capture accurate geometric data in the form of a point cloud and to depict the existing condition of a building. Hence, point cloud data captured by laser scans can be used as references to update a given BIM. An important step during the update process is to match segments of elements captured by a point cloud to building components modeled in a BIM, so that the discrepancies between the two data sets can be identified. Typically, features depicted within point cloud segments and BIM components are used in the matching process. However, understanding is limited regarding which features enable the matching process and how these features perform. This paper describes six feature-based matching approaches that match segments of a point cloud to components modeled in a BIM. Next, it discusses the results of an experimental analysis conducted to evaluate the performance of different features used to match mechanical equipment and ductwork captured by point clouds to the corresponding objects modeled in an as-designed BIM.

Changes in energy demand from low-energy homes	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						behaviour; buildings; domestic; energy; energy demand; energy performance; longitudinal study; time		To measure change in energy demand, a follow-up study was conducted in 2005-2007 of 36 'low-energy' UK dwellings that were originally monitored for hourly energy consumption between 1989 and 1991. All results were compared under standardized daily external winter conditions of 5 degrees C. Overall, no significant evidence of change over 15-17 years was found in average gas consumption (67 kWh/day, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) = 55, 79) and average electricity usage (14 kWh/day; 95% CI = 11, 18). Dwellings were then classified into low, middle, and high groups according to energy usage in 1990. Gas usage of the high group at follow-up was 107 kWh/day (95% CI = 89, 125) in 2005-2007, and was consistent with increased floor space, but electricity consumption increased by 72% to 24 kWh/day (95% CI = 18, 30). The high group comprised dwellings that were both larger originally than in the other groups and they were more likely to have been extended. These results are broadly consistent with national statistics that show a distribution of household energy expenditure increasingly skewed towards those on highest incomes. Findings suggest that efficiency measures remain effective over the medium-term, but once implemented, little further improvement is made by occupants. Energy policy should focus on households with the highest consumption as this is where potential reductions are greatest and increases in gas and electricity usage are most are likely to occur.

An Analysis of Partnership Networks in the Enterprise Software Industry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complementarity; dynamic capabilities; enterprise software industry; independent software vendors (ISV); partnership networks; resource-based view; small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME)	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; SYSTEMS; STRATEGY; FIRMS; OPPORTUNITIES; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; MODULARITY; WEB	In the enterprise software industry, large providers (hubs) are fostering partner networks with smaller companies (spokes) that complement their platforms. This study takes the perspective of these spokes and seeks to understand their motivation to partner. It is the first to simultaneously examine two theoretical perspectives that help explain partnership formation. The input-oriented perspective holds that organizations enter inter-firm arrangements in order to access external resources and capabilities. The output-oriented perspective posits that the complementarity of the partners' products influences the benefits obtained from a partnership. In order to examine the relevancy and possible interaction of these two perspectives, a multiple-case study is conducted. Qualitative data from 17 spoke organizations is gathered and thoroughly analyzed. The study confirms that the hub's reputation and its capability to provide integrated systems are generally important reasons for partnering. However, the extent to which the hub's innovativeness and its commercial capital motivate spokes to partner varies substantially. The key finding of this study is that these variations can be explained by differences in the level of product complementarity. This leads to the conclusion that there is a widely neglected interaction effect between the input-and output-oriented perspectives in explaining the formation of hub-and-spoke partnerships.

J	Yu, JY; Leung, MY				Yu, Jingyu; Leung, Mei-yung			Structural Stakeholder Model in Public Engagement for Construction Development Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Interests; Power; Public engagement; Stakeholder; Structural equation model	MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; POWER; INFRASTRUCTURE; SATISFACTION; DIALOGUE	Construction development projects are often complicated and influence multiple stakeholders with different requirements and interests. Public engagement (PE) has emerged as a prerequisite for collecting stakeholders' opinions and involving them in the planning and decision making of construction development projects. It is not easy to identify and manage stakeholders in PE because different stakeholders possess different types of power and interests that have the potential to dramatically affect stakeholder behaviors and final project outcomes. However, the effects of stakeholder attributes (i.e.,power and interest) on stakeholder management in PE and final PE outcomes have been insufficiently studied. This study aimed to investigate the complicated relationships between stakeholders' power, interests, and PE outcomes through a questionnaire survey. An integrated model for stakeholder power, interest, and PE outcomes was developed using a structural equation model. The results showed that different forms of power and interest influenced final PE outcomes either directly or indirectly. PE organizers are encouraged to directly involve project teams, experts, and reputable stakeholders in the PE process and allow the media and nongovernmental organizations to monitor the decision-making process. The findings of this study will contribute to stakeholder management for PE in construction projects by developing a structural model that can be adopted to identify stakeholder power and interests and engage appropriate stakeholders in the decision-making process. It is expected to improve PE outcomes and enhance stakeholder satisfaction for construction development projects.

The facade is one of the largest main components of a building, which could strongly contribute to the sustainability performance for the whole building. Previous studies started defining tools to assess facade sustainability, although relevant indicators were dismissed or, if considered, they were rather subjectively quantified. Likewise, most existing tools omit stakeholder satisfaction in the assessment process for optimal facade systems. In this regard, this paper presents a new systematic approach based on the Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) for holistic sustainability assessment of building facade systems by integrating stakeholders' satisfaction in the decision-making process. To this end, for the first time to the authors' best knowledge, the most representative and discriminative indicators for quantifying facade sustainability were identified to define a new approach to minimize subjectivity in the decision-making process and, consequently, to ease the task of decision makers when choosing and designing facade alternatives for new buildings and rehabilitation. This approach is validated and initially applied to assess the six most common residential facade systems in Barcelona, Spain. Results indicate that these building elements have low to medium sustainability performance.

Framework to Evaluate Energy-Saving Potential from Occupancy Interventions in Typical Commercial Buildings in the United States	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Commercial buildings; Energy efficiency; United States; Commercial buildings; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Agent-based modeling; Social subnetworks	NORMATIVE SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; EXTREMISM PROPAGATION; NETWORK ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; OPINION; CONSERVATION	Occupancy-focused interventions to reduce building energy use have been shown to be effective but often result in unsustained energy reductions. In addition, these interventions have rarely been applied to commercial buildings. Research on residential buildings has linked the success of these interventions to the buildings' social structures. However, the results cannot be directly applied to commercial buildings given their complex social structures formed by independent entities (i.e.,companies) with different organizational structures and cultures within a building. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is developed to (1)provide a more realistic representation of social subnetworks in commercial buildings, (2)model interactions between occupants and the resulting peer pressure to change their energy-use characteristics based on the relative agreement interaction model, and (3)evaluate the efficiency of occupancy interventions for different subnetwork characteristics on a typical medium-sized office building in the United States. Statistical analyses are performed and recommendations made on how to improve energy conservation from occupancy interventions by as much as 24.7%. The contributions of this research to the fields of computing and energy conservation are significant and can be used to shape future occupancy interventions for more effective and sustained energy reductions in commercial buildings.

The effects have resonated in various disciplines, such as organizational efficiency, communication approach, and employee behavior. However, a comprehensive and in-depth review of the ICT applied in the AEC organization is missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this paper presents an in-depth review of mainstream studies of ICT-supported AEC organizations published in last 15years (1998-2012). A total of 145 articles from 12 construction and IT-related journals are identified and have been thoroughly reviewed. This review is divided into four parts: (1)synthesis and general trend of existing literature; (2)lessons learned from ICT practical implementation; (3)enabling technologies of ICT applications; and (4)ICT-induced organizational outcomes. Throughout this paper the authors summarize and categorize developments to date, discuss the advances and limitations of the use of ICT, and propose key areas for future research. This review can become a foundation for the classification and integration of the state of the art in ICT research on behalf of AEC organizations. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Yang, KP; Chiao, YC; Kuo, CC				Yang, Kuo-Pin; Chiao, Yu-Ching; Kuo, Chih-Chung			The Relationship Between R&D Investment and Firm Profitability Under a Three-Stage Sigmoid Curve Model: Evidence From an Emerging Economy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Optimal level; performance; research and development (R&D); sigmoid (S) curve; threshold	PRODUCT INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; INDUSTRY; GROWTH; SIZE	The relationship between investment in research and development (R&D) and firm performance has been the subject of numerous academic investigations, but the findings of these investigations have varied greatly, with research revealing a number of different patterns in the R&D-performance relationship. This inconsistency may be partly attributable to the failure of the commonly used linear modeling method to capture the full dynamics of the R&D-performance relationship. Based on the sigmoid (S) curve paradigm, as well as on other economic foundations, this study proposes the use of a three-stage S-curve model to help reconcile the disparities in the literature. This S-curve model shows that the relationship between R&D intensity and firm profitability is nonlinear, with the slope negative at low levels (stage 1), positive at medium levels (stage 2), and negative again at high levels of R&D investment (stage 3). Empirical evidence from a sample of 377 publicly listed Taiwanese high-tech manufacturing firms and 179 nonhigh-tech firms, examined during the period between 2000 and 2007, confirmed our proposed model. This study not only establishes a relationship pattern that differs from that shown in past studies, but also has important managerial implications for R&D managers and important policy implications for governments.

This article offers an overview of the development of the NPD management literature published over the last ten years (2008 to 2018) in 1226 peer-reviewed articles. By applying bibliometric analysis, we have discovered the existence of five research clusters focused on the following main thematic areas: the NPD process, the integration of diverse knowledge sources for NPD optimization, the relationship between NPD and corporate strategy, the role of users and consumers in the NPD process, and the supplier involvement in the NPD activities. In respect of each area, we selected and reviewed the most relevant contributions and presented the emerging theoretical approaches and best practices.

J	Lam, TT; Mahdjoubi, L; Mason, J				Thep Thanh Lam; Mahdjoubi, Lamine; Mason, Jim			A FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST IN THE ANALYSIS OF RISKS AND REWARDS OF ADOPTING BIM FOR SMES IN THE UK	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; risk; reward; SMEs; involvement phase; project value; source of funding; procurement route	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; E-BUSINESS; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; ENTERPRISES; SIMULATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS	Building information modelling (BIM) adoption amongst larger construction firms and innovators seems to be on the increase. However, there is evidence to suggest that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are currently lagging behind and are losing out in winning publicly funded projects. Guidance and frameworks to assist SMEs to make an informed decision about BIM adoption are currently lacking. There has been no systematic effort to date to bring together the results of research in SMEs' BIM adoption. Consequently, this paper seeks to bridge this gap and provide a conceptual framework to give a theoretical foundation to the study of brokering risks and rewards in the adoption of BIM for project delivery. This framework is comprehensive and includes trading off risks and rewards associated with several criteria, such as stage of involvement, project value, funding, and the procurement route chosen. The approach has been validated by a representative sample of BIM users and the findings of the validation are also presented. The findings of the framework validation reveal that early design stage, project size between 5 pound m and 50 pound m, private funding, and integrated project delivery procurement are the best opportunities that enable SMEs to maximise the benefits and minimise the risks, when adopting BIM.

The governments of various countries have encouraged firms to adopt OGD to develop innovative products and services to bring about social and economic benefits. This paper examines the factors influencing the adoption of OGD among firms in Taiwan to fill a gap that prior studies do not adequately address. Based on the sociotechnical perspective, we developed a research model that integrates the following factors that are central to adoption decisions of firms: top management support, government support, competitive pressure, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We examined this model through survey data from firms with experience in OGD adoption in Taiwan. The results show a significant positive relationship among top management support, competitive pressure, and the adoption of OGD by firms. This paper serves as a first attempt to contribute to advancing knowledge on OGD adoption at the firm level via empirically testing a research model that integrates factors within social and technical systems. This paper has significant implications for practitioners of enterprise information management and creates a valuable reference for other countries in the early stages of OGD initiatives.

J	Wembe, PT				Tchumtcha Wembe, Paulin			Managing stakeholders in EPCM projects in Africa by Western project managers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Leadership; culture; influence; decision making; project management	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONFLICT; SATISFACTION; EXPECTATIONS; BENEFITS; TASK	Due to a number of issues - political, social, historical, personal contexts, and technical - large EPCM companies find it difficult to manage projects stakeholders properly in Africa. The Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management projects (EPCM) are complex, customised, and produce highly unique products. Project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) highlights that projects and the workforce are generally temporary in nature. Literature reviews and media reports show that EPCM projects are poorly managed in Africa by Western companies. Some of these problems are caused by a gap between companies and projects in Africa. To take up these challenges, this paper presents a research methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative (observation and survey of practising project managers) working in large EPCM projects, to understand local stakeholders' needs and the iterative improvement of communication directly upon projects. Multi-method research technique was used for this study. The paper shows the practical feasibility of the management approach using field observation. The field observation provides evidence that the qualitative approach is well suited to support the development and implementation of effective and efficient mechanisms in large projects. The research has revealed that stakeholders should be effectively integrated in the organisation management processes to improve project success. The research makes a significant contribution to stakeholder management by presenting how Western project managers should manage stakeholders in EPCM project in Africa.

But some key parts are so difficult to enter by manpower and equipment, making it extremely challenging to detect (e.g. the bottoms of small and medium bridges, urban underground culverts, etc.). Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic solution including two parts: a deep learning method and an unmanned surface vessel (USV) to efficaciously detect damage. For the detection algorithm, a novel anchor-free network, CenWholeNet, which focuses on center points and holistic information, is proposed. The attention mechanism was also introduced into the model innovatively and a parallel attention module (PAM) was put forward. Sufficient ablation experiments substantiate that PAM can enhance the representation capability of models with negligible computational overheads. For the smart device, a USV system without the global positioning systems (GPS) navigation is proposed, supporting real-time transmission of lidar and video information. The presented solution was applied to the inspection of a bridge group, which verified the effectiveness and applicability of the solution to complex projects. Furthermore, the results corroborate that, compared with the influential objective detection methods, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5, CenWholeNet is more suitable for the detection of multiple diseases with variable slenderness ratios and complex shapes. Therefore, CenWholeNet is expected to become a new paradigm of intelligent damage detection for infrastructure.

To enable the productivity and sustainable economic growth across the African continent, the infrastructure development projects are needed. Recently Africa has become a destination of Chinese Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM) companies. The majority of these large Chinese EPCM companies find it difficult to manage projects in the way that satisfy all stakeholders in Africa due to a number of issues - political, social, historical, personal contexts, and technical. Chinese management approach is regarded as informal by nature generally referred as guanxi management. Literature review and media reports reveal that Chinese model of managing stakeholders in projects is characterized by the informal management approach (guanxi). The informal Chinese management is vital to projects success in China therefore, it is important to explore the informal (guanxi) management approach in EPCM projects in Africa. This paper investigates how Chinese Project Managers manage stakeholders in EPCM in Africa by adopting a mix research method to investigate the Chinese stakeholder management approach in West Africa. The research uses a field observation and survey questionnaires. It is found in practice that the Chinese only use guanxi management approach when certain stakeholders such as project owners and sponsors, in addition, the whole stakeholders' group in EPCM projects are not all satisfied with the informal (guanxi) management approach of the Chinese PM.

This is increasingly critical in the context of complex multiparticipant construction projects. Clashes of organizational, operational, national, and/or professional cultures point to the need for "relational integration" as a prerequisite for such synergistic teamworking. This paper draws on recent approaches to promoting trust and cooperation through (1) basic teambuilding techniques in general and (2) partnering and alliancing in construction projects. It then focuses on analyzing the views of Singapore-based contractors as derived from a survey to elicit the hypothesized 28 factors facilitating relationally integrated teambuilding, and 31 factors deterring such integration in construction project teams. On the whole:, (1) 27 of the 28 factors facilitating integrated project team, and 26 of the 31 factors deterring integrated project team, are significant; (2) these two sets of factors could be represented by four and five "broad factors," respectively; and (3) except,in a few cases, respondents from large and medium companies, as well as with and without experience in RC, have similar perceptions of the importance levels of different factors. These two sets of critical factors, as identified in this paper, complement two other previously isolated sets of factors that facilitate or deter a "relational contracting" culture. Taken together, they feed into a consolidated strategy for releasing the latent energies and potential synergies that should yield the much higher construction project performance levels that have been called for worldwide.

This paper examines the political tensions that occur when such processes unfold as well as their implications for project management. By doing so, the paper counterbalances the prescriptive and normative literature on "New Ways of Working" which largely overlooks the political complexity of such projects. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a qualitative study of a triple design process in a media company. Data collection mainly consists of a nine-month process of non-participant observation of weekly meetings held by the strategic group in charge of the project. Semi-structured interviews with members of the executive committee have also been conducted. Findings The analysis illustrates how space, organization and technology are gradually designed and structured. Four interconnected and often concealed mechanisms that support triple design processes are identified: political tensions, unexpected twists, conflicting temporalities and arbitration measures. Originality/value The originality of the paper lies in breaking down the concept of design in three separate objects - organization, space and technology - and examining how these objects were conjointly problematized by an organization in transformation, whereas existing studies often investigate organization design, space design or technology design in isolation.

How would such strategies cope with a changing climate? Natural ventilation is promoted by the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its recently launched carbon reduction strategy. NHS energy targets are reviewed in the context of UK national and international targets. Examination of the targets suggests customary environmental design strategies for new hospitals will not deliver the performance required. Perceived barriers to the implementation of more naturally driven environments in healthcare buildings are discussed, particularly the risk of air-borne cross-infection. Environmental design propositions for specific clinical and non-clinical space-types are created, catalogued, and aggregated into a typical plan component, their ventilation and energy performance modelled and factored to the scale of a 200-bed hospital to current NHS service delivery policies. The exercise suggests 70% of net floor area of small-to-medium-sized acute hospitals could be naturally ventilated. A hybrid ventilation strategy may serve a further 10% of net floor area. Patients and staff may benefit from more naturally sustained environments. Indications of the predicted comparative energy performance, potentially reduced to 38 MJ/100 m(3), and capital and life cycle costs are provided.	[Short, C.

On this backdrop, we report from a three-year collaborative action research project in Software, Inc., aimed at increasing the benefits of their metrics program. The perceived challenge was not to improve individual metrics, but rather to more effectively integrate the metrics program as a whole into the managerial and organizational context at Software, Inc. To organize the results, we used Pettigrew's framework for studying organizational change, emphasizing the content, the context, and the process of the improvement effort. We considered the content of improvement through an information-centric analysis of the program as a medium for interactions between stakeholders; this analysis focused on the usage of metrics and helped redesign the program. The context was taken into account through an organization-centric analysis of management practices, organizational structures, people, and technical systems involved in executing the metrics program; this analysis focused on operation of the program and helped understand how to implement the new program. Finally, the improvement process was guided by the IDEAL model for innovating software practices; this approach helped combine different analyses into a coherent change effort. The paper presents this contextual approach to improving software metrics practices; it presents the results of applying it in Software, Inc.; and offers lessons for how managers can use contextual approaches to increase the benefits of software metrics programs.

J	Taliento, M				Taliento, Marco			Corporate Valuation: Looking Beyond the Forecast Period Through New "Fuzzy Lenses"	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Economics; Cost accounting; Fuzzy logic; Uncertainty; Data models; Lenses; Corporate valuation; discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis; forecast period; fuzzy logic; terminal value	INVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING; EXPERT-SYSTEMS; LOGIC; MODEL; SELECTION; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; ESSAY; FIRMS; COST	Novel suggestions and insights on corporate valuation are provided adopting a still unconventional approach: fuzzy logic. It recalls the (Sophist) concepts of imprecision, vagueness, and ambiguity, overcoming the common (Aristotelian/Boolean) logic founded on dichotomy. Fuzziness has been applied to economics and appears, for most part in cognitive contexts characterized by uncertainty and complexity, growingly adequate to business and information sciences. In this paper, our goal is to revisit and expose the future horizon value attributable to a business after n years (in the medium and long term, beyond the normal five-to-ten-year forecast period) through a fuzzy multivalent number, rather than a limiting crisp (single-valued) one. Since the "continuing" or "terminal" value is a big slice of the overall corporate value, such "picture" results in an amusing and suggestive (impressionistic) visualization, as financial numbers are looked through deconstructing and zooming lens. Abductively, absolute conclusions on business values are precluded, but several levels of feasibility or adequacy are possible, showing a blurry multiplicity of gathered numbers. The fuzzy approach enlarges the extent of the sensitivity analysis made by the expert (appraiser) and enables the decision makers (administration) having for processes or predictions more information with characteristics of completeness, transparency, and credibility. Finally, the approach sheds light on different value possibilities rather than sharply estimating and releasing only one single (most likely) value.

During this process, the number of collaborative ventures to mitigate the burden of entry risks has greatly increased. This study aims to investigate the formation of construction firms' collaborative networks for performing international projects from both the LC and SMC network perspectives. To this end, 389 real cases of overseas projects executed by Korean firms over the last two decades that involved collaboration were analyzed using social network analysis (SNA) approach. The result showed that LCs and SMCs have different perspectives when pursuing collaborative ventures for overseas construction projects; LCs have a tendency to form large and dense networks, whereas SMCs prefer to maintain long-term and targeted relationships. Moreover, this study showed a series of apparent tendencies in the development of collaboration networks to realize better profit performance under risky project conditions. Through analysis based on real cases, this study validated the applicability of SNA in analyzing the collaboration in the construction domain. More importantly, this study is useful as an aid for developing collaboration strategies to achieve better outcomes while considering the relevant network patterns and their different levels of performance under the assorted network attributes.

Despite these advances there remains a tendency for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) to be used as the medium to assist in the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I) systems within heavy industrial engineering projects. In this paper, a retrospective OOM (i.e., Systems Information Model (SIM)), for the E&I systems of a utility facility, which was constructed for an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the purpose of undertaking a construct ability assessment prior to the commencement of construction is presented and discussed. The CAD drawings and cable schedule produced by the EPC were provided to an E&I organization to undertake a constructability assessment; errors, omissions and information redundancy were identified and quantified. The SIM model was then used to examine a tender proposal from a construction subcontractor (CS) of the EPC; discrepancies were identified and it is suggested that differences arose due to the prevailing errors and omissions. The potential use of a SIM during construction as a quality assurance/control (QA/QC) is then examined, as it is suggested that it can be used to ensure the development of an 'As-built' model and provide a realistic representation of the constructed asset, which safeguards its integrity for operations and maintenance.

Biofuel Production: Utilizing Stakeholders' Perspectives	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Biofuel; Decision-Making; Pyrolysis; Stakeholder Requirements	TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; BIOMASS; PYROLYSIS	The use of biofuels as a replacement for fossil fuels is growing in the United States and other countries in part because of economic and environmental concerns. One of the technologies for biofuels production is fast pyrolysis; however, to increase manufacturing of fast pyrolysis units, a better understanding of stakeholders' requirements and perspectives is needed. This is a complex decision problem. Due to the diversity of perspectives, each group of stakeholders has their own unique requirements, which in total will determine the right manufacturing approach. Previous studies either investigated optimal sizing from a single viewpoint or have combined a subset of perspectives. This study applies multiple tools to develop a more comprehensive view of stakeholders' perspectives. Individual subject matter experts were asked to review and prioritize a set of requirements that reflected different stakeholders' perspectives, including economic, environmental, technical, social, and legal. The perspectives were then used to analyze multiple fast pyrolysis units to determine which size was the most effective in meeting the perspectives in total. The analysis indicated that the smallest unit, able to process an average of 50 tons per day, is the best alternative when viewed from the economic, technical, social, and legal perspectives. However, when viewed from the environmental perspective, a medium-sized unit, able to process in the range of 200-500 tons per day, is the best alternative. This work provides the basis for further discussions about the individual perspectives, including the economic and environmental perspectives of biofuel production. Potential avenues for further work in assessment of stakeholders' requirements are also noted.

While their great importance has been discussed extensively, very scarce detailed research has been published on 3DP parameters that are incorporated into the design process at an early stage to assess their impact on 3D printing performance, focusing on geometric conformity aspects. This work aims to provide a comprehensive parametric design investigation, driven by 3DP parameters, related to infill and overhang control, which can enhance a deeper understanding of their use in construction scale of non-conventional wall components, placing emphasis on construction time performance minimization. To this end, the paper initially illustrates the development of a parametric-integrated algorithm for toolpath planning and 3DP control using an industrial robot, capable of being universally adjusted based on open-source extruders with small, medium and large nozzle diameters. In this study, earth and clay-based materials are chosen because of their lower environmental impact and recyclability compared to concrete-based materials. Secondly, important printing parameters for toolpath planning, robotic and nozzle control, as well as robotic printing time, are presented and discussed in detail through 3DP experimental tests and a non-conventional wall study. The correlation of parameters in the early stage of design allows the assessment of their effectiveness to be used in construction-scale of non-conventional geometries towards minimization of 3DP time performance.

Moderating Effect of Senior Management Support on the Relationship Between Schedule Delay Factors and Project Performance	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Schedule Delay Factors; Project Performance; Senior Management Support; Construction Projects; Continuous Improvement; Decision Making & Risk Management; Leadership; Program & Project Management	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COST PERFORMANCE; BUILDING-PROJECTS; COMMUNICATION; SUCCESS; PRECONSTRUCTION; IDENTIFICATION; COORDINATION	Schedule delays in construction projects are often a major concern and considered as a global phenomenon in the construction industry. In regards to project delivery, lack of senior management support is one of the main issues that impact project outcomes. This empirical research study aims to investigate the moderating effect of senior management support on the relationship between schedule delay factors and project performance. A questionnaire survey method was adopted to collect data from project directors, project managers, civil and construction engineers, project supervisors, and experts from small, medium, and large construction companies from major cities in Pakistan. A response rate of 84% was obtained based on 310 valid responses from a sample of 368 potential participants that received the survey. The cross-sectional data were used to test direct relationships and moderating effects through regression analysis and "process" method, respectively. The findings indicate that schedule delays in construction projects occur due to lack of commitment, insufficient site management, poor site coordination, lack of clarity in project scope, lack of communication and substandard contracts, in addition to major delays owing to improper planning. Moreover, the relationship between schedule delay factors and project performance is moderated by all dimensions of senior management support, i.e. providing resources, structural arrangements, communication, expertise, and power.

The Role of Technology in the Project Manager Performance Model	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						project performance; project leadership; interpretive structural modeling (ISM); information technology (IT); knowledge management (KM); project management (PM)	KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	Technology assumes importance in the context of project management due to greater challenges in today's technology-enabled work environment, where technology tools are routinely used for collaboration, communication, and deployment of project management practices. It is becoming common practice for even co-located project teams to use the electronic medium for these purposes. Notwithstanding the importance of technology, research has shown that it is difficult to associate the use of technology with business performance and the absence of such relation can be extrapolated to project performance as well. However, technology can play a major role in supporting project managers in managing projects effectively and efficiently. Several studies have addressed the importance and leadership style of project managers. However, specific roles and responsibilities of a project manager toward the project team is an area that needs further study. In this research effort, using the literature review, important people-related factors of project performance are identified. Then structured personal interviews were used to gather data for understanding relations among these factors in order to develop a project manager performance model. The model was developed employing the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The model was used to determine the role of the project manager in managing the project team and improving the project performance. Results show that both leadership and management roles are important. This study helped to analyze underlying interactions among these factors and, consequently, understand the supportive function of technology to the project manager in improving project performance.

However, information asymmetries in present markets indicate the supply side fails to meet the building information needs of the demand side about the quality, performance and service provided by a facility. Therefore, when property is traded, the demand side's willingness to pay for value decreases and the initial price becomes the decisive factor. The question is raised whether the quality or the performance approach might stimulate the market to provide sufficient building information to counter asymmetric information. It is argued that both concepts are moving towards one another, that they are complementary and that they can form the basis of an interchanging communication medium. A comprehensive building information system is proposed that serves as a knowledge basis from which certain building information can be extracted depending on the type of enquiry. An array of indicators and criteria is categorized to allocate/match information on buildings to the parties involved. It is argued that creating an effective information exchange between market participants leads to a 'win-win' situation for the demand and supply sides in particular and for the whole construction and property industry in general. The details of this paper are related to housing property markets.

The conceptual stage of the design process is essentially an artistic activity unencumbered with accuracy, dimensionality, scale, program or even tectonics, albeit all of these maybe tacitly present at the 'back of a designer's mind'. Artistic activities involve broad mental processes that are beneath the stratum of consciousness. By definition, consciousness is selective awareness; it is linear in execution and limited in its capability to synthesize complex parameters. One of the central questions of this paper is "if artistic process requires one to abandon, or relinquish conscious purpose at the time of the generation of the work of art, and if the early stages of artistic process is a result of a vast number of 'unconscious' forces and impulses, then how can the computer, which demands (and thus propagates) geometric precision, focused operation and rational execution, be part of that process?" This paper will explore bow, cybernetically, the computer can be 'coupled' with 'self' (via a visual interface) and the artistic process. Three specially devised conceptual design exercises-namely BlurrDesign, BlinDesign and BlitzDesign-and three corresponding "interruptive" computer interface modifications were deployed in an introduction to digital media course. The results of this study are now under consideration for their effectiveness in promoting conceptual design using the computer, and how the 'self' might form a cybernetic whole with the machine. The findings could have implications in design pedagogy, informatics and interface design. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In order to improve the management of diverse infrastructure systems, decision makers should be mindful of infrastructure failure interdependencies (IFIs) and associated stakeholders when the failure of a particular infrastructure occurs. Currently, approaches to identify IFIs and associated stakeholders rely heavily on expert knowledge or limited historical records. To complement the shortage of empirical evidence, a synthetic approach that exploits media news is proposed to delineate the patterns of IFIs and stakeholders associated with the initial infrastructure failure. The integrated approach collects and cleanses the corpus from news articles, prepares the domain knowledge components, recognizes the affected infrastructure and stakeholder entities, verifies the information captured, applies association rule learning to discover IFI chains, and adopts a network analysis to depict associated stakeholders. Incidents of bursting water pipes in Hong Kong are used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed approach with 2,828 news articles being collected and analyzed. Altogether, 18 one-order or second-order IFI rules are identified. Besides, 25 associated stakeholders are delineated from the news, and they are divided into three tiers according to their degree centralities. The findings provide insightful information to policymakers for helping to respond to the cascading effects among infrastructures and coordinate a wide spectrum of stakeholders who might be embroiled.

Introduction of flexible elements at the base of a structure and at the same time ensuring enough damping is the evocative alternate option to mitigate seismic hazard. The device that is capable to meet such criteria is known as isolator. This paper covers design of base isolators for multi-storey buildings in medium risk seismicity region and the structural response evaluation. Automated nonlinear models for dynamic response investigation have been configured. Finite element method (FEM) has been incorporated to envisage the structural response behaviors. Lead rubber bearing (LRB) and high damping rubber bearing (HDRB) have been chosen for inserting isolator link element in structural base. The nonlinearities of rubber-steel bearing have been duly considered. Linear static, linear dynamic and nonlinear dynamic analyses due to site-specific earthquake accelerogram are performed for both fixed based (FB) and base isolated (BI) buildings. Both time domain and frequency domain approaches have been carried out for dynamic solution. It was found that for multi-storey buildings, base isolation diminishes muscular amount of structural responses compared to the conventional fixed base (non-isolated) structures. Allowable higher horizontal displacement induces structural flexibility. The suggested isolation technique is competent to mitigate the structural hazard even under strong seismic vulnerability in optimum manner. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Islam, A. B.

The aim of this paper is to rank SMEs failure factors in order to identify the most influential ones. Identification of the most influential factors can help SMEs develop an optimal strategy for improving a business environment and remove obstacles they encounter while conducting business. In addition, the existing and future entrepreneurs/managers would become aware of potential obstacles. Therefore, they would be able to prepare an appropriate response to overcome these obstacles. For the ranking of the failure factors of SMEs, the hybrid Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)-Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) model was used, which represents a new approach to ranking of the failure factors. The ABC method was applied to the obtained results in order to separate the group of the most influential factors. This group includes the following factors: Economic issues, Possibility of increasing capacity, Political issues, the Supply of electricity, Management of receivables/payables and Legislative issues. The obtained results indicate that the main problems which SMEs encounter come from the environment in which they operate, as well as from SMEs themselves. Therefore, there is an additional need to improve the business environment for SMEs, and also to identify these factors and resolve the problems in order to reduce the potential SMEs failure.

J	Kim, H; Ham, Y				Kim, Hongjo; Ham, Youngjib			Participatory sensing-based geospatial localization of distant objects for disaster preparedness in urban built environments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Geospatial localization; Participatory sensing; Urban built environments	SOCIAL MEDIA; INFRASTRUCTURE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Although the benefit of participatory sensing for collecting local data over large areas has long been recognized, it has not been widely used for various applications such as disaster preparation due to a lack of geospatial localization capability with respect to a distant object. In such applications, objects of interest need to be robustly localized and documented for supporting data-driven decision-making in site inspection and resource mobilization. However, participatory sensing is inappropriate to localize a distant object due to the absence of ranging sensors in citizens' mobile devices; thus, the localization accuracy varies to a large extent. To address this issue, this study presents a novel geospatial localization method for distant objects based on participatory sensing. The proposed geospatial localization process consists of multiple computational modules a geographic coordinate conversion, mean-shift clustering, deep learning-based object detection, magnetic declination adjustment, line of sight equation formulation, and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse method to improve the localization accuracy in participatory sensing environments. The experiments were conducted in Houston and College Station in Texas to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrated a reasonable localization accuracy, recording the distance errors of 1.5 m to 27.8 m when the distance from observers to the objects of interest were 17 m to 296 m. The proposed method is expected to contribute to rapid data collection over large urban areas, thereby facilitating disaster preparedness that needs to identify locations of distant objects at risk.

J	Nguyen, THD; Chileshe, N; Rameezdeen, R; Wood, A				Tan Hai Dang Nguyen; Chileshe, Nicholas; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen; Wood, Anthony			Stakeholder Influence Pathways in Construction Projects: Multicase Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						External stakeholders; Stakeholder influence pathways; Construction projects; Project management; Stakeholder management; Vietnam	IMPACT ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; POWER; PERCEPTION; VIETNAM; MEDIA; MEGAPROJECTS; COMMUNITY; COVERAGE; VALIDITY	Understanding external stakeholders' influence is essential to achieving success; however, little attention has been paid to investigating their indirect influence on projects. This study aims to explore indirect pathways that external stakeholders normally pursue to affect construction projects and to develop a framework of stakeholder-influencing pathways. The authors adopted abductive reasoning, using a preliminary framework. Based on the framework, four process-tracing case studies in the Vietnamese construction industry were conducted for data collection and analysis. Newspapers were the main source of data, complemented by interviews and other archive data, such as press releases, petitions, blog postings, and official documents. All cases confirmed the pathway through which stakeholders induce decision-makers to exert pressure related to a project. Also, some unanticipated results were found: first, two additional pathways, comprising two or three causally ordered mediators, can be employed to affect projects; second, stakeholders tend to use multiple influence pathways in which some actors, such as governmental authorities and the public, have a high rate of occurrence; and third, a mediator can be affected by more than one successor, whereas some mediators are capable of influencing various predecessors. Accordingly, the preliminary framework was revised to match the unanticipated results. This study explores a preliminary mechanism that transmits stakeholder influences to a project via multiple causally ordered actors. It is also the first comprehensive investigation into stakeholder influence pathways in the built environment. The findings can assist managers in stakeholder prioritization and anticipating their influences on projects.

Model for Systematic Innovation in Construction Companies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction companies; Business management; Innovation; Construction company; Business management; Innovation; Process; Standardization; Organizational issues	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; R-AND-D; FIRMS; STANDARDIZATION; INDUSTRY	The reasons that drive construction companies to innovate, as well as the processes they use, have not yet been fully explored in the construction management literature. This paper describes the hows and whys behind the push for innovation in a construction company. The research method is founded on the validation of a model developed by a case study; this is focused on a medium-sized construction company which implemented and certified an innovation management system, as established by a Spanish standard. The studies conducted by the authors over a five-year period generated a set of 18 propositions reflecting an explanatory model of innovation management. This paper reports on the external validation of this model by means of a set of interviews; the results fully corroborate 15 of these propositions. The strongest drivers of innovation in construction companies are technical problems in construction projects, client requirements, and upper management. Innovation opportunities are identified as a result of examination of the internal processes of the company, the construction projects, and the environment. Identifying, developing, and transferring an innovative solution require the implementation of technological watch and knowledge management in the organization. Finally, the research concludes that the main benefit of innovation management is an increase in the company's technical capability, whereas the two main barriers to innovation are the prioritization of production processes and the lack of support from the leaders of the company.

It addresses the issues surrounding exchange of information throughout the design process, and where BIM may be useful in contributing to effective design progression and information availability. Design/methodology/approach - Through review of current design procedures and examination of the concurrency between architectural and thermophysical design modelling, a procedure for information generation relevant to design stakeholders is created, and applied to a high-performance building project currently under development. Findings-The extents of information key to the successful design of a buildings energy performance in relation to its architectural objectives are given, with indication of the level of development required at each stage of the design process. Practical implications - BIM offers an extensible medium for parametric information storage, and its implementation in design development offers the capability to include BEM parameter-integrated construction information. The extent of information required for accurate BEM at stages of a building's design is key to understanding how best to record performance information in a BIM environment. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the discussion around the integration of concurrent design procedures and a common data environment. It presents a framework for the creation and dissemination of information during design, exemplifies this on a real building project and evaluates the barriers experienced in successful implementation.

The preliminary analyses and experiments described in this paper concern two of the most important functionalities which must be included in the system's final release. The first functionality consists in real-time position-tracking of workers involved on construction sites and the second-in a software tool for the prevention of non-authorized access to dangerous zones. This research step is part of a vaster, ongoing research project, addressing the development of a new generation of advanced construction management systems which allow real-time monitoring and coordination of tasks, automatic health and safety management, on-site delivery of technical information and the capture of "as-built" documentation. This paper focuses mainly on the development of a reliable methodology for real-time monitoring of the position of both workers and equipment in outdoor construction sites by applying Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based technologies. This positioning system was then interfaced with a software tool which performs virtual fencing of pre-selected, dangerous areas. Guidelines for the design of the receivers' topology will be addressed and the results of measurements recorded on a typical medium-sized block of flats, during different phases of the construction progress will be summed up. Finally, the preliminary experimental results obtained by the virtual fencing application tool will be presented and used to plan future research objectives.

It highlights the transformation dilemma, which occurs when traditional industrial institutions are confronted by project organizations. It also discusses how one may prepare to meet these challenges. Design/methodology/approach The long-run incremental changes in organizational structures of the economy are described in an economic historical context, focusing on the organizational form of work and the employment regimes. Challenges, at the societal, organizational and individual levels, related to the "projectification" process are illustrated in considering the case of Sweden. Findings Project dense industries, like media, entertainment and consultancy, are growing faster than the rest of the economy. The share of project work in permanent organizations is increasing. More than a third of all working hours in industrialized countries, like Germany, was labeled as project work in 2013. This transformation challenges basic conditions for how work is designed and regulated, like the stipulated and uniform work time or the permanent and stable work place. Central institutions of today, like the labor law and the educational system, are challenged. Originality/value The paper brings together and problematizes several aspects of "projectification" of work life. It highlights what kind of challenges work and work-related institutions meet and discusses how to handle some of them, like education.

J	Walden, R; Lie, S				Walden, Roderick; Lie, Stefan			University-Industry Collaboration in Frugal Innovation Through Prototyping: The Case of a Firefighter Cooling Vest	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cooling; Technological innovation; Manufacturing; Australia; Business; Collaboration; Prototypes; Design for community services; frugal innovation; resource-constrained product design and innovation; university-based product design practice; university&#8211; industry collaboration (UIC)	TECHNOLOGY	The research presented here analyses the design and development of a firefighters cooling vest for rural Australian volunteer bush firefighting services. Bush firefighting is hazardous work due to extreme heat stress experienced by firefighters. Cooling vests therefore form a critical part in reducing the core body temperature of firefighters on duty. Given that volunteer fire fighting services have minimal funding for either the purchase of existing cooling vests or for R&D of new affordable cooling vests; resources for the project are particularly constrained. Reflective analysis of the case study against some of the key features of frugal innovation identifies that management of priority and constraint as well as prototyping during design development may be useful in achieving a good university-industry collaboration (UIC) for manufacturing small-medium enterprises (SMEs). An existing integrated parameter model is utilized to reflect the way priority and constraint is managed in conjunction with prototyping and has been adapted using frugal innovation objectives to conceptualize the case analysis. Analysis of the case, by referencing the literature on frugal innovation and ways of managing UIC projects for new product development, uncovers a complementary relationship between the two practices. The adapted version of the integrated parameter model presented can provide a reference guide for other UIC product design projects for SMEs operating within the constraints of frugal innovation, incorporating prototyping as the central method of research.

This paper presents a systematic study of the factors that limit and drive adoption in a construction sector-specific context. A mixed research method was employed, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Eight focus groups with 54 experts and an online questionnaire were conducted. Forty-two limiting and driving factors were identified and ranked. Principal component analysis was conducted to group the identified factors into a smaller number of factors based on correlations. Four types of limiting factors and four types of driving factors were identified. The main limitation of adoption is that AR and VR technologies are regarded as expensive and immature technologies that are not suitable for engineering and construction. The main drivers are that AR and VR enable improvements in project delivery and provision of new and better services. This study provides valuable insights to stakeholders to devise actions that mitigate the limiting factors and that boost the driving factors. This is one of the first systematic studies to present a detailed analysis of the factors that limit and drive adoption of AR and VR in the construction industry. The main contribution of this study is that it grouped and characterized myriad limiting and driving factors into easily understandable categories, so that the limiting factors can be effectively mitigated and the driving factors potentiated. A roadmap with specific short-term and medium-term actions for improving adoption was outlined.

J	Tasevska, F; Damij, T; Damij, N				Tasevska, Frosina; Damij, Talib; Damij, Nadja			Project planning practices based on enterprise resource planning systems in small and medium enterprises - A case study from the Republic of Macedonia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; SMEs implementation; ERP project; Project success	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; ERP; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; ADOPTION; LESSONS	This paper examines whether Macedonian SMEs plan for the implementation of ERP projects and studies the effect of project planning practices on project success. Four project planning measures were taken into consideration: business case development, scope planning, baseline plan development and risk planning along with three measures of project success; customer satisfaction, perceived quality of the project and success of the implementation process. The study was based on a survey that was conducted on 30 SMEs in the Republic of Macedonia. Data dimensionality was reduced through factor analysis and relationships between the two sets of variables were analyzed by correlation and regression analyses. The findings demonstrated that Macedonian SMEs implemented general project planning practices, even though they did not consider the planning process as a separate phase of the ERP implementation. However, they did not use any particular project planning tools, such as the Gantt chart or WBS. Of the project planning practices that were surveyed, the most practiced were the development of a business case, project scope and baseline plan. The least practiced were risk planning practices. Considering the success of the ERP implementations, this study demonstrated that most of the companies' representatives perceive this undertaking as successful in terms of client satisfaction and perceived quality measures. A higher percentage of respondents found their ERP implementations unsuccessful in terms of implementation process measures, when compared to the previous two success parameters.

J	Hon, CKH; Chan, APC				Hon, Carol. K. H.; Chan, Albert P. C.			Safety Management in Repair, Maintenance, Minor Alteration, and Addition Works: Knowledge Management Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety; Knowledge management; Repair and maintenance; Hong Kong	CONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATIONS; HONG-KONG	Safety of repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition (RMAA) works have long been neglected because RMAA works are often minute and only last for a short period of time. With rising importance of the RMAA sector in many developed societies, safety of RMAA works has begun to draw attention. Many RMAA contracting companies are small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that do not have comprehensive safety management systems. Existing safety legislation and regulations for new construction sites are not fully applicable to RMAA works. Instead of relying on explicit and well-established safety systems, tacit safety knowledge plays an extremely important role in RMAA projects. To improve safety of RMAA works, safety knowledge should be better managed. However, safety knowledge is difficult to capture in RMAA works. This study aims to examine safety management practices of RMAA contracting companies to see how safety knowledge of RMAA projects is managed. Findings show that RMAA contracting companies undertaking large-scale RMAA projects have more initiatives of safety management. Safety management of small-scale RMAA works relies heavily on the motivation of site supervisors and self-regulation of workers. Better tacit knowledge management improves safety performance. To enhance safety capability of RMAA contracting companies, a knowledge sharing culture should be cultivated. The government should provide assistance to SMEs to implement proper safety management practices in small-sized projects. Potentials of applying computer software technology in RMAA projects to capture, store, and retrieve safety information should be explored. Employees should be motivated to share safety knowledge by giving proper recognition to those who are willing to share. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Hon, Carol. K.

J	Osman, KK; Claveria, JB; Faust, KM; Hernandez, S				Osman, Khalid K.; Claveria, Joseph B.; Faust, Kasey M.; Hernandez, Salvador			Temporal Dynamics of Willingness to Pay for Alternatives That Increase the Reliability of Water and Wastewater Service	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH-RISKS; POLICY; MODEL; HETEROGENEITY; IMPROVEMENTS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; PRICE; NEWS	Changes in public perceptions affect infrastructure projects, policies, and revenue streams. As such, utilities should leverage these dynamic perceptions for a variety of reasons, including identifying strategic times to increase operational revenues through rate changes or billing structure, implementing capital projects or management approaches, or integrating new policies. This study focuses on assessing the temporal variations of stated willingness to pay for improved water and wastewater service of residents in 21 shrinking US cities. This classification of cities was selected due to the fiscal constraints placed on utilities because of the reduced number of customers from that which the original system was designed to serve. Furthermore, a consequence of this decline, a high proportion of low-income residents are paying high per-capita costs. Enabling this study are survey data collected in 2013 and 2016. Random-parameter Tobit regression models are used to identify geographic and sociodemographic factors influencing this stated willingness to pay. A likelihood ratio test confirmed a statistically significant shift between the surveys in the residents' stated willingness to pay. Model results reveal that between the timeframes of the deployed surveys, the influences of geographic (e.g., Michigan, Ohio) and sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, income) changed as well. Utilities may benefit from using the identified parameters to develop strategies (e.g., outreach programs, targeted education, media advertisements, inclusion in planning) to target specific groups. Similarly, using the geographic parameters may also present an opportunity to increase operational revenue due to higher willingness to pay by residents. In general, this study highlights that public perceptions should be periodically investigated to continually identify times of greater public support for various utility efforts under way.

J	Sane, S				Sane, Seydou			Effect of using project management tools and techniques on SMEs performance in developing country context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Developing countries; SMEs; Firm performance; Project tools and techniques; Performance factors	MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; LIFE-CYCLE; SUCCESS; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight, through a theoretical and empirical analysis, the expected effects of the use of tools and techniques of project management on the performance of SMEs in Africa. Design/methodology/approach The study uses data from a questionnaire survey of 157 SMEs in Senegal. The sample was chosen for convenience. Also, for data processing, the author mobilized descriptive statistics, factor analysis and regression analysis. Findings Regardless of size, SMEs use project management tools and techniques. Their use positively and significantly influences their business and social performance. Also, the size of the SME is positively and significantly associated with the use of tools and techniques; however, the results show that the older the SME, the less it uses such tools and techniques. Research limitations/implications This research provides an overview of the tools and techniques of project management used by SMEs and their contribution to performance, everything that can support them in choosing the appropriate tools and techniques to respond to their needs. A limitation of this research is that it does not mention the tools that contribute the most to the performance of the SMEs. Originality/value Contrary to the results of some previous research studies on SMEs in Africa, showing that the way in which SMEs operate in Africa is often characterized by less use of formal management tools, for cultural and institutional reasons, this research shows that these have a very appreciable degree of openness to project management tools and techniques.

J	Edwards, P; Bowen, P				Edwards, Peter; Bowen, Paul			Language and communication issues in HIV/AIDS intervention management in the South African construction industry Interview survey findings	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						South Africa; Communication; Construction industry; HIV; AIDS management	HEALTH; STIGMA; AIDS; CAMPAIGNS	Purpose Effective communication is a key factor in presenting Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) awareness and prevention campaigns, and delivering treatment programmes, particularly in South Africa where different ethnic groups and a diversity of languages and educational attainment levels are encountered. Language is an important element of such communication. The purpose of this paper is to examine the communication effectiveness of AIDS-related intervention messages. Design/methodology/approach Case-based semi-structured interviews, with 42 employees from three construction organisations, and with six telephone counsellors from a service provider, were used to explore language in the HIV/AIDS context in the construction industry in the Western Cape region. Findings Workers' knowledge about HIV (a key element in prevention and willingness to engage in treatment regimes) tended to align with their level of education. African cultures may inhibit the use of plain language about AIDS. Graphic posters with text in different languages were the most preferred communication media, but need periodic refreshment to remain effective. For toolbox talks and other company presentations, a comprehensive approach to language differences is limited, and appropriate confirmatory feedback loops are not used - the message sent is not always the message received. The recruitment and training processes for service provider counsellors ensure a more comprehensive grasp of HIV knowledge and a more consistent approach to communication. Originality/value Communication effectiveness is pivotal in the provision of intervention management by construction firms. Ineffective language and communication processes directly and adversely influence HIV/AIDS intervention management success.

DUET: Data-Driven Approach Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Disaster informatics; Emergency detection; Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social media		Social networking platforms have been widely employed to detect and track physical events in population-dense urban areas. They can be effective tools to understand what happens and when and where it happens, either retrospectively or in real time. Correspondingly, a variety of approaches have been proposed for detecting either targeted or general events. However, neither type of event detection technique has been developed to detect urban emergencies that happen in specific geographic locations and with unpredictable characteristics. Therefore, we propose a spatial and data-driven detecting urban emergencies technique (DUET) for natural hazards, manmade disasters, and other emergencies. The method addresses both geographic and semantic dimensions of events using a geotopic detection module and evaluates their crisis levels on the basis of the intensity of negative sentiment through a ranking module. DUET was designed specifically for georeferenced tweets from a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). To validate the technique, we conducted multiple experiments with geotagged tweets in different urban environments over a period of four to six consecutive hours. DUET successfully identified emergencies of different types among all the candidate geotopics. Our future work focuses on enabling online-mode detection with high scalability with large volumes of streaming data and providing interactive visualization through a GIS system. DUET can identify emergencies of general types and provide timely emergency reports both to first responders and to the public. The technique contributes to building an efficient and open disaster information system through a crowdsourcing effort and adding agility to urban resilience regarding crisis detection, situation awareness, and information diffusion.

J	Dijkstra, J; Timmermans, H				Dijkstra, J; Timmermans, H			Towards a multi-agent model for visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of design performance	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Media and Design Process	1999	SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH			multi-agent model; design performance; cellular automata grid	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; TRAFFIC FLOW	We introduce the outline of a multi-agent model that can be used for visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of design performance. We will consider various performance indicators of building environments, which are related to user reaction to design decisions. This system may serve as a media tool in the design process for a better understanding of what the design will look like, especially for those cases where design or planning decisions will affect the behavior of individuals. The system is based on cellular automata and multi-agent simulation technology. The system simulates how agents move around in a particular 3D (or 2D) environment, in which space is represented as a lattice of cells. Agents represent objects or people with their own behavior, moving over the network. Each agent will be located in a simulated space, based on the cellular automata grid. Each iteration of the simulation is based on a parallel update of the agents conforming local rules. Agents positioned within an environment will need sensors to perceive their local neighborhood and some means with which to affect the environment. In this way, autonomous individuals and the interaction between them can be simulated by the system. As a result, designers can use the system to assess the likely consequences of their design decisions on user behavior. We think that the system provides a potentially valuable tool to support design and decision-making processes, related to user behavior in architecture and urban planning.

J	Miles, SB; Jagielo, N; Gallagher, H				Miles, Scott B.; Jagielo, Nora; Gallagher, Hannah			Hurricane Isaac Power Outage Impacts and Restoration	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac made landfall twice in Louisiana. Cumulatively, over 1 million customers lost electricity as a result of the hurricane, some for more than 10 days. As a disaster, Hurricane Isaac is relatively unique because of the opportunity to largely isolate impacts and decisions directly associated with the electricity outage and restoration from cascading impacts related to direct flood or wind damage. Louisiana emergency managers, business representatives, and public officials were interviewed to develop and analyze a case study of the outage and restoration event. Interviewees were asked about (1) the significant impacts from the outage, (2) what (if any) lasting effects would result from the outage, (3) the relative performance of power restoration, (4) the effectiveness of communication between stakeholders, and (5) factors influencing the public and political perception of restoration performance. Other collected data included content from news media, government documents, press releases, situation reports, and publicly available quantitative data. Results suggest that there were few long-term impacts from the outage, and restoration performance was not unusually slow. Even so, the electricity service provider was the subject of vocal criticism. The findings of the case study highlight the importance of all aspects of communication and awareness raising before, during, and after power outages, as well as further research to facilitate this. The study reinforces the need to improve power continuity using a wide range of technical, political, and organizational strategies. Research and policy development is particularly needed for improving continuity of transportation, health care facilities, and gasoline provision. Understanding of the sociotechnical role of electricity outages within broader disaster contexts can only be improved through further interdisciplinary research.

Concurrent with this trend has been the rise in research on RPA, establishing this as a new field of study within the construction management domain. What is needed now is an assessment of the current state of research in this emerging discipline - its strengths and weaknesses - by which future research on RPA in construction may be guided. The purpose of this paper is to address this need. Design/methodology/approach A total of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles covering RPAs within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilizing qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings The results reveal a field of study in its fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation, from a limited number of institutions. Key publication outlets are identified, with the main focus of research being in the technical areas of remote sensing, photogrammetry and image processing. Practical implications - The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of RPAs in the industry. Originality/value The study exposes what is missing from current research: a broader consideration of organizational adjustments needed to accommodate RPA usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.

J	Pablo, Z; London, KA				Pablo, Zelinna; London, Kerry Anne			Stable relationality and dynamic innovation: two models of collaboration in SME-driven offsite manufacturing supply chains in housing construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case Study; Construction; Innovation; Integration; Supply chain management; Technology	SUCCESS FACTORS; TECHNOLOGY; ALLIANCES	Purpose The study analyses collaborative practice in offsite manufacturing (OSM) housing supply chains, focusing specifically on supply chains driven by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The study's analysis builds on previous work where we argued that collaboration in OSM housing construction comprises nine elements. In this study, the authors demonstrate empirically that SMEs enact these collaborative practice elements in distinct ways, foregrounding key elements over others. One core model and two sub-models of collaboration emerge from our two case studies. Design/methodology/approach The study analyses two SME-driven supply chains using qualitative case study techniques. Data were gathered through 12 semi-structured interviews conducted in two housing construction supply chains: one in South Australia, Australia, and another in Tasmania, Australia. Findings A comparative case study of SMEs shows that collaboration in OSM supply chains has a number of common elements, including a champion for innovation, investment in long-term relationships, resourceful use of limited assets and physical co-location. However, SMEs can also enact these elements through a range of diverging collaborative strategies that can be distilled into different models: stable relationality and dynamic innovation. Originality/value Findings provide a compelling empirical basis for arguing that SMEs can successfully lead OSM supply chains if key collaborative practice elements are strategically mobilised in ways that are suited to their strengths and limitations. The study therefore interrogates the widely held and often limiting assumption that OSM can only be driven by large organisations with access to capital assets, capacity to invest and undisputed bargaining power.

Recently electronic publication is increasingly important for the dissemination of scientific work, while evaluation of scientists and institutions remains largely based on the printed publications. In the "material world", associations, such as eCAADe have been providing a stage for getting the right people together and through annual conferences and seminars made sure that research results were heard and read. The Internet and the Web are allowing the scientists to pursue those activities on their own or through flexibly organized "virtual" associations. Electronic publications also provide a basis for efficient management of scientific knowledge-discovering related work, reduction of the duplicate efforts, establishment of virtual research teams etc. In this paper, we present the goals and initial results of an EU-project called SciX: "Open, Self Organising Repository for Scientific Information Exchange". The goal of SciX is to analyze the business processes of scientific publishing, to invent new publication models and through a series of pilots to demonstrate how this will work. In the envisioned scenarios, professional associations such as eCAADe play an important role. Their members are the potential users of SciX's platforms. authors and readers of the papers. Associations could also become the publishers and archivists of the knowledge created within their respective community. The objectives of this contribution focus on involving the eCAADe-community in the developments in SciX, on fine-shaping the goals, as well as on defining the requirements and monitoring the usability of the pilots.

Benchmarking the quality management level of developed countries and improving quality management are also becoming necessities for promoting innovation in the economy. The purpose of this study is to analyse the internal relationships between the five enablers of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence model, based on a market-oriented strategy, to serve as a framework for managing and improving quality. Design/methodology/approach Considering the different market environment and culture, this study refines the strategy enabler based on Zebal and Goodwin's (2011) Developing Country Market Orientation Scale, and builds a market-oriented EFQM Excellence model. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to analyse the results of a questionnaire survey of 683 China construction industry top enterprises to explore the internal relationships between the model's five enablers. Findings (1) "Leadership" has a positive influence on "Market-Oriented Strategy", "People" and "Partnerships and Resources"; (2) "Market-Oriented Strategy" has positive influence on "Partnerships and Resources"; (3) "People" has a low influence on "Processes, Products and Services"; (4) "Partnerships and Resources" has a medium influence on "Processes, Products and Services" and (5) the relationships between "Market-Oriented Strategy" and "People", "Partnerships and Resources" are not significant. Originality/value This study refines the strategy enabler of the original EFQM Excellence model with Zebal and Goodwin's (2011) Developing Country Market Orientation Scale. It also develops a market-oriented EFQM Excellence model that is suitable for developing countries, and it tests the implicit relationships of its five new enablers in an innovation environment where cultural differences exist.

J	Gao, S; Low, SP				Gao, Shang; Low, Sui Pheng			Toyota Way style human resource management in large Chinese construction firms: A qualitative study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						lean; Toyota Way; HRM; Chinese construction firms	LEAN PRODUCTION; WORK ORGANIZATION; STRATEGY	The Toyota Way model is known to be a comprehensive management framework with two main two objectives: continuous improvement and respect for people. In contrast to the enormous amount of attention focused on lean tools and process-oriented improvement, less is known about the softer aspects of such practices. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current practices of people management within large Chinese construction firms and their relevance to the Toyota Way. Addressing the gaps identified can help Chinese construction firms understand the missing link of human resource management practice in the lean context. This paper is qualitative in nature and is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 Chinese construction industry professionals. Several practices associated with the Toyota Way style people management have been identified in this study, including selectivity in recruitment, training and individual development, teamwork, motivation and organizational support. The research determines which of the practices from a range of generally recognized Toyota Way people management were in fact followed and which are currently not used. Additionally, the potential hindrances to several practices, which were seen to be implemented only with difficulty, are also identified. The results will be of value to readers with interests in lean production, human resource practices, the Toyota Way and the management and implementation of human resource management in the context of lean or within project-based firms, such as construction firms. The limitations of this study are that small and medium enterprises are excluded and that the sample contains unequal numbers of interviewees from private firms and state-owned enterprises, which would potentially affect the generalization of the implementation of Toyota Way style people management to the entire construction industry in China.

J	Ambrose, PJ; Rai, A; Ramaprasad, A				Ambrose, PJ; Rai, A; Ramaprasad, A			Internet usage for information provisioning: Theoretical construct development and empirical validation in the clinical decision-making context	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information processing; information systems (IS) success; IS usage; Internet; partial least squares	TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION DECISIONS; GROUP SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; USER ACCEPTANCE; PERCEIVED USEFULNESS; MEDIA SELECTION; MCLEAN MODEL; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; ATTENTION; FIT	Despite substantial discussion of the Internet's impact on individual activities, there is an absence of a theoretically grounded measure of Internet usage for the provisioning of information required by decision-makers. Our research addresses this void in the literature. We conceptualize Internet Usage for Information Provisioning (IUIP) as the degree to which the Internet is used to meet information requirements of individual decision-makers engaged in diagnostic decision-making tasks. Drawing on the information processing theoretical framework, three dimensions (usage for breadth of content, usage for depth of content, and usage for interaction dynamism) of IUIP are identified. The construct was validated through a two-phase empirical study conducted in the physician clinical decision-making context. The first phase involved interviewing physicians to establish face validity of the dimensions and to generate multi-item measures for each dimension. The second phase consisted of surveying physicians to evaluate measurement properties and nomological validity. Principal components analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and partial least squares analysis were the primary statistical techniques used to analyze the data and evaluate construct validity. Our results suggest that decision-makers operating in uncertain and equivocal decision contexts use the Internet to a greater degree for their content needs and selective attention requirements. Our results also suggest that a fit between the user's information processing requirements and technology, and selected social norms, lead to higher levels of IUIP. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

Media-rich VR and AR environments have been proven to help users better understand design solutions, however, they have not been quite advanced in supporting interoperability and collaboration. Relying on capabilities of openBIM and IFC schema, this study posits that this shortcoming of VR and AR environment could be addressed by use of BIM server concept allowing for concurrent multiuser and low-latency communication between applications. Successful implementation of this concept can ultimately mitigate the need for advanced technical skills for participation in design processes and facilitate the generation of more useful design solutions by early involvement of stakeholders and end-users in decision making. This paper exemplifies a method for integration of BIM data into immersive VR and AR environments, in order to streamline the design process and provide a pared-down agnostic openBIM system with low latency and synchronised concurrent user accessibility that gives the "right information to the right people at the right time". These concepts have been further demonstrated through development of a prototype for openBIM-Tango integrated virtual showroom for offsite manufactured production of self-build housing. The prototype directly includes BIM models and data from IFC format and interactively presents them to users on both VR immersive and AR environments, including Google Tango enabled devices. This paper contributes by offering innovative and practical solutions for integration of openBIM and VR/AR interfaces, which can address interoperability issues of the AEC industry.

J	Poirier, EA; Staub-French, S; Forgues, D				Poirier, Erik A.; Staub-French, Sheryl; Forgues, Daniel			Measuring the impact of BIM on labor productivity in a small specialty contracting enterprise through action-research	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Labor Productivity; Building information modeling; Prefabrication; Action research; Performance assessment; Small or medium enterprise (SME); Construction; Specialty contractor	CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE	Productivity in the construction industry is a well-documented and expansive field of research. It benefits from over four decades of research that have developed models and methods for evaluation and identified multiple factors that influence it. In parallel, building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a disruptive innovation, showing great potential to mitigate many of the factors negatively affecting construction productivity. Indeed, studies are increasingly looking into the impact of BIM on project performance. Improving construction productivity, labor productivity in particular, is one of the widely reported benefits. For organizations looking to transition to BIM, being able to grasp these benefits and quantify their impact is extremely important to ensure the viability of the BIM implementation process. This article presents the findings of an action-research project undertaken with a small mechanical contractor which investigates the impact of BIM on labor productivity on a large commercial project. The objective of the action-research was to assist the organization in reconfiguring its performance measurement practices in light of the transition to BIM and prefabrication. The article discusses the challenges of this reconfiguration and presents the findings from the performance measurement process which was put in place. The findings suggest a clear positive impact of BIM on labor productivity on the project studied: the areas that were modeled and prefabricated showed an increase in productivity ranging from 75% to 240% over the areas that were not modeled. More importantly, however, the article operationalizes a strategy allowing organizations to consistently assess their performance relating to labor productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rahman, A; Wu, ZY; Kalfarisi, R				Rahman, Atiqur; Wu, Zheng Yi; Kalfarisi, Rony			Semantic Deep Learning Integrated with RGB Feature-Based Rule Optimization for Facility Surface Corrosion Detection and Evaluation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Corrosion detection; Deep learning; Semantic segmentation; Corrosion evaluation	RECOGNITION; TEXTURE	Over the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to detect corrosion in images. Unfortunately, the corrosion is detected in bounding boxes, without precisely segmenting the corrosion elements in irregular boundary shapes, and thus it is difficult to assess them quantitatively, such as in terms of corrosion areas and corrosion severity, which are important for engineers to evaluate the performance and condition of an inspection target. In addition, training an effective CNN model requires creating a training data set by labeling the corrosion pixels in each image, which is tedious and labor intensive. This paper presents a semantic segmentation deep learning approach together with an efficient image labelling tool for rapidly preparing large training data sets, and effectively detecting, segmenting, and evaluating corrosions in the images. The image labeling tool was developed by implementing a texture-based unsupervised image segmentation method, integrated with red-green-blue (RGB) feature-based classifier optimization. The tool enables users to construct a pixel-based corrosion classifier with small set of manually labeled images. This small set of labeled images is used for optimizing the pixel-based corrosion classifier to automatically generate corrosion segments for a large number of training images. A CNN model with semantic segmentation feature then is trained for corrosion detection and segmentation. Finally, a corrosion evaluation method is proposed for classifying each pixel of a corrosion segment into user-prescribed categories such as heavy corrosion, medium corrosion, and light corrosion. The integrated approach was tested on images collected by professional inspection engineers. The results indicated that the proposed approach is practically applicable for corrosion assessment for a wide range of industrial facilities and civil infrastructures.

However, little is known about the factors contributing to NVA BIM implementation practices from different stakeholders' viewpoints. This study aims to identify the leading contributors to NVA BIM implementation activities in BIM-based building project delivery in Singapore, compare perceptions among stakeholders with different roles, firm sizes, and BIM implementation experience, and propose strategies for NVA implementation activity reduction. An extensive literature review and a pilot study were conducted to determine causes. The results of a questionnaire survey, statistical analyses, and four postsurvey interviews found that all 49 causes categorized by major stakeholders were critical. Among the most influential causes were "design models do not fit for intended downstream uses" (for architect/engineers) and "design changes are expensive once fabrication has commenced" (for manufacturer/supplier). The subgroup analysis indicated that contractors, especially those of small to medium size, perceived that the leading causes related to consultancy firms' reluctance to enhance design-construction integration and consider incremental changes, whereas stakeholders without much BIM practical experience probably underestimated the difficulties of conducting value-adding BIM diffusion activities. This study extends the concept of NVA activities to BIM implementation and recommends management strategies for each project role to implement BIM-based collaborative practices. The findings enable practitioners to better understand BIM diffusion and reduce their NVA BIM implementation activities for enhanced construction productivity.

Most of disastrous accidents of dike engineering are induced directly or indirectly by seepage. The reliable observation and reasonable identification of seepage behavior play an important role in ensuring the service safety of dike engineering. In this paper, a distributed optical fiber temperature sensor system (DTS)-based approach is presented to monitor the seepage velocity in soil-concrete joint between dike structure and other constructions across it such as culvert and sluice. The theoretical investigation and laboratory test are carried out. Firstly, the DTS-based monitoring principle of seepage velocity is introduced. The theoretical model identifying seepage velocity is established. Secondly, a DTS-based test platform of soil-concrete joint, which can simulate the structural feature and service environment of dike engineering, is designed and constructed. It consists of DTS, heating system, water-supply system, data processing system and dike model. Thirdly, the monitoring experiments on seepage velocity under the conditions of different mediums and optical fibers are implemented using the test platform. The correlations between seepage velocity and heating power, temperature change of optical fiber are analyzed. The practical model monitoring seepage velocity of soil-concrete joint in dike engineering is built Lastly, considering the seepage features of dike engineering, the embedment mode and procedure of optical fiber are proposed to promote the application of DTS-based approach to real-time observation of seepage velocity in actual dike engineering.

Here a robot is envisioned as both a placement and external support agent during fabrication - the unfinished structure is supported in such a way that scaffolding is not required. The goal of this paper is to present and validate the efficacy of three cooperative fabrication approaches using two or three robots, for the scaffold-free construction of a stable masonry arch from which a medium-span vault is built. A simplified numerical method to represent a masonry structure is first presented and validated to analyze systems composed of discrete volumetric elements. This method is then used to evaluate the effect of the three cooperative robotic fabrication strategies on the stability performance of the central arch. The sequential method and cantilever method, which utilize two robotic arms, are shown to be viable methods, but have challenges related to scalability and robustness. By adding a third robotic agent, it becomes possible to determine a structurally optimal fabrication sequence through a multi objective optimization process. The optimized three robot method is shown to significantly improve the structural behavior over all fabrication steps. The modeling approaches presented in this paper are broadly formulated and widely applicable for the analysis of cooperative robotic fabrication sequences for the construction of masonry structures across scales.

CPD projects have the potential to use socialized design resource for creative product development because they are openly participated by a large number of socialized designers. However, CPD projects are unreliable, unpredictable, and usually endure low success rate. We believe that the reason for these problems is that many unreliable factors caused by the nature of CPD mode are disturbing the implementation of CPD projects, but few research works can provide systematic and quantitative understanding of the relationship between these factors and CPD project feasibility, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate and manage their CPD projects. To mitigate these problems, in this paper an improved Bayesian causal map approach is developed and used to build a CPD project feasibility analysis model. The model can reveal the interaction relationship among the factors, and provide quantitative evaluation of CPD project feasibility given the states of the factors. In this way, the model can help the stakeholders in CPD project management by showing them which factors require priority processing and providing them with the prediction of project success rate, and eventually improve the overall reliability of CPD projects. The model has been verified through sensitivity analysis and post analysis on real CPD projects.

J	Upstill-Goddard, J; Glass, J; Dainty, A; Nicholson, I				Upstill-Goddard, James; Glass, Jacqui; Dainty, Andrew; Nicholson, Ian			Implementing sustainability in small and medium-sized construction firms The role of absorptive capacity	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Corporate social responsibility; Absorptive capacity; Organizational learning; Responsible sourcing; Sustainability standards	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS-APPROACH; SMES; FRAMEWORK; CAPABILITIES; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; BUSINESS; STRATEGY	Purpose - Construction organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the impacts of their operations, from both an environmental and, more recently, a social viewpoint. Sustainability standards can enable an organisation to evidence a benchmarked level of performance against a particular issue. To date, research on standards has largely focused on the operational and administrative aspects of their enactment, rather than how they might affect - and be appropriated by - organisational actors. The purpose of this paper is to examine how capacity for learning can affect the success of implementing standards within two construction SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - Taking an organisational learning and absorptive capacity (ACAP) perspective, this research uses the case study approach and abductive logic to understand what role learning plays with regard to sustainability standard implementation. Findings - The results reveal that strong communication channels and commitment to training programmes increase the capacity for implementing standards, but that SMEs tend only to approach standards if they see immediate financial benefits stemming from their implementation. Practical implications - SMEs provide a challenging context for the implementation of sustainability standards unless there are significant external levers and extrinsic motivation for them to be embraced. Care should be taken in incorporating these aspects into the future design of standards that are more aligned with SME needs. Social implications - Stakeholders should seek to apply pressure to firms to positively influence engagement with sustainability standards. Originality/value - The role and importance of ACAP is an underdeveloped debate in the certification field. This study is the first that links the process of implementing a standard with the ACAP of an organisation.

Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats.

Design/methodology/approach - To address the need to consider both vendors and customers in the innovation diffusion process and the need for in-depth cross-sectional studies, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 147 participants including 85 vendors and 62 customers of modern construction technologies at company, project and operational levels in Australia and North America. Thematic analysis and an analytic hierarchy process illustrate the critical role of both customers and vendors in the diffusion process of modern equipment technologies. Findings - A new conceptual model is presented which classifies modern equipment technology customers into four categories: visionaries (group I); innovators (group II); pragmatists (group III); and conservatives (group IV) based on the way in which they interact with vendors in the innovation diffusion process. The results also reveal that there is a significant emotional/affective aspect of innovation diffusion decisions which has not been recognised in previous research. Originality/value - The major contribution of this study is that it analyses the role of both vendors and customers in the equipment technology diffusion process at three different levels (strategic, project and operational) in large corporations and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The findings not only advance construction innovation research beyond traditional linear models of innovation, but also provide new knowledge which enable customers and vendors to interact more effectively in the diffusion of new construction equipment technologies.

J	Duncan, J				Duncan, J			Performance-based building: lessons from implementation in New Zealand	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building codes; governance; innovation; performance; performance-based regulation; regulation; New Zealand		New Zealand was an early adopter of a performance-based building code in 1992. The subsequent lessons learned from its implementation strategy are examined. Performance-based codes have decided advantages, but need careful implementation to capture these advantages. There are particular problems where the building code does not use specific numerical levels as the basis for mandatory performance requirements. A small fraction of houses built over the last decade developed 'weathertightness' problems. The resulting media and political focus has led to a full review of the Building Act (the legislation leading to the Building Code) and new legislation will be in place by late 2004. As part of this, the Building Industry Authority will be absorbed into a government department. This will be followed by a detailed review of the New Zealand Building Code between 2005 and 2008. Although the performance requirements remain unaltered, the 'Acceptable Solutions' that are deemed to satisfy the code have already been made more conservative and prescriptive to account for the lack of sufficient experience and understanding in some parts of the building industry. Other legislation is expected to address the asymmetry between the industry and its clients, including a builder licensing scheme and consumer protection systems. The key lesson is that implementation of performance-based building codes systems cannot simply be done by putting the documents before the industry. Successful introduction of performance-based building codes, and changes to them, must be accompanied by well-focused training programmes for all involved in the process, and especially the designers, the building control staff and the on-site workforce.

J	Dawood, N; Sriprasert, E; Mallasi, Z; Hobbs, B				Dawood, N; Sriprasert, E; Mallasi, Z; Hobbs, B			Development of an integrated information resource base for 4D/VR construction processes simulation	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						integrated database; 3D modelling; virtual reality		The objective of this paper is to report on the development of an integrated database to act as an information resource base for 4D/VR construction process simulation. A comprehensive database was designed, implemented and populated with the School of Health Construction Project (a pound8 million, three-story development at the University of Teesside campus). The database is composed of a core database of building components which is in turn, integrated with a CAD package (AUTOCAD 2000), a Project Management Package (MS Project) and Graphical User Interfaces. The core database was designed using Standard Classification Methods (Uniclass). One of the benefits of using the Uniclass method, a part from providing standards for structuring building information, is that it provides a media for integrating Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) with Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This is an important aspect for delivering a meaningful 4D model. Integrated interfaces between MS Access Database, AutoCAD Drawings and MS Project Schedules were developed and implemented. Furthermore, the British Standards of layering convention (BS 1192-5) was adapted and implemented and justification for this is given in the part 2 of this document. The database was populated with detailed 2D drawings (whole building and M&E), schedules of work and resources of the School of Health Project. This paper is also addressing object definition, structuring the data, and establishing the relationships and dependencies within the data set, the WBS and building objects as well as modelling the building in 3D in order to capture the essential space- and time-critical attributes of tasks. Practical application of database throughout the construction process has been highlighted and discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach Using a survey questionnaire, data were gathered over four consecutive quarters (N = 2,537). The statistical methods included exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Project management was perceived as a three-dimensional construct (proposal, installation, commissioning/start-up). There was a significant longitudinal relationship between project stages and satisfaction in the complete data set. The results varied on the quarterly basis. The relationship customer satisfaction/repurchase intent was significant in the whole data set and during all quarters. This was the case for the relationships between value for money and customer satisfaction and between value for money and repurchase intent. The effect sizes were small between project management stages and customer satisfaction, small to medium for the value for money construct and large for the customer satisfaction construct. Originality/value An important implication is the significant relationship between the stages of project management and satisfaction. However, the effect sizes were small, however. The importance of the effect size in comparison to the significance of the relationships is highlighted especially when the sample size is large. The paper also confirms the linear relationship between satisfaction and repurchase intent. The nature of the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty is based on a moderate exchange relationship in the relational exchange continuum. The study contributes to the relational exchange theory in the context of project management.

J	Ham, Y; Kim, J				Ham, Youngjib; Kim, Jaeyoon			Participatory Sensing and Digital Twin City: Updating Virtual City Models for Enhanced Risk-Informed Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Participatory sensing; Digital twin city; Geospatial localization	SOCIAL MEDIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFORMATION; GENERATION	The benefits of a digital twin city have been assessed based on real-time data collected from preinstalled Internet of Things (IoT) sensors (e.g., traffic, energy use, air pollution, water quality) for managing the complex systems of cities, but the sensor-based reality information is likely insufficient to provide dynamic spatiotemporal information about physical vulnerabilities. Understanding cities' current states of physical vulnerability can support city decision makers in analyzing associated potential risk in urban areas for data-driven infrastructure management in extreme weather events. As a step toward creating a digital twin city for effective risk-informed decision-making, this paper proposes a new framework to bring crowdsourced visual data-based reality information into a three-dimensional (3D) virtual city for a model update with interactive and immersive visualization. Unstructured visual data are collected from participatory sensing and analyzed to estimate the geospatial information of vulnerable objects in the distance representing physical vulnerability in cities. The crowdsourced visual data-based reality information of physical vulnerability in a given region is then integrated with a 3D virtual city model, and the updated 3D city model is fed into a computer-aided virtual environment (CAVE) for immersive visualization to enable users to navigate the intersection of reality and virtuality. To test the proposed framework, case studies were conducted on Houston. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to make the virtual city model live in terms of local vulnerability. The digital twin city building on crowdsourced visual data is expected to contribute to risk-informed decision-making for infrastructure management in cities and help analyze various what-if scenarios in disaster situations with increased visibility of hazard and city interactions.

J	Yu, WD; Hsu, JY				Yu, Wen-der; Hsu, Jia-yang			Content-based text mining technique for retrieval of CAD documents	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						CAD; Text mining; Information retrieval; Characteristic document; Construction engineering	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PROJECT	The computer aided design (CAD) document provides an effective communication medium, a legal contract document, and a reusable design case for a construction project. Due to technological advancements in CAD industry, the volume of CAD documents has been increased dramatically in the database of construction organizations. Traditional retrieval methods relied on textual naming and indexing schemes that require the designers (engineers and architects) to memorize in details the meta-information used to characterize the drawings. Such approaches easily overwhelmed the users' memory capability and thus caused low reusability of CAD documents. In this paper, a content-based text mining technique is adopted to extract the textual content of a CAD document into a characteristic document (CD), which can be retrieved with similarity matching using a Vector Space Model (VSM), so that the automated and expedited retrievals of CAD documents from vast CAD databases become possible. A prototype system, namely Content-based CAD document Retrieval System (CCRS), is developed to implement the proposed method. After preliminary testing with a CAD database with 2094 Chinese annotated CAD drawings collected from two real-world construction projects and a public engineering drawing database, the proposed CCRS is proven to retrieve all relevant CAD documents with relatively high precision when appropriate query is specified. Finally, three search strategies are recommended for the users to narrow down search scope while a target CAD document is desired. It is concluded that the proposed content-based text mining approach provides a promising solution to improve the current difficulty encountered in retrieval and reusability of vast CAD documents for the construction industry.

Since design behaviors are non-deterministic and subjective, a novel clustering algorithm named efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (EFKCN) is utilized to produce informative clusters of different features. First, datasets are pulled out from the raw design logs and transformed into understandable forms for computers. Then, EFKCN clustering algorithm is performed in datasets at both individual and team level. Finally, analysis and prediction methods, like time analysis, regression and others, will further investigate the extracted clusters, which help managers to figure out the design preference and productivity of different designers. A case study is conducted in the real BIM design logs from an international architecture design firm with 853,520 records to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From a view of individuals, the personal design behaviors hidden in different clusters are served to arrange proper design work rationally during particular time periods. From a team perspective, the design productivity of different designers can be approximately evaluated as high, medium, and low levels in an objective and efficient manner. In the comparison of EFKCN with other popular clustering methods, EFKCN takes less time and iterations to complete the clustering process, and its clustering results achieve great compactness and separation according to the value of cluster validity indices (CVIs). Hence, this research contributes to performing the novel clustering-based BIM log mining, which acts as a powerful decision-making tool in evaluating design productivity and drawing up personalized work arrangements for a more efficient modeling process.

J	Kumaraswamy, MM; Rahman, MM; Ling, FYY; Phng, ST				Kumaraswamy, MM; Rahman, MM; Ling, FYY; Phng, ST			Reconstructing cultures for relational contracting	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TRUST	Although previous research has pointed to potential performance gains through relational contracting (RC), reservations remain as to its value and viability. Even those who wish to use RC need guidelines for introducing it, especially where it clashes with prevalent project cultures. A study was launched from Hong Kong to identify the critical factors which promote RC and team building in the context of specific cultures. This paper consolidates the perceptions of 60 respondents to a questionnaire survey in Singapore, in relation to the hypothesized 24 factors facilitating RC, and 28 factors impeding/deterring RC. It indicates the evident readiness of the Singaporean contracting industry to embrace collaborative working practices. On the whole: (1) all the 24 factors facilitating RC, and 23 of the 28 factors deterring RC, are significant; (2) these two sets of factors could be represented by six and seven "broad factors," respectively; and (3) except in a few cases, respondents from large and medium companies, as well as with and without experience in RC, have similar perceptions of the importance of different factors. It was perceived that trust should be at the core of RC approaches to construction procurement, but also seen that the current level of trust is low. Identifying the principal "facilitators" and "impediments"/ deterrents to RC, provides pointers to building relationally integrated teams to boost performance to much higher levels, as are now expected from the industry. The literature indicates that the outcome of the survey in Singapore reflects the trends in many countries that are moving toward RC. This research model and approach may be conveniently replicated in other contractual regimes, in order to reinforce these observations.

Although previous work has shown the effects of different CR groups on time in condition, CR-group-specific effects of NBI-related variables on time in condition by CR group are less documented. Additionally, heterogeneity issues with NBI data have focused on between-group heterogeneity, and not on bridge-deck-specific variation due to unobserved heterogeneity. In the context of statistical and econometric models, unobserved heterogeneity refers to unobserved characteristics that may influence the process of interest-in this case, the likelihood of being assigned a lower CR. This work uniquely addressed both these gaps. First, three separate survival models by CR group were fit and a parameter transferability test was conducted. Results from the parameter transferability test indicated that separate models by CR group should be fit (i.e., parameters and their effects are not transferable among CR groups). Secondly, to account for bridge-deck-specific variation due to unobserved heterogeneity and to address potential bias in parameter estimates, random parameters were estimated. Model specifications suggested that the NBI data are susceptible to large amounts of heterogeneity, as indicated by the number of random parameters and the heterogeneity-based model being preferred over the fixed parameters model. For CR-group-specific variables and effects, only two variables were found to be significant in each CR group: mountainous climate, and design period after 1970. For both variables, the effects differed by CR group. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Labour and skill shortages in Hong Kong's construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Construction industry; Employee attitudes; Labour shortage; Labour supply model; Skill shortage		Purpose - With many large-scale infrastructural and residential projects in Hong Kong, the construction industry is suffering from serious labour and skill shortages. The purpose of this paper is to identify practicable strategies for resolving these problems, assess the effectiveness of these identified strategies and finally develop a conceptual labour supply model. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected qualitatively and quantitatively through discussion forums and questionnaire surveys. Comprising 30 expert members, two discussion forums were held to identify both practical response strategies and conceptual labour supply framework. Based on ten identified strategies, surveys were then conducted in the form of a web-based questionnaire. In total, 2,900 respondents were invited to take part and 438 questionnaires were completed. Grounded theory approach was adopted to develop a labour supply theory. Findings - In total, three identified strategies which could deliver quick results to the industry were increasing worker wages, importing foreign workers and engaging employers to provide training. Other identified strategies were also effective over the medium and long terms. Practical implications - Many of the identified solutions are enforceable. These are not only applicable to Hong Kong, but also transferable to other countries where voluntarily based measures under the free-market economy do not work in an effective manner. Originality/value - Unlike previous studies largely relied on voluntarily based measures, most of the identified strategies in this study are enforceable to ensure its effectiveness. In addition, based on the grounded theory approach, this study has developed a conceptual model for analysing labour supply issues in both local and overseas situations, thus contributing to the new knowledge in this area.

J	Yap, JBH; Skitmore, M				Yap, Jeffrey Boon Hui; Skitmore, Martin			Ameliorating time and cost control with project learning and communication management Leveraging on reusable knowledge assets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Overruns; Project control; Project communication; Project learning; Reusable knowledge	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DESIGN CHANGES; DELAY MITIGATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; MODEL; ORGANIZATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; REWORK	Purpose Legions of projects fail to attain their time and cost objectives due to ineffective coordination. This is often due to a lack of essential learning from projects because of insufficient communication and working experience. One of the key reasons why this occurs is that managers are unaware of what knowledge needs to be retained. In contrast with knowledge management research, which mostly focuses on the systems and processes for capturing, storing, and retrieval of knowledge, this paper investigates the nature of project communication and learning and their role on project time and cost control. Design/methodology/approach A stratified proportional purposive sampling approach was adopted in choosing the interview participants for the study. They are experienced industry practitioners working on building construction projects in Malaysia. Content analysis was then performed on the interview data. The identified variables were further validated by 11 industry experts from the three primary construction stakeholders. Findings The results of a series of 12 in-depth interviews with industry practitioners are provided to reveal the effective communication tools for sharing and learning in a project-based environment, the learning inducing situations involved, and the use of reusable project experiences to improve project time and cost control. Originality/value A two-phase model with three-step project management process of input, tools, and output is developed from the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide as an aid for more effective knowledge reuse in project time and cost control in the future.

J	Nik-Bakht, M; El-Diraby, T				Nik-Bakht, Mazdak; El-Diraby, Tamer			Project collective mind: Unlocking project discussion networks	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social network analysis; Twitter; Semantic analysis; Project management and monitoring; Stakeholder mapping; Community engagement	SOCIAL NETWORK; MANAGEMENT	A project discussion network is a space where project stakeholders form relationships among each other and share information about the project. Virtual discussion networks may refer to networks of e-mails, document exchange and social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.). As such, both social linkages and semantics of the exchanged content must be considered in analysis of such networks. The proposed framework in this study aims to analyze both the social and semantic aspects of these networks. We developed the framework through analysis of the social networks formed around Twitter accounts of infrastructure megaprojects. To assure relevance to construction research and practices, three objectives guided our analysis: relaying on a large and diversified data corpus from construction projects; testing the applicability and usage of a set of relevant algorithms to the context of construction project management; and linking the results of data analysis and algorithm evaluation to the conditions of construction projects at hand. In examining algorithms for detecting sub-communities, the Louvain fast unfolding modularity maximization was more suitable in detecting project relevant sub-groups. For assessing the relative influence of actors, PageRank algorithm performed better than centrality measures. For extracting key terms, we found that modifying the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) measure to incorporate the relative importance of the source nodes enhances the relevance of extracted terms. Obliviously, Twitter networks are only one type of project networks that can cover a limited/biased sample of participants. Their analysis should be one component of the overall project network analysis. We believe that the proposed framework has the same level of applicability to internal networks of project teams as well as non-Twitter networks.

Genetic Algorithm-Based Acoustic-Source Inversion Approach to Detect Multiple Moving Wave Sources of an Arbitrary Number	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Identification of moving wave sources; Inverse-source modeling; Finite element method (FEM); Genetic algorithm (GA)	TIME-REVERSAL; FORCE IDENTIFICATION; HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA; DAMAGE DETECTION; ELEMENT-METHOD; LOCALIZATION; PROPAGATION; VIBRATIONS; VEHICLES; BEAMS	Acoustic-source inversion in the time domain can be used for a broad range of engineering applications [for example, detecting speeds and weights of overweight trucks on urban roads and locating underwater moving acoustic sources (i.e., naval surveillance)]. However, past studies have not shown whether it is feasible to determine the profiles of moving wave sources without knowing the number of target sources. To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents a genetic algorithm (GA)-based acoustic-source inversion algorithm to identify the amplitudes, positions, and speeds of multiple moving sources by using wave motions recorded at sensors within a heterogeneous one-dimensional solid bar system without knowing the number of targets. To this end, the authors cast this problem into an inverse-source problem, in which solutions can be obtained via minimization of a misfit between measured wave responses and numerically computed responses found using estimated parameters. The wave responses due to moving sources are computed by using the finite element method (FEM) in the time domain. The presented FEM modeling successfully captures the shifts of frequency contents (i.e., the Doppler effect) of wave responses that are generated by moving wave sources. The numerical results, for which the GA is used for the minimization process, show that it is possible to detect the parameters of moving sources in a heterogeneous host without knowing how many targeted sources exist in advance. It is also observed that greater computational cost (i.e., iteration number of the GA) and denser distribution of sensors are required to detect a larger number of moving wave sources. Similarly, larger computational costs are required for a heterogeneous host than a homogeneous one. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The potential for infrastructure and urban improvement remains unrealized, however, due to technical, financial, and social constraints and criticisms that limit the implementation of smart cities concepts for infrastructure management. The discussion presented here provides a review of smart technologies including sensors, crowdsourcing and citizen science, actuators, data transmission, Internet of Things, big data analytics, data visualization, and blockchain, which can be used for infrastructure management. Smart infrastructure programs are reviewed to explore how enabling technologies have been applied across civil engineering domains, including transportation systems, water systems, air quality, energy infrastructure, solid waste management, construction engineering and management, structures, and geotechnical systems. Gaps in the application of smart technologies for infrastructure systems are identified, and we highlight how the civil engineering profession can adopt new roles toward the development of smart cities applications. These roles are: (1) master designer: civil engineers can identify ready applications of enabling technologies to improve the delivery of urban resources and services; (2) steward: civil engineers must account for both the environmental and societal impacts of smart infrastructure applications; (3) innovator and integrator: civil engineers should integrate across diverse sectors and groups of experts to develop smart infrastructure programs; (4) manager of risk: civil engineers should manage existing and growing risks of natural disasters, emergencies, and climate change; they should also manage new vulnerabilities in the privacy and security of individuals and households that are introduced through smart technologies; and (5) leader and decision maker: civil engineers can take a lead in smart infrastructure discussions and policy development.

J	Fuller, T; Hasan, A; Kamardeen, I				Fuller, Tamara; Hasan, Abid; Kamardeen, Imriyas			A systematic review of factors influencing the implementation of health promotion programs in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						Health promotion program; Health policy; Construction workers; Health and safety; Systematic review	WORKPLACE HEALTH; WORKERS; INTERVENTION; DIETARY; SAFETY; MANAGEMENT; ISSUES; RISK	Purpose The construction industry has a poor reputation for an unhealthy lifestyle and a high prevalence of health problems such as obesity, stress and hypertension among construction workers. The review examines the factors influencing the design and delivery of health promotion programs implemented by construction organisations to educate workers and promote a healthy lifestyle. It also identifies gaps in research and practices and proposes directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of 51 relevant journal articles published during 2010-2019 was undertaken to achieve the aim of the study. Findings The review reveals 46 different factors grouped into four major themes related to individuals, organisations, industry and the program, influencing the successful implementation of health promotion programs. The top ten most cited factors are cost, time, facilities and resources, transient workforce, delivery method, influence from managers, long working hours, masculine culture, production pressure and interest. The review also found a noticeable lack of studies on implementing health promotion programs in the context of developing countries, small and medium-sized construction organisations, residential sector workers, and construction professionals and female workers. Research limitations/implications The review's scope is limited to research on health promotion programs, and it did not investigate the factors affecting the health of construction workers in construction projects. Practical implications A better understanding of various influencing factors present at different decision levels will inform the future implementation of targeted workforce health promotion strategies to foster construction workers' health and well-being. Originality/value The review reveals bottlenecks that need to be addressed to successfully implement health promotion programs in the construction industry. It provides new insights that can improve existing health and workplace policies and health promotion programs in the construction industry. Finally, it identifies new research directions in a neglected but crucial area of workers' health and safety management.

J	Nnaji, C; Gambatese, J; Karakhan, A; Eseonu, C				Nnaji, Chukwuma; Gambatese, John; Karakhan, Ali; Eseonu, Chinweike			Influential safety technology adoption predictors in construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Technology adoption; Success predictors; Mixed method	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; UNITED-STATES; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; HEALTH; ORGANIZATIONS; ANTECEDENTS; ACCEPTANCE	Purpose Existing literature suggests that construction worker safety could be optimized using emerging technologies. However, the application of safety technologies in the construction industry is limited. One reason for the constrained adoption of safety technologies is the lack of empirical information for mitigating the risk of a failed adoption. The purpose of this paper is to fill the research gap through identifying key factors that predict successful adoption of safety technologies. Design/methodology/approach In total, 26 key technology adoption predictors were identified and classified using a combination of literature review and an expert panel. The level of influence for each identified safety technology adoption predictor was assessed and ranked using the Relative Importance Index. Analysis of variance was performed as well to assess the potential difference in perceived level of importance for the predictors when the study participants were clustered according to work experience and company size. Findings Statistical analysis indicates that 12 out of the 26 predictors identified are highly influential regarding technology adoption decision-making in construction. Technology reliability, effectiveness and durability were ranked as the most influential predictors. The participants who work for small companies and who had less than ten years of experience rated individual- and technology-related predictors significantly lower than the experienced participants working for medium and large companies. Practical implications - The present study provides construction researchers and practitioners with valuable information regarding safety technology predictors and their magnitude, both of which are essential elements of a successful safety technology adoption process. Improved technology adoption can enhance workplace safety and minimize worker injuries, providing substantial benefits to the construction industry. Originality/value This study contributes to technology adoption knowledge by identifying and quantifying the influential predictors of safety technologies in relation to different organizational contexts. The study informs the need to develop an integrated conceptual model for safety technology adoption.

However, these studies were unable to draw conclusions about which enabling factor has the most impact and thus should receive the most attention. In the perspective of a developing country such as the Philippines where economic development is important, enabling factor identification is a crucial task as it provides inputs to decision-makers, policy-makers, and engineering managers in framing guidelines and directions for important activities such as resource allocation, strategic planning, prioritization of initiatives, and policy formulation. A case study was carried out at the University of the Philippines Technology Business Incubator (TBI), one of the established TBIs in the Philippines. Prioritization was performed using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Findings suggest that on-site business expertise, the suggested ideas on situational experiences (technology/ideas), and the confidential techniques or information that would assist the incubatees (know-how) are the most relevant enabling factors for incubatees' success. In contrast, in-kind financial support, concise program milestones with clear policies and procedures, and expert organization emerge as the least important factors. Engineering managers are crucial in addressing these top enabling factors. These would help incubators and engineering managers formulate policies to improve their operations such as attracting and retaining the best management academics and practitioners to support their incubatees. Engineering managers can support incubatees in optimization studies and engineering experiments for the efficient and effective adoption of the incubatees' technologies. Policy-makers must also consider incentivizing private institutions and successful entrepreneurs to be involved in the incubation programs.

J	Bristow, EC; Brumbelow, K				Bristow, Elizabeth C.; Brumbelow, Kelly			Delay between Sensing and Response in Water Contamination Events	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Delay time; Emergency services; Infrastructure; Municipal water; Public safety; Terrorism; Water management; Water pollution		Determining the consequences of a water contamination event is an important concern in the field of water systems security. Morbidity and mortality resulting from such a contamination are influenced in part by the amount of contaminated water consumed and the time between consumption and medical treatment. Water quality sensors in the water distribution network may shorten this time and help the users avoid the contaminant's adverse effects by alerting authorities to unusual water quality parameters; otherwise, the authorities may first suspect contamination when the victims begin seeking treatment. Once the irregular water quality parameters have been detected, some time may still elapse before all users stop consuming the contaminated water. Modeling this additional delay is the focus of this article. This delay has been divided into five independent, sequential processes. The first phase is the amount of time required to transmit the sensed or measured contaminant concentrations to the local authorities. The second process includes the authorities' efforts to verify that there is a genuine contamination event, usually through additional water quality tests. The third stage includes any measures that the authorities take in preparation to alerting the public to the threat including agency coordination, drafting announcements, contacting media, and printing flyers. The fourth phase of the delay is the time required to transmit the news of the contamination to the public. The final period encompasses the time elapsed while the system users, after being informed of the contamination, decide whether or not to comply with instructions on how to avoid the adverse effects. Probability distributions are constructed for the duration of each phase of the delay based on data collected from historical water contamination events and other disasters and characteristics of typical sensor networks. The entire response process is modeled using a Monte Carlo approach to determine probability distributions of response delay.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a five-factor model that can be used to diagnose and measure safety climate in construction safety research and practice. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review was adopted, and following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 574 articles were selected at the start of the study based on a developed review protocol for investigating safety climate factors. While examining the factor analysis of different studies, data reliability and data validity of the individual research findings were considered and frequency of factors uploaded was used to determine the significance as a quantitative measure to develop the ranking of safety climate factors. Findings The review identified that, from the established measures of safety climate in construction, there is little uniformity on factor importance. However, management commitment safety system role of the supervisor; workers' involvement and group safety climate were found to be the most common across the studies reviewed. It is proposed these factors are used to inform a five-factor model for investigating safety climate in the construction industry. Originality/value The findings of this study will motivate researchers and practitioners in safety to use the five-factor safety climate model presented in this paper and test it to develop a common factor structure for the construction industry. The fact that the model is comprised of five factors makes it easier to be used and implemented by small-to medium-sized construction companies, therefore enhancing its potential use.

David			Empirical Analysis of Host-Country Effects in the International Construction Market: An Industry-Level Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International construction; Project profitability; Host-country effect; Variance-component model; Empirical analysis; Organizational issues	DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; ENTRY; STRATEGIES; MODEL; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTS	The international construction market has significantly grown in the past decades, and it has created new opportunities for engineering and construction firms to expand their businesses into foreign countries. However, this market is primarily riskier than the domestic market because of differences of political, economic, social, cultural, and business environments. Because firms are profit-seeking entities, it is vital for them to explicitly understand those risks in both macrodimensions and microdimensions such as country level and project level, and they must be well prepared to assess and mitigate those risks to successfully gain the anticipated profits. The goal of this paper is to empirically analyze the host-country effects (i.e.,macrolevel risks) on the profitability of international engineering and construction projects. A total of 2,821 projects completed by Korean engineering and construction firms from 1993 to 2012 were analyzed using the variance-component model. The results show that (1)host-country effects contribute to the profitability of projects indirectly (interaction with firm capabilities) rather than directly (independently); (2)host-country effects are more evident in booming periods than in recession or transition periods; (3)host-country effects are greater in less-developed countries than in developed countries; and (4)host-country effects are more significant for large firms than for small-medium firms. The findings of this paper are also significant in that they provide a data-driven strategic guidance for top managements of international firms, particularly for their country diversification planning and country portfolio management. The process and methodology used in this paper is repeatable, and it can be directly adopted by international firms in the construction industry for a macrolevel-risk analysis of their future international projects.

Fuzzy Set Theory Approach to Classify Highway Project Characteristics for Delivery Selection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fuzzy set theory; Cluster analysis; Project delivery methods; Cost performance; Complexity; Risks	CLUSTER VALIDITY; DECISION-MAKING; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Selecting an appropriate delivery method for highway projects is a complex decision process. Delivery decisions typically involve evaluating both quantitative (e.g., cost, schedule) and qualitative (e.g., project complexity, delivery risk) criteria. Although many studies have proposed processes and guidance to select the most suitable delivery method, there is a lack of understanding on how to rigorously address qualitative criteria. This study aimed at applying fuzzy cluster analysis to investigate cost performance associated with qualitative criteria, including project complexity and delivery risk. The proposed approach includes three main steps: (1) assess data clustering tendency; (2) determine number of clusters; and (3) validate clustering result. An empirical data set of 254 completed highway projects was used to develop and illustrate the proposed approach. The result shows seven clusters for comparing cost performance between design-bid-build (D-B-B) and design-build (D-B) projects. D-B-B produces low-cost growth for Project Cluster 1, but medium- to high-cost growth for Project Cluster 3. D-B produces low-cost growth for Project Clusters 2, 4, 5, and 7. For Cluster 6, there is no difference in cost growth between D-B-B and D-B. The findings also indicate that D-B outperformed D-B-B in new, complex, and highly risky projects, whereas D-B-B was a better choice in certain reconstruction projects. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying seven groups of highway projects that have many commonalities with respect to project attributes and cost performance associated with the use of D-B-B and D-B. The identified groups may help highway agencies better understand and select the most suitable delivery method for their projects.	[Nguyen, Phuong H.

J	Jebelli, H; Choi, B; Lee, S				Jebelli, Houtan; Choi, Byungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			Application of Wearable Biosensors to Construction Sites. I: Assessing Workers' Stress	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers' stress prediction; Physiological signals; Wearable sensor; Supervised learning; Workers' safety; Health and productivity; Occupational stress	GALVANIC SKIN-RESPONSE; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS; BODY-TEMPERATURE; MENTAL STRESS; SENSORS; PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION; CORTISOL; HEALTH	One of the major hazards of the workplace, and in life in general, is occupational stress, which adversely affects workers' well-being, safety, and productivity. The construction industry is one of the most stressful occupations. Current stress-assessment tools rely either on a subject's perceived stress (e.g., stress questionnaires) or an individual's chemical reaction to stressors (e.g., cortisol hormone). However, these methods can interrupt ongoing tasks and therefore may not be suitable for continuous measurement. To address this problem, the authors aim to develop and validate a framework for noninvasive and nonsubjective measurement of worker stress by examining changes in workers' physiological signals collected from a wearable biosensor. The framework applies various filtering methods to reduce physiological signal noises and extracts the patterns of physiological signals as workers experience various stress levels. Then, the framework learns these patterns by applying a supervised-learning algorithm. To examine the performance of the proposed framework, the authors collected a physiological signal from 10 construction workers in the field. The proposed framework resulted in a stress-prediction accuracy of 84.48% in distinguishing between low and high stress levels and 73.28% in distinguishing among low, medium, and high stress levels. The results confirmed the potential of the proposed framework for assessing workers' stress in the field. Automatic predictions of workers' physical demand levels based on physiological signals is described in a companion paper. This study, along with the companion paper, contributes to the body of knowledge on the in-depth understanding of construction workers' stress on construction sites by developing a noninvasive means for continuous monitoring and assessing workers' stress. The proposed stress-recognition framework is expected to enhance workers' health, safety, and productivity through early detection of occupational stressors on actual sites.

To achieve this aim, a research methodology consisted of literature review and survey questionnaire was developed to accomplish three objectives. First, literature review was used to investigate the nature of the construction industry, identify and classify the causes of site accidents as well as their social and economic impacts on organizations and affected families. Second, a survey questionnaire was conducted with a representative sample of large and medium sized construction firms in Egypt to examine their perception of the causes of site accidents. Finally, outlining research conclusions and recommendations useful to construction firms and governmental organizations. The research identified 16 causes of construction site accidents. These causes were classified into three categories based on the party responsible for the occurrence of site accidents namely, workers, organization management and government. Results of data analysis showed that "Lack of housekeeping" and "Lack of governmental inspection for Safety" were ranked the highest causes of site accidents in the Egyptian construction industry, while "inefficiency of old safety equipment or no safety equipment at all" and "reluctance to input resources for Safety" were ranked the least causes. Moreover, Spearman correlation test showed there are relationships between many causes in which some causes may affect the occurrence of other causes. This research provides valuable information about the nature of the construction industry with particular focus on site accidents, causes and impacts of construction site accidents. The research tackled a topic that received scant attention in construction literature especially in the Egypt context. The work presented in this paper represents a synthesis that is important and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred in the Egyptian construction industry.

The limited available research concerning the applications of AR visualization means in assembly highlights the need for a structured methodology of addressing cognitive and usability issues for the application potentials of AR technology to be fully realized. Thus, the focus of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how much improvement in assembly productivity and performance can be achieved by lowering cognitive workload via AR. The AR system was developed in collaboration with Woodside Energy Ltd. following research project ECHO. Evaluation of the prototyped construction piping scenario revealed that the AR visualization yielded shorter task completion time (50% reduction), fewer assembly errors (50% reduction), and lower total task load. More specific findings also indicated that the animated AR visualization significantly shortened the original time (55% reduction) and rework time (46% reduction), payment to assemblers (50% reduction), and cost of correcting erroneous assembly (66% reduction). Questionnaire feedback revealed that the animated AR visualization better aided assembly comprehension and better facilitated information retrieval and collaboration between human and guidance medium. From a technology innovation perspective, by providing a higher level of immersion and interaction with spatial awareness, the dynamic AR guidance can be integrated with building information model (BIM) technology in helping and training practitioners, because all of the models and assembly sequences are designed in BIM and visualized in AR.

J	Cao, Y; Ashuri, B				Cao, Yang; Ashuri, Baabak			Predicting the Volatility of Highway Construction Cost Index Using Long Short-Term Memory	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction cost index; Cost prediction; Time series forecasting; Artificial intelligence		The highway construction cost index (HCCI) is a composite indicator that reflects the price trend of the highway construction industry. Most available indexes exhibit significant variation, creating a challenge for state agencies to make accurate budget estimations. Numerous researchers have attempted to forecast the index using quantitative models, but two major problems still exist. First, few models work effectively with highly volatile data. A model that is only fitted well with stable data does not validate its forecasting power. Second, a good prediction model should be able to forecast at different time horizons. Many prior research projects only predicted one index point ahead, limiting the application effectivity in practice. This research fills the gap by applying the long short-term memory (LSTM) units built in the encoder and decoder architecture to model and predict the variation of the HCCI. An illustrative example used the Texas HCCI as the raw data, and the results were compared to the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. The results show that the developed LSTM model outperformed the time series models in terms of providing more accurate prediction in all three forecasting scenarios, short-term, medium-term, and long-term prediction. The main contributions of this study to the body of knowledge in cost engineering and forecasting are summarized in the following two areas: first, the paper presents a novel application of an artificial intelligence algorithm for cost index forecasting that provides more accurate prediction than the prevailing time series models, particularly for highly volatile cost indexes. Future researchers could be benefited from the explored results in this paper and use them as a referenced benchmark. Second, this is one of the first papers in construction management that shows the performance of the forecasting models when shape-change of index exists.

A single high-intensity tornado can result in high casualty rates and catastrophic economic and social consequences, particularly for small- to medium-size communities. Comprehensive community resilience assessment and improvement requires the analyst to develop a model of interacting physical, social, and economic systems and to measure outcomes that result from specific decisions made. These outcomes often are in the form of metrics such as the number of people injured or the number of households and/or businesses without water, but it has been recognized that most community resilience metrics have socioeconomic characteristics. In this study, for the first time, a fully quantitative interacting model is used to examine the effect of a tornado damaging physical infrastructure (buildings and electrical power network) and the effects on the population and the local economy for a real community. Then, three residential building retrofit strategies are considered as alternatives to improve community resilience, and the metrics for the physical, economic, and social sectors are computed. An illustrative example is presented for the 2011 Joplin tornado in a new open-source Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE), with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economics model that computes household income, employment, and domestic supply before and after the tornado. Detailed demographic data was allocated to each structure to enable the calculation of resilience metrics related to population dislocation impacts from the tornado. The results of these analyses stemming from building damage estimation have a logical trend, but the substantial contribution of this work is that, for the first time, the effect of retrofit strategies for tornado loading can be quantified in terms of their effects on socioeconomic metrics.

J	Zhao, XB; Hwang, BG; Low, SP				Zhao, Xianbo; Hwang, Bon-Gang; Low, Sui Pheng			Enterprise risk management in international construction firms: drivers and hindrances	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Singapore; Driver; Construction firm; Hindrance; Implementation; Enterprise risk management	COMPANIES; PROJECTS	Purpose - The specific purposes of this paper are: to identify the critical drivers for and hindrances to enterprise risk management (ERM) implementation; and to compare the influence of these factors on ERM implementation between large and small-medium (SM) Chinese construction firms (CCFs) in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted and responses were received from 35 experienced managers in CCFs operating in Singapore. Findings - A total of 13 drivers and 22 hindrances were found critical to ERM implementation in Singapore-based CCFs. "Improved decision making" were the top influential driver, while "insufficient resources (e.g. time, money, people, etc.)" were the most significant hindrances. Additionally, despite significant differences in the mean scores of seven drivers and four hindrances, the large and SM CCFs agreed on the rankings of drivers and hindrances, respectively. Research limitations/implications - As the survey was performed with the Singapore-based CCFs, there may be geographical limitation on the identification of the critical drivers for and hindrances to ERM implementation. The sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. Practical implications - The findings of this study allow the management to strengthen the positive influence from the drivers and overcome the challenges posed by the significant hindrances. Originality/value - Despite studies on ERM in various industries, few studies have attempted to disclose the factors driving and hindering ERM implementation in construction firms. Thus, this study expands the existing literature relating to ERM. An understanding of the drivers for ERM implementation enables the management to obtain sufficient support for the ERM program and strengthen the positive influence from the drivers. The identification of the hindrances allows the management to be clear about the challenges faced by the ERM program and take measures to diminish their negative influence and overcome them. Additionally, other construction firms can use the drivers and hindrances identified in this study to prepare their customized list of drivers and hindrances.

J	Liu, SJ				Liu, SJ			Industrial development and structural adaptation in Taiwan: Some issues of learned entrepreneurship	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						entrepreneurship; industrial competition; intellectual property; market governance; structural change; Taiwan	GROWTH; MIRACLE	The industrialization of Taiwan has been a remarkable phenomenon. This paper discusses recent changes in Taiwan's manufacturing industries and the response of both government and private enterprises to the challenges presented by a dynamic environment and by global competition. Several cases are discussed in light of the activities and adjustments on the part of government and of the public sector, of small and medium business, and of high-tech industries. Government participation over the last four decades has been and will remain pivotal in economic growth and in achieving adjusted positioning. Taiwan's personal computer and IC industries have evolved from an infant stage through an accelerated growth period and are now extending to other technologically associated industries. The small enterprise sector is in a transitional stage of upgrading competitive niches. The unsuccessful stories of biopharmaceuticals and automobiles are discussed in terms of what they reveal about government intervention and the performance of public research institutes. Active patenting activities by Taiwan enterprises and public research institutes illustrate the accumulated technological capability found on this island. The accelerated sociopolitical movements toward democracy, the bureaucratic management of public issues, and the political and economic interactions between Taiwan and China, exert significant effects on the industrial structure and on government's role in directing the industrial evolution. This article presents an integrated reasoning of Taiwan's economic success, It reveals that the neoclassical doctrine of market efficiency is fundamentally valid, and that the effective commercialization of national technological capability has created Taiwan's industrial evolution. Market governance proved to be an efficient short-term policy instrument when the latecomer strategy of cost leadership was applied. A conceptual model of industrial competition and technology commercialization is also proposed to facilitate the methodological analysis. This study concludes that learning capability and human capital will determine the endurance of Taiwan's industrial success, and that entrepreneurship must be learned by the state, as well as by the private firms.

Project manager's role in safety performance of Saudi construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project manager; SMEs; Construction; Project management; Health and safety	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CULTURE; CLIMATE; HEALTH; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTRACTORS; PERCEPTIONS; REGRESSION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the primary research question, which is what is the relationship between the project manager's (PM) possession of the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification and the level of the safety culture present in the construction project the PM manages. Design/methodology/approach The research was based on a survey of a purposive sample, 109 engineers and first-line supervisors worked in 23 construction projects of which ten were led by PMP-certified PMs and 13 were led by PMs lacking PMP certification. Each PM completed a demographic questionnaire for the predictor variables of PMP certification controlled for age and experience. To assess the criterion variable of safety culture total score, engineers and first-line supervisors working in the same project completed the questionnaire of safety culture values and practices. Findings Results of this study indicated the level of safety culture was significantly different, and improved, for engineers and first-line supervisors who work under PMs with PMP certification compared to the level of safety culture in projects managed by PMs with no PMP certification. Although alignment of safety culture perceptions among different levels in the organization helps to achieve a positive safety culture, the role of the PM in transferring, implementing and maintaining the safety culture in the construction project is fundamental, particularly in small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Originality/value This study addressed the role of the PMs managerial skills in the safety performance of Saudi Arabian SMEs. The principal finding was that PMs with managerial skills perform better regarding safety performance in SME construction projects than PMs lacking managerial skills. The primary recommendation is that leaders in construction projects must carefully evaluate engineers' managerial skills before hiring the individuals as PMs. A PM's promotion model developed in this study provides a suitable framework and business process component for construction leaders seeking to maintain safety performance successfully.

J	Nucera, C; di Scalea, FL				Nucera, Claudio; di Scalea, Francesco Lanza			Modeling of Nonlinear Guided Waves and Applications to Structural Health Monitoring	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nonlinear ultrasonic guided waves; Higher harmonics generation; Semi-analytical finite element; Internal resonance; Structural health monitoring	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; FATIGUE-CRACK DETECTION; PROPAGATION; DAMAGE; PIPES; COMPUTATION; GENERATION; INSPECTION; ACOUSTICS; BONDS	Propagation of nonlinear waves in solid waveguides is a branch of wave mechanics that has received ever-increasing interest in the last few decades. Nonlinear guided waves are promising candidates for interrogating long waveguide-like structures as they conveniently combine high sensitivity to peculiar structural conditions (defects, quasi-static loads, instability conditions), typical of nonlinear parameters, with large inspection ranges, characteristic of wave propagation in confined media. However, the mathematical framework governing the nonlinear guided wave phenomena becomes extremely difficult when characterized to waveguides that are complex in either material (damping, anisotropy, heterogeneous, and the like) or geometry (multilayers, geometric periodicity, and the like). Therefore, the successful use of nonlinear guided waves as a structural diagnostic tool is not always a trivial task. In particular, the efficiency of nonlinear structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques based on higher-harmonics generation (harmonics generated by a monochromatic input in nonlinear waveguides) strongly relies on the correct identification of favorable combinations of primary and resonant double-harmonic nonlinear wave modes for which the nonlinear response is cumulative. The present work develops predictions of nonlinear second-harmonic generation and identifies these combinations of wave modes in complex waveguides by extending the classical semianalytical finite-element formulation to the nonlinear regime, and implementing it into a highly flexible, yet very powerful, commercial finite-element code. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked for four case studies, including a railroad track, a viscoelastic plate, a composite quasi-isotropic laminate, and a reinforced concrete slab. In all these cases, this tool successfully identified appropriate combinations of resonant guided modes (satisfying synchronism and large cross-energy transfer). These results open up new possibilities for the analysis of dispersion and resonance conditions for a variety of complex structural waveguides that do not lend themselves to alternative analyses, such as purely analytical solutions.

Technology adoption in the BIM implementation for lean architectural practice	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Technology adoption; Architectural practice; Design process; Lean efficiency gains		Justification for research: The construction companies are facing barriers and challenges in BIM adoption as there is no clear guidance or best practice studies from which they can learn and build up their capacity for BIM use in order to increase productivity, efficiency, quality, and to attain competitive advantages in the global market and to achieve the targets in environmental sustainability. Purpose: This paper aims to explain a comprehensive and systemic evaluation and assessment of the relevant BIM technologies as part of the BIM adoption and implementation to demonstrate how efficiency gains have been achieved towards a lean architectural practice. Design/methodology/approach: The research is undertaken through a KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) project between the University of Salford and the John McCall Architects based in Liverpool, which is an SME (Small Medium Enterprise). The overall aim of KTP is to develop a lean design practice through the BIM adoption and implementation. The overall BIM implementation approach uses a socio-technical view in which it does not only consider the implementation of technology but also considers the socio-cultural environment that provides the context for its implementation. The technology adoption methodology within the BIM implementation approach is the action research oriented qualitative and quantitative research for discovery, comparison, and experimentation as the KTP project with JMA provides an environment for "learning by doing". Findings: Research has proved that BIM technology adoption should be undertaken with a bottom-up approach rather than top-down approach for successful change management and dealing with the resistance to change. As a result of the BIM technology adoption, efficiency gains are achieved through the piloting projects and the design process is improved through the elimination of wastes and value generation. Originality/value: Successful BIM adoption needs an implementation strategy. However, at operational level, it is imperative that professional guidelines are required as part of the implementation strategy. This paper introduces a systematic approach for BIM technology adoption based on a case study implementation and it demonstrates a guideline at the operational level for other architectural companies of architectural practices.

J	Vuorinen, L; Martinsuo, MM				Vuorinen, Lauri; Martinsuo, Miia Maarit			Lifecycle view of managing different changes in projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Change management; Improvisation	MANAGEMENT; IMPROVISATION; FLEXIBILITY; LESSONS; PLANS	Purpose A project contractor can promote the success of a delivery project by planning the project well and following a project management methodology (PMM). However, various changes typically take place, requiring changes to the project plan and actions that deviate from the firm's established PMM. The purpose of this paper is to explore different types of changes and change management activities over the lifecycle of delivery projects. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative single case study design was used. In total, 17 semi-structured interviews were carried out during a delivery project in a medium-sized engineering company that delivers complex systems to industrial customers. Findings Both plan-related changes and deviations from the PMM were mapped throughout the project lifecycle. Various internal and external sources of change were identified. An illustrative example of the interconnectedness of the changes reveals the potential escalation of changes over the project lifecycle. Managers and project personnel engage in different change management activities and improvisation to create alternative paths, re-plan, catch up, and optimize project performance after changes. Research limitations/implications The empirical study is limited to a single case study setting and a single industry. The findings draw attention to the interconnectedness and potential escalation effect of changes over the lifecycle of the project, and the need for integrated change management and improvisation actions. Practical implications Efficient change management and improvisation at the early phase of a delivery project can potentially mitigate negative change incidents in later project phases. Changes are not only the project manager's concern; project personnel's skilled change responses are also helpful. The findings emphasize the importance of the project customer as a source of changes in delivery projects, meaning that customer relationship management throughout the project lifecycle is needed for successful change management. Originality/value The study offers increased understanding of changes and change management throughout the project lifecycle. The results show evidence of plan-related and methodology-related changes and their interconnections, thereby proposing a lifecycle view of integrated change management and improvisation in projects.

These applications and technologies have inadequate interoperability and there is still a dearth of investigations addressing interoperability issues in the structural engineering domain. This paper proposes a novel approach which combines an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based Unified Information Model with a number of algorithms to enhance the interoperability: (a) between architectural and structural models, and (b) among multiple structural analysis models (bidirectional conversion or round tripping). The proposed approach aims to achieve the conversion by overcoming the inconsistencies in data structures, representation logics and syntax used in different software applications. The approach was implemented in both Client Server (C/S) and Browser Server (B/S) environments to enable central and remote collaboration among geographically dispersed users. The platforms were tested in four large real-life projects. The testing involved four key scenarios: (a) the bidirectional conversion among four structural analysis tools; (b) the comparison of the conversion via the proposed approach with the conversion via direct links among the involved tools; (c) the direct export from an IFC-based architectural tool through the Application Program Interface (API), and (d) the conversion and visualization of structural analysis results. All these scenarios were successfully performed and tested in four significant case studies. In particular, the conversion among the four structural analysis applications (ETABS, SAP2000, ANSYS and MIDAS) was successfully tested for all possible conversion routes among the four applications in two of the case studies (i.e., Project A and Project B). The first four steps of natural mode shapes and their natural vibration periods were calculated and compared with the converted models. They were all achieved within a standard deviation of 0.1 s and 0.2 sin Project A and Project B, respectively, indicating an accurate conversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, IT; Lin, YC; Lee, HY				Yang, I-Tung; Lin, Yu-Cheng; Lee, Hsin-Yun			Use of Support Vector Regression to Improve Computational Efficiency of Stochastic Time-Cost Trade-Off	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stochastic processes; Multiple objective analysis; Optimization; Construction costs; Time factors; Time-cost trade-off; Multiobjective optimization; Support vector regression; Particle swarm optimization; Metaheuristic; Uncertainty analysis; Cost and schedule	CONSTRUCTION TIME; PARTICLE SWARM; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; GA; APPROXIMATION; CONVERGENCE; MODEL	Stochastic time-cost trade-off has been a popular object of investigation in past decades because there are uncertain factors that can be considered when determining the appropriate trade-off between project completion time and cost. Previous studies, however, have implemented a double loop procedure, which performs optimization in the outer loop and simulation in the inner loop. The double loop procedure is ponderous because it requires an unacceptably long computation time (taking hours or days), even for a small to medium project. The present study proposes an integrated system that converts the double loop to single loops,thereby dramatically reducing computation time. This is done by incorporating a support vector regression model to obtain a decision function, which will be used to replace the time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the objective function values for individual solutions. With the objective function values, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to search for the Pareto front composed of nondominated solutions. It has been empirically shown that the proposed system significantly outperforms the conventional double loop procedure because the former can consistently generate a better Pareto front (with a larger hyperarea ratio) hundreds of times faster by using much less computation time. The Student's t test is performed to validate the superiority of the proposed system. The contribution of the proposed system is multifold. First, improved computational efficiency is essential for the widespread acceptance of the stochastic time-cost trade-off analysis in practical applications. Second, with less computation time spent in simulation, efforts can be focused on the search for much better nondominated solutions. Third, the proposed system can incorporate the risk attitudes of the decision makers into the analysis by allowing them to specify the probability that they can tolerate for project duration (cost) to exceed a certain limit.

However, in current practice, the implementation of the MC in the industrialized housing industry has not achieved an ideal level. Little effort was devoted to customer value generation and achieving lean production in a multi-disciplinary MC environment. In this concern, a highly efficient and flexible production information system is expected to capture accurately the customer's demand and efficiently perform work planning for encouraging customer involvement and mass efficiency production. Design/methodology/approach To gain an insight into the development of the MC production information system for the housing industry and to depict the interaction among system modules, this study used a design science research methodology for a case study of customized cabinet production information system development. Findings A prototype of the production information system was proposed in this paper, supported by three information technologies to facilitate the MC implementation in the millwork manufacturer. A focus group discussion method was carried out for evaluating the system feasibility and the subsequent survey analysis on the virtual reality (VR) interface experiment. The evaluation process results showed that the VR interface is an effective medium for design information communication and encourages customer involvement. Most participants believed that the proposed production information system could generally benefit the MC implementation and improve production efficiency. Originality/value This study integrated lean production principles along with building information modelling, VR and discrete-event simulation in the production information system to assist the manufacturer in effectively handling variant product information and enabling quicker reactions in response to diverse customer requirements in housing industries. The coordination among system modules and the managed information flow could be a valuable reference for future MC production system development in housing industries.

J	Kassem, M; Succar, B				Kassem, Mohamad; Succar, Bilal			Macro BIM adoption: Comparative market analysis	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Macro adoption models; BIM adoption benchmarks; BIM policy development; BIM Framework	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; IMPLEMENTATION; DIFFUSION; SNOWBALL; MODELS	The adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) across markets is a pertinent topic for academic discourse and industry attention. This is evidenced by the unrelenting release of national BIM initiatives; new BIM protocols; and candidate international standards. This paper is the second part of an ongoing Macro BIM Adoption study: the first paper "Macro BIM Adoption: Conceptual Structures" (Succar and Kassem, 2015) introduced five conceptual models for assessing macro BIM adoption across markets and informing the development of BIM adoption policies. This second paper clarifies how these models are validated through capturing the input of 99 experts from 21 countries using a survey tool; highlights the commonalities and differences between sample countries with respect to BIM adoption; and introduces sample tools and templates for either developing or calibrating BIM adoption policies. Survey data collected indicate that all five conceptual models demonstrate high levels of 'clarity', 'accuracy' and 'usefulness', the three metrics measured. They also indicate (1) varying rates of BIM diffusion across countries with BIM capability near the lower-end of the spectrum; (2) varying levels of BIM maturity with - the mean of - most macro BIM components falling below the medium level; (3) varying diffusion dynamics across countries with the prevalence of the middle-out diffusion dynamic; (4) varying policy actions across countries with a predominance of the passive policy approach; and (5) varying distribution of diffusion responsibilities among player groups with no detectable dominant pattern across countries. The two papers provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of BIM adoption dynamics across countries. Future research can build upon the models and tools introduced to enable (a) an expansion of benchmarking data through surveying additional countries; (b) identifying BIM adoption changes in surveyed countries over time; (c) correlating changes in adoption rates/patterns with policy interventions; (d) identifying BIM policy variations within the same country; (e) establishing statistical correlations between the conceptual models; and (f) developing new tools to facilitate BIM policy development and encouraging BIM adoption.

In this context, performance indicators have been used as the basis for decision support by various sectors of the construction industry. The Brazilian apartment building-construction sector is the industry sector with the highest individual contribution (on the basis of gross domestic product) to the construction process, mostly composed of small-and medium-sized businesses. In the residential-construction sector, most decisions are made in very unstructured and intuitive ways, and the initial budgeting process is one of the most critical phases because of the high level of uncertainty in a project's early stages. In addition, most methods for measuring performance on the basis of indicators have been developed without regard to the preferences and values of the persons responsible for improving the unique environment in which budgeting problems occur. Using the multicriteria decision aid-constructivist methodology (MCDA-C), a framework for budget performance evaluation for apartment-building projects was developed in which the characteristics of the context evaluated have been identified, organized, measured, and integrated according to the decision maker's values and preferences. The framework enables decision makers to understand the current situation more accurately with respect to each criterion evaluated and to the whole. This allows planning actions to improve the budget process to ensure better quality and accuracy, determine the impact of such actions on the overall assessment of the context, and prioritize actions according to goals. Performance-evaluation models built with theMCDA-C have the capacity to generate knowledge concerning the contexts decision makers intend to improve and can be used as tools to produce competitive advantages.

J	van Leeuwen, JP; van der Zee, A				van Leeuwen, JP; van der Zee, A			Distributed object models for collaboration in the construction industry	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction	SEP, 2003	Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, NETHERLANDS		Eindhoven Univ Technol	collaborative design; product data modelling; concept modelling; distributed object model; semantic web		Information about products for the construction industry is increasingly often provided to designers in digital ways that enable them to apply the information directly in the design process. Digital product catalogues are provided using various media and formats and several initiatives are taken by the industry and by CAD developers to integrate this kind of information into CAD systems. Generally, current practice is to distribute the information to designers, for example, by using CD-ROMs or a website where the information can be downloaded. In our research, we recognise that distributing information in this manner detaches it from the business processes in the construction supply chain, which is a major disadvantage. The project presented in this paper concerns the implementation in the Dutch construction industry of a methodology for sharing product information through a distributed object model. The methodology, which is called Concept Modelling, forms a generic basis for the support of collaborative design, but is applied in this project to the integration of information from the supply chain in the design process. Through the distributed object model, design information and product information can be integrated while the actual data objects remain at their source. This enables the supply chain to provide information of a high semantic level to designers while keeping the control over the information and maintaining the relationship of the information with their business processes. The advantages of this approach in which information is shared, rather than exchanged, are numerous. Redundancy of information is minimised, consistency is improved, and updated information is available immediately. Moreover, design and construction processes can benefit significantly from the dynamic aspects of accessing information that is tied to business processes in the supply chain. For example, product selection during design can be based on latest information on product details, prices, production methods, and variants of products. This information can be provided to designers automatically and on demand. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Relationship between organizational sizes and contractors' risk pricing behaviors for weather risk under different project values and durations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; CULTURE	A problem that always annoys building employers and their consultants when drafting building contracts is whether it is more cost efficient to retain certain risks with themselves or to transfer the same to contractors, and it has long been a difficulty to accurately estimate the cost for transferring risks to the other contract party. It is a very common market practice to remove contractors' entitlement to extension of time due to inclement weather, and in view of the significant impacts that inclement weather posed on construction progress, it would be helpful to assess the associated costs for such risk allocation exercises in order to ensure that it is a cost-effective transaction. The costs for these potential weather-caused delays are priced by contractors in their returned tenders. This risk-pricing behavior is affected by the contractor's risk perception and risk attitude. However, merely working out contractors' risk perception and risk attitude patterns is inadequate, as they may vary in accordance with different organizational sizes and project backgrounds. Therefore, further studies should be carried out on the implications of project information, such as project value and contract period, on different-sized contractors' risk behaviors. In this research, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the weather-risk-pricing behavioral patterns of various-sized contractors under different given project scenarios. The survey revealed that the impacts of project value and contract period (and, thus, the intensity of work and scale of exposure to weather risk) were significant on contractors' risk behaviors, and these impacts varied in accordance with different organizational sizes. The medium-sized contractors' pricing behaviors were rather constant under different project values and contract periods, while both small and large contractors behaved differently when the intensity of work and scale of risk exposure varied. Despite the fact that contractors of various sizes behaved differently in some given scenarios, the number of days of delaying cost allowed by them in returned tenders were generally less than the actual number of days of inclement weather affecting work.

Taking the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) as a typical LCP case, this study explored in depth the diverse and regionalized impacts of the project as reflected in online public opinion by developing an evaluation framework integrating post intensity, sentiment, and topic analyses. Leveraging lexicon-based sentiment analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation-based topic modeling technologies, patterns of public sentiments and topics were identified from spatial and temporal perspectives. The results showed that post intensity and public sentiment were significantly affected by project-related major events. A comparison of the water-donating and -receiving areas suggested that people in the water-receiving area had a more attentive and active attitude toward the project, and those in the water-donating area were predisposed to be more vigilant to negative events. Moreover, the variation of public sentiment across regions was found to largely depend on local social context. With regard to topic analysis, people in the water-donating and -receiving areas were more likely to focus on topics directly associated with their own interests, while the feasibility of the SNWDP garnered attention from both areas. In addition, project functions and significance as well as topical issues related to engineering corruption, water pollution, and security aroused widespread attention in all the areas under study. This study contributes to the literature on ex-post evaluation and public participation in the context of LCPs by incorporating online public opinion into the evaluation framework. The findings provide valuable insights for developing policies and strategies to improve the management of projects and to achieve an inclusive development process for projects of this type.

Using action research in innovation project management: building legitimacy and organizational learning in an SME during a merger process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article; Early Access						Action research; Innovation; Legitimacy; Organizational learning	PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; FRONT-END; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; PERSPECTIVE; PATTERNS	Purpose The purpose is to explore how the process of action research (AR) can support building legitimacy and organizational learning in innovation project management and portfolio practices in merger contexts. Design/methodology/approach Meta-reflection on method issues in Action Research through an action research case study with an innovation group during an organizational change process. This case demonstrates an example of an action research cycle focused on building practitioner legitimacy rather than problem-solving. Findings Key findings include (1) demonstrating how AR can be used for building legitimacy through visualizing the innovation process, and embedding those visuals in top management practices of the organization; and (2) demonstrating how AR can work as an organizational learning tool in merger contexts. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on an action research cooperation during a two-and-a-half-year period. Thus, findings offer the depth of a medium term case study. The processes of building legitimacy represent this particular case, and can be investigated in other organizational contexts to see the extent to which these issues can be generalized. Practical implications For researchers, this paper offers an additional type of AR cycle to consider in their research design which can be seen as demonstrating a form of interplay between practitioner action and organizational level legitimacy. For practitioners, this paper demonstrates a connection between legitimacy and organizational learning in innovation contexts. The discussion of how visuals were co-created and used for building legitimacy for an innovation process that differs from the standard stage gate model demonstrates how engaging in AR research can contribute to developing visuals as resources for building legitimacy and organizational learning based on connections between theory and practice. Originality/value This case rethinks AR practice for innovation project management contexts to include legitimacy and organizational learning. This focus on legitimacy building from organizational learning and knowledge conversion contributes to our understanding of the soft side of innovation project management. Legitimacy is demonstrated to be a key concern for innovation project management practices.

J	Li, GH; Chen, C; Zhang, GM; Martek, I				Li, Guanghua; Chen, Chuan; Zhang, Guomin; Martek, Igor			Bid/no-bid decision factors for Chinese international contractors in international construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International construction; Project management; Strategic management; Questionnaire survey	ENTERPRISE RISK-MANAGEMENT; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; POLITICAL RISKS; SYSTEM; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; PROFIT	Purpose Factors affecting bid/no-bid decisions of international projects are more complex than those of domestic projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank decision factors considered by variously sized Chinese international contractors (CICs) and categorize those groups of factors important to experienced practitioners. Design/methodology/approach The analysis of factors identified by a literature review is conducted based on data derived from questionnaire results received from 119 CIC project and bidding managers. The relative importance of factors is measured by mean value and standard deviation. The discrepancy in rank and importance value perceived by variously sized CICs are explored by ranking disparity analysis, non-parametric test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. Finally, factor analysis is used to categorize the underlying groups of factors considered by CICs. Findings In sum, 41 factors are identified through the literature review as having an impact on the bid decision. Significant disparities in ranking and importance are found in several factors, which partially affect the consistency of the ranking of factors perceived between large and small-medium CICs. Ultimately, nine major factors are identified as impacting the bidding decision, with "contractor's capability" and "country risk of the host country," being the most important. Research limitations/implications The weight of a factor considered in a decision varies across contractors as a function of contractor size. Whether using models or subjective judgment in making decisions, it is beneficial to fully understand the main groups of factors influencing the decision. Vulnerability to country risk emerges as the first criterion accessed in the bid decision. Originality/value A comprehensive set of factors is established for CICs, including both general factors common to domestic projects, and international factors unique to international projects. All factors are grouped by inferential analysis from the perspective of contractors, which reveals the underlying mechanism of the bid decision-making process. While the data were collected from CICs, the methodology in exploring factors, along with implications, is determined to be applicable internationally.

J	Chisala, ML				Chisala, Maxwell L.			Quantitative Bid or No-Bid Decision-Support Model for Contractors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bidding behaviors; Bidding factors; Weight factors; Optimization; Importance scoring; Contracting	UP SIZE DECISIONS	The bidding behavior of contractors in the Malawi contract construction market was investigated using a selected set of 75 bidding factors in a structured questionnaire survey administered to a random representative sample of contractors where contractors were asked to indicate the importance they attach to given bidding factors when making a bid or no-bid decision. A proposed simple additive weighted scoring (SAWS) model was used to generate importance weights of bidding factors and subjective importance scoring of internal (firm-related) and external (project-related and environment-related) factors affecting the bid or no-bid decision for a given bidding situation. Conclusions of contractor bid or no-bid decision behavior from the questionnaire study were corroborated with a semistructured interview study involving senior industry players deemed more familiar with real-life bid or no bid decision problems. Medium-to-large-sized contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 50% of the importance scoring of external factors, whereas small contractors with high bid-win rates were found to have an importance scoring of internal factors not exceeding 45% of the importance scoring of external factors and hence offering quantitative criteria for when to pursue a bidding opportunity (bid) or not to pursue a bidding opportunity (no bid) on a new job in the studied contract construction market. The proposed bid or no-bid decision-support model was found to be 86% effective in predicting the actual decisions in 35 real-life bid or no-bid situations in a test study of the model in the Malawian contract construction market. The primary value of this study is the development of an effective and reliable tool for quantifying bid or no-bid decisions that is functional for any studied contract construction market with the potential to facilitate contractors' establishing in-house procedures and managerial decision support systems likely to improve the quality of decision-making in the construction industry.

J	Choi, B; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			An Empirically Based Agent-Based Model of the Sociocognitive Process of Construction Workers' Safety Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Safety behavior; Sociocognitive process; Agent-based modeling; Labor and personnel issues	PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; PERCEIVED EXTERNAL PRESTIGE; ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION; SOCIAL IDENTITY; AFFECTIVE COMMITMENT; SELF-CATEGORIZATION; RISK PERCEPTION; HONG-KONG; CLIMATE; INDUSTRY	Workers' unsafe behaviors have a substantial impact on construction safety. To regulate workers' unsafe behavior, construction practitioners have mainly used formal controls (e.g.,penalties). However, the formal approaches may not be effective at eliciting desired behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. Therefore, recently, researchers have paid more attention to how unsafe behaviors are produced. In this regard, cognitive models of safety behavior and empirical evidence on social influence have been suggested. However, there is a noticeable paucity of research investigating the mechanism behind the link between cognitive process, social influence, site risk, and safety behavior. In this paper, an empirically based agent-based model that incorporates theoretical and empirical findings of the sociocognitive process of workers' safety behaviors is developed. The model is used to conduct experiments examining how the sociocognitive process interacts with safety management interventions (i.e.,strictness and frequency of management feedback, and project identification) and influences workers' safety behaviors across different site risk conditions (i.e.,low-, modest-, and high-risk conditions). The results demonstrated that all three interventions contribute to decreasing the incident rate. Also, the interaction effects of the interventions in different site risk conditions were found using the parameter sweeping. The results indicated that (1)promoting workers' project identification would be an effective strategy in the modest-risk site condition; (2)other interventions should be combined after achieving the medium strictness of management feedback in the high-risk site condition; and (3)other interventions would not be effective without very strict management feedback in the low-risk site condition. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on construction safety by extending the authors' understanding of the role of sociocognitive process and its interaction with the environment in shaping workers' safety behaviors. Additionally, the experiment results are expected to lay a strong foundation for developing effective safety management interventions in the construction projects.

Design/methodology/approach Interview-based exploratory research strategy was used to survey senior managers and directors of medium- to large-sized road contracting firms in NZ. Empirical data were analyzed using the multi-attribute analytical technique. Findings Results revealed 70 productivity constraints faced by the RPMRCs in NZ; in diminishing order of influence, these constraints were aggregated into eight broad categories as follows: finance, workforce, technology/process, statutory/regulatory compliance, project characteristics, project management/project team characteristics, unforeseen circumstances and other/external factors. The most important constraints in each of the eight broad categories were presented. Research limitations/implications The key limitation of the research is that it was based on feedback from a limited number of participants which were less than the minimum required to represent the views of the potential participants in the sampling frame for the study. As a result, the findings may not be reliably generalized beyond the scope of the data used. Further research on the subject is recommended to ensure that the representation of the views of the individuals and companies that comprised the sampling frame is achieved. The current findings could be formulated as propositions or hypotheses to be tested in future confirmatory research. Practical implications At the industry level, the findings could provide the basis for the skill development programs of the NZ RPMRCs. The application of the research findings by the RPMRCs and consultants could result in significant improvement in the productivity of the NZ roading sector and the sector's enhanced contribution to the economy. Originality/value Currently, there is little research on the priority constraints to productivity and performance in the NZ roading sector. The findings contribute to knowledge by revealing critical factors constraining productivity performance of the NZ RMRCs and the associated improvement measures. New and more enriching viewpoints were provided on how contractors could leverage their limited resources to address the identified key constraints.

The purpose of this paper is to develop, test and validate ANN models for predicting the costs of electrical services components. Design/Methodology/Approach - The research is based on data mining of over 200 building projects in the office of a medium size electrical contractor. Of the over 200 projects examined, 71 usable data were found and used for the ANN modeling. Regression models were also explored using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics Software 21, for the purpose of comparison with the ANN models. Findings - The findings show that the cost forecasting models based on ANN algorithm are more viable alternative to regression models for predicting the costs of light wiring, power wiring and cable pathways. The ANN prediction errors achieved are 6.4, 4.5 and 4.5 per cent for the three models developed whereas the regression models were insignificant. They did not fit any of the known regression distributions. Practical implications - The validated ANN models were converted to a desktop application (user interface) package - "Intelligent Estimator." The application is important because it can be used by construction professionals to reliably and quickly forecast the costs of power wiring, light wiring and cable pathways using building variables that are readily available or measurable during design stage, i.e. fully enclosed covered area, unenclosed covered area, internal perimeter length and number of floors. Originality/value - Previous studies have concluded that the methods of estimating the budget for building structure and fabric work are inappropriate for use with mechanical and electrical services. Thus, this study is unique because it applied the ANN modeling technique, for the first time, to cost modeling of electrical services components for building using real world data. The analysis shows that ANN is a better alternative to regression models for predicting cost of services elements because the relationship between cost and the cost drivers are non-linear and distribution types are unknown.

J	Ling, FYY; Ning, Y; Chang, YH; Zhang, Z				Ling, Florence Yean Yng; Ning, Yan; Chang, Yi Hao; Zhang, Zhe			Human resource management practices to improve project managers' job satisfaction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human resource management; Talent development; Job satisfaction; Project managers; Job rewards; Career coaching	BEHAVIOR	Purpose More attention should be paid to project managers' (PMs) job satisfaction as they play an important role in ensuring projects are completed successfully. The purpose of this paper is to identify human resource management (HRM) policies and practices that lead to higher PMs' job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted on PMs who are working in construction firms and project management consultancy firms. Data were collected via random, convenience and snowball sampling. The data collected were analysed using partial least square-structural equation modelling, independent samples t-test and Pearson's correlation. Findings The findings show that PMs who are satisfied with their firms' HRM practices and job rewards also have higher job satisfaction. Several HRM strategies that give rise to higher job satisfaction are identified, e.g. a system to recognise and develop talent, and taking active steps to identify and develop backups in case of emergency. Unfortunately, some practices are not implemented to a significant extent, and these include: systematically recruiting and retaining talented PMs, encouraging PMs to plan for their careers, offering performance and development coaching, and appraising employees. Research limitations/implications The limitations include the low response rate and the relatively small sample size of 81. The profile of respondents is largely from construction companies with more than 150 staff, and, therefore, the findings are more applicable to medium- to large-sized construction firms. Practical implications The study identified many HRM practices and policies that are significantly associated with PMs' job satisfaction, yet many of these are not implemented to a significant extent by the employers. The practical implication is that employers of PMs should systematically implement these in order that their PMs have higher job satisfaction which is important for a project's success. Originality/value The originality of this research is that the HRM practices and policies that are associated with job satisfaction of PMs are uncovered. Its value is in showing that PMs derive greater job satisfaction when HRM policies encompass talent development, career coaching and a personalised management style. Among these important practices, those that have been neglected were also identified. The study offers recommendations on the HRM practices that firms should be put in place for their PMs to experience higher job satisfaction.

J	Baalousha, Y; Celik, T				Baalousha, Yousef; Celik, Tahir			INTEGRATED WEB-BASED DATA WAREHOUSE AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS SYSTEM FOR UNIT PRICE ANALYSIS WITH INFLATION ADJUSTMENT	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						web data warehouse; unit price analysis; artificial neural networks; inflation; MATLAB	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; MODEL	Estimating is a fundamental part of construction projects. Accurate cost estimate is the single most important element involved in the series of events that leads to a profitable completion of a contract in construction industry. The success or failure of a project depends on the accuracy of cost estimation. A cost estimate becomes more difficult and more complicated under inflationary medium. An unpredictable inflation rate and long progress payment delay during this period makes the budgeting function very difficult, if not impossible. The cost estimation process uses lots of data. The availability of the appropriate data at the appropriate time is one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the cost estimation. As the complexity of the estimating task increases computerized system becomes increasingly important. The estimator should develop a good system of estimating forms and procedures that exactly meet the requirements of the project, and that is understood and accessible by all team members. This system should provide the ability to define material, labor hour and equipment hour quantities required for the project. Material, labor, and equipment unit costs are then applied to the bill of quantities. This paper presents An Integrated Web-Based Data Warehouse and Artificial Neural Networks Model for Unit Price Analysis with Inflation Adjustment system called "DANUP". Web facilities and database management capabilities of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 are applied to create a data warehouse which is mainly aimed to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous databases and other information sources. The System also supports integrated cost index for adjusting the effect of inflation during estimating process. An artificial neural network model for forecasting the cost indices in Turkey for the project period has been developed. A construction project takes relatively long time to complete, effective communication among the project participants during the project period is important. A web based system is developed to facilitate the collection of construction cost information and communication. The web based system focuses on demonstrating the potential of data centric web data bases in enhancing the communication process during project execution. End users can access the database through the interne and perform certain transactions according to their authorization.

J	Hussain, RR; Ishida, T				Hussain, Raja Rizwan; Ishida, Tetsuya			Computer-aided oxygen transport model of mass and energy simulation for corrosion of reinforced steel	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Oxygen; Corrosion; Automation; Modeling; Reinforced concrete construction	PITTING CORROSION; CONCRETE; MACROCELL; CEMENT	The paper includes automated modeling and experimental verification of corrosion in reinforced concrete construction under the effect of varying oxygen concentration. Various construction corrosion cells with different concrete compositions under four different environmental conditions (air dry, submerged, 95% R.H and alternate wetting-drying) have been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Using the results (half-cell potential and gravimetric corrosion mass loss) of these laboratory tests and an automated computer-aided simulation model based on mass and energy transfer through the porous construction media for the corrosion process, it was possible to predict, maintain and manage the influence of oxygen concentration on the corrosion rate of the reinforcement in concrete construction under various defined conditions satisfactorily. The variation in oxygen concentration available for corrosion reaction has been taken into account simulating the actual construction field conditions such as by varying concrete cover depth, relative humidity, water-cement ratio, etc. The modeling task has been incorporated by the use of an automated computer based construction durability model 'DuCOM' developed by our construction research group at The University of Tokyo as a finite element computational approach for the effect of oxygen on corrosion in relation to W/C, concrete cover, chloride concentration and various environmental humidity construction conditions. This paper is of interest to a broad readership for those interested in automation in reinforced concrete construction involving durability design & engineering related to corrosion of steel in concrete, corrosion resistant construction technology, corrosion maintenance & management. The scope of this paper encompasses various stages of the corrosion in construction life cycle from initial planning and design, through construction of steel reinforced concrete facility, its operation and maintenance, to the estimation of demolishing due to limiting oxygen controlled corrosion damage. This paper contains novel investigations involving computer-aided durability design, corrosion modeling under varying oxygen, classification and standardization of corrosion product data. The paper incorporates mass and energy process simulation models and graphics for the effect of oxygen on corrosion and its automated inspection as well as management. This comprehensive automated modeling and experimental investigation involving variety of materials and environmental variables will help in profound understanding, maintenance and management of oxygen controlled corrosion reaction in RC construction and will provide significant future research prospects in the field of oxygen limiting automated corrosion modeling of RC construction.

J	Nik-Bakht, M; El-Diraby, TE				Nik-Bakht, M.; El-Diraby, T. E.			Beyond Chatter: Profiling Community Discussion Networks in Urban Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Community engagement; Cocreation; Social network analysis; Social media; Infrastructure projects	SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; MODEL	The relevance of social networks in engaging communities in planning and project decision making has been established. This case study work analyzes the social and semantic networks for the Twitter accounts of four large light rail transit (LRT) projects in North America. These networks portray typical features of social networks: consistent small-world behavior, formation of stable subcommunities, and dynamic variation in topic and issues discussed with changes to the project conditions. The proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects-mainly because the cases were analyzed with an additional focus on the dynamics of social networks of participants. In early stages of the projects, these networks have a limited group of participants. As time passes and more interest is cumulated in the project, the number of nodes increases but the number of connections (between the nodes) does not increase at a similar speed. This reduces the overall density of the network and, at the same time, creates "hub" nodes. These are influential participants with an impact on the information diffusion and formation of opinions. The subcommunities that form evolve in membership, density, and topics of interest, in accordance with the project progress. Citizens migrate between subcommunities, mainly based on the central topics of discussion and, partially, the addition or migration of influential nodes. The use of the proposed methodology can be helpful to future projects because it showcases a sociosemantic approach for the analysis of stakeholders. This can help decision makers to not only understand what is on the mind of communities, but also track how such thoughts (issues) evolve over time and what the role of key players is in forming or changing the issues. A careful analysis over the project life span can help the decision makers to predict some of these trends and, accordingly, shape the project communication strategy in a more proactive fashion to meet the possible community needs. In the era of unstructured big data, this methodology can help practitioners to study the impact of decisions made or scope deviations in a project on the themes and levels of interest of local communities. Both of these two features will help to transfer public communication in construction mega-projects from a one-way outreach to a two-way interaction: try to understand/predict community issues, gather community interests and concerns, and study how community structure and views change based on the changes made to the project scope.

J	Potier, S; Maltret, JL; Zoller, J				Potier, S; Maltret, JL; Zoller, J			Computer graphics: assistance for archaelogical hypotheses	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-for-Computer-Aided-Design-in-Architecture	OCT, 1998	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Assoc Comp Aided Design Architecture				This paper is a contribution to the domain of computer tools for architectural and archeological restitution of ancient buildings. We describe an application of these tools to the modeling of the 14th century AD. Thermae of Constantin in Aries, south of France. It was a diploma project in School of Architecture of Marseille-Luminy, and took place in a context defined in the European ARELATE project. The general objective of this project is to emphasize the archeological and architectural heritage of the city of Aries; it aims, in particular, to equip the museum of ancient Aries with a computer tool enabling the storage and consultation of archaeological archives, the communication of information and exchange by specialized networks, and the creation of a virtual museum allowing a redescription of the monuments and a "virtual" visit of ancient Aries. Our approach involves a multidisciplinary approach, calling on architecture, archeology and computer science. The archeologist's work is to collect information and interpret it; this is the starting point of the architect's work who, using these elements, suggests an architectural reconstruction. This synthesis contains the functioning analysis of the structure and building. The potential provided by the computer as a tool (in this case, the POV-Ray software) with access to several three-dimensional visualizations, according to hypotheses formulated by the architect and archaeologists, necessitates the use of evolutive models which, thanks to the parametrization of dimensions of a building and its elements, can be adapted to all the changes desired by the architect. The specific contribution of POV-Ray in architectural reconstruction of thermae finds its expression in four forms of this modeling program, which correspond to the objectives set by the architect in agreement with archeologists: (a) The parametrization of dimensions, which contributes significantly in simplifying the reintervention process of the architectural data base; (b) Hierarchy and links between variables, allowing "grouped" modifications of modelized elements in order to preserve the consistency of the architectural building's morphology; (c) The levels of modeling (with or without facing, for example), which admit of the exploration of all structural and architectural trails (relationship form/function); and, (d) The "model-type", facilitating the setting up of hypotheses by simple scaling and transformation of these models (e.g., roofing models) on an already modelled structure. The methodological validation of this modeling software's particular use in architectural formulation of hypotheses shows that the software is the principal graphical medium of discussion between architect and archaeologist, thus confirming the hypotheses formulated at the beginning of this project.

Reza; Chen, Chuan			Political risk management of foreign direct investment in infrastructure projects Bibliometric-qualitative analyses of research in developing countries	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International construction; Risk management; Construction; Strategic management	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; WATER-SUPPLY PROJECTS; PPP PROJECTS; SECTOR INVESTMENT; CHINA; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; PARTICIPATION; PERFORMANCE	Purpose Foreign direct investment in the infrastructure (FDII) of developing countries has a history of at least four decades. Bullish demand for foreign infrastructure services in developing countries, in combination with unstable political environments, has buoyed attention in political risk management (PRM). Even so, research into PRM of FDII remains fragmented and unmapped. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify the current body of knowledge in this area, uncover deficiencies and lay the foundation for further practical PRM research in FDII. Design/methodology/approach This paper offers a bibliometric-qualitative review of current literature on political risk in foreign infrastructure in developing countries. A 36-year period is identified, from 1983 to 2018. Publication year, area of focus, author(s), institution and country are classified and analyzed through the medium of social network analysis. The tools used are VOSviewer, CiteSpace and Gephi to analyze citation networks of 345 published papers. Out of 345 papers, 94 highly related studies were selected for further content analysis. Findings The study identified the research trends in related areas of PRM in infrastructure (e.g. PRM in international construction and foreign direct investment) by bibliometric analysis, which includes scattered researcher collaboration, wide-ranging and unfocused journal selection, unsystematic and discontinuous research themes. The specific research weakness in PRM in FDII is recognized by qualitative analysis from the perspective of PRM process, which reveals a lack of understanding of the impact of political risk factors, subjective risk estimations, lacking application of mature political risk database in FDII, combined with a shortage of complete and effective strategies for PRM in FDII in developing countries. Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind, providing a comprehensive benchmark survey of the research to date in PRM in foreign infrastructure investment in developing countries. It proposes a framework of future research agenda on PRM in FDII, including special issues on this topic, identification and assessment of political risk factors with objective methods, proposition of PRM strategies on FDII with proactive and active approaches, completing strategies of PRM with reactive strategies from the perspectives of whole life cycle of infrastructure projects, political risk factors and stakeholders. It also addressed the need to investigate the suitable literature databases for researching in this area.

J	Langroodi, AK; Vahdatikhaki, F; Doree, A				Langroodi, Armin Kassemi; Vahdatikhaki, Faridaddin; Doree, Andre			Activity recognition of construction equipment using fractional random forest	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Activity recognition; Machine learning; Construction simulation; Fractional feature augmentation; Random forest	WORKERS-ON-FOOT; POSE ESTIMATION; EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS; MISS INTERACTIONS; DATA-COLLECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; STRUCK-BY; SAFETY; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE	The monitoring and tracking of construction equipment, e.g., excavators, is of great interest to improve the productivity, safety, and sustainability of construction projects. In recent years, digital technologies are leveraged to develop monitoring systems for construction equipment. These systems are commonly used to detect and/or track different pieces of equipment. However, the recent research work has indicated that the performance of the equipment monitoring system improves when they are able to also recognize/track the activities of the equipment (e.g., digging, compacting, etc.). Nevertheless, the current direction of research on equipment activity recognition is gravitating towards the use of deep learning methods. While very promising, the performance of deep learning methods is predicated on the comprehensiveness of the dataset used for training the model. Given the wide variations of construction equipment, in size and shape, the development of a comprehensive dataset can be challenging. This research hypothesizes that through the use of a robust feature augmentation method, shallow models, such as Random Forest, can yield a comparable performance without requiring a large and comprehensive dataset. Therefore, this research proposes a novel machine learning method based on the integration of Random Forest classifier with the fractional calculus-based feature augmentation technique to develop an accurate activity recognition model using a limited dataset. This method is implemented and applied to three case studies. In the first case study, the operations of two different models of excavators (one small-size and one medium-size) were tracked. By using the data from one excavator for the training and the data from the other one for testing, the impact of equipment size and operators' skill level on the performance of the proposed method is investigated. In the second case study, the data from an actual excavator was used to predict the activity of a scaled remotely controlled excavator. In the last case study, the proposed method was applied for rollers (as an example of non-articulating equipment). It is shown that the fractional feature augmentation method can have a positive impact on the performance of all machine learning methods studied in this research (i.e., Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). It is also shown that the proposed Fractional Random Forest method is able to provide comparable results to deep learning methods using considerably smaller training dataset.

J	Laryea, S; Watermeyer, R				Laryea, Samuel; Watermeyer, Ron			Structuring architectural competitions as a competitive procurement process	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Architectural competition; Case study; Public procurement; South Africa	DESIGN COMPETITION	Purpose Architectural competitions have been in existence for over 2,500 years. Past studies on this have focussed on the architectural aspects, competition formats, design evaluation by jury members and its evolution. However, no comprehensive research has examined the way that architectural competitions can be structured as a competitive procurement process for contractual outcomes. This paper addresses that gap by examining the way in which a two-stage proposal procedure (as defined by ISO 10845) was used to convert the architectural ideas competition for two new universities in South Africa (SPU and UMP) into a public procurement process with contractual outcomes. Design/methodology/approach A case study was designed to examine (1) the procurement and contractual aspects of the two-stage proposal procedure within a public procurement context; (2) the challenges encountered in implementing the procurement procedure adopted; and (3) the outcomes of the procurement process. In total, 16 documents relating to the architectural competition were examined, using document analysis, to obtain insights into the procurement approach and processes. This was followed by in-depth interviews with the competition administrators to identify the key challenges encountered in implementing the procurement procedure. A content analysis method was used to analyse the qualitative data. Findings Only 40% of architects who expressed interest made submissions in the first stage. Those admitted to the second stage associated themselves with architectural practices and submitted tender offers which were evaluated on the basis of their financial offer, preference and quality. Most participants experienced difficulty with the procurement procedure due to unfamiliarity with the process and tight timescales. However, necessary clarifications provided by the client's team enabled them to respond appropriately and the procurement procedure proved effective for procuring innovative design ideas from nine talented architects. They were all based in small to medium-sized firms rather than large firms. Originality/value This paper fills an important gap in current understanding of how architectural competitions may be alternatively structured into a competitive procurement process, using empirical evidence from two architectural competitions. Architectural competitions have traditionally been used and characterized in the research literature primarily as an ideas competition rather than a competitive procurement process. This paper, therefore, extends current knowledge on the traditional way architectural competitions are generally used in practice and demonstrates through examination of two case studies how architectural competitions may be further extended and utilized as a competitive procurement process rather than just a process for obtaining ideas.

J	Makabate, CT; Musonda, I; Okoro, CS; Chileshe, N				Makabate, Choeu Tshepisho; Musonda, Innocent; Okoro, Chioma Sylvia; Chileshe, Nicholas			Scientometric analysis of BIM adoption by SMEs in the architecture, construction and engineering sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Building information modelling (BIM); Construction industry; SMEs; Science mapping; Bibliometric analysis; Network analysis; Qualitative analysis		Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) has had a significant impact on the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector in the past several years. However, not much is published concerning small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopting BIM in the construction industry. To address this knowledge gap, a complete and in-depth literature review of the adoption of BIM by SMEs in the AEC sector is conducted in this study. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of the mainstream studies of adoption of BIM in the AEC organisations. Design/methodology/approach Based on a five-stage literature review, 54 articles on the adoption of BIM by SMEs from the period 2009 to 2019 were critically analysed from the following three perspectives: (1) the number of articles produced; (2) the research focus and (3) the author's contributions. The techniques of the visualisation of similarities (VOSviewer) software were used to analyse the citation networks of the 54 articles as identified. Findings From the analysis, it was established that the number of studies on BIM adoption by SMEs in the reviewed journals has not been increasing and not many articles are available. The finding makes the argument that BIM adoption by SMEs is not a focus point but rather the adoption and implementation of BIM is generalised in the AEC sector. In addition, the results revealed that most of the published articles come from the United Kingdom (UK). However, this finding is hardly surprising due to the requirements in the UK, which have made the adoption of BIM mandatory on all publicly funded projects and are at level 2 BIM. The other highly ranked countries by origins of studies on the adoption of BIM by SMEs were found to be Australia and the United States of America (USA), all of which are developed nations or economies. Some key BIM in SME research trends (adoption, enforcement, benefits, strategies, skills gap, awareness, education and training, and technology) were identified and evaluated. Research limitations/implications The results presented in this journal are only applicable to SMEs in the AEC sector. As a result of little available literature on the adoption of BIM in developing countries, the articles have been drawn from developed countries. The dataset was mainly extracted from the Scopus database for the analysis. Originality/value An accomplished series content analysis of the implementation and adoption of BIM by SMEs from international construction journals were reported. The study makes significant and emergent contribution by building on the foundation of BIM research in SMEs as well as providing a reference point for the interpretation of findings, as well as directions for future research.

J	Rahimi-Golkhandan, A; Garvin, MJ; Wang, Q				Rahimi-Golkhandan, Armin; Garvin, Michael J.; Wang, Qi			Assessing the Impact of Transportation Diversity on Postdisaster Intraurban Mobility	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Infrastructure; Natural hazard; Hurricane Sandy; Multimode; Twitter; Geosocial networking; Urban computing; Transportation; Diversity; Resilience; Mobility	VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; PHONE USAGE; URBAN FORM; ROAD; PREDICTABILITY; RESILIENCE; TWITTER; SPACE; INTEGRATION	Transportation infrastructure enables mobility in urban communities and impacts the functionality of other infrastructure and services. Natural hazards can cause failures in a transportation system, which can affect mobility and other economic activities in a community. Diversity is recognized as an important factor of resilience in transportation infrastructure, but empirical work linking the two is limited. In this study, the impact of transportation diversity on mobility in New York City after Hurricane Sandy is explored. Transportation diversity, defined as the availability and distribution of modes in a community, is measured by employing a recently developed approach at the zip code level using transportation system GIS data. The geotagged Twitter data of one month before and after Hurricane Sandy in New York City are used to understand mobility patterns before and after this extreme event. The primary locations of individuals are found, and their mobility patterns are subsequently determined by measuring travel distance, the radius of gyration, and mobility entropy one week and one month before and after the hurricane. Individuals are grouped in quartiles based on the transportation diversity of their primary locations, which is determined by two different methods that overcome the lack of transportation system information in call detail records and social media data. The results indicate that the distance, radius, and entropy of all individuals significantly decreased after Sandy. The comparison of the significance of change in mobility metrics by diversity quartiles revealed that one-week distance and radius metrics in low transportation diversity quartiles were changed and statistically significant. Thus, individuals with primary locations in zip codes with higher transportation diversity generally had a higher maintained distance and radius one week after the hurricane. The comparison of diversity quartiles in the one-month analysis showed that the radius of low transportation diversity quartiles was impacted more than high transportation diversity quartiles and was statistically significant. Further, the comparison of results of one week and one month after the hurricane indicated that distance, radius of gyration, and entropy improved after a month as the transportation system was recovering. The findings establish an empirical link between transportation diversity and intraurban mobility in the wake of natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and confirm that transportation diversity influences individual postdisaster mobility. In addition, the results contribute to the mobility resilience literature by deepening our understanding of the underlying drivers of changes in human mobility following extreme events. Further, the adopted approach supports pinpointing areas with low transportation diversity, which can enable more targeted infrastructure and urban resilience management.

J	Chalker, M; Loosemore, M				Chalker, Mathew; Loosemore, Martin			Trust and productivity in Australian construction projects: a subcontractor perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Trust; Collaboration; Supply chain management; Communications; Productivity capacity	SUCCESS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between trust and productivity from a subcontractor perspective. More specifically it investigates: the perceived level of trust that currently exists between subcontractors and main contractors; the factors affecting trust at the project level; the relationship between trust and productivity. Design/methodology/approach - An on-line survey was undertaken with of 112 senior construction managers working for tier-1 and tier-2 subcontractors in the Australian construction industry. The survey was based on a combination of validated questions from Lau and Rowlinson's (2009) interpersonal trust and inter-firm trust in construction projects framework and Cheung et al.'s (2011) framework for a trust inventory in construction contracting. Findings - In contrast to the large number of research projects which have highlighted a lack of trust in the construction industry, the findings show that level of trust that Australian subcontractors have in main contractors is generally high. However, bid shopping is a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry which acts to undermine trust. The findings also provide strong evidence that high levels of trust influence productivity on site by enabling greater collaboration, better communication and greater flexibility, agility and informality in project relationships. Research limitations/implications - This research was undertaken in the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and within an economic boom. It is quite possible that outside this regional context which tends to dominated by larger construction firms and in an alternative economic context that the results of this research could be quite different. This possibility needs to be investigated further. Practical implications - The results indicate that this relatively healthy level of trust is down to good communication and empathy on the part of main contractors to the subcontractor's welfare. While the results showed that bid shopping is clearly a continuing problem in the Australian construction industry, subcontractors also felt that their contracts were clearly defined and that they were given sufficient time to innovate on their projects. This suggest that new communications technologies can be used to build trust through the supply chain. Given that much of the construction supply chain is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses, the challenge of diffusing these new technologies into this business environment should be a priority. Social implications - Trust in basis of effective collaboration which has been shown to produce numerous social benefits such as greater equity and justice in business relationships and higher levels of productivity and safety. Originality/value - The originality of this research is in using theories of trust to give subcontractors a greater "voice" in the construction productivity debate.

J	Bowen, P; Govender, R; Edwards, P; Cattell, K; Street, A				Bowen, Paul; Govender, Rajen; Edwards, Peter; Cattell, Keith; Street, Abigail			Factors Determining South African Construction Workers' Prejudice towards and Discrimination against HIV plus Persons	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS); Construction workers; Stigma; Prejudice; Discrimination; Fear of testing; Predictive modeling; Labor and personnel issues	AIDS-RELATED STIGMA; RISK SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; CAPE-TOWN; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; HIV/AIDS; KNOWLEDGE; MEN; PREVALENCE; DEPRESSION; INFECTION	Stigma and fear of discrimination are powerful deterrents against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing. Prejudice and discrimination against people living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are deterrents to their willingness to disclose their status and thereby avail themselves of treatment. Stigma impairs employees' general well-being, affecting their work capacity, and thus directly impacting upon project management success. Little is known about construction workers' prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons, and the determinants thereof. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Following bivariate and regression analyses of the survey response data, a structural equations model comprising demographic factors, lifestyle risk, substance use (alcohol consumption and drug use), knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and attitudinal fear of testing is posited to explain prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. The results indicate the following: (1) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudinal fear of testing, and prejudice towards HIV+ persons are determinants of discrimination against HIV+ persons; (2) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and attitudinal fear of testing are determinants of prejudice towards HIV+ persons; (3) AIDS knowledge is predicted by level of education and ethnicity; and (4) attitudinal fear of testing is predicted by level of education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and extent of risky lifestyle. The research confirms current knowledge about the multivariate determination of prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. It advances this understanding by identifying and emphasizing the central role played by education and subject-specific information in such determination. Specifically, it offers a clearer picture of the direct influence of educational background and AIDS knowledge in determining both the cognitive dimension of prejudice and the behavioral manifestation of this through discrimination. This has clear implications for construction firms in their efforts at HIV/AIDS intervention management. As much of this AIDS knowledge is determined by cultural beliefs and values, there exists the need to design programs that directly and sensitively address these cultural beliefs and their likely impact on prejudice and discrimination. Likewise, prior education is also critical, both in terms of amplifying or mitigating the impact of cultural beliefs and in terms of the potential comprehension by workers of such structured media and awareness campaigns. Failure to account for these two factors and their influence on cognition and behavior would result in interventions of diminished impact and success. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Reza			Patterns and trends in Internet of Things (IoT) research: future applications in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry 4; 0; Internet of Things; Sensors; Digitalisation; Construction; 5G; Scientometric analysis; Strategic roadmap	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; BLOCKCHAIN	Purpose The Internet of Things (IoT) provides exciting opportunities for the construction industry to solve its time and resource constraints and frequent defaults. This study seeks to identify and rank the perceived importance level of principal research areas associated with the IoT and the construction industry by utilising a scientific mapping tool (i.e. VOSviewer). Such knowledge would enable key drivers for successful adoption of the IoT and digitisation technologies to be outlined. An analysis of key drivers and research trends that facilitates the development of a roadmap for applying the IoT and digital technologies in the construction sector is therefore much needed. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to analyse published work as secondary data, where each publication represented a unit of analysis. A total of 417 peer-reviewed journal review articles covering the IoT within the construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods approach, utilising qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques. Findings The results revealed a field of study in a fledgling stage, with a limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation and offering single-point solutions instead of taking an integrated "holistic" approach. Key publication outlets were identified and the main focus of research undertaken being in the technical areas of smart buildings, smart construction objects and environmental sustainability. The major effects of adopting the IoT within the construction industry were identified as high-speed reporting, complete process control, data explosion leading to deep data analytics, strict ethical and legal expectations. Key drivers of the IoT adoption were outlined: interoperability; data privacy and security; flexible governance structures; proper business planning and models. Practical implications The study benefits researchers and industry practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas of high priority in future research. For construction companies, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of the IoT in the industry. For government agencies and policymakers, this study offers a point of reference in directing the adoption of the IoT smoothly in the construction sector and provides guidelines and standards for maximising the potential benefits. Originality/value The study is the first scientometric review of the existing body of knowledge in the context of application of the IoT in the construction industry. Findings expose knowledge gaps in contemporary research, specifically, a broader consideration of organisational adjustments needed to accommodate the IoT usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.

Impact of Construction Workers' Hazard Identification Skills on Their Visual Attention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard identification skill; Eye-tracking technology; Human error; Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA); Labor and personnel issues	HUMAN ERROR-PROBABILITY; EYE TRACKING; PERCEPTION; DRIVERS; SAFETY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; AWARENESS; YOUNGER	Eye-movement metrics have been shown to correlate with attention and, therefore, represent a means of identifying and analyzing an individual's cognitive processes. Human errors-such as failure to identify a hazard-are often attributed to a worker's lack of attention. Piecemeal attempts have been made to investigate the potential of harnessing eye movements as predictors of human error (e. g., failure to identify a hazard) in the construction industry, although more attempts have investigated human error via subjective measurements. To address this knowledge gap, the present study harnessed eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impacts of workers' hazard-identification skills on their attentional distributions and visual search strategies. To achieve this objective, an experiment was designed in which the eye movements of 31 construction workers were tracked while they searched for hazards in 35 randomly ordered construction scenario images. Workers were then divided into three groups on the basis of their hazard identification performance. Three fixation-related metrics-fixation count, dwell-time percentage, and run count-were analyzed during the eye-tracking experiment for each group (low, medium, and high hazard-identification skills) across various types of hazards. Then, multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of workers' hazard-identification skills on their visual attention. To further investigate the effect of hazard identification skills on the dependent variables (eye movement metrics), two distinct processes followed: separate ANOVAs on each of the dependent variables, and a discriminant function analysis. The analyses indicated that hazard identification skills significantly impact workers' visual search strategies: workers with higher hazard-identification skills had lower dwell-time percentages on ladder-related hazards; higher fixation counts on fall-to-lower-level hazards; and higher fixation counts and run counts on fall-protection systems, struck-by, housekeeping, and all hazardous areas combined. Among the eye-movement metrics studied, fixation count had the largest standardized coefficient in all canonical discriminant functions, which implies that this eye-movement metric uniquely discriminates workers with high hazard-identification skills and at-risk workers. Because discriminant function analysis is similar to regression, discriminant function (linear combinations of eye-movement metrics) can be used to predict workers' hazard-identification capabilities. In conclusion, this study provides a proof of concept that certain eyemovement metrics are predictive indicators of human error due to attentional failure. These outcomes stemmed from a laboratory setting, and, foreseeably, safety managers in the future will be able to use these findings to identify at-risk construction workers, pinpoint required safety training, measure training effectiveness, and eventually improve future personal protective equipment to measure construction workers' situation awareness in real time.

J	Wikberg, E; Bomark, N				Wikberg, Erik; Bomark, Niklas			Managing competing logics through situational irony	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Competing institutional logics; Cultural projects; Organizational irony; Situational irony	ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES; FORMAL-STRUCTURE; CONSTRUCTION; INSTITUTIONS; DYNAMICS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the literature on how actors manage competing logics in an organizational field. The authors do so by introducing the concept of organizational irony to the literature on how to manage competing logics, and analyze a collaborative cultural project encompassing actors subjected to competing institutional logics. Design/methodology/approach - The case study is built on qualitative data from in-depth interviews, newspaper articles and observations. Findings - The authors describe and analyze a cultural project encompassing actors subjected to competing institutional logics and show how they responded to institutional pressures in their environment with the use of organizational irony. Thereby, the actors could collaborate with actors subjected to a competing institutional logic and still maintain adherence to their respective institutional logic. Research limitations/implications - Most studies of how to manage competing logics asserts that one logic will prevail over a competing one, either through "battles" or gradual dominance (Reay and Hinings, 2009). This study supports and adds to Reay and Hinings' (2009) finding that actors also can collaborate and maintain adherence to their respective logic under such circumstances. In particular, it supports two identified mechanisms of how this can be achieved, namely, to separate decisions and to jointly innovate in experimental sites. It also adds to these mechanisms by showing that this can be done through the use of organizational irony. The authors only study one cultural project in one organizational field. It remains unclear if these findings are common in other cultural projects or in other organizational field, and the authors therefore encourage other researchers to extend or challenge the findings of this study. Practical implications - The authors believe that the analysis and findings can be useful for politicians to take into account and address either to minimize the risk of organizational irony or on the contrary encourage it as a source of reflexive critique of society and cultural politics. The authors also believe that the response of organizational irony to institutional pressures broadens the acting space of cultural actors, provide media and critics with an analytical tool to analyze and deconstruct practices that otherwise would risk to be silenced or neglected. Finally, the authors believe that an analysis of organizational irony has the potential to make people attend to contradictions and multiple meanings in the artworks under study in a novel way. Originality/value - The paper provides an intriguing and complex empirical case to demonstrate how actors manage competing logics in an organizational field through the production of organizational irony. The authors believe that its theoretical contributions and practical implications can inspire future research on how paradoxes can be managed through the use of organizational irony in other projects and organizational fields.
