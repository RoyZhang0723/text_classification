J	Strobele, B; Lutzkendorf, T				Stroebele, Benjamin; Luetzkendorf, Thomas			Communicating environmental information: rethinking options for construction products	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						buildings; construction products; environmental assessment; environmental impacts; environmental indicators; environmental information; life cycle assessment	ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT; ENERGY DEMAND; BUILDINGS; PERFORMANCE; BIM	A need exists for robust environmental and health-related information to support decisions about construction products and the design of new construction and refurbishment projects. This need arises in order to protect resources and the natural environment. The relevant information can be provided from, for example, a life cycle assessment in the form of impact indicators. However, the large, complex data can overburden individual actors in construction and property (real estate). Hence, the question arises as to whether and how the complexity of communicating environmental information for construction products can be simplified. This paper explores various approaches to grouping the different impact indicators and to determining proxy indicators and impact indices as single scores within these indicator groups. No appropriate single proxy indicator is appropriate for all impact indicators. However, a cluster of indicators can be formed and proxy indicators or impact indices can be determined within these groups. An application of the approaches to the impact indicators according to the currently discussed product environmental footprint approach is presented. With a series of single scores, an existing multi-criteria decision problem can be reduced and a basis for business-to-consumer communication can be formed.

J	Wallhagen, M; Malmqvist, T; Eriksson, O				Wallhagen, Marita; Malmqvist, Tove; Eriksson, Ola			Professionals' knowledge and use of environmental assessment in an architectural competition	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						architects; architectural competition; assessment tool; environmental assessment; knowledge; neighbourhood; sustainable design; urban design	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; OF-THE-ART; SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION; ASSESSMENT TOOLS; BUILDING DESIGN; GREEN; DRIVERS; TRENDS; BREEAM; HOMES	In early design phases, architects, landscape architects and urban planners are key actors whose decisions determine the environmental impact of planning and building projects. Environmental and sustainability assessment tools for buildings and neighbourhoods have been developed to promote sustainable building, but their usage has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study investigated self-reported knowledge and usage of such tools among competitors and jury group from 10 European countries involved in the international architectural competition A New City Centre for Kiruna' in Sweden. The questionnaire revealed that 13% used environmental assessment tools or management systems in the competition, although 47% had used them previously. Tool users reported greater knowledge of how to handle environmental impacts than non-users. However, the self-rated experience of handling various environmental impacts, in the competition and in general, was low for both groups. Nevertheless, the self-rated importance of environmental impacts was high among all participants. Based on this study, it is concluded that environmental assessment tools, issues and goals can be better integrated into the processes of early design in planning and building projects, and in architectural competitions. Furthermore, to limit environmental impacts in building and planning projects, professionals need to be educated about environmental strategies and solutions.

In addition, indicators facilitate the consideration and management of an array of environmental issues in the relevant decision-making situations. The broad acceptance of indicators across different groups of decision-makers in different phases of a building's life cycle is especially important when indicators are not mandatory, but are to be used in voluntary bottom-up initiatives. The objective of the present study was to investigate if (and to what extent) a consensus on environmental indicators for buildings as 'a common language for green building' can be reached among core actors in the Danish building sector and what such indicators could look like. Based on an analysis of current indicator systems and a qualitative investigation of the views of different actor groups on environmental indicators for buildings, the areas of consensus and lines of conflict between the actor groups were identified. Four different technological frames were used to identify four different perceptions of environmental indicators. Applying the theory of the social construction of technology (SCOT) in a prospective way, the findings show that a closure of the indicator-debate on the basis of an all-actors consensus within the near future is unlikely. Instead, three likely scenarios are described for the future development of the indicator debate and the directions for different actors are identified to create a common language for the use of green building indicators.

Environmental assessment in construction using a Spatial Decision Support System	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Environmental assessment; Building; Spatial system	GREEN BUILDING CHALLENGE; LAND-USE; GIS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	This research proposes a Spatial Decision Support System based on the Geographical Information System (GIS) to evaluate the environmental performance in construction. The system has been designed to add a spatial component to the current tools for the inspection and management of the sustainability of buildings and to assist the planners in their decision-making. The multi-criteria evaluation method developed in the Green Building Challenge and implemented in the software SbTool has been used as a reference. The evaluation method presents a hierarchical structure of criteria and variables which is applied to buildings spatially indexed in GIS and the environmental data of the buildings comes from an external data-base developed in Access. In order to validate the system, the environmental assessment of a group of residential, industrial and public service buildings during the phases of operation was simulated. The application of this tool in the inspection and environmental assessment of buildings allows the geographical scale of analysis to be extended to a group of buildings within the area of interest and consequently to extend the limits of its usefulness within the field of planning and environmental assessment.

Although many researchers have investigated construction labour productivity (CLP), the lack of adequate studies in this field is evident in developing countries. This paper intends to measure the CLP of the concrete pouring operations related to the construction of commercial-office complex projects in Iran. For this purpose, 19 critical factors with significant impact on the CLP were identified and listed in five groups, including individual, managerial, economic, technical, and environmental aspects. Then, a hybrid model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (GOA) was developed to determine the most influential factors and increase the CLP model's precision. Data related to the CLP of 24 under-construction commercial-office complex projects in Iran were gathered. Results reveal the most influencing factors on the CLP are labour experience and skill and motivation of labour from the individual group, the amount of pay from the economic group, site accidents from the technical group, proper supervision from the management group, and weather conditions from the environmental group. The findings can facilitate the development of more efficient project schedules, increasing the CLP, and reducing project costs.

J	Handfield, RB; Melnyk, SA; Calantone, RJ; Curkovic, S				Handfield, RB; Melnyk, SA; Calantone, RJ; Curkovic, S			Integrating environmental concerns into the design process: The gap between theory and practice	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						case studies; design for environment; environmentally responsible manufacturing	MANAGEMENT	This paper focuses on the product design process and integration of environmental performance criteria during this critical stage. Specifically, we explore environmentally responsible manufacturing (ERM) as perceived and acted on by two critical groups within this design process. The first consists of the champions and supporters of ERM, who either formally or informally act as advocates of ERM within the organization. The second consists of the users of design for environment (DfE) tools and procedures. Typically, these people consist of product designers and design engineers. We study these two groups through in-depth interviews with managers and engineers in a sample of ten firms drawn from the "best-in-class" environmental leaders. We found that a large gap exists between the ERM supporters and the users of ERM tools in terms of expectations, perceptions and orientations toward ERM principles, practices and tools. To overcome some of the many obstacles preventing effective integration of environmental criteria into the design process, we conclude with a process map that proposes the following steps: 1) enlisting support of a corporate champion; 2) defining environmental goals; 3) selecting a pilot project; 4) setting product launch goals and evaluation system; 5) enlisting support of team members; 6) providing DfE tools and training; 7) monitoring the project; and 8) celebrating successes.

In this research, a large-scale study analysed 2275 occupants' responses from 30 workplace buildings across nine years to explore the diverse impacts of demographic factors on IEQ satisfaction. The Sustainable Post-Occupancy Evaluation Survey, a self-administered and online-based questionnaire was used. The results indicated that male occupants have a greater tendency to be satisfied with thermal conditions, acoustic conditions, electric lighting, and privacy than female occupants. The middle age group (35-54yearrs) was less satisfied with the IEQs than the younger (18-34years) and older (+55years) groups. In addition, occupants who had worked less than 2 years were more satisfied with most IEQ factors than occupants who had worked more than 2 years. Occupants who worked less than 20 h/week were more satisfied with IEQ factors than occupants who worked more than 20 h/week. This study demonstrates the impacts of demographic differences on workplace occupants' satisfaction with IEQ factors. In addition to adding to the existing literature, this comprehensive longitudinal study provides findings that may inform future workplace design to enhance occupants' satisfaction with IEQ.

Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.

The CEE is garnering a new focus on sustainability with special emphasis on environmentally responsible design, construction, and operation of constructed facilities. To promote the aforementioned goals of sustainability, the authors have mentored a group of 23 undergraduate junior students under the High-Performance Sustainable Construction class to provide a comprehensive Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) analysis for the new CEEC. Based on the 2009 Reference Guide for Green Building Design and Construction, this paper presents a detailed overview showing (1)which credits are attainable in light of the current available design documents; (2)which credits are not incorporated in the current design documents but are achievable with some modifications and amendments; and (3)which credits are not obtainable regardless of any reasonable new design proposals. This case-study research shows that CEEC can possibly earn up to 71 points to acquire a LEED Gold certification. In addition, this study shows how undergraduate students can be mentored through active learning techniques to be effective and efficient participants in societal developments through their university curriculums.

This is even more important to green construction projects. There is a noticeable surge in the number of green construction projects. Green construction projects require contractors that have certain capabilities in addition to the traditional capabilities. This article highlights the key criteria for selecting contractors for green construction projects. Twenty criteria were identified based on literature review. These criteria were categorized into five groups: firm characteristics, firm record, commercial and technical bid, environmental and socio-economic. A survey was then developed and sent to professionals from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The respondents evaluated the selection criteria using pair-wise comparison using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Forty-eight responses were collected. The results show that the top five criteria are the bid price, energy management, technical bid, proposed time and water management. The results show that sustainability-related criteria (environmental and socio-economic groups) are important with a combined weight of 0.386.

J	Yu, JY; Leung, MY				Yu, Jingyu; Leung, Mei-yung			Exploring factors of preparing public engagement for large-scale development projects via a focus group study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction projects; Focus group; Preparation; Public engagement	HONG-KONG; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; POLICY; SUSTAINABILITY; STAKEHOLDERS; DELIBERATION; CONSENSUS	Public engagement (PE) is increasingly employed to gauge public opinions and obtain their support on large-scale planning and development projects. Despite its booming development, there is a lack of research on how to prepare PE activities. In order to explore the factors of preparing PE activities in the construction industry, four focus groups were conducted, each including different stakeholders (e.g., PE organizers, construction professionals, interest groups, and local residents). Seven critical factors for preparing PE were identified into 3 main dimensions: (1) social (e.g., governmental support and bottom-up consultation approaches); (2) project (e.g., project characteristics, PE program, and project information and publicity); and (3) stakeholder (e.g., stakeholder identification and representative sampling). Based on the results of focus groups, we propose several practical recommendations to stimulate active engagement and improve performance of PE activities, including developing PE guidelines, preparing project information with appropriate language and formatting, and establishing stakeholder identification methods.

J	Bangwal, D; Tiwari, P				Bangwal, Deepak; Tiwari, Prakash			Environmental design and awareness impact on organization image	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design management; Building information modelling; Construction planning	SUSTAINABLE OFFICE BUILDINGS; GREEN BUILDINGS; OCCUPANT SATISFACTION; CORPORATE IMAGE; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; LEED; SYSTEMS; ENERGY; MODEL	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how environmental design features of a green building contribute to the formation of employees' organization image (OIM) through better environmental awareness (EAW) within employees. Design/methodology/approach Based on a comprehensive literature review on environmental design features of a building, a theoretical model was proposed for investigation. Three putative paths linking workspace (WSP) to EAW, departmental space (DSP) to EAW and EAW to OIM were then tested relying on a survey data of 362 employees collected from three Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified buildings by using structural equation modeling methodology as prescribed by Hair et al. Findings Significant evidence was found in support of all three purposed paths. Further, the study found that workspace and the DSP together explained around 46 percent of the variance in employee's EAW, which then explained around 54 percent of the variance in the formation of the employees' OIM. Research limitations/implications - The study drew data only from green certified organizations. Future research should involve other green organizations or a larger sample of green buildings. The size and character of the sample were restricted by organizational constraints. Practical implications - The organizations need to be extremely cautious of green concerns during the design phase in order to capitalize on the yields of better employees' OIM. It also motivates the other organizational group toward the green building concept to increase the employees' EAW and to enhance organizational values and image. Originality/value - While the green concept has been a significant research topic for more than decades, barely any research has been conducted that focuses specifically on environmental design features of a green building on employees' EAW and OIM. This study tries to make a link between green building design features with employees' EAW and OIM. These links are rare in Indian perspective.

Several environmental management measures were put in place by international organisations to reduce these impacts on humans and the entire ecosystem. Sadly, such environmental management measures are not widely embraced in the construction industry of developing countries. This contributes to the poor quality of life of construction stakeholders, amongst other outcomes. Therefore, this study investigated the drivers to facilitate an environmental management system (EMS) in the Nigerian construction industry (NCI). Design/methodology/approach questionnaires retrieved from construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises were used to conduct both descriptive and inferential statistics, namely, mean score, standard deviation, Kruskal-Wallis H test, post hoc test and factor analysis. Findings The analyses show that the drivers of EMS implementation in the NCI could be grouped into intellectual enhancement strategies, documentation and cultural strategies, and motivation and tracking strategies. The study concluded that training and education of relevant stakeholders, tracking compliance levels of organisations and recognising firms acting in compliance with stipulated "environmental" policy are essential. It was recommended that the collaboration of all construction stakeholders be upheld to aid EMS implementation in the NCI. Originality/value This paper investigated the drivers of EMS with the opinions of construction professionals in the mainstream of the NCI through survey using to ensure wide coverage of respondents. Investigating the view of construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises helped determine possible significant differences. Thus, practical implications of the study were also provided in a systematic manner.

The previous study does not provide much evidence on dynamic patterns of stakeholder conflicts in the project duration from the planning to the construction and handover stage. Therefore, this study established a network-based framework to analyze the dynamics of stakeholder conflicts by detecting the critical conflicts and the affected relationships among stakeholders with a 16-year case study of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge project. Finally, a stakeholder-conflict map was proposed to provide management strategies considering the conflict criticalness and stakeholder participation of each stakeholder conflict. After reviewing 1,748 official documents from 2003 to 2018, the chronological features of environmental conflicts, neighboring conflicts, and traditional conflicts are detected. The changes of stakeholder relationships in the project duration are discussed by five stakeholder groups: local industry, green group, supervision group, construction group, and governmental organizations. The Mirror Z strategies of stakeholder conflicts are proposed in the phases of planning, construction, and handover, respectively. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Kalutara, P; Zhang, GM; Setunge, S; Wakefield, R				Kalutara, Pushpitha; Zhang, Guomin; Setunge, Sujeeva; Wakefield, Ron			Factors that influence Australian community buildings' sustainable management	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Life cycle assessment; Factor analysis; Sustainable management; Environmental assessment; Sustainability aspects	KEY INFORMANT APPROACH	Purpose - Australia has a huge stock of community buildings built up over decades. Their replacements consume a large sum of money from country's economy which has called for a strategy for their sustainable management. For this, a comprehensive decision-making structure is an utmost requirement. The purpose of this paper is to capture their sustainable management from four aspects, i.e. environmental, economic, social and functional. Design/methodology/approach - The design process follows an extensive review of environmental and life cycle assessments and company context documents. Extracted factors are tailored to community buildings management following expert consultation. However, the resulted list of factors is extremely large, and "factor analysis" technique is used to group the factors. For this, an industry-wide questionnaire across Australian local councils is employed to solicit opinions of the list of factors. Findings - The analysis has pinpointed 18 key parameters (criteria) to represent all four aspects. This paper presents the preliminary findings of the factors and the analysis results based on the questionnaire responses. Practical implications - The final decision-making structure incorporates all these aspects and criteria. This can be used to develop a decision-making model which produces a sustainability index for building components. Asset managers can mainly use the sustainability index to prioritise their maintenance activities and eventually, to find out cost-optimisation options for them. Originality/value - Most notably, this is the first study to apply all four sustainability aspects (environmental, economic, social and functional) to develop a decision-making structure for Australian community buildings' sustainable management.

J	Stenberg, AC				Stenberg, Ann-Charlotte			Green ideas travelling across organizational boundaries	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						community of action; community of practice; green building; identity construction; innovation; organizational culture; policy implementation; sense-making; travel of ideas		In the last few decades, environmental commitment has become a powerful discursive means of mobilizing actors and developing distinct organizational identity. However, the prevalent uncertainty in society concerning the interpretation and operationalization of concepts, such as `green', `sustainable', `environment' and `ecology' allows for interpretative flexibility. Accordingly, individual members or groups of members in organizations operationalize the concept green in ways that make sense to their working contexts' specific ontology, epistemology and ideology. Based on a comparative case study of three Swedish municipal housing companies, the paper examines how green ideas are translated as they travel across organizational boundaries, and how these notions become embedded within different organizational processes, and thus set external as well as internal boundaries. The underlying assumption is that the meaning of `green' shifts depending on which organization and sphere of society is in perspective. Therefore, the paper traces spatial shifts in meanings of `green' as these travel across organizational boundaries, from the local governmental authority, via the Parent company, to the three individual companies studied. Comparing the companies' official environmental statements with the organizational members' representations of green shows discrepancies in talk and action, which may have implications for the companies' internal identity as well as for the creation of an external image. Furthermore, these discrepancies are traced to different communities of action and practice, i.e. those who make strategic environmental decisions in the companies are not the same as those who possess environmental expertise.

Biofuel Production: Utilizing Stakeholders' Perspectives	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						Biofuel; Decision-Making; Pyrolysis; Stakeholder Requirements	TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; BIOMASS; PYROLYSIS	The use of biofuels as a replacement for fossil fuels is growing in the United States and other countries in part because of economic and environmental concerns. One of the technologies for biofuels production is fast pyrolysis; however, to increase manufacturing of fast pyrolysis units, a better understanding of stakeholders' requirements and perspectives is needed. This is a complex decision problem. Due to the diversity of perspectives, each group of stakeholders has their own unique requirements, which in total will determine the right manufacturing approach. Previous studies either investigated optimal sizing from a single viewpoint or have combined a subset of perspectives. This study applies multiple tools to develop a more comprehensive view of stakeholders' perspectives. Individual subject matter experts were asked to review and prioritize a set of requirements that reflected different stakeholders' perspectives, including economic, environmental, technical, social, and legal. The perspectives were then used to analyze multiple fast pyrolysis units to determine which size was the most effective in meeting the perspectives in total. The analysis indicated that the smallest unit, able to process an average of 50 tons per day, is the best alternative when viewed from the economic, technical, social, and legal perspectives. However, when viewed from the environmental perspective, a medium-sized unit, able to process in the range of 200-500 tons per day, is the best alternative. This work provides the basis for further discussions about the individual perspectives, including the economic and environmental perspectives of biofuel production. Potential avenues for further work in assessment of stakeholders' requirements are also noted.

The framework identifies 10 suitability factors accounting for environmental, ecological, cultural, human settlement, physical infrastructure, and wind resource aspects. It uses fuzzy-based nonlinear membership functions for scoring and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for weighting by engaging a group of experts. For the case study state, Indiana, suitable lands are identified and compared with existing wind farm developments. A sensitivity analysis shows suitable locations for wind farm development assuming different factors-weighting scenarios, such as suitable locations without considering environmental and ecological aspects. Such state-level analysis can be helpful for permitting agencies, local planners, and engineers engaged in permitting processes, zoning ordinances, and the development of regulations for the wind farms.

Sustainable performance criteria for construction method selection in concrete buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction methods; Prefabrication; Concrete construction; Construction management; Sustainable development	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION; MANAGEMENT; WASTE	The use of prefabrication offers significant advantages, yet appropriate criteria for applicability assessments to a given building have been found to be deficient. Decisions to use prefabrication are still largely based on anecdotal evidence or simply cost-based evaluation when comparing various construction methods. Holistic criteria are needed to assist with the selection of an appropriate construction method in concrete buildings during early project stages. Following a thorough literature review and comprehensive comparisons between prefabrication and on-site construction method, a total of 33 sustainable performance criteria (SPC) based on the triple bottom line and the requirements of different project stakeholders were identified. A survey of U.S. experienced practitioners including clients/developers, engineers, contractors, and precast concrete manufacturers was conducted to capture their perceptions on the importance of the criteria. The ranking analysis of survey results shows that social awareness and environmental concerns were considered as increasingly important in construction method selections. Factor analysis reveals that these SPCs can be grouped into seven dimensions, namely, economic factors: "long-term cost," "constructability," "quality," and "first cost"; social factors: "impact on health and community," "architectural impact": and environmental factor: "environmental impact." The resultant list of SPCs provides team members a new way to select a construction method, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of built environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Temporal Effect of Construction Workforce Physical Strain on Diminishing Marginal Productivity at the Task Level	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction productivity; Labor and personal issue; Diminishing marginal productivity; Work physiology; Physical strain	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT; SHIFT WORK; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; TAYLORISM; BURNOUT; DESIGN; IMPACT; SAFETY	Physiological status and environmental stressors are known to influence workforce performance at the individual worker level. A previous study, which conducted a cross-sectional comparison in repetitive material-handling construction activities, suggested that a U-shaped relationship existed between physical strain and productivity at the group level. This research revisits those findings to further investigate the U-curve relationship between physical strain and productivity at the group level and validate the concept of diminishing marginal productivity. Heart rates were measured as an indicator of subjects' physical strain, whereas task productivity was estimated by work sampling. Eighty person-hour data were converted into panel data sets by dividing each subject's 4-h experimental data into 5-min intervals. These data sets were subsequently used to evaluate the effects of time on physical strain and productivity with 5-min lags. The study found a U-curve relationship between physical strain and task-level productivity at the group level while controlling for individual characteristics. The U-shape relationship was constant in the low-performance and high-performance groups, although the degrees of the polynomials differed. Productive workers will remain more productive than low-productive workers with increased physical strain.

Various factors faced with during construction period prevent struction industry on the macro-economic structure of a country, it is inevitable to be aware of considerable effect of the timely completion on the allocated project budget. In this study, causes of time extensions in the Turkish construction industry and levels of their importance were examined together. In total, 34 factors affecting project duration were taken into account. A questionnaire survey, including these factors, was then applied to 71 construction companies in Turkey, and the outcomes were evaluated by means of statistical analyses. According to the results, "design and material changes" was found to be the most predominant factor, followed by "delay of payments" and "cash flow problems". In terms of importance levels of factor groups, financial factors were found to be the first group, while environmental factors were the least effective group. It should be also noted that managerial causes of time extensions are encountered in developed and developing countries, whereas financial causes are experienced in developing countries only.

J	Yuan, HP				Yuan, Hongping			Achieving Sustainability in Railway Projects: Major Stakeholder Concerns	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						stakeholder management; conflict; consensus; sustainability; railway projects	PERFORMANCE INDICATORS KPIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MANAGEMENT; KEY; COMPLEXITY; SUCCESS; PERCEPTION; IMPACT; CHINA	Achieving sustainability is becoming increasingly critical for measuring the overall success of infrastructure projects. Given the complexity of such projects, the successful management of sustainability-related targets requires joint efforts from the major stakeholders involved, including project clients, contractors, suppliers, and the general public. Nevertheless, these stakeholders often have different, and sometimes even conflicting, concerns regarding the achievement of project sustainability. Confrontations and disputes can arise unless these concerns are carefully analyzed and addressed. However, we know little specifically about how major stakeholders perceive infrastructure sustainability and how their concerns differ in the three dimensions of project sustainability: economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This study investigated the major concerns of stakeholders in achieving sustainability in a typical infrastructure project (i.e., railway projects). A triangulated methodology was adopted, including a literature review, a questionnaire survey, and interviews to obtain data from project stakeholders. Based on the results, there was a significant divergence of views among stakeholder groups, and conflicts arose when there was a mismatch between stakeholders' perceptions. A list of major concerns from each individual stakeholder group was ranked and discussed. Some measures for promoting the consensus on achieving project sustainability among different stakeholder groups were also provided. The study not only provides insights into understanding differences in the concerns of major stakeholder groups in achieving railway project sustainability, it also helps develop quantitative approaches for measuring the degree of consensus and conflict among major stakeholder groups so as to minimize their concern differences.

This presents a significant challenge to both policymakers and industry practitioners as sustainability is such a complex concept that includes various aspects, whereas construction firms are usually resource-constrained. There is lack of studies classifying various aspects of sustainability according to their managerial priorities, thereby identifying efficient transition pathways toward higher sustainability levels for construction enterprises. This paper proposes transition pathways toward sustainability (TPS) for construction enterprises by conducting an importance-performance analysis of the critical sustainability aspects. The construction enterprises were firstly classified into different clusters based on their sustainability performance by means of cluster analysis. Consequently, the importance-performance analysis was employed to classify the various sustainability aspects of the identified firm clusters, followed by the development of the TPS. The results show that although there is general agreement on the high importance of economic-sustainability aspects, significant differences exist in the perceptions and performance of social and environmental sustainability aspects across firm groups. Therefore, there are considerably different transition pathways for the various firm groups toward higher sustainability levels. This research provides a useful reference for construction enterprises to evaluate their positions in the sustainability transition journey and to optimize their resource allocation for sustainable development.

Stakeholder-Sensitive Social Welfare-Oriented Benefit Analysis for Sustainable Infrastructure Project Development	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable infrastructure development; Stakeholder management; Benefit analysis; Social choice theory; Social welfare theory; Project planning and design		There is a need for better involving stakeholders in the development of sustainable civil infrastructure systems and for incorporating their input in the decision-making process. In this paper, we present a new model for analyzing the sustainability of infrastructure project alternatives from a stakeholder-centric perspective: the stakeholder-sensitive, social welfare-oriented sustainability benefit analysis model (S-3 Model). The model evaluates infrastructure project alternatives based on a proposed sustainable construction social welfare function (SC-SWF). The SC-SWF is a measure of the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to all stakeholders. It can help identify project solutions that offer social (group) welfare based on the social, environmental, and economic benefits to individual stakeholders. The theoretical foundation of the proposed SC-SWF is grounded in the areas of social choice theory and social welfare theory. The proposed model and its practical application are illustrated through a hypothetical case study. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by advancing the knowledge in the area of social welfare theory and the fundamental research in infrastructure system decision theory. The proposed analysis may guide infrastructure system decision making and may lead to better understanding of how to plan and design infrastructure systems in a way that maximizes the collective social, environmental, and economic benefits to stakeholders.

Nevertheless, the application of the theory of TMS on new product development teams is surprisingly scant. We argue that the TMS leverages the notion of project-team memory, which is mostly equated with mechanistic memory or electronic documents and databases, by facilitating an interpersonal awareness of who knows what and who has appropriate and adequate skills and expertise, and then receiving information from that person. We then empirically test the effects of TMS on new product development outcomes including mediating and moderating factors, i.e., the collective mind and environmental turbulence, respectively. By investigating 79 Turkish new product development project teams, we found that: 1) the TMS has a positive impact on team learning and speed-to-market; 2) the collective mind (i.e., team members' attention to interrelating actions) mediates relations between the TMS, team learning, and speed-to-market; and 3) team learning and speed-to-market mediates relations between the TMS and new product success. Further, the moderating effect of environmental turbulence is investigated between the TMS, and team learning and speed-to-market. We found that the impact of the TMS on: 1) speed-to-market is negative when market and technology turbulence associated with the environment is high and 2) team learning changes quadratically with respect to the market and technology turbulence. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings are discussed.

The results of a survey on the prioritization of these 31 CSFs reveal that LCM projects involve more stakeholders than do general construction projects and require a correspondingly wider range of changes during each project. To identify more systematic and strategic approaches to stakeholder management in LCM projects, a framework was developed through factor analysis and focus-group interviews with project management experts. The framework is composed of the following five agendas: clear understanding of stakeholders, clear definition of the project, effective communication, responding to environmental changes, and social cooperation. The analysis results show that LCM projects require a stronger emphasis on responding to environmental changes and social cooperation. These results, along with the CSF priorities, reveal the necessity of taking customized approaches to LCM projects. The results of this analysis are expected to help LCM project managers effectively manage stakeholders. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This study applied this concept by developing and empirically testing a risk-based method for assessing renewable energy policy. An integrated theoretical framework is proposed for analyzing group decision-making regarding renewable energy (RE) policy selection. The proposed graphical matrix approach combined with Monte Carlo simulation compares alternative RE schemes by identifying and measuring critical performance indicators with acceptable reliability. The mathematical model reliably prioritizes alternatives using majority voting to address uncertainty in multi-criteria decision making process. A case study using historical data from previous RE development projects to confirm the feasibility of this approach. Compared to the conventional deterministic method, the stochastic graphical matrix approach provides more reliable estimation accuracy, decision quality, and efficiency in selection of sustainable renewable energy. The systematic approach provides policy makers information for use in evaluation by synthesizing the judgments of a panel of experts. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

J	Schoenherr, T; Talluri, S				Schoenherr, Tobias; Talluri, Srinivas			Environmental Sustainability Initiatives: A Comparative Analysis of Plant Efficiencies in Europe and the U.S.	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis (DEA); environmental sustainability initiatives (ESI); global survey; institutional theory; manufacturing industry; resource-based view	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE; IMPLEMENTATION-PROCESS; NORTH-AMERICAN; IMPACT; CORPORATE; SYSTEMS; PRESSURES; CONSEQUENCES	The importance of environmental sustainability initiatives (ESI) for engineering and supply chain management practice and research is undeniable. However, despite the widespread attention to this domain, investigations in the effects of ESI on performance have been ambiguous and led to contradicting results, calling for the examination of contingencies influencing the relationship. This study works to bring insight and clarity into this debate by a comparative analysis of ESI among efficient and inefficient plants in Europe and the U. S. Specifically, using a sample of 402 plants located in Europe and the U. S., we study the impact of an explicit set of ESI (recycling, waste reduction, pollution prevention, ISO 14000 certification) on plant efficiency, an important performance measure which is, however, rarely considered. Basing our rationale on the resource-based view of the firm, we suggest that plants more heavily engaged in ESI are also characterized by a greater level of efficiency. We test this contention in both European and U. S. plants. Extending this cross-national comparison, we further study whether the emphasis on ESI differs in the two country groups. Relying on institutional theory, we suggest that the pursuit of ESI is enhanced among European plants, compared to their U.S. counterparts. Our findings and conclusions draw attention to the importance of contingencies to be considered and bring light to the seemingly contradictory findings in prior research. Important implications for engineering and supply chain management practice and research are highlighted.

Many reviews, primarily from the UK and US literature, are examined to illustrate the nature and diversity of recent, largely descriptive, research into the impact of good design on social and economic outcomes. It is argued that the likelihood of the research being taken up is limited because of the difficulty in capturing the value intangible benefits. The results from three workshops identified the types of value delivered by the built environment, the stakeholders to whom value accrues, the possibilities for new valuation methods and their implementation, and what new research is needed. Five groups of stakeholders emerged between whom value is exchanged; and six main types of value that the built environment delivers were identified: social value, cultural value, image value, economic value, use value and environmental value. Value maps, matrices and probability curves are put forward as possible approaches for exploring and capturing these varied sorts of value, while developments in brand valuation and environmental economics are identified as having potential application in the built environment. Although knowledge of the tangible and intangible benefits that arise from good design is growing, better information together with improved valuation methods and a new attitude towards evidence-based design are all needed if the built environment is to reflect the emerging understanding.

Design/methodology/approach Through in-depth interviews with six stakeholder groups, namely, the government, developers, designers, contractors, manufacturers and researchers, 13 critical factors were identified and used to construct stakeholder-grouped FCMs, which were further aggregated into a collective FCM. The complexity and density of the collective FCM and the centrality of factors in the FCM were examined. Subsequently, a series of "what-if" simulations of the collective FCM were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions in promoting prefabrication. Findings The results show that three factors including market demand, cost, and policies and regulations have been mentioned by all stakeholder groups. However, these factors were ranked differently by stakeholder groups, implying that different stakeholder groups perceive the barriers to prefabricated building technologies differently. FCM simulations show that strengthening policies and regulations yield the strongest overall effect stimulating prefabrication, alleviating the organizational and environmental barriers more than the technological barriers, while improving the knowledge and expertise alleviate the technological barriers more. These measures need to be accompanied by other approaches, such as reducing cost and improving quality. Originality/value Few studies aim to analyze the interactions among the barriers to prefabrication, while this study specifically investigates this issue by illustrating the complex interactions using FCMs. Few studies also aim to identify the intervention strategies promoting prefabrication based on a quantitative approach, while this study employs FCM simulations to directly simulate the effectiveness of different strategies to facilitate prefabrication in a quantitative manner.

Energy expenditures and pollution emissions into the environment were studied and compared to analogical purpose materials. One of the most economically perspective technogenic waste - extractive hemihydrate phosphogypsum was investigated. Two technological production streams of phosphogypsum were studied. It was found, that the energy needs for production of analogical purpose materials (wall partitions) differ significantly. The nature of raw materials has an influence on energetic usefulness. The most effective materials according to their nature, energetic usefulness and environmental protection are mineral ones, especially if they are made with technogenic inorganic waste materials. The best results, from the energetic and ecological point of view, are obtained by using the waste raw material - extractive hemihydrate phosphogypsum. Its reprocessing energy expenditures and pollutant emissions into the environment are several times less, than for other analogical purpose and properties wall materials, also with less environmental pollution. Products made from reprocessing extractive hemihydrate phosphogypsum can replace other energy consuming articles for wall partitions.

J	ElWakeel, O; Andersen, B				ElWakeel, Omar; Andersen, Bjorn			Stakeholder evolution: a study of stakeholder dynamics in 12 Norwegian projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project life cycle; Project management; Quantitative analysis; Project stakeholder management	MANAGEMENT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of stakeholder dynamics and to show how stakeholders demonstrate their dynamic nature in the power/interest matrix. This, in turn, should assist project management and stakeholder management practitioners predict the behavior of different stakeholder groups in their projects, and strategize their stakeholder management approaches accordingly. Design/methodology/approach The findings in this paper are based on data collected from 12 diverse projects from five different business sectors executed in Norway by means of an online, closed-question questionnaire, which was analyzed using various statistical approaches. Findings Stakeholder dynamics is a contextual phenomenon, which takes different forms and shapes from one stakeholder group to the other, from one industry or business sector to the other, and even from one project to the other within the same industry or business sector. The stakeholder group of user(s) was the most dynamic in Norwegian projects based on their continuous repositioning on the power/interest matrix from one project phase to the other. Environmental activists/organizations were the least dynamic stakeholder group in the full sample of projects. Originality/value This paper presents the first more comprehensive empirically based findings about stakeholder dynamics in projects the authors have been able to find. The study gives project management practitioners insights from various industries and business sectors into how stakeholders change position over time. It also shows that the two attributes of power and interest are strongly connected and affect one another, which might make it possible to control and design a safer and less complex stakeholder environment for future projects.

However, there is relatively little research investigating stakeholders' drivers for engaging in collaborative innovation and the relative importance of drivers in infrastructure megaprojects. This research aims to address this gap by identifying the drivers for collaborative innovation and their relative importance in the context of infrastructure megaprojects. We adopt the literature review and questionnaire survey methods to identify drivers, the Relative Importance Index to rank them, and exploratory factor analysis to group them. The results show that 18 drivers are grouped into 6 dimensions. Their rankings are as follows: responding to project and clients' requirements, improving efficiency, gaining rewards, learning, responding to competition, responding to environmental changes. The research contributes to stakeholders' drivers to engage in collaborative innovation and the relative importance of drivers in the context of infrastructure megaprojects. Identifying and prioritizing stakeholders' drivers can provide practitioners with suggestions on managing the collaborative innovation process in infrastructure megaprojects.

Design/methodology/approach Literature review and expert interviews were conducted to identify the key factors. These factors were quantitatively evaluated via a questionnaire survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the underlying structure of these variables and organize the factors into a systematic framework. Findings Resource, clarity of policy problem and goal, legitimacy, acceptance of targeted group and environmental concern of public are the five top variables, which should be emphasized in the selection of CDW policy. The respondents with experience in policymaking and those without experience had slightly different views on the importance of these variables. A total of six latent factors were identified and organized into a framework. Research limitations/implications The questionnaire survey was conducted with government staff via a snowball sampling method, which may affect the representativeness of conclusions to a certain extent. Practical implications This study provides a useful reference for local government to choose appropriate policies to address the CDW problem. Matching attributes of policy instruments with the policy goal and the problem is the starting point in choice of the CDW policy. The matched instruments will be further narrowed by social context, i.e. environmental concern and socioeconomic situation. The final selection must undergo bargaining between policymakers and targeted groups. Originality/value Policy instruments choice is a complicated process, which is shaped by the interaction of many influential factors. However, the impact of these factors on CDW policy choice is largely overlooked. This study will contribute to the knowledge body pertaining to policy selection in the CDW field.

Identification and categorization of these complications could be the initial step towards carrying out a systematic assessment of construction stage emissions. This study aims to investigate major impediments affecting an emission study in building construction. Triangulation approach was adopted to collect the required data for the study in the form of literature review study, interviews and questionnaire survey distribution. Eighteen factors were identified through literature reviews and interviews with professionals in the construction industry and further investigated through a questionnaire survey. Ranking analysis was used to identify 11 critical factors out of which 'difficulties in collection of construction site specific data', 'commercial sensitivity of the data' and 'lack of data inventories and standards to estimate emissions' were identified as the most important factors. Using factor analysis, the identified factors were grouped into three categories, namely data related issues, scope definition issues and cost and technology related issues. Findings and the future research directions from the study provide valuable reference to researchers and industry practitioners who seek to pursue a comprehensive emission study at the construction stage of a building.

A participatory action research (PAR) project was undertaken at construction sites in Queensland, Australia. Using the PAR framework, a needs-based health promotion planning model was implemented. Health promotion measures were designed to address the 'SNAPO' health risk factors (i.e. smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, insufficient physical exercise and overweight/obesity). At the largest site participating in the research, preliminary health assessments revealed levels of physical health that were comparable with those of the general Australian population. The construction workers' mental health was poorer than that of the general Australian population. A consultation workshop with a representative group of workers at the site identified healthy eating, smoking cessation and physical exercise as priority areas for intervention. Several health promotion measures addressing these issues were implemented, including a quit smoking programme, a 'healthy options' menu in the site canteen, healthy eating and cooking workshops and onsite yoga and stretching sessions. A subset of workers at the site reported their health behaviour in weekly 'logs'. The log data revealed fluctuations in health behaviour over a 14-week period. Evaluation interviews and a focus group revealed environmental impediments to the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviours. Workers identified the need to provide a work environment that is supportive of healthy behaviour as critical to the effectiveness of specific health promotion measures.

Construction delays in Hong Kong civil engineering projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction delays are common in civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, inevitably resulting in contractual claims and increased project cost. This study was aimed, first, at gathering the perceptions of civil construction practitioners on how significant are the causes of delay; and, second, investigating whether the suggestions as stated in the report of the Construction Industry Review Committee (the Committee comprises members with good standing and knowledge in the construction and related fields as well as those from other professions who are responsible for examining the current state of the construction industry in terms of its output quantity, the quality of work, its environmental friendliness, site safety, its workforce and the system of supervision) are applicable to and effective at mitigating the corresponding delays with reference to a ranking order established using the mean score method. The extent of the differences in perception among the different respondent groups on these two issues was also examined using the rank agreement factor (RAF), percentage agreement (PA), and percentage disagreement (PD). The differences in the perceptions of the respondents on the significance of delays and the actual causes of delays for the six projects studied were also examined. The results of the study showed that the respondents tended to admit their own faults as shown in the top ten significant causes of delay. A strong consensus was found between the client and consultant groups on the significance of the various causes of delay (PA=74%) and the effectiveness of mitigation measures (PA=67%) compared with the other pairs of groups. The consultant and contractor groups held extremely different perceptions regarding the significance of various delay causes (RAF=4.9 and PD=32%) and the effectiveness of corresponding mitigation measures (RAF=6.2 and PD=47%). It is believed that the findings can provide much more insight for the construction practitioners as well as the researchers and thus help to improve the productivity and overall performance of civil construction projects in Hong Kong.

J	Fawcett, T; Killip, G				Fawcett, Tina; Killip, Gavin			Anatomy of low carbon retrofits: evidence from owner-occupied Superhomes	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						demographics; energy; homeowners; housing; low carbon; motivation; owner-occupier; refurbishment; retrofit	EXISTING BUILDINGS; REFURBISHMENT; RENOVATION	A small number of Superhome' owners in the UK have renovated their homes to reduce CO2 emissions by 60% or more. Superhome owner-occupiers, their homes and various aspects of their retrofit are characterized including the timing, planning, motivation, costs and interactions with professionals, and lessons drawn from this specialized group for the wider population. Research is based on a survey of 57 Superhome owners and 14 more detailed interviews. Compared with typical owner-occupiers, Superhome owners are on average younger, better educated, living in larger household groups and larger homes, and have higher incomes. However, there is considerable variation between households. Two main routes to retrofit were identified: planned and emergent, with emergent retrofits taking longer to complete, stretching over many years in some cases. Householder levels of knowledge and involvement in planning and managing the retrofit were high. Most commonly, paid professionals did most or some of the retrofit work, but many projects included some DIY. Significantly, their decisions are not made as rational economic actors'; instead motivations were multiple and included environmental concern, desire for improved comfort and living standards, reducing waste and saving on energy costs. Questions for further research are identified, as are suggestions for policy development.

J	Redfern, P; Zhong, H				Redfern, Peter; Zhong, Hua			The role of EcoCampus in addressing sustainability in UK universities	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						EcoCampus; environmental management; sustainable development; carbon management	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; CARBON FOOTPRINT; IMPLEMENTATION	Universities are key drivers of sustainable development and are well-positioned to contribute to the sustainability agenda. Universities in the United Kingdom (UK) are themselves large and influential organisations, and because of their size, can have a significant impact on the environment. Their challenge, however, is to practice what they preach and to manage their own estates and procurement decisions to reduce their impact on the environment and meet carbon reduction targets. In the UK, higher education (HE) sector Scopes 1 and 2 carbon CO(2)e emissions have, over recent years, been falling considerably short of the emission reduction targets set by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in all but a few institutions. Setting sector specific targets, therefore, does not guarantee success in addressing climate change. However, in those institutions adopting the EcoCampus management system approach, Scopes 1 and 2 carbon CO(2)e emissions have fallen by up to 5% over the latest reporting period (2013/2014-2014/2015). This contrasts with the increase in emissions from those institutions who currently do not have a certified management system and are currently at the bottom of the People and Planet University League Table. (This is an independent league table of UK universities ranked by environmental and ethical performance). Environmental management systems (EMSs) are increasingly being used by organisations to improve their environmental performance. EMSs deliver many benefits such as reducing resource use and pollution, complying with relevant environmental legislation, managing risks, improving corporate reputation and saving costs. The aim of this research was to assess the carbon management performance of universities in the UK and China and relate this to the level of uptake of EMSs in these universities. The results of this research informed the development of the EMS support and awards programme called EcoCampus. EcoCampus addresses the challenges faced by universities in reducing their carbon emissions by developing an EMS in simple stages with support in a variety of different forms. This self-financing programme has now been operating successfully for over ten years. During this time, EcoCampus has worked with over 60 universities and colleges in the UK. Eighteen participants have currently achieved the highest phase of EcoCampus and certification to the international EMS standard ISO14001. There are currently 40 universities, one research institute and three colleges enrolled on the various phases of the EcoCampus programme. There are five universities from the Russell Group including Cambridge University, Imperial College London, Nottingham University, Newcastle University and University College London. The EcoCampus programme is highly successful in the UK and there is growing interest from international universities wishing to join the programme. Seven of the top ten universities in the UK's People and Planet University League Table are EcoCampus members. All the top ten universities in the League Table have shown a reduction in their carbon emissions. In contrast, the ten institutions at the bottom of the League don't have a certified EMS and have increased their carbon emissions. By identifying the benefits of an EMS, particularly in relation to carbon management, it is hoped that this paper will encourage organisations to develop, implement and operate an EMS. This should lead to a more sustainable sector able to lead by example.

A social ontology for appraising sustainability of construction projects and developments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Social issues; Construction; Project; Ontology		The social dimension of sustainability has been growing in importance as a criterion for evaluating the viability of projects in the construction sector. The authors present an ontology that can be employed to provide a systematic articulation to the issues that impinge on the social dimension of sustainability appraisals. The development of the social ontology was a consequence of a research project that explored the tools, metrics and models (SUE-Mot) employed in the evaluation of sustainability within the urban built environment. The development was achieved by the method of focus group interaction. The proposed ontology can be combined with the environmental and economic requirements of projects to assist developers and others stakeholders gain a more comprehensive and holistic view of the sustainable issues that attend construction and urban developments.

Design/methodology/approach Stakeholders and CFs were identified through literature review and document analysis. The Delphi method was used to screen the extracted stakeholders and CFs. The focus group methodology was applied to obtain evaluation matrices of relationships between stakeholders and CFs. A two-mode social network was formed to analyse the evaluation matrices generated. Findings Results of the analyses indicate that local governments and policymaking institutions, together with project investors, obtained high prioritisations in the stakeholders' group, whilst senior citizens and caregivers appear to rank last. For CFs, communities' environmental factors receive the most attention from stakeholders. Research limitations/implications Results of the analyses can only show similarities of the participating stakeholders' opinions on their concerns, and provide researchers and practitioners with initial ideas on analysing stakeholders and CFs at the briefing stage of promoting AFCs. For a specific project, the concerns and prioritisations would change. Diverse voices are necessary and case studies are in need. Practical implications Challenges in promoting AFCs in urban China are discussed, and a preliminary framework of the briefing stage is developed for practitioners to follow when promoting AFCs. Originality/value This study discusses which CFs should be considered priorities and what consensuses are generally reached by stakeholders. CFs are utilised to interpret stakeholders' relationships, influences and concerns on AFC projects when conducting the social network analysis (SNA).

A framework called LENSES (Living Environments in Natural, Social, and Economic Systems) is presented that can address the type and scale of change necessary. This framework outlines a process to help communities and project teams create places where natural, social and economic systems can mutually thrive and prosper. LENSES is both a process and a metrics tool designed to help teams establish goals and to explore effectively relationships and interconnections in order to create restorative and regenerative places. The strength of LENSES lies in its ability to help groups consider concepts and elements often missing in other frameworks and tools such as inclusivity, financial sourcing, cultural resources, regional context, education, shared authority and governance, and on-going prosperity. LENSES provides a clear path to facilitate movement toward regenerative, place-based solutions in the built environment and beyond.

This continuing injury trend requires further understanding of the causes of safety issues as well as what magnifies safety risk. This study aims to investigate the extent of the impact of different factors on worker safety risk. The factors, namely human, site conditions, psychological, environmental, social, economic, regulatory, ergonomic, and organizational, were developed as part of recently formulated degrees of connectivity (DoC) model scenarios utilizing the risk perception of different specialists. The risk perceptions associated with the factors as provided by construction safety university professors and practicing safety engineers are explored for comparison. The Delphi method was adopted to collect the required data from both mentioned groups. The results show that the participants perceive that site condition factors create the highest impact whereas the worker economic factor adds the lowest impact. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of risk perception, nor was there a clear impact of participant experience on the risk perception process and the factors under investigation. Safety planners can benefit from the study results by considering the level of impact that the factors have on worker safety. Moreover, when addressing safety on a project, both professors and engineers can contribute equally. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Balekelayi, N; Tesfamariam, S				Balekelayi, Ngandu; Tesfamariam, Solomon			Statistical Inference of Sewer Pipe Deterioration Using Bayesian Geoadditive Regression Model	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sewer deterioration; Regression analysis; Nonlinear effect; Geospatial location; Bayesian geoadditive models	PREDICTION MODELS; INFRASTRUCTURE; SELECTION	Several deterioration models have been developed for prediction of the actual and future condition states of individual sewer pipes. However, most tools that have been developed assume a linear dependency between the predictor and the structural condition response. Moreover, unobserved variables are not included in the models. Physical processes, such as the deterioration of pipes, are complex, and a nonlinear dependency between the covariates and the condition of the pipes is more realistic. This study applied a Bayesian geoadditive regression model to predict sewer pipe deterioration scores from a set of predictors categorized as physical, maintenance, and environmental data. The first and second groups of covariates were allowed to affect the response variables linearly and nonlinearly. However, the third group of data was represented by a surrogate variable to account for unobserved covariates and their interactions. Data uncertainty was captured by the Bayesian representation of the P-splines smooth functions. Additionally, the effects of unobserved covariates are analyzed at two levels including the structured level that globally considers a possible dependency between the deterioration pattern of pipes in the neighborhood and the unstructured level that account for local heterogeneities. The model formulation is general and is applicable to both inspected and uninspected pipes. The tool developed is an important decision support tool for urban water utility managers in their prioritization of inspection, maintenance, and replacement.

J	Bajjou, MS; Chafi, A				Bajjou, Mohamed Saad; Chafi, Anas			Exploring the critical waste factors affecting construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction waste; Waste reduction; Factor analysis; Lean construction; Environmental performance; Sustainable construction	LEAN CONSTRUCTION; BUILDING-PROJECTS; COST OVERRUNS; MANAGEMENT; GENERATION; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; INDUSTRY	Purpose Waste is typically encountered during the building's life cycle, from the design phase, through the construction phase, to modification and demolition. Most of these construction wastes are unnoticed or unattended by project managers, which lead to serious environmental problems. Effective waste reduction strategies will require a thorough and detailed understanding of the causes of construction waste. Hence, this paper aims to explore critical waste factors (CWFs) affecting the performance of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review was carried out to determine these factors based on previous studies, from which a questionnaire was developed. Series of statistical analyses such as reliability analysis, Spearman Correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and factor analysis were performed on a total of 330 valid responses to identify latent factors responsible for wastes occurrence. Findings This study reveals 31 CWFs through evaluation of prior relevant studies carried out in several countries and then adjusted and validated through semistructured interviews. The significant differences in views within various groups of respondents with different organizational characteristics are highlighted. The results of factor analysis showed that there are six principal components extracted with 66.3% of variance explained (material-related factors; subcontractors and workers; planning, communication and coordination; people involvement and financial issues; people development strategies; and external factors). Originality/value This study differs from other studies in the literature by gathering all relevant waste factors including those related to nonphysical waste such as time, budget, workers and equipment. Furthermore, this paper will be of great interest to both practitioners and researchers since it brings various recommendations concerning the prevention/reduction of waste through lean construction for more sustainable construction projects.

Discovering Stakeholder Values for Axiology-Based Value Analysis of Building Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Axiology; Value analysis; Stakeholder values; Infrastructure management; Project planning and design	SUSTAINABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN	There has been an increasing demand for maximizing the environmental, social, and economic value of built infrastructure. However, a major gap still exists in the area of value analysis; there is no formal model to conceptualize, represent, and reason about value and valuation of built infrastructure. This paper presents the authors' work in the area of formal axiology-based value analysis of building projects. Axiology is a theory of value and worth. The formal axiology is a theory-based, semantic model for analyzing and assessing the value (worth) of building projects based on the environmental, social, and economic values of stakeholders (e.g.,energy conservation, safety, economic growth). The first step towards developing the formal axiology is discovering stakeholder values in the context of building projects. Value discovery is the process of identifying the values that are relevant to a particular system. In this paper, the authors focus on presenting their value-discovery work for residential, commercial, and educational building projects. Stakeholder values were discovered from project documents, value literature, and a stakeholder survey. The paper discusses the survey design, implementation, and results. Overall, the results show that, on average, all values are at least moderately important to all stakeholders. The results also show that although there is a general agreement on the importance ranking of values among stakeholders, there are significant differences in the ranks across different stakeholder groups and across different project types. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing both theoretical and empirical knowledge on stakeholder value discovery; it could facilitate value-sensitive decision-making by embodying stakeholder values into project planning and design towards better synergy between human values and the built environment.

J	Ghoddousi, P; Nasirzadeh, F; Hashemi, H				Ghoddousi, Parviz; Nasirzadeh, Farnad; Hashemi, Hassan			Evaluating Highway Construction Projects' Sustainability Using a Multicriteria Group Decision-Making Model Based on Bootstrap Simulation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL); Fuzzy cognitive map (FCM); Highway construction project; Interval intuitionistic fuzzy; Non-parametric bootstrap simulation; Sustainable construction	FUZZY; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; RANKING; INDICATORS	Sustainable construction has recently been acknowledged as a crucial issue in the construction industry. Developing and using multicriteria evaluation models to prioritize alternative construction projects based on sustainability indicators plays a major role in promoting sustainable construction. Evaluating construction projects according to sustainable development principles is a complicated problem, because the evaluation includes various indicators that have complex interdependences. Moreover, sufficient data is not normally available for the evaluation of construction projects from a sustainability point of view. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces a novel multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) model based on bootstrap simulation. The proposed model uses nonparametric bootstrap simulation to address aggregating inadequate experts' opinions and employs decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to provide the relative importance of evaluation criteria. Furthermore, based on the positive-ideal, negative-ideal, and closeness coefficient in interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets, a novel ranking score is proposed to compute the sustainability level of the construction projects. The proposed model is employed in a case study for evaluating and prioritizing highway construction projects by considering sustainability indicators. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel and applicable mathematical model to assist decision makers (DMs) in evaluating various alternative projects and making the optimum decision based on an integrated consideration of economic, environmental, and social sustainability indicators.

Measuring the complexity of mega construction projects in China-A fuzzy analytic network process analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mega construction projects; Complexity measurement; Fuzzy analytic network process; Shanghai Expo construction project	SELECTION; SUCCESS; MODEL	Mega construction projects in China are usually very complicated in nature, thus evaluating and understanding these complexities are critical to the success of these megaprojects. However, empirical studies related to the measurement of the complexity of megaprojects remain lacking. This paper aims to fill this gap by developing a complexity measurement model based on the Shanghai Expo construction project in China using fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). Firstly, a complexity measurement model consisting of 28 factors, which are grouped under six categories, namely, technological, organizational, goal, environmental, cultural and information complexities, is formulated through literature review using the content analysis technique. The model is then refined by a two-round Delphi survey conducted in the case megaproject. Finally, the refined model and suggestions for its application are provided based on the survey results.

Presently, China is pursuing the development of coal gasification technology despite industry setbacks, limited progress and elusive solutions due to limited specialty materials, technological shortfalls and intellectual expertise. The most prominent challenges to overcome include unbalanced research and project scale development issues followed by an excessive emphasis on equipment manufacturing rather than responsible management practices. The ENN Group explored these industry shortcomings to develop a comprehensive management philosophy that is specifically tailored to overcome these fundamental hurdles. Such innovative solutions include the Centralized Innovation Camp, TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) training, Extensive Alliance Network and enhanced process management, focusing upon engineering, quality assurance and process efficiency with the overall objective of industrial scale application. As a result, ENN's Clean Coal Technologies include: Coal Hydro-gasification, Supercritical Coal Gasification, Catalytic Coal Gasification and Underground Coal Gasification, having successfully completed all pilot plant testing requirements and the construction of demonstration commercial units.

The recent advancements in various structural systems have made the selection of the appropriate structural system for a specific project a challenging decision-making process. This process involves different economic and technical criteria representing the availability of experienced technicians and engineers and necessary machinery and construction materials. Economic life cycle, environmental protection related issues, safety of the project site, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes are also issues related to the country and location in which the construction project takes place, and they should also be addressed in the decision-making process. In this paper, a new algorithm combining two well-known multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III) and preference ranking organization method for enrich evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), have been specially developed for ranking of structural systems. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to group decision-making cases. In addition, the decision matrix data, criteria weights, preference, indifference, and veto thresholds are set as interval values to consider uncertainties in the decision-making procedure. The proposed methodology considers veto threshold, provide complete ranking, exempts the preference functions and includes conceptions such as risk, uncertainty, and reliability with interval approach. The proposed algorithm has been utilized in selecting the appropriate structural system in a low-rise multihousing project in Iran. In this case study, sixteen criteria have been used to select the best structural system between eight alternatives considering relevant uncertainties in the judgments of three groups of stakeholders (owner, consultants, and contractors). The results of the case study showed that the proposed methodology can be used as a proper tool for decision making in the construction management processes.

J	Hussain, RR; Ishida, T				Hussain, Raja Rizwan; Ishida, Tetsuya			Computer-aided oxygen transport model of mass and energy simulation for corrosion of reinforced steel	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Oxygen; Corrosion; Automation; Modeling; Reinforced concrete construction	PITTING CORROSION; CONCRETE; MACROCELL; CEMENT	The paper includes automated modeling and experimental verification of corrosion in reinforced concrete construction under the effect of varying oxygen concentration. Various construction corrosion cells with different concrete compositions under four different environmental conditions (air dry, submerged, 95% R.H and alternate wetting-drying) have been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Using the results (half-cell potential and gravimetric corrosion mass loss) of these laboratory tests and an automated computer-aided simulation model based on mass and energy transfer through the porous construction media for the corrosion process, it was possible to predict, maintain and manage the influence of oxygen concentration on the corrosion rate of the reinforcement in concrete construction under various defined conditions satisfactorily. The variation in oxygen concentration available for corrosion reaction has been taken into account simulating the actual construction field conditions such as by varying concrete cover depth, relative humidity, water-cement ratio, etc. The modeling task has been incorporated by the use of an automated computer based construction durability model 'DuCOM' developed by our construction research group at The University of Tokyo as a finite element computational approach for the effect of oxygen on corrosion in relation to W/C, concrete cover, chloride concentration and various environmental humidity construction conditions. This paper is of interest to a broad readership for those interested in automation in reinforced concrete construction involving durability design & engineering related to corrosion of steel in concrete, corrosion resistant construction technology, corrosion maintenance & management. The scope of this paper encompasses various stages of the corrosion in construction life cycle from initial planning and design, through construction of steel reinforced concrete facility, its operation and maintenance, to the estimation of demolishing due to limiting oxygen controlled corrosion damage. This paper contains novel investigations involving computer-aided durability design, corrosion modeling under varying oxygen, classification and standardization of corrosion product data. The paper incorporates mass and energy process simulation models and graphics for the effect of oxygen on corrosion and its automated inspection as well as management. This comprehensive automated modeling and experimental investigation involving variety of materials and environmental variables will help in profound understanding, maintenance and management of oxygen controlled corrosion reaction in RC construction and will provide significant future research prospects in the field of oxygen limiting automated corrosion modeling of RC construction.

However, there is no comprehensive study that explores the important project management factors from the perspective of architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms, whose decisions can significantly affect the environmental performance of building projects. In Singapore, Green Mark, a certification for green building, has become a compulsory requirement for all new buildings. AEC firms are now facing challenges on how best to attain Green Mark certification with minimum cost and resources. The purpose of this research is to identify the controllable critical project management factors for delivering Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher Green Mark ratings. Nineteen controllable project management factors were first identified from related literature, and then a survey was carried out to collect data needed to perform the principal component factor analysis. The factor analysis revealed that the controllable project management factors could be grouped into five major components, namely, (1) human resource-oriented factors, (2) technical and innovation-oriented factors, (3) support from designers and senior management, (4) project manager's competence, and (5) coordination of designers and contractors. Finally, multiple regression analysis was applied. It was found that the coordination of designers and contractors and technical and innovation-oriented factors are the most critical success factors, and possible reasons are discussed. With the help of the research findings, project organizations in Singapore will manage their Green Mark certified projects to achieve higher rating levels in a more efficient and effective way.

Semantic System for Stakeholder-Conscious Infrastructure Project Planning and Design	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable infrastructure development; Stakeholder management; Benefit analysis; Social welfare theory; Information and knowledge management; Knowledge-based computer models; Ontology; Project planning and design		There is an increasing recognition of the importance of incorporating social equity into transportation infrastructure system decision-making. This paper presents a semantic, ontology-based system for stakeholder-conscious infrastructure project planning and design. The ontology offers a semantic model for representing and reasoning about the stakeholders of transportation projects, the benefits generated by transportation projects, and the analysis of the social equity of transportation projects based on stakeholder input and expected benefits. The theoretical foundation of the proposed equity analysis is grounded in the area of social welfare theory. The ontology was verified and validated using automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and real-life case study evaluation. The proposed ontology-based system may support infrastructure system decision-making by assessing the social (group) welfare based on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of transportation project alternatives and taking stakeholder preferences into account, and may lead to better identification of the alternative(s) that offer the highest social welfare.

J	Zhao, XL; Lovreglio, R; Nilsson, D				Zhao, Xilei; Lovreglio, Ruggiero; Nilsson, Daniel			Modelling and interpreting pre-evacuation decision-making using machine learning	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Random forest; Machine learning; Interpretation; Nonlinearity; Human behaviour in fire; Pre-evacuation	HUMAN-BEHAVIOR; FIRE EVACUATION; CLASSIFICATION; CHOICE; TREES	The behaviour of building occupants in the first stage of an evacuation can dramatically impact the time required to evacuate buildings. This behaviour has been widely investigated by scholars with a macroscopic approach fitting random distributions to represent the pre-evacuation time, i.e. time from noticing the first cue until deliberate movement. However, microscopic investigations on how building occupants respond to several social and environmental factors are still rare in the literature. This paper aims to leverage machine learning as a possible solution to investigate factors affecting building occupants' decision-making during pre-evacuation stage. In particular, we focus on applying interpretable machine learning to reveal the interactions among the input variables and to capture nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the outcome. As such, we use a well-established machine-learning algorithm-random forest-to model and predict people's emergency behaviour pre-evacuation. We then apply tools to interpret the black-box random forest model to extract useful knowledge and gain insights for emergency planning. Specifically, this algorithm is applied here to investigate the behaviour of 569 building occupants split between five unannounced evacuation drills in a cinema theatre. The results indicate that both social and environmental factors affect the probability of responding. Several independent variables, such as the time elapsed after the alarm has started and the decision-maker's group size, are presenting strong nonlinear relationships with the probability of switching to the response stage. Furthermore, we find interactions exist between the row number where the decision-maker sits and the number of responding occupants visible to her; the complex relationship between the outcome and these two variables can be visualized by using a two-dimensional partial dependence plot. An interesting finding is that a decision-maker is more sensitive to the proportion of responding occupants than the number of them; hence, the people sitting in the back are often responding more slowly than the people in the front.

To address this, organizations have implemented behavioural health promotion programmes. However, targeting workers' lifestyle behaviour without addressing relevant environmental factors is unlikely to produce significant or sustained improvement. An ecological perspective offers a different way of understanding the determinants of health, reflecting the interplay of factors at multiple levels and the dynamic, reciprocal and non-linear relationships between them. Qualitative data collected during focus groups and in interviews with workers and managers were analysed to explore factors impacting the effectiveness of a health promotion programme implemented at two work sites in Queensland, Australia. A qualitative causal loop diagram identifying determinants of construction workers' health behaviour was developed. The findings suggest that the adoption of healthy behaviours is influenced by factors operating at and between individual, family, workplace and industry levels. These factors suggest key leverage points that can be addressed in the design of future health promotion interventions for the construction industry. The research provides qualitative evidence of the need to consider workers' health in a holistic way and develop multi-level strategies to produce improved health behaviour and outcomes in the construction industry.

J	Le, C; Yaw, MW; Jeong, HD; Choi, K				Le, Chau; Yaw, Meng Wai; Jeong, H. David; Choi, Kunhee			Comprehensive Evaluation of Influential Factors on Public Roadway Project Contract Time	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contract time determination (CTD); Project duration estimation; Project scheduling; Influential factors; Importance index		Contract time determination (CTD) is one of the most critical activities when developing a public roadway. There is no lack of policy documents, process manuals, and technical papers emphasizing its significance and impact on project performance and contractor behavior. However, little definitive information or systemic knowledge is available on the factors that affect a public roadway project's contract time. Studies holistically examining CTD factors are scarce. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study first identified 42 factors from an extensive scan of the existing literature and CTD manuals and examined the factors using a two-stage nationwide survey. The survey results provide a comprehensive evaluation of CTD factors from multiple dimensions: frequency of occurrence, level of influence, proper timing of identification, and impact boundary (projectwide versus item-specific). This study also identified the top important CTD factors, such as traffic maintenance, production rates, environmental issues, project complexity, and utility issues. This research is significant because it is probably the first national study to assemble the scattered and incoherent information and knowledge across different regions and states on CTD factors and systematically organize and evaluate them. This study's key results also carry high practical value for practitioners-another important group of readers of this journal.

Managing the expectations of external stakeholders in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Review; Management strategy; Construction projects; Stakeholder management; Expectations; External stakeholders	PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM; MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CONFLICT-ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES; MODEL	Purpose - The consideration of external stakeholders has proven to be more critical than internal stakeholders in construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to present the diverse expectations of external stakeholder groups, i.e. governmental authorities, general public, and affected local communities, in construction projects. The practical steps to manage the expectations are also outlined. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage methodology was adopted for the review. The primary terms "stakeholder," "project participants," or "project environment" were first searched in four popularly search engines and eight top journals that publish construction research to retrieve publications. After a second-stage filtering process, the selected data were then analyzed and reviewed in line with the objectives. Findings - In total, 49 common expectations were identified and classified. The results indicate that each stakeholder group pursues expectations in line with the social, environmental, and economic sustainability objectives. For effective management, project managers (PMs) must know stakeholder opportunities and threats, fulfill social responsibilities, establish common goals, apply appropriate strategies, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - The identified expectations are only based on the selected publications. Even though the expectations have been categorized in line with the triple bottom line model, the relative importance of the expectations cannot be ascertained since there is no empirical support. Practical implications - PMs can play safe by acknowledging the stakeholder expectations and employ such strategies to curtail resulting impacts and maximize mutual benefits. The list of expectations could also be used to promote equitable value optimization in projects, enhance needs fulfillment, and facilitate the evaluation of external stakeholder satisfaction. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive checklist of construction stakeholder expectations which hitherto, is lacked in the literature. Moreover, practical steps to manage the expectations of external stakeholders have been discussed.	[Chan, Albert P.

J	Hill, S; Lorenz, D; Dent, P; Lutzkendorf, T				Hill, Stephen; Lorenz, David; Dent, Peter; Luetzkendorf, Thomas			Professionalism and ethics in a changing economy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						accountability; civic; ethics; leadership; professionalism; public interest; responsibility; values		Professional responsibilities in a complex and contested work environment are constantly being reshaped by a changing economic, environmental and social context. Responsibility and accountability have become more diffuse, and they reside with a wider group including professionals and professional organizations. The codes, charters and laws of several built environment professional organizations in the United Kingdom and Germany are examined for ethical principles and guidance. The allocation of responsibility for acting in the public interest rests with both the individual professional and the professional organizations, but many professionals experience an ethical void due to little guidance from their institutions. To address this problem, an ethical framework is constructed for professionals, allowing ethical issues to be considered in a structured, practical way. Consideration is also given to how to foster conditions for professionals to take personal responsibility for ethical behaviour, including the idea of personal responsibility for the Other. An overarching concept of civic professionalism can guide professional behaviour. A set of guiding ethical principles for professional practice can stimulate both individual professionals and their professional organizations to fulfil this key role better, as well as challenging the latter to fulfil their leadership role and responsibilities in professional practice and civic society.

J	Hu, Y; Chan, APC; Le, Y				Hu, Yi; Chan, Albert P. C.; Le, Yun			Understanding the Determinants of Program Organization for Construction Megaproject Success: Case Study of the Shanghai Expo Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Program organization; Construction megaprojects; Client organizations; China	PROJECT	Program management is increasingly regarded as a key approach to improving the performance of a construction megaproject through the coordinated management of its constituent projects. However, previous studies have seldom provided a pragmatic program management framework that can fully address the requirements of clients in managing construction megaprojects. Therefore, based on a case study of the Shanghai Expo construction, this study aims to identify the principal program organization factors (POFs) that are determinants of the program organization established by a client to manage a megaproject. Mixed research methods, such as case study, literature review, interviews, Delphi survey, and archival methods, are employed in this study. Consequently, 12 principal POFs, grouped under three main categories (environmental capability, core capacity, and motivational capability of the client's program organization to manage its construction megaproject), are identified: (1) contextual understanding, (2) program strategy, (3) program leadership, (4) scope management, (5) program governance, (6) matrix organizational structure, (7) program management office, (8) use of project breakdown structure and work breakdown structure tools, (9) partnering with key stakeholders, (10) technology management, (11) communication management, and (12) team building. These research findings will help scholars and professionals, particularly those in China, to appreciate the key issues in managing megaprojects through program organization.

Sustainable property funds: financial stakeholders' views on sustainability criteria and market acceptance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						key financial stakeholders; market acceptance; responsible property investment; sustainability criteria; sustainable real estate funds	ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS; ANTHROPOCENTRIC ATTITUDES; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; AGE-DIFFERENCES; RISK; LIFE; IMPACTS; CHOICE; STOCK; QUESTIONNAIRE	Sustainable property (real estate) funds (S-REFs) have started to enter international finance markets. An investigation in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland examined two key questions: (1) the sustainability criteria that institutional real estate investors and real estate fund (REF) suppliers regard as important for the market success of S-REFs; and (2) how they assess the market acceptance of such funds. Focus groups were conducted to define sustainability components for S-REFs from a market success perspective. A questionnaire study was then undertaken to assess the two key questions. Factor analysis identified four independent sustainability factors: (1) building materials and energy; (2) expenses, return, and flexibility; (3) green space design; and (4) landscape and natural ecology. In the factor analysis, the set of criteria relating to sustainable social infrastructure did not form an independent factor. In total, 76% of the responding institutional investors decided on an S-REF investment, and 38% reported accepting return shortfalls against the REF benchmark. The market acceptance of S-REFs by institutional investors depends on cognitive drivers, institutional context, age, and family status of investors. These results can inform the design of S-REFs, marketing strategies, and sustainability ratings.

M.; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.; Basha, Ismail			BOT viability model for large-scale infrastructure projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						build/operate/transfer; infrastructure; decision support systems; construction management	TENDER	The key to a successful implementation of a build-operate-transfer (BOT) infrastructure project is in-depth analysis of all aspects related to economic, environmental, social, political, legal, and financial feasibility of the project. For these reasons, the analysis of the project feasibility decision needs a technique to include the qualitative decision factors that have a strong impact on the project. This paper aims to introduce a decomposed evaluation model developed to assess the most common significant decision factors that strongly affect the feasibility of BOT projects. The paper describes the viability decision factors that were identified and screened with the assistance of a group of industry experts. This analysis yielded 21 significant factors that would have a certain impact on the feasibility of any BOT project. These factors were classified into three relative categories forming the structure of the suggested project viability model. This model presents a new approach, based on the analytical hierarchy process technique, to evaluate the relationships between decision factors related to project feasibility determination. The new approach has been validated by information obtained from three case studies of BOT projects. The proposed approach to project feasibility evaluation aims to increase the decision maker's ability to determine the factors contributing the most to the viability to the BOT project at hand.

This paper describes the application and evaluation of more visual energy feedback techniques (carbon mapping, thermal imaging) at different scales, alongside traditional methods (web-based energy and environmental visualization platform, home energy reports) delivered through community workshops, home visits and the internet, across six low-carbon communities in the UK. Overall, most of the feedback approaches were able to engage and raise awareness amongst the householders. Whilst carbon mapping was felt to be aimed more at community groups and local councils by providing evidence of past and future community action, displaying carbon maps at community workshops helped to show that others were also engaged in energy action. Thermal imaging was successful in engaging individual local residents through both community workshops and home visits, especially when included in the home energy reports. This stimulated discussions on future energy savings through building fabric upgrade. However, the data-driven web-based platform had limited uptake due to online log-in requirement and information overload. Such insights are useful for those involved in scaling up the deployment of energy feedback to encourage energy demand reduction.

The survey was conducted in a mixture of air-conditioned, evaporative-cooled and naturally ventilated classrooms in nine schools located in three distinct subtropical climate zones during the summer of 2013. A total of 2850 questionnaires were collected from both primary (grade) and secondary (high) schools. An indoor operative temperature of about 22.5 degrees C was found to be the students' neutral and preferred temperature, which is generally cooler than expected for adults under the same thermal environmental conditions. Despite the lower-than-expected neutrality, the school children demonstrated considerable adaptability to indoor temperature variations, with one thermal sensation unit equating to approximately 4 degrees C operative temperature. Working on the industry-accepted assumption that an acceptable range of indoor operative temperatures corresponds to group mean thermal sensations of -0.85 through to +0.85, the present analysis indicates an acceptable summertime range for Australian students from 19.5 to 26.6 degrees C. The analyses also revealed between-school differences in thermal sensitivity, with students in locations exposed to wider weather variations showing greater thermal adaptability than those in more equable weather districts.

As a result, the Chinese government is promoting prefabricated buildings (PBs) but many difficulties occur during promotion of prefabrication. One of the most effective ways to overcome these difficulties is to study the factors affecting the motivation of adopting PBs and their relationships, which has rarely been studied by previous literature. In this paper, 13 critical factors affecting the choice of adopting prefabrication were identified by reviewing literature and interviewing experts. A hierarchical graph of factors was obtained through interpretative structural modelling (ISM). It can be concluded that ?safety?, ?quality?, ?cost?, ?schedule?, ?corporate image? and ?environmental benefits? are direct factors. ?Supply capacity of component factory?, ?structure type?, ?capacity of the contractor?, ?transportation of components? and ?function of project? are indirect factors. ?Project height? and ?project size? are fundamental factors. Through using the Matriced? Impacts Croise?s Multiplication Appliquee a UN Classement (MICMAC), factors were classified into two groups based on their driving power and dependence. This research states the benefits of PBs in detail such as schedule, quality and safety and offers a comprehensive view on factors.

Voluntary actions to reduce the emissions from construction practices have rarely received attention from contractors because eco-construction methods tend to incur extra project costs and induce the bidders' concern to lose the bidding competitions. This study developed an incentive procurement system named Green Road Incentive Procurement (GRIP) to persuade contractors to adopt environmental-friendly construction methods. Initially, GRIP proposed six highly potential alternative construction methods of emission reduction for which bidders could choose as their preference. To ensure the acceptance and collaboration of this new GRIP, a survey study was conducted on two directly involved parties of road construction projects, contractors and public owners, which were selected as a sample group. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to evaluate an opinion by three options based on eight criteria. The results showed that both contractors and the public owners gave the highest weighted scores for the GRIP full implementation alternative. The users' readiness was an AHP criterion, which both parties were mutually concerned as the highest significance. These results confirmed that both involved parties agreed with the concept of GRIP and were pleased to cooperate with the GRIP implementation.

J	Kaminsky, J; Javernick-Will, A				Kaminsky, Jessica; Javernick-Will, Amy			Theorizing the Internal Social Sustainability of Sanitation Organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sanitation; Legitimacy; Organizations; Developing communities; Decoupling; Social sustainability; Organizational issues	COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; LEGITIMACY; PROJECTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Onsite household sanitation technologies such as septic tanks or latrines serve a large percentage of the world's population. Unfortunately, they experience high failure rates after construction, with resulting environmental and public health consequences. Previous work has suggested that these failures are often a result of an inability to navigate the technology-society nexus. In other words, they represent problems of social sustainability. In order to address this urgent problem, theory is built regarding the social sustainability of infrastructure systems by leveraging established organizational theory. To do this, household level interview data is collected in four communities in rural Bangladesh. Virtually all households in this research population have constructed onsite sanitation systems, typically using their own resources. However, almost half of these systems have since fallen into disrepair, mirroring the high socially based failure rates cited globally from similar systems. Using cross-case qualitative analysis and legitimacy theory, the writers explored what differentiates those households that continue to use and maintain sanitation systems (those with socially sustainable systems) from those that do not (those with socially unsustainable systems). Households in the unsustainable group have adopted toilets ceremonially, with construction decoupled from the actual practice of maintaining and using the sanitation system. Understanding infrastructure abandonment as a form of organizational decoupling gives researchers a new way to analyze and try to solve the problem of postconstruction infrastructure abandonment. Specifically, effectiveness concerns (whether or not desired infrastructure services are actually achieved) and competing rational myths (beliefs regarding how and why things ought to be done) drive decoupling and lead to abandoned sanitation. In order to recouple sanitation structure and practice for continued use and maintenance of onsite systems, designs should consider both effectiveness and competing rational myths. For example, by requiring odor management technology for all improved sanitation infrastructure, infrastructure effectiveness is improved (by delivering odor management) and also the commonly held rational myth of miasma (odors causing illness) is addressed. Therefore it is suggested that, as researchers revise the almost expired millennium development goals, technologies without odormanagement should be removed from the definition of improved sanitation due to negative contributions to social sustainability. Further, concern with status (likely stemming from community led total sanitation development methods) appears at a similar and high rate in both the socially sustainable and socially unsustainable household groups; it does not differentiate the two groups. Finally, technical support is needed to address effectiveness concerns, share knowledge, and help households move away from ceremonial sanitation adoption and towards locally desired benefits such as improved convenience, odor management, and public health protection.

Space heating demand and heatwave vulnerability: London domestic stock	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building stock; climate change; domestic stock; energy consumption; Geographic Information System (GIS); heat demand; heat-related mortality; overheating; sustainable planning; urban heat island	UK HOUSING STOCK; URBAN; MORTALITY; EMISSION; ENGLAND; ENERGY; EXCESS; IMPACT; ISLAND; WALES	A conceptual framework and methodological approach are developed to understand the potential linkage between urban domestic heat demand and the heatwave vulnerability index, using the London building stock as a case study. A geographic information system (GIS)-based systematic approach towards exploring the impact of the urban built form and the heat island phenomenon on domestic space heating needs and heat-related mortality is demonstrated. The physical properties of individual dwellings were inferred from existing GIS databases as a function of given attributes (such as the form and age of the property). Localized annual heating degree-days (HDD) across London were predicted using a site-specific model. Each dwelling was modelled using a modified version of the steady-state annual domestic energy model. The energy consumption profiles generated were subsequently compared with existing top-down regional energy statistics. In addition, local environmental factors such as built density, green coverage ratio, and land surface temperature were extracted from a combination of GIS and satellite image data sources. By mapping these factors across the Greater London Area, their influence on the risk of heat death during the 2006 heatwave was examined. The model could potentially be utilized to inform urban-scale policies relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the identification of heat-vulnerable population groups across London.

J	Jin, RY; Chen, Q				Jin, Ruoyu; Chen, Qian			Overview of Concrete Recycling Legislation and Practice in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Solid waste management (SWM); Concrete recycling; Sustainability; Questionnaire survey; United States	DEMOLITION WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT	Recycling concrete waste helps reduce the negative environmental impacts of construction activities. Worldwide, concrete recycling rates and available applications for recycled concrete vary widely. A deep understanding of the current status of concrete recycling in individual countries or regions would allow development of applicable and effective strategies for improvement. This empirical research on concrete recycling in the United States consists of two parts: a qualitative study of the legislation, regulation, and practice of solid waste management (SWM) and concrete recycling in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and a questionnaire survey of practitioners' views of concrete recycling in Ohio and California. Based on the qualitative analysis, the studied states and district were grouped into three categories, representing advanced, average, and below-average SWM practices, with the majority of states having average to below-average practice and so being in need of improvement. The survey results showed that practitioners in the two selected states have positive, consistent perceptions of the practice and benefits of and recommended methods for concrete recycling and identified no major difficulties except for a lack of government awareness and support. This research not only provides an updated understanding of concrete recycling legislation and practice but also offers useful strategies for government and industry to work together to promote concrete recycling.

In this study, a comprehensive assessment of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) using RCA as partial or total replacement of coarse aggregate was conducted. Recycled concrete aggregate self-consolidating concrete (RCA-SCC) mixtures with varied water-to-cement (W/C) ratios (0.28-0.46), sand-to-aggregate (S/A) ratios (48-52%), fly ash (FA) contents (20-40%), RCA replacement ratios (0-100%), and water reducer contents (0-1.5%) were designed and tested. 5 groups of the RCA-SCC columns with different W/C and replacement ratios of RCA were also investigated. The slump flow, the J-ring flow and the cubic compressive strength, and the compressive behaviors of the RCA-SCC columns were studied. Results indicated that W/C ratio was the dominant parameter in RCA-SCC mixture, and the failure modes of the RCA-SCC columns were similar to those of the conventional concrete columns. Based on the experimental results, the mechanical performance of RCA-SCC columns was evaluated quantitatively, and a stress-strain relation model for predicting the axial compressive behavior of RCA-SCC column was proposed. This study will provide a reference for the engineering application of the environment-friendly SCC using RCA that are derived from tested or returned concretes with better performance.

The overall aim is to enhance urban sustainability, the process of developing a built environment that meets peoples' needs whilst avoiding unacceptable social or environmental impacts. The system, called the BEQUEST toolkit, consists of modules that present advice on how to make urban development projects more sustainable, how to assess their sustainability and whom to contact for further advice. A glossary of terms related to sustainable urban development (SUD) as well as links to best practice examples and other additional information are also included in the toolkit. The system addresses the issues in a holistic manner and aims to bridge the various scales of urban development from whole urban regions down to buildings and their components and materials. The toolkit has been developed in collaboration with the project's Extranet, an advisory body of more than 100 mainly European professionals and researchers. This group has supported the development of the toolkit through participation in an iterative development process with the core BEQUEST team, addressing the structure of the toolkit and the information that it contains. The Extranet has also tested the system through the Internet, and provided feedback that has led to improvements in the navigational and presentational features of the toolkit and identified areas for future development. The system is a prototype but already demonstrates the usefulness that a full-scale version would possess.

J	Karami, H; Olatunji, OA				Karami, Hamidreza; Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred			Critical overrun causations in marine projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Delay; Marine projects; Reductionism; Schedule overrun; Structural modelling	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTOR SELECTION; COST OVERRUNS; DELAY FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; POWER; OIL	Purpose Delay causations in infrastructure projects are well reported in normative literature. However, very little is known regarding the environment-related causations which can assist in developing mitigation strategies. This study aims to examine critical causations of overruns in marine construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A total of 73 delay factors, grouped into 16 themes, were identified from literature. Data relating to the significance of each factor were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to 151 respondents. A total number of 126 valid responses were retrieved. Reductionist methodology was used to identify the statistical significance of each delay causation. Findings All 73 variables analysed in the study are significant, including communication issues amongst stakeholders, inadequate planning, safety issues, deficient technical instructions and inappropriate management approaches. Others include design and construction issues, issues with project organisational structures, political and cultural factors, environmental uncertainties and complexity in resource management. The study also found estimation errors, owner's attitude, financial issues, delay in approval processes, construction strategies and unavailability of appropriate technologies for the work as influencing factors. These findings are consistent with earlier studies on other forms of projects, but they further confirm that they are very relevant to marine projects. Originality/value Determining delay factors specific to marine construction projects assists stakeholders and project management community in developing dedicated strategies applicable in scheduling to prevent and correct obstructions caused by overruns. Since projects are different in types and sizes, delay observations cannot be generalised.

Replacing human laborers with robotic systems has many advantages such as increased quality, productivity and safety. The current trends in construction with high-rise buildings have accelerated attempts to employ robotic technologies in the construction industry. Recently in South Korea, a robot-based construction automation system for high-rise buildings was finished with successful field application results. This project is composed of a few subprojects involving construction and robot technologies. Among several parts of the project, this paper deals with the development of a robotic transport mechanism administrated by the robot research group of the project. This system consists of a cross-wired lift and a rail sliding mechanism. Each system performs a vertical and horizontal transfer of a robotic beam assembly (RBA) system which is discussed in a companion paper, 'Robot-Based Construction Automation: An Application to Steel Beam Assembly (Part I).' This paper accounts for the designs, functions, specifications and structural analyses of each system and presents an RBA control system, including a human-machine interface to operate the integrated system. The real prototype of the proposed system was manufactured and intensive tests were conducted in a test bed. In addition, a field application test was added for evaluating the feasibility in real construction sites. We showed the possibility of replacing human laborers with the robotic system in high-rise building construction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Framework to evaluate quality performance of green building delivery: construction and operational stage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Green buildings; quality performance; project delivery systems; sustainability; construction quality; operational quality	PROJECTS	Quality performance in construction is the degree of compliance with the specifications against which the work was executed. Green buildings extend the compliance to sustainability-related aspects to ensure that the energy and water consumption is conserved, promote a healthy indoor environmental quality and reducing the detrimental impacts of the construction activities on the environment. The operational stage reflects the construction workmanship and the effectiveness of the design solution to achieve the sustainability requirements through the overall building performance. Procedures for maintenance and overhauling extend the longevity of buildings. Green buildings exhibit underperformance caused by inadequate construction practices and a lack of understanding of the operations and maintenance practices. This research serves to tackle this problem through a comprehensive and forward-looking framework to depict construction- and operation-related quality activities through an integrated definition for the function modeling (IDEF0) process model. Semi-structured interviews and a focus group validate the framework's suitability and its implementation offered revelations from industry practitioners on the factors affecting quality procedures from assigned metrics, liaison of staff from different project lifecycle stages, green building technologies, commissioning and retro-commissioning and impact of project delivery systems adopted especially in isolating operational liaison. The contributions of this work reinforce the impact of quality on the sustainability objectives that a green building is envisioned to serve, and through capturing the pre-, during, and post-construction lifecycle, the compliance and performance quality aspects are combined in a more integrated manner.

J	Ghanbaripour, AN; Sher, W; Yousefi, A				Ghanbaripour, Amir Naser; Sher, Willy; Yousefi, Ariyan			Critical success factors for subway construction projects - main contractors' perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project success; critical success factors; subway projects; construction management	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; PERCEPTION; DESIGN; SECTOR; ATTRIBUTES	Successful subway construction projects involve many socio-economic, cultural and environmental challenges. These projects enhance public convenience, and are complex and uncertain, involving multiple governmental organizations. The critical success factors (CSFs) of these projects have been identified and prioritized from a main contractors' perspective, to enable project managers to prioritize their efforts and concerns. This study sheds light on CSFs in subway construction projects and contributes to the project delivery success literature with an overarching focus on the contractors' perspectives. Our investigation revealed that, for subway construction projects in Iran, goal setting through clear and realistic project goals, project management competency, competent project team, good cultural fit, top management support and adequate funding throughout the project are the top-ranking CSFs. An extensive body of literature is reviewed, and 140 potential success factors are identified. Then, a focus group has been conducted in which the potential CSFs reduced to 39 success factors. The priorities and ranking of the success factors were evaluated according to the views of 63 project managers of subway projects. The correlation coefficients analysis was used to analyze the results, and it revealed that 23 success factors such as goal setting, top management support and PM competency were perceived to be critical by the respondents. No other research has, until now, found the critical factors leading to success in subway construction industry in Iran. The results have been verified against other research done in other countries.

J	Mangun, D; Thurston, DL				Mangun, D; Thurston, DL			Incorporating component reuse, remanufacture, and recycle into product portfolio design	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cost of recycling; design for reuse; personal computer recycling; product portfolios; remanufacturing; reuse		Product take-back laws have been enacted in the Netherlands, and the European Commission is expected to follow suit. The legislation mandates that manufacturers bear the economic burden of collection and disposal of products at the end of their useful lives. Reuse or remanufacturing of some components might be more cost-effective than disposal and provide an opportunity for recovery of their economic value. However, manufacturers have not traditionally engaged in the long-range planning over several product lifecycles that cost-effective reuse or remanufacturing requires. This paper develops a model for incorporating long-range planning for component reuse in product design. The model employs a product portfolio approach based on market segmentation, rather than a single product. The model is embedded in a decision tool that aids in determining when a product should be taken back, and which components should be reused, recycled, or disposed. A case study of a line of personal computers (PCs) demonstrates an implementation of the model. It also shows that if product take-back is mandated, it is in the PC manufacturer's best interest to shift from selling a product to essentially selling a service by controlling when the product is taken back and, thus, effectively creating a leasing program. The portfolio approach creates opportunities for the design engineer to distribute the cost, reliability, and environmental impacts of component reuse, remanufacture, and recycling in such a way that the end result is higher customer satisfaction than designing one product for all customer groups.

This pedagogical practice emphasizes the impacts of BIM, as the digital collaboration platform, on the cross-disciplinary teamwork design through information sharing. This study also focuses on collecting students' perceptions of building information modeling (BIM) effects in integrated project design. Challenges in BIM adoption from AEC students' perspective were identified and discussed, and could spark further research needs. Design/methodology/approach Based on a thorough review of previous pedagogical practices of applying BIM in multiple AEC disciplines, this study adopted a case study of the Solar Decathlon (SD) residential building design as the group project for AEC students to deliver the design work and construction planning. In total 13 different teams within the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each group consisting of final year undergraduate students with backgrounds in architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked to deliver the detailed design of the solar-powered residential house meeting pre-specified project objectives in terms of architectural esthetics, structural integrity, energy efficiency, prefabrication construction techniques and other issues such as budget and scheduling. Each team presented the cross-disciplinary design plan with cost estimate and construction scheduling together within group reports. This pedagogical study collected students' reflective thinking on how BIM affected their design work, and compared their feedback on BIM to that from AEC industry professionals in previous studies. Findings The case study of the SD building project showed the capacity of BIM in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration through information exchange and in enhancing communication across different AEC fields. More sustainable design options were considered in the early architectural design stages through the cross-disciplinary cooperation between architecture and building services engineering. BIM motivated AEC student teams to have a more comprehensive design and construction plan by considering multiple criteria including energy efficiency, budget, and construction activities. Students' reflections indicated both positive effects of BIM (e.g. facilitating information sharing) as well as challenges for further BIM implementation, for example, such as some architecture students' resistance to BIM, and the lack of existing family types in the BIM library, etc. Research limitations/implications Some limitations of the current BIM pedagogy were identified through the student group work. For example, students revealed the problem of interoperability between BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit) and building energy simulation tools. To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case studies, for the purpose of providing professional advice on improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Practical implications To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case study, for the purpose of providing professional advice in improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Originality/value This work provides insights into the information technology applied in the AEC interdisciplinary pedagogy. Students gained the experience of a project-based collaboration and were equipped with BIM capabilities for future employment within the AEC job market. The integrated design approach was embedded throughout the team project process. Overall, this BIM pedagogical practice emphasized the link between academic activities and real-world industrial practice. The pedagogical experience gained in this BIM course could be expanded to future BIM education and research in other themes such as interoperability of building information exchange among different digital tools.

J	Vu, HA; Cu, VH; Min, LX; Wang, JQ				Hong Anh Vu; Viet Hung Cu; Min, Lian Xing; Wang, Jian Qiong			Risk analysis of schedule delays in international highway projects in Vietnam using a structural equation model	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Engineering; Risk management; Methodology; Project management; Construction planning	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CONTRACTORS; SUCCESS	Purpose - As in other developing countries, increased highway development in Vietnam provides enormous opportunities for international construction companies (ICCs). However, a prolonged schedule delay (SD) can have an extremely detrimental impact on a project's efficiency, cost and investment reputation. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential SD risk factors in international highway projects (IHPs) in Vietnam, and to explore the effects of and influences on such factors. A specific risk management framework is proposed as a useful tool for ICCs. Design/methodology/approach - A system of SD risk indicators is presented for IHPs in Vietnam through a questionnaire survey. The system comprises 50 indicators that are grouped into 12 main factors. A structural equation model (SEM) is then used to assess the influences and mechanisms of these factors. Based on the obtained results, corresponding suggestions for preventing SD risks are presented and discussed. Findings - First, among the 12 aforementioned major factors, the authors identify eight facors that have significant effects on IHP SDs. Second, the SEM analysis reveals that policy flaws and the fiscal ability of the owner play the most important roles, on account of their direct and indirect influences on SDs. Originality/value - Considering stakeholders and external environmental effects, a system of indicators is introduced to explore SD risks to IHPs. In particular, an SEM is used to assess the effects of potential SD factors and characterize their interacting influences. This study could help ICCs to avoid or mitigate project delays and cost overruns in Vietnam, and also provide valuable lessons for other developing countries.

However, hindered by various factors, construction has long been recognized as an industry with low innovation. Innovation is essential to the productivity, cost effectiveness, and, more importantly, the sustainable development of any organization and industry. Following rapid globalization, technological advancement, and the trend toward partnering between the public and private sectors, the importance of innovation has increased dramatically for construction firms, particularly for large-size construction firms. However, studies investigating the association between leadership and innovation in the construction context are still rare. Using an innovation climate as a proxy for organizational innovation, this study investigates the effect of leadership on the innovation climate in construction firms. A questionnaire survey was designed and distributed to 300 construction professionals in major (Group C) contractor firms in Hong Kong. A hundred and thirteen valid returns were collected, representing a response rate of 37.7%. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, and structural equation modeling using SPSS version 19 and Lisrel version 8.8. Three leadership factors were identified, namely transformational leadership, development exchange leadership, and corrective avoidant leadership. The results of the structural equation modeling revealed that an innovation climate is predicted positively by transformational leadership and is predicted negatively by development exchange leadership. The results of this study have implications for construction academics and practitioners regarding the importance of leadership to foster innovation in the industry.

Although numerous studies on accident causation models have discussed the correlations of unsafe behaviors with various factors (e.g., unsafe conditions), limited research explores correlations between unsafe behaviors within accidents. The purpose of this paper is mining strong association rules of unsafe behaviors from historical accidents to clarify this kind of tacit knowledge. Design/methodology/approach A case study was adopted as the research approach, in which accident records from building and urban railway construction in China were selected as data resources. The groups of unsafe behaviors extracted from accident records were expressed by the definitions of unsafe behaviors from safety regulations and operating procedures. Frequent Pattern (FP)-Growth algorithm was used for association rule mining, and the critical correlations between unsafe behaviors were represented by the effective strong rules. Findings The findings identify and distinguish correlations between unsafe behaviors within construction accidents. In building construction, workers and managers should pay attention to preventing unsafe behaviors related to personal protective equipment and machines and equipment. In urban railway construction, workers should especially avoid unsafe behaviors of inadequately dealing with environmental factors. Practical implications Tacit knowledge is transferred to explicit knowledge as the critical correlations between unsafe behaviors within accidents are determined by the effective strong rules. Additionally, the findings provide practice guidance for safety management, to collaboratively control unsafe behaviors with strong correlations. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of safety knowledge in construction and provides a further understanding of how construction accidents are caused by multiple unsafe behaviors.

Focusing on ways to mitigate floods and provide a quick response after floods is critical to ensuring fatalities are minimized, along with reducing environmental and economic damages. In the literature, techniques from different domains including remote sensing, machine learning, image processing and data analysis have been explored to manage different tasks related to flood management. This study proposes a new framework that categorizes the recent research that has been conducted on flood management systems. The framework addresses the following significant research questions: (1) What are the major techniques deployed in flood management? (2) What are the phases of flood management which existing studies tend to focus on? (3) What are the systems that are proposed to tackle problems related to flood management? (4) What are the research gaps identified in the literature when it comes to deploying technology for flood management? A classification framework for flood management has been proposed to group the various technologies reviewed. Lack of hybrid models, which combine image processing and machine learning, for flood management was observed. In addition, the application of machine learning-based methods in the post-disaster scenario was found to be limited. Thus, future efforts need to focus on combining disaster management knowledge, image processing techniques and machine learning tools to ensure effective and holistic disaster management across all phases.

Dynamic shading systems: A review of design parameters, platforms and evaluation strategies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Geometries; Mechanisms; Control systems; Dynamic shading systems; Responsive architecture	ENERGY PERFORMANCE; DAYLIGHTING SYSTEM; OFFICE BUILDINGS; VISUAL COMFORT; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; DEVICES; FACADES; OPERATION; SUPPORT	The advancements in software and hardware technologies provide opportunities for solar shading systems to function dynamically within their context. This development has helped dynamic shading systems respond to variable environmental parameters such as sun angles and solar insolation. However, the technical understanding of system design, mechanism and controlling methods presents a challenge for architects and designers. Therefore, this study aims to review the current applications and trends of dynamic shading systems to clarify the potentials and limitations in enhancing system performance based on integrated design objectives. This study assessed several systems on the basis of a critical review to identify different models, applications and methodologies. This study is divided into two main sections: (i) design elements and platforms that engage with specific methods in creating a dynamic shading system and (ii) evaluation strategies to examine system performance. The systems were investigated based on the multiplicity and integration of the parameters involved through various components, such as architectural, mechanical, operational and automation components. The review analysed various studies on the following two bases: (1) geometric-based analysis, which distinguishes between simple and complex shading models, and (2) performance-based analysis, which assesses the shading systems based on two groups of methodologies, namely, theoretical and experimental. The outcome of the review reflects a clear classification of shading models and a comprehensive analysis of their performance. This study generally provides a systematic framework for architects based on thorough research and investigation. Finally, the study introduced several findings and recommendations to improve the performance of dynamic shading systems.

J	Elshaboury, N; Marzouk, M				Elshaboury, Nehal; Marzouk, Mohamed			Optimizing construction and demolition waste transportation for sustainable construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction and demolition wastes; Transportation; Optimization; Multiple criteria decision making; Group decision making; Sensitivity analysis	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; LIFE-CYCLE; MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; SELECTION; GENERATION; COLLECTION; ENTROPY	Purpose There have been numerous efforts to tackle the problem of accumulated construction and demolition wastes worldwide. In this regard, this study develops a model for identifying the optimum fleet required for waste transportation. The proposed model is validated through a case study from the construction sector in New Cairo, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach Various fleet combinations are assessed against the time, cost, energy and emissions generated from waste transportation. Genetic algorithm optimization is performed to select the near-optimum solutions. Complex proportional assessment and operational competitiveness rating analysis decision-making techniques are applied to rank Pareto frontier solutions. These rankings are aggregated using an ensemble approach based on the half-quadratic theory. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the most sensitive attribute. Findings The results reveal that the optimum fleet required for construction and demolition wastes (CDW) transportation consists of one wheel loader of bucket capacity 2.5 cubic meters and nine trucks of capacity 22 cubic meters. Furthermore, consensus index and trust level of 0.999 are obtained for the final ranking. This indicates that there is a high level of agreement between the rankings. Moreover, the most sensitive criterion (i.e. energy) is identified using a sensitivity analysis. Originality/value This study proposes an efficient and effective construction and demolition waste transportation strategy that will lead to economic gains and protect the environment. It aims to select the optimum fleet required for waste transportation based on economic, social and environmental aspects. The usefulness of this study is establishing a consensual decision through the aggregation of conflicting decision makers' preferences in waste transportation and management.

Integrating Worker Health and Safety into Sustainable Design and Construction: Designer and Constructor Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Safety risk; Prevention through Design (PtD); Research methods; Statistical analysis; Sustainable construction		Sustainable building design and construction is gaining rapid growth within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency of building projects by incorporating efficient and effective materials, technologies, and strategies into the building process. However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The potential for infrastructure and urban improvement remains unrealized, however, due to technical, financial, and social constraints and criticisms that limit the implementation of smart cities concepts for infrastructure management. The discussion presented here provides a review of smart technologies including sensors, crowdsourcing and citizen science, actuators, data transmission, Internet of Things, big data analytics, data visualization, and blockchain, which can be used for infrastructure management. Smart infrastructure programs are reviewed to explore how enabling technologies have been applied across civil engineering domains, including transportation systems, water systems, air quality, energy infrastructure, solid waste management, construction engineering and management, structures, and geotechnical systems. Gaps in the application of smart technologies for infrastructure systems are identified, and we highlight how the civil engineering profession can adopt new roles toward the development of smart cities applications. These roles are: (1) master designer: civil engineers can identify ready applications of enabling technologies to improve the delivery of urban resources and services; (2) steward: civil engineers must account for both the environmental and societal impacts of smart infrastructure applications; (3) innovator and integrator: civil engineers should integrate across diverse sectors and groups of experts to develop smart infrastructure programs; (4) manager of risk: civil engineers should manage existing and growing risks of natural disasters, emergencies, and climate change; they should also manage new vulnerabilities in the privacy and security of individuals and households that are introduced through smart technologies; and (5) leader and decision maker: civil engineers can take a lead in smart infrastructure discussions and policy development.

Thomas; Skitmore, Martin			Modeling Multi-Stakeholder Multi-Objective Decisions during Public Participation in Major Infrastructure and Construction Projects: A Decision Rule Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public participation; Multi-stakeholder multi-objective decision making; Conflict analysis; Consensus building; Major infrastructure and construction projects; Quantitative methods	ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM; CONFLICT-ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT	Major infrastructure and construction (MIC) projects are those with significant traffic or environmental impact, of strategic and regional significance and high sensitivity. The decision-making process of schemes of this type is becoming ever more complicated, especially with the increasing number of stakeholders involved and their growing tendency to defend their own varied interests. Failing to address and meet the concerns and expectations of stakeholders may result in project failures. To avoid this necessitates a systematic participatory approach to facilitate decision making. Though numerous decision models have been established in previous studies (e.g.,ELECTRE methods, the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process) their applicability in the decision process during stakeholder participation in contemporary MIC projects is still uncertain. To resolve this, the decision rule approach is employed for modeling multi-stakeholder multi-objective project decisions. Through this, the result is obtained naturally according to the rules accepted by any stakeholder involved. In this sense, consensus is more likely to be achieved because the process is more convincing and the result is more easily accepted by all concerned. Appropriate rules, comprehensive enough to address multiple objectives while straightforward enough to be understood by multiple stakeholders, are set for resolving conflict and facilitating consensus during the project decision process. The West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) project is used as a demonstration case and a focus group meeting is conducted in order to confirm the validity of the model established. The results indicate that the model is objective, reliable and practical enough to cope with real world problems. Finally, a suggested future research agenda is provided.

J	Chen, YL; Yin, YL; Browne, GJ; Li, DH				Chen, Yilin; Yin, Yilin; Browne, Glenn J.; Li, Dahui			Adoption of building information modeling in Chinese construction industry The technology-organization-environment framework	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; Construction industry; Adoption; Building information modelling; Technology-organization-environment framework	EDI ADOPTION; LIFE-CYCLE; BIM; INNOVATION; BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS; IMPLEMENTATION; ARCHITECTURE; ANTECEDENTS	Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is recognized as a major innovation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Understanding the factors that influence the AEC's adoption of BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study provides empirical evidence for the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of Chinese construction industry. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach. Findings - The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more likely to adopt BIM. Originality/value - One of the first to apply the TOE framework to integrate three groups of factors that may explain BIM adoption in China. Such a comprehensive framework provides a much broader perspective of BIM adoption to evaluate the impacts of different antecedent factors. The authors conducted an empirical study based on survey data collected from two different types of companies, i.e., engineering consulting firms and construction firms, representing the two parties in the principal-agent relationship of a construction project. One of the first to apply a sophisticated statistical approach, i.e., partial least squares, to analyze the data in the BIM literature.

This is particularly so in 3-D and 4-D scenarios, What we describe here is a technique, which tackles this and associated problems. The technique is founded in the idea of quad-tesseral addressing; a technique, which was originally applied to the analysis of atomic structures. It is based on ideas concerning Hierarchical clustering developed in the 1960s and 1970s to improve data access time [G.M. Morton, A computer oriented geodetic database and a new technique on file sequencing, IBM Canada, 1996.], and on atomic isohedral (same shape) tiling strategies developed in the 1970s and 1980s concerned with group theory [B. Grunbaum, G.C. Shephard, Tilings and Patterns, Freeman, New York, 1987.]. The technique was first suggested as a suitable representation for GIS in the early 1980s when the two strands were brought together and a tesseral arithmetic applied [F.C. Holdroyd, The Geometry of Tiling Hierarchies, Ars Combanitoria 16B (1983) 211-244.; S.B.M. Bell, B.M. Diaz, F.C. Holroyd, M.J.J. Jackson, Spatially referenced methods of processing raster and vector data, Image and Vision Computing 1 (4) (1983) 211-220.; Diaz, S.B.M. Bell, Spatial Data Processing Using Tesseral Methods, Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, 1986.]. Here, we describe how that technique can equally be applied to the analysis of environmental interaction with built forms. The way in which the technique deals with the problems described is first to linearise the three-dimensional (3-D) space being investigated. Then, the reasoning applied to that space is applied within the same environment as the definition of the problem data. We show, with an illustrative example, how the technique can be applied. The problem then remains of how to visualise the results of the analysis so undertaken. We show how this has been accomplished so that the 3-D space and the results are represented in a way which facilitates rapid interpretation of the analysis, which has been carried out.

NICE's Indirect Coal-to-Liquid Process for Producing Clean Transportation Fuels Using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; tail gas recycle; simulations; process design	CATALYST; KINETICS; REACTOR; MODEL	China is currently the world's top coal consumer and the largest oil importer to sustain its rising economy and meet the mounting demand for transportation fuels. However, the increasing emissions due to the huge fossil fuels consumption, coupled with oil market instability, could derail China's economic growth and jeopardize its national energy security. To face such a hurdle, China has been aggressively supporting low-carbon businesses opportunuties over the past decade, has recently announced several plans to cap coal utilization, and is currently the biggest investor in clean energy technologies. Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) is one of the most promising clean coal technologies, offering an ideal solution that can meet China's energy demands and environmental expectations. It is widely known that the Shenhua Group has pioneered and is currently leading the commercialization of the Direct Coal Liquefaction (DCL) process in China. This paper highlights a part of the joint research effort undertaken by the National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy (NICE) and University of Pittsburgh in order to develop and commercialize the Indirect Coal Liquefaction (ICL) process. In this mission, NICE has built and operated an ICL plant including a large-scale (5.8-m ID and 30-m height) Slurry-Bubble-Column Reactor (SBCR) for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using iron catalyst. The research, conducted at the University of Pittsburgh over the past few years, allowed building a user-friendly Simulator, based on a comprehensive SBCR model integrated with Aspen Plus and is validated using data from the NICE actual ICL plant. In this paper, the Simulator predictions of the performance of the NICE SBCR, operating with iron and cobalt catalysts under four different tail gas recycle strategies: (1) direct recycle; (2) using a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit; (3) using a reformer; and (4) using a Chemical looping Combustion (CLC) process, are presented. It should be mentioned also that our joint research effort has laid the foundation for the design of a commercial-scale SBCR for producing one-million tons per annum of environmentally friendly and ultraclean (no sulfur, no nitrogen and virtually no aromatics) transportation fuels, which could greatly contribute to ensuring China's national energy security while curbing its lingering emission problems.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the completion of a MiC-based 1000-bed hospital in Wuhan, China, in less than a month, has made the world, especially sophisticated economies, 'talking' about this new technology. However, MiC is an ultra-modern technology that has both its merits and demerits; balancing out between them to maximize the opportunities that MiC has to offer needs insightful decision-making from higher authorities. Therefore, there is a vital need to understand and analyze the two contrasting but related matters, 'benefits and challenges of MiC' to help decision-makers in formulating better strategies based on informed choices. Past studies on MiC reported benefits in terms of time, cost, quality, safety, and environmental and social impacts, however, lack a holistic synthesis of MiC benefits by considering data from both the literature and real case studies. Whereas, the assessment methodologies used to prioritize MiC challenges did not consider the hierarchical nature of these challenges and their relative importance, which in turn impact the prioritization accuracy. This study contributed to bridging these gaps. Firstly, MiC benefits have been extensively explored by adopting a mixed research approach integrating literature synthesis, structured discussions, and real case studies. Then, a list of challenges was explored through literature synthesis and further validated and shortlisted through the first set of interviews from MiC experts. The second set of interviews was aimed mainly at evaluating the performance of MiC and providing recommendations for improvement from the international perspective. The interviews revealed that MiC should be treated as a long-term strategy and would not necessarily be a cheaper option in the short run, however, it would be a revolution in terms of time, quality, sustainability, safety, and life-cycle costs. Following the interviews, a questionnaire survey was conducted to prioritize the challenges using the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) approach, namely, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), considering the hierarchical nature of challenges and their relative importance. The 'road network capacity' was found to be the most critical challenge. Finally, case studies were further carried out to reveal the measures that were adopted to mitigate the challenges in three international MiC projects. This research provides an interesting insight into the positive and negative aspects of using MiC for interested governments and construction stakeholders. It is anticipated that the benefits shall outweigh the drawbacks in the long run.
