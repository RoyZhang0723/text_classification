J	Hu, Y; Liu, MQ; Le, Y; Skitmore, M				Hu, Yi; Liu, Mingqiang; Le, Yun; Skitmore, Martin			External Consultant Involvement for Organizational Capability Building in Complex Construction Projects: A Perspective from Interorganizational Learning Process	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						External consultant; Complex construction project (CCP); Organizational capability; Management innovation	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE SEARCH; MEDIATING ROLE; PERFORMANCE	External management consultants have been increasingly employed by owners of complex construction projects (CCPs) to foster management innovation and improve their organizational capability. However, the dynamics of the owner-consultant collaboration process in such projects are still unknown. To bridge this gap, this paper explores the roles of external consultant involvement in fostering management innovation and developing an organizational capability in CCPs. Based on survey data collected from 102 such projects across different types in China, the partial least square-structural equation modeling analysis results uncover the positive effect of external consultant involvement in creating management innovation and building organizational capability. In particular, the mediating role of management innovation is identified in the exploration and transformation learning processes with external consultants involved. The findings of this study provide a novel explanation for the creation of management innovation in CCPs through external consultant involvement and useful guidance to project owners to better identify and utilize external consultants in the future.

Here, we study knowledge sharing when employees of the focal firm cooperate with external consultants. We differentiate between "in-group" (inside an employment category) and "out-group" (between employment categories) knowledge sharing and analyze the antecedents of knowledge sharing behavior. In an empirical study of 117 employees and external consultants, we find strong support for the main hypotheses: Internal employees tend to engage in more knowledge sharing than external consultants, in their relation to employees. Employees tend to engage in less knowledge sharing than external consultants, in their relation to external consultants. Trust in relation to a specific category of employment was also found to be statistically related to knowledge sharing behavior toward personnel in the category. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

They are responsible for ensuring that the technical specifications and design standards of mechanical, electrical and plumbing aspects of construction projects are adhered to with due consideration to budget and schedule. The quality of services offered by these consultants have however become a source of worry to clients recently in Nigeria as reflected in variance in the quality of services they render. This study examined clients' assessment of service quality of consultant services engineers in building project delivery. The study adopted survey research design with a total 121 responses obtained from target respondents using structured questionnaire administered to clients' organizations. The study adapted the 22 SERVQUAL service quality variables from literature. The study discovered that client's expectation of service quality of building services consultant exceeded the actual perceived service in building project delivery. Clients are unimpressed with the ability of the consultants to show sincere interest, provision of services at the time promised, the ability to give client specialized services relating to MEP and willingness to help client. Out of date software is being used and clients are rarely satisfied with consultants' responsiveness and assurance. It is imperative for service consultants to understand client's expectations and ensure such needs are met in the construction delivery process in order to ensure the service quality gap is eliminated. Finally, there is the need for consultants to be conscientious by timeously responding to all instructions and requests of clients as well as improve reputation which will ultimately pay off in project outcome.

J	Avila, EA				Avila, EA			Demystifying the local agency procurement and selection process for professional engineering consultant services	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Local agency procurement and selection of professional engineering consultant services has often been a misunderstood process. Consultants often wonder why they fail to be selected and wonder what mysterious process is used by local agencies to make their selection. These questions may be best answered by evaluating the common fundamentals used by consultants that are successful in this process: (1) they know their client (and, their client knows them); (2) they provide a well-qualified team; (3) they develop a well-defined project approach that reflects their knowledge of the common partnering approach used by local agencies to complete key project work elements; and (4) they communicate effectively. The true mystery regarding local agency procurement of professional engineering consultant services is how often these fundamentals are overlooked by a consultant's management team during statement of qualifications, proposal, and interview preparation. Perhaps it is time to revisit them.

The study included an examination of whether the civil engineering consultants' advice on CPPSs and CPPSs services fulfilled the client's needs and also the degree to which the client's project requirements were being met. The selection criteria used by civil engineering consultants when choosing an appropriate procurement system was investigated. Also included in the study was an investigation into the degree to which civil engineering consultants communicate and inform clients of the range of CPPSs available to them. A postal questionnaire survey was administered to the clients (property developers) and civil engineering consultants in South Africa's Western Cape Province. The results show that civil engineering consultants are unaware of or underinformed about the various construction project procurement systems available. Their selection criteria for procurement systems is based on biased past experience and conservative choices, with the result that incorrect decisions with unfortunate consequences are made.

J	Liao, XF; Lee, CY; Chong, HY				Liao, Xiaofeng; Lee, Cen Ying; Chong, Heap-Yih			Contractual practices between the consultant and employer in Chinese BIM-enabled construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						International construction; Case study; Project management; Construction; Building information modelling; International practice		Purpose The management of building information modeling (BIM)-enabled construction projects is challenging and unstructured in nature, particularly in terms of contract administration. Even though previous studies have revealed various legal issues related to BIM, little is known regarding the contractual practices of BIM. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the contractual practices between the BIM consultant and employer in detail. Design/methodology/approach An explanatory case study was carried out on four large BIM-enabled construction projects in China. Findings The contractual practices differed from one project to another in terms of ownership and intellectual property rights (IPRs) of the BIM model, roles of the BIM consultant, liability of the BIM consultant in the event of errors and delays of the BIM model, and BIM-related costs and payments. Some of the interesting findings are as follows: the employer shall retain the ownership and IPRs of the BIM model, the BIM consultant shall provide a warranty to ensure usability of the BIM model after project handover, the BIM consultant shall pay for damages or losses if the BIM model fails to deliver and the costs of BIM implementation shall be borne by both contracting parties. Originality/value This study provides a fresh, realistic insight on the development of plausible contractual practices between the BIM consultant and employer and the findings can be used to improve BIM contract protocols in future projects.

J	Tang, SL; Aoieong, RTM; Tsui, CSL				Tang, S. L.; Aoieong, Raymond T. M.; Tsui, Candy S. L.			Quality Culture Auditing for Engineering Consultants	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Design is one of the most important aspects in the engineering project cycle. To improve the quality of engineering consulting firms, various quality techniques and practices have been proposed by researchers. Most researchers agree that the successful implementation of such quality practices depends on the quality culture of the consultant organization. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the overall quality culture that exists in a consultant organization is essential. The purpose of this paper is to develop a pragmatic tool, a quality culture auditing (QCA) questionnaire, which enables engineering consulting firms to measure the quality culture quantitatively through a scoring system. The responses obtained from 30 engineering consulting firms that participated in the QCA show that the scores obtained can be a good indicator of a consultant organization's current quality culture. Using these results as the basis, benchmarking exercises and parametric studies can also be conducted. Through the use of QCA, an engineering consultant can pinpoint areas of weakness so that more effort can be put into these areas for future improvement.	[Aoieong, Raymond T.

J	Enshassi, A; Arain, F; Al-Raee, S				Enshassi, Adnan; Arain, Faisal; Al-Raee, Sadi			CAUSES OF VARIATION ORDERS IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE GAZA STRIP	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						variation orders; construction; contractors; consultant; owner		The maximum project performance would be achieved if the work invariably flows smoothly within time limits and anticipated budget. Variation orders result in time delay, cost overrun, quality defects, and other negative impacts. This is common in construction projects in Gaza Strip. The main objective of this study was to analyze the causes of variation orders in construction projects in Gaza Strip. The causes of variation orders in construction process in Gaza Strip were investigated through questionnaire survey of 36 classified construction companies, 25 consultants and 15 owners. 64 causes of variation orders were identified from literature review. The study results identified the top ten most important factors that include lack of materials and equipment spare parts due to closure, change in design by consultant, lack of consultant's knowledge of available materials, errors and omission in design, conflicts between contract documents, owner's financial problems, lack of coordination among project parties, using inadequate specification for local markets by international consultant, internal politics, and change is specification by owners. In general, the study shows an agreement among owners, consultants and contractors regarding the ranking of the 64 factors causing variation orders. The results also reveal that factors related to consultant are the most important causes of variation orders followed by the factors related to owner. An understanding of the causes of variation orders would be helpful for building professionals in assessing variation orders. Furthermore, the study would also assist professionals in taking proactive measures for reducing variation orders in construction projects. The findings from this study would also be valuable for all construction professionals in general.

J	BISHOP, JC; MADDEN, EC				BISHOP, JC; MADDEN, EC			ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT TRIANGLE	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								There are complex and unforeseen difficulties with owner and architect/engineer relationships over long distances. Where the technical support to the owner is not readily available, both owner and consultant need to be more sensitive to each other's needs. A lack of communication skills and experience by both parties, budgetary constraints, and unforeseen conditions can result in failure, unless the project managers understand the need for special consideration of these problems. The key is communication-not only receiving directions but also recognizing the professional experiences of both parties and developing a trust and understanding of each other's position. The triangular relationship of cost, efficiency, and accuracy must be understood and negotiated before the project starts so that both owner and consultant understand the scope of work and the cost of the project. For the inexperienced engineering manager or consultant unfamiliar with remote sites, this relationship can strain the professionalism of both parties. This paper describes the engineer-consultant management pitfalls inherent in long-distance project management and any added costs, and provides ''dos and don'ts'' to manage a technical consultant or project by long-distance. Understanding the project triangle is the key.	WINCE CORTHEL BRYSON,KENAI,AK 99611								2	0	0	0	3	ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENG	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398	0742-597X			J MANAGE ENG	J.

J	Wen, Q; Qiang, MS; An, N				Wen, Qi; Qiang, Maoshan; An, Nan			Collaborating with Construction Management Consultants in Project Execution: Responsibility Delegation and Capability Integration	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management consultant; Capability integration; Responsibility delegation; Process capability; Organizational issues	PERFORMANCE; COMPETENCE; QUALITY; RISKS; MODEL	The professional consultancy services provided by construction management consultants (CMC) are important supplements to clients' management of project execution. However, CMCs' services, if not carefully managed, cannot bring salient contributions. This paper aims to empirically examine how clients' delegation to CMCs affects client-consultant capability integration in project management processes. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a conceptual capability integration model was developed. A triangulated approach was adopted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Social network analysis (SNA) and case analysis provide exploratory evidence on the capability integration model. Partial least square based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses tested the model hypotheses statistically. The results suggest that both clients' and CMCs' capabilities contribute to project management processes, although clients' contributions are more significant. Delegating more responsibilities to CMCs better utilizes their capabilities and at the same time does not restrict clients' contributions. Theoretically, these findings provide empirical support to the theory of temporal project organization and map the client-consultant collaboration interface. In practice, clients should better utilize CMCs' capabilities by designing appropriate responsibility delegation systems based on the revealed capability integration mechanism.

J	Moschandreas, J; Yoon, SH; Demirev, D				Moschandreas, J.; Yoon, Sung-Hoon; Demirev, Darina			Validation of the indoor environmental quality conceptual model	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building assessment; consultant comparison; environmental indices; indoor environment; model validation; occupant symptoms; offices	BUILDING OCCUPANTS; AIR-POLLUTION; SYMPTOMS; INDEX	The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) conceptual model is validated with an independent consultant generated database that was not used for its formulation. The model uses the Indoor Environmental Index (IEI) to assess the IEQ and select among three management options. IEI values are either calculated using measured environmental variables or predicted by a simple linear regression model with the Percent of Occupants with Two or More Persistent Symptoms (POPS2) index as the independent variable. Responses to a questionnaire determine POPS2 values. The paper investigates if the predicted IEI values lead to the same IEQ management decisions as the expensive calculated IEI values. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between predicted and calculated IEI values. The second objective examines the consultant effect on environmental stressor and IEI measurements by testing the null hypothesis of no difference among consultants. The difference between the calculated and predicted IEI values is not statistically significant and the inexpensive predicted values can be used for management purposes. The consultant effect on IEI values is statistically significant but interpreted to have no practical importance because it does not affect selection of management options. Consequently, it is argued that the conceptual model can be used as a proactive management tool that may be used to improve and maintain IEQ.

J	Yiu, CY; Ho, HK; Lo, SM; Hu, BQ				Yiu, CY; Ho, HK; Lo, SM; Hu, BQ			Performance evaluation for cost estimators by reliability interval method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; SYSTEM	Most consultant selection models stress the importance of past performance. However, there are so far very few studies on evaluating consultant's performance. It hampers the whole process of the selection model. This paper tries to establish a systematic approach in developing a consultant's performance evaluation model for the evaluation of the performance of cost estimators in the construction industry of Hong Kong. Nominal group technique is adopted in identifying the decision criteria for the evaluation, and a reliability interval method (RIM) is developed to assess the importance weighting of each criterion. The RIM allows statistical analysis and fuzzy assessment of the weight. The results report the weights of each decision criterion and its subcriterion in evaluating cost estimator's performance. Interestingly, the results show that traditional functions of cost estimator are the least treasured from the clients. Proactive and professional advice is considered to be much more important. The study is highly relevant to industry practitioners in assessing performance of costs estimators, as well as to researchers in further developing the consultant selection model.

This study aims to develop a prequalification model that can serve as the basis for revising the existing regulations and criteria. The authors conducted interviews among experts to localize a framework of prequalification criteria. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), accompanied by a survey among industry participants, was used to determine the importance level of decision criteria. The results confirmed that the existing guidelines cannot meet the expectations of the industry due to the overemphasis on the past performance of consultants and disregarding their current capabilities. For the international audience, this study clarifies that (1)the working culture of industry participants impacts their judgments on the importance level of intangible and tangible criteria used for prequalification processes, (2)short-listing consultants for long-term and fragmented data collection in national registration or project prequalification should be avoided, and (3)researchers must test FAHP models with different fuzzy scales because the success of the widely used fuzzy extent analysis method is highly dependent on the scale of fuzzy functions and judgments of decision makers.

In this context, the major objective of this research is to explore the key factors influencing trust in different stages of a construction project from the perspectives of owners and consultants involved in a Sino-German eco-park in China. The analytic network process (ANP) was employed to assess which factors are most closely related to trust and to establish four models to meet the objective of this study. According to the ANP results, trust is strongly influenced by factors that are associated with the mutual interests between owners and consultants. In addition, there are certain differences in the priority of the factors influencing initial trust between owners and consultants, but these gaps gradually decrease over time. The weight of guanxi also decreases over time, and the owners' and consultants' guanxi transforms from out-group to in-group focused.

J	Chow, LK; Ng, ST				Chow, Lai Kit; Ng, S. Thomas			A fuzzy gap analysis model for evaluating the performance of engineering consultants	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						consultant performance; performance evaluation; fuzzy membership functions; gap analysis	QUALITY; DESIGN	Evaluating the performance of Engineering Consultants (ECs) is a major challenge as the process involves a number of subjective elements. However, as performance is an important dimension for prequalifying and selecting ECs, it would be helpful if relevant data can be solicited from various clients. The diversity in the Consultant Performance Evaluation (CPE) criteria and the interpretation of performance levels amongst various assessors would undoubtedly undermine the reliability and transparency of CPE. In this paper, a fuzzy gap analysis model is proposed to improve the practice of CPE. The study begins by identifying a list of CPE criteria and their corresponding quantitative indicators for the design stage of a project. Considering the performance levels for each of the quantitative indicators could be interpreted by assessors differently, an empirical survey is conducted to identify a range of possible values within each of the 'poor', 'average', 'good', 'very good' and 'excellent' performance levels. The fuzzy gap analysis CPE model is proposed to facilitate assessors to compare the client's expectation and actual service quality of an EC. The model proposed in this paper is not only novel but could also improve the fairness and transparency of this type of decision under an increasingly collaborative environment.

This paper presents the results of a questionnaire conducted to identify and evaluate the relative importance of the significant factors contributing to the Gas-Oil construction industry of Iran as a case study for developing countries. The survey respondents included project owners, contractors and consultants involved in Iranian Gas-Oil construction projects. The results of the survey revealed that the main causes of cost overrun in this industry include inaccurate cost estimations, improper planning, frequent design changes, inadequate labour/skill availability, inflation of costs of machinery, labour, raw material and transportation prices. The first three factors are the project consultants' responsibility and the appointment of qualified consultants and personnel training are strongly recommended to alleviate cost overrun. The paper also reviews and compares findings of a set of similar researches in a number of developing countries.

PROJECT DELAY: KEY ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION FACTORS IN HONG KONG	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						building; construction; consultant; contractor; delay; electrical	PERFORMANCE	The price of construction project delays is too substantial to pay. Electrical construction is a critical activity influencing project completion, but research on its delay factors was limited. Aimed at contributing knowledge to this niche area, a study was conducted in Hong Kong. 56 delay factors, in 10 groups, were found with electrical construction. Processing the data of a survey on 64 consultants and 68 contractors revealed "insufficient labour", "late decision making of client" and "insufficient electrical contractor" as the top delay factors. Strong agreements on the importance rankings of the delay factors existed between the consultant and contractor groups, and the principal factor components were "incompetent project team members", "lack of skillful labour" and "poor on-site planning". Besides discussing the common problems underlying the delay factors, recommendations were made for avoiding the problems. An understanding of the delay factors would help construction stake-holders in taking proactive measures to prevent project delay. The approach of the study can serve as reference for similar, future research in construction management.	[Chiu, Betty W.

Such consultant-assisted information systems projects differ from internal and outsourced IS projects in two important respects. First, the joint project team consists of members from client and consulting organizations that may have conflicting goals and incompatible work practices. Second, close collaboration between the client and consulting organizations is required throughout the course of the project. Consequently, coordination is more complex for consultant-assisted projects and is critical for project success. Drawing from coordination and agency theories and the trust literature, we developed a research model to investigate how interorganizational coordination could help build relationships based on trust and goal congruence and achieve higher project performance. Hypotheses derived from the model were tested using data collected from 324 projects. The results provide strong support for the model. Interorganizational coordination was found to have the largest overall significant effect on performance. However, its effect was achieved indirectly by building trust and goal congruence and by reducing technical and requirements uncertainty. The positive effects of trust and goal congruence on project performance demonstrate the importance of managing the client-consultant relationship in such projects. Project uncertainty, including both technical and requirements uncertainty, was found to negatively affect goal congruence and trust, as expected. This study represents a step toward the development of a new theory on the role of interorganizational coordination.

Thus, a consultant will typically be judged by (implicit) comparison to an observer's mental picture of a "top performer." Three linked studies conducted at a large IT consulting firm examine the nature and implications of this process. In the first, we address what it means to be a "top performer" as an IT consultant, both at the entry level and in more senior roles. The second study demonstrates incongruity among various stakeholders in their perceptions of which attributes are of primary and lesser importance as determinants of excellent performance. The third study examines the effects of this incongruence on consultants' attitudes and performance. This research presents a novel operationalization of incongruity that is particularly relevant for understanding IT personnel, and one that has practical implications for their socialization and management.

Construction projects faces delays, cost overrun and quality defects due to avoidance of risk factors by contractors, clients and consultants. So the present study aims to investigate the risk factors that influence project objectives namely cost, quality and time of building construction projects in Pakistan from perspective of contractors, clients, and consultants. Risk factors were selected from literature survey and were finalized after consultation with construction experts. A questionnaire survey was prepared and various construction professionals were approached for feedback. Based on feedback of 164 experts, collected data was analysed statistically and were ranked based on relative importance index. As per the survey results, inadequate project management is the most critical factor effecting time performance of construction projects, rework due to error effect cost performance, and poor supervision effect quality of construction projects. Additionally, the study will help in planning and monitoring stages of the projects and shall improve the performance of construction industry of Pakistan.

During the project, many interface problems may arise, and their severities may vary and affect the overall project performance. This research was conducted to identify the causes of design-construction interface problems in large building construction projects in Palestine. To achieve the research objectives, a comprehensive literature review, pilot study and questionnaire survey were carried out to collect information on these causes. Responses from 34 consultants and 30 contractors were analysed. The results revealed that the top 10 extreme significant causes are unstable client requirements', lack of proper coordination between various disciplines of the design team', awarding the contract to the lowest price regardless of the quality of services', lack of skilled and experienced human resources in the design firms', lack of skilled human resources at the construction site', delaying of dues payments', lack of specialized quality-control team', lack of professional construction management', delaying the approval of completed tasks' and vague and deficient drawings and specifications'. Spearman's rho coefficient was 0.64, which indicates that the overall level of correlation between Palestinian consultants and contractors in the context of this research can be identified as moderate.

Comprehensive information, expanded knowledge, considerable expertise, and continuous improvement are needed to obtain accurate cost estimation. The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical factors that affect accuracy of cost estimation and evaluate the degree to which these factors are important from contractors' and consultants' viewpoints. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were adopted in collecting and analyzing the data, and testing the hypotheses. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire was prepared and then was modified according to the results of face-to-face open-ended interviews conducted with 11 project managers. The final version of the questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 265 respondents. For analyzing the collected data Kendall's and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted. Findings - The analysis revealed that there is a strong agreement between contractors and consultants in the ranking of the factors related to consultant, contractor, design parameters, and information. A slightly weak agreement between contractors and consultants was noted regarding the factors related to market conditions (external factors) and factors related to project characteristics. Furthermore, the results show that the top ten factors affecting the accuracy of cost estimate are clear and detail drawings and specification, pricing experience of construction projects, perception of estimation importance, equipment (cost/availability/performance), project complexity, clear scope definition, accuracy and reliability of cost information, site constraints (access, storage, services), material availability, financial capabilities of the client, and availability of database of bids on similar project (historical data). Originality/value - Offers an original view of the concept of accuracy of cost estimates as it relates to the efficiency of the project relying on both literature review and empirical evidence.

It developed models to predict the level of quality of interpersonal relations between the stakeholders at the completion of public projects. Design/methodology/approach - Using a set of questionnaire, data were collected from randomly selected construction industry practitioners who have had experience in public projects in Singapore. The data were analysed to identify association between the use of RC practices and quality of interpersonal relations between stakeholders. In-depth interviews with experts were conducted. Findings - It was found that when certain RC practices were adopted to a larger extent, public projects also have significantly higher quality of interpersonal relations between clients, contractors and consultants. Three mathematical models were developed to predict the relationship quality between stakeholders at the end of the public project. Research limitations/implications - The limitations include the subjective nature of the Likert scale that was used in answering the questionnaire survey and the limited number of interviews. The effect of existing good relations among stakeholders was not taken into account. Practical implications - Suitable RC practices for adoption by public clients, contractors and consultants in public projects are recommended. These include developing deeper mutual trust and understanding, sharing project information, and having real gain-share/pain-share among contracting parties. Originality/value - RC practices that are significantly associated with relationships among contracting parties in public projects in Singapore are uncovered. Contracting parties may use the recommendations to help enhance their relationships with one another in a public project.	[Ling, Florence Y.

Traditionally, design institutes have operated as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and for them, China's accession to the WTO in 2001 presents both a threat as well as an opportunity. Given the market conditions in China, most of the design institutes are restructuring their organizations to cope with the increasing competition. Through a pilot investigation, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the Chinese design institutes are identified. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes development strategies for the sustainable growth of Chinese design institutes and suggests approaches for collaboration with foreign contractors and consultants. A case study is presented to demonstrate the practical application of these strategies.

Hence determining the contractual responsibility of delay is the most likely source of dispute in construction projects and many techniques have been used in the courts to demonstrate the criticalities of a delay event on the project schedule. Therefore, authors try to investigate all process-based techniques of delay claims and evaluated and conformed them with principles by Society of Construction Law (SCL) protocol and Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACEI) in order to choose the best techniques based on the specific circumstances of each project. Design/methodology/approach - This section is divided into two distinct parts: refers to the methods used to assess the perceptions of clients, consultants, and contractors on the relative importance of causes of delay in construction industry; and refers to advantages and disadvantages of various techniques used to analyze delays and their conform with SCL protocol. A questionnaire was developed to assess the perceptions of clients, consultants, and contractors on the relative importance of causes of delay in Iranian construction industry. The respondents were asked to indicate their response category on 78 well-recognized construction delay factors identified by authors. Findings - In total, 78 causes of delay were identified through research. The identified causes are combined into seven groups. The field survey included 58 contractors, 55 consultants, and 62 client. Data collected were analyzed by RII and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The authors identified main causes of delay and ten most important causes, according to Table AII, from the perspective of three major groups of participants (clients, consultants and contractors). The ranking of categories of causes of delay, according to Table I, were: client-related causes (RII = 0.716); labor and equipment category causes (RII = 0.701); contractor-related causes (RII = 0.698); material-related causes (RII = 0.690); design-related causes (RII = 0.666); external causes (RII = 0.662); and consultant-related causes (RII = 0.662). But according to the discussions and given that determining the contractual responsibility of delay is the most likely source of dispute in construction industry and many techniques have been used in the courts to demonstrate the criticalities of a delay event on the project schedule. Originality/value - All process-based techniques of delay analysis have been present in this paper and categorized in 11 groups. In order to understand the advantages and disadvantages of them by clients, contractor and consultant, a thorough review conducted to reveal the nature of techniques. In the next step, given that selecting the most appropriate technique based on constraints and specific conditions of each project is one of the most important steps to carry out a successful delay analysis. The authors conformed, all process-based techniques of delay analysis, by SCL protocol and AACEI principles. Finally, the result of this match was brought in order to choose the best technique based on the specific circumstances of each project.

Critical Role of the Learning Transfer Climate in Fostering Innovation in Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Innovation; Learning transfer climate	TRANSFER SYSTEM INVENTORY; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; PUBLIC-SECTOR; ENVIRONMENT; VALIDATION; STRATEGY; MODEL	Because learning is a key antecedent to innovative activities, more attention needs to be paid to the climate, within the organization or project settings, that supports learning. The objectives of this paper are (1)to empirically examine the influences of the learning transfer climate on innovation and (2)to investigate how the between-group variability in the learning transfer climates of clients, contractors, and consultants affects innovation. The learning transfer climates are assessed in terms of the task-support and motivational elements adopted from the well-tested questionnaire of the Learning Transfer System Inventory. Based on the 147 survey returns collected from construction participants, factor analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis are conducted (the latter two using the total sample and the subsamples of client developers, contractors, and consultants). It is found from the total sample that openness to change (task-support element), performance-outcome expectations, and performance self-efficacy (motivational elements) are significant predictors of innovation. Whereas a successful construction project requires the interaction of multiple waves of innovation, contributed by various construction participants throughout the project, it is important to acknowledge the heterogeneity of these participants in considering the innovation process. The results also indicate that, with regard to their innovations, the different groups are influenced by different learning transfer climate factors: clients are affected by openness to change and performance self-efficacy; contractors are affected by openness to change; and consultants are affected by performance-outcome expectations. Analysis of these findings leads to a conceptual model of learning transfer climate and interactions between the clients, contractors, and consultants. From the theoretical perspective, the findings of this study lay ground for an interorganizational framework for further innovation-learning transfer studies. From the managerial perspective, this study provides empirical confirmation of the importance of measuring the learning transfer climate in construction organizations and of developing strategies for facilitating an innovation-conducive climate that fits each particular organization.

The current design practices are first reviewed through the conduct of multiple interviews. The development of the QMS for designing residential and commercial buildings is also based on quality standards from the literature. The practical implementation of the model is conducted using actual design projects in a real design environment. The model implementation consists of three stages, the first stage is awareness; the second stage is benchmarking of existing practice, which is carried out on 20 projects; and finally, the validation of the model is verified using data from 11 projects. The benchmarking of existing performance and the validation of the model are carried out utilizing statistical approaches. The implementation of the QMS model improves the efficiency of the designs and the production process distributions.

J	Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO				Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO			Evaluation of factors influencing construction clients' decision to build	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Evidence indicates that construction clients are not wholly satisfied with the performance achieved on many of their projects, with the blame for failures often attributed to both consultants and contractors. However, the findings of a survey described in this paper suggest that there are several factors influencing a client's decision to build that ultimately bear upon a successful project outcome. It is imperative for project participants to understand these factors before developing the project objectives. These factors operate in the following three main groupings: organizational variables, including director's preference, corporate ego, status/prestige, location, and profit/economic reasons; structural variables, including change of attitude, cultural influence, social expectation, workers' pressure; and externalities, including users' preference, and need for more facilities. Organizational factors predominate the decision to build. If the consultant in general and the client in particular can appreciate the factors that instigate the project, they will both perform their respective roles adequately and ensure a succesful project outcome.

Yet, poor time and cost performance have been a critical issue prevailing in the global construction market and UAE have not been an exception. This research adopted a concurrent mixed-methods approach, utilizing a questionnaire and an interview with UAE construction professionals, to analyse the major causes of this poor time and cost performance. The top five causes for time overrun were concluded as design variation from client and consultant, unrealistic schedules and completion dates projected by clients, delay in obtaining government permits and approvals, inaccurate time estimation by the consultants and change orders from clients. Whereas, the top five causes of cost overrun were summarized as design variation, poor cost estimation, delay in client's decision-making process, financial constraints of client and inappropriate procurement method.

J	Chang, AST; Ibbs, CW				Chang, AST; Ibbs, CW			On-call contracting strategy and management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	The purpose of this paper is to present an on-call contracting process model. On-call contracting is a strategy in which the owner initially signs a master contract with one party for a project and then divides the project work into task orders that are released to the party in phases. It is a contracting strategy tailored from traditional contracting methods, and applicable to consultant services. It is a flexible method that can retain the advantages of traditional strategies while avoiding or minimizing their disadvantages. It can make the consultant more attentive to the work. On-call contracting needs to follow principles and guidelines in order to be effective. Three principles-complete planning, overlapping, and design management-are derived from project scope freezing, concurrent engineering, and construction management, respectively. Task order planning is the core process of on-call contracting and includes four steps: (1) divide overall work; (2) group tasks into task order; (3) define task orders; and (4) issue task orders. Guidelines for task order planning are presented within these steps.

J	Doloi, H				Doloi, Hemanta			Cost Overruns and Failure in Project Management: Understanding the Roles of Key Stakeholders in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cost overrun; Cost estimation; Cost performance; Project management	CLIENTS; DESIGN; BUILD	The subject of poor cost performance has been widely published in the mainstream project and construction management literature. Nevertheless, the underlying responsibilities of the key stakeholders (clients, consultants, and contractors) in managing this chronic problem in the Australian construction industry remain unclear. By performing an in-depth analysis of the roles and responsibilities of these key stakeholders, this research is intended to unfold the industrywide perception of cost performance being heavily reliant on the contractor's performance alone. Based on a thorough literature review and relevant industry inputs, 73 attributes associated with cost performance were identified for investigation. Based on the relative importance weighing technique on 48 selected attributes, planning and scheduling deficiencies have the highest impact on cost performance from clients, consultants, and contractors' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analysis on the combined responses across all three groups suggests that robust control procedures and adequate programming, along with efficient design and effective site management, are the most critical factors. These factors are primarily associated with the responsibilities of contractors and consultants for managing cost overruns in projects. However, the client's responsibility in facilitating effective management of these factors within the project environment is crucial. Multivariate regression analysis performed on eight factors' scores highlighted the influence of five significant factors (p < 5%) on managing cost overruns. The findings are expected to abridge a significant knowledge gap by shifting the priorities in cost estimation and management practices across all industry sectors.

This leaves a lot to be desired especially in most developing countries which are now embracing environmental sustainability. This paper examines the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana within a case study (The Kumasi City Mall project). Thematic template analysis revealed designer?s own philosophy, request by clients, incentives for green designs, policies and regulation, and competitive advantage as the drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. Furthermore, the results disclosed specific governmental role and social network utilization as drivers of environmental sustainability of construction projects. The outputs of this study offer strategies which are significant to the construction industry in embracing environmental sustainability. Further, the findings contribute to knowledge on achieving the sustainable development agenda.

J	San Santoso, D; Soeng, S				San Santoso, Djoen; Soeng, Sothy			Analyzing Delays of Road Construction Projects in Cambodia: Causes and Effects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RISK-ASSESSMENT; DISPUTES	This research analyzes the delay factors in road construction projects in Cambodia and their effects on project time, cost, and quality. A questionnaire survey was conducted with engineers from contractor and consultant firms in assessing the frequency and severity of delays so that an importance index for delay factors could be computed. In general, there was no significant difference between contractors and consultants in assessing the delay factors. The top-10 list was dominated by factors related to the contractor and the project. However, two external factors, rain and flood, were the first two factors on the list, which also had a high impact on the three project objectives. The remaining factors on the list were land acquisition, award of project to lowest bidder, equipment breakdowns, poor site arrangement, management and supervision, unexpected ground condition and terrain, low quality of the contractor human resources, late progress payments, and low productivity of labor. Recommendations to manage the delay factors were presented. Significant relationships between the delay factors and the three project objectives also were observed and discussed.

However, many projects experience extensive delays and thereby exceed initial time and cost estimates. Construction delay is considered to be one of the most recurring problems in the construction industry and it has an adverse effect on project success in terms of time, cost, quality, and safety. This study is conducted to investigate the time performance of road construction projects in the West Bank in Palestine to identify the causes of delay and their severity according to contractors and consultants through a questionnaire survey. The field survey included 34 contractors and 30 consultants. A total of 52 causes of delay were identified during the research. The survey concluded that the top five severe delay causes are political situation, segmentation of the West Bank and limited movement between areas, award project to lowest bid price, progress payment delay by owner, and shortage of equipment.

During the last two decades in Algeria, many large-scale construction projects have been launched to develop the basic infrastructure facilities of the country. However, most of these projects experience extensive delays. The objective of this paper is to identify the causes of delay in the Algerian construction industry and assess their importance according to the main project stakeholders, which are the owner, the contractor and the consultant. Data were collected through a questionnaire and direct interviews of a sample of construction experts including 16 owners, 16 contractors and 20 consultants. Fifty-nine causes of delay were identified in this research. The results indicate that the five most important causes are slow change orders, unrealistic contract duration, slow variation orders in extra quantities, delays in payment of performed work and ineffective planning and scheduling by contractors. The study revealed that owner-related causes are the most important sources of delay. The findings of this research can be used to guide the improvements of the construction industry in Algeria.

Effects of Contract Strategy on Interpersonal Relations and Project Outcomes of Public-Sector Construction Contracts in Australia	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Contracts; Construction management; Australia; Relational contracting; Public construction projects; Relationship; Strategy; Sydney; Australia	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; DELIVERY; FORMS; TRUST	Hitherto, it is not known if the integration of relationship concepts into traditional public-sector construction contracts would improve project performance. This study hence examines the effects of contract strategies on project outcomes and relationship quality in the context of public-sector construction projects in Sydney, Australia. It also identifies the relational contracting (RC) practices that are in place when certain contract strategies are adopted. Using a two-pronged research design, data were first collected from public owners and private contractors and consultants through a questionnaire survey. The data were analyzed and the results were then validated by interviews. Correlation analysis shows that cost performance, client satisfaction, and relationship quality among contracting parties are significantly correlated with contract strategies. The findings indicate the important role that contract strategies play in project outcomes and interpersonal relationship. Among the 20 RC practices that are significantly correlated with contract strategies, 16 of them are related to clients and consultants, suggesting their important role in setting the tone of the relationship in a project.

Despite the potential benefits of effective alignment, there is still little information about optimally designing procurement approaches that promote motivation towards 'above business-as-usual' goals. A contribution to this knowledge gap is made by examining the negative drivers of motivation in a major construction project that, despite a wide range of performance enhancing incentives, failed to exceed business-as-usual performance. A case study of an iconic infrastructure project in Australia shows that incentives provided to contractors and consultants to achieve above business-as-usual performance can be compromised by a range of negative motivation drivers including: inequitable contractual risk allocation; late involvement of key stakeholders; inconsistency between contract intentions and relationship intentions; inadequate price negotiation; inconsistency between the project performance goals and incentive goals; and unfair and inflexible incentive performance measurement processes. Future quantitative research is planned to determine the generalizability of these results.

Causes of Delay in Building Construction Projects in Egypt	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Delay in construction projects is considered one of the most common problems causing a multitude of negative effects on the project and its participating parties. This paper aims to identify the main causes of delay in construction projects in Egypt from the point of view of contractors, consultants, and owners. A literature review was conducted to compile a list of delay causes that was purged based on appropriateness to Egypt in seven semistructured interviews. The resulting list of delay causes was subjected to a questionnaire survey for quantitative confirmation and identification of the most important causes of delay. The overall results indicated that the most important causes are: financing by contractor during construction, delays in contractor's payment by owner, design changes by owner or his agent during construction, partial payments during construction, and nonutilization of professional construction/contractual management. The contractor and owner were found to have opposing views, mostly blaming one another for delays, while the consultant was seen as having a more intermediate view. Results' analyses suggest that in order to significantly reduce delay a joint effort based on teamwork is required. Furthermore, causes of project delay were discussed based on the type and size of the project.	[El-Razek, M. E. Abd; Bassioni, H.

Properly assigning the supervision engineers under a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract has been a key factor affecting the profitability of the firm and the quality assurance of the project. Assigning too many engineers will be a waste, while allocating too few engineers may harm the supervision quality. This work proposes a two-stage model to develop engineering S-curves (called ES-curves) for planning and controlling the engineering supervision schedule. In the planning stage, a predictive ES-curve model is established based on historical ES-curves. In the controlling stage, an ES-curve is built according to the relationships between the engineering progress and construction progress. A cluster analysis and regression analysis are applied to the model development. A case study demonstrates that the produced ES-curves can help management in planning and evaluating when to increase or decrease the number of supervision engineers assigned to a project.

The aim of this study is to determine the critical causes affecting projects delays in Moroccan construction industry. Forty-nine causes of delay were identified from the literature review and redefined through interviews with Moroccan experts. These causes are classified according to nine categories: client, contractor, consultant/designer, finance, planning and scheduling, communication and contractual relationship, material, labours and equipment, and external. A questionnaire survey was conducted with public and private contractors and consultants in order to assess the relative importance of construction delay causes in Morocco. A total of 330 valid responses were collected. Statistical analysis of data collected from this survey study reveals that the top-10 delay causes are: delay of progress payment, lack of training for employees, lack of waste management strategy, unrealistic contract duration imposed by clients, rework due to the construction errors, excessive subcontracting, delay in obtaining permits from governmental agencies, ineffective planning and scheduling, lack of collective planning, and unskilled workforce. These findings can be helpful for construction project managers to guide efforts in improving the performance of the Moroccan construction industry.

A review of the literature identifies major problems in relation to the fairness and equality of the risk allocation process. However, most existing studies have been conducted from the client's perspective rather than that of contractors or consultants and do not focus specifically on risk misallocation. This paper aims at determining the factors involved by a questionnaire survey of the perceptions of contractors and consultants of the main issues in relation to medium to large commercial construction projects in South East Queensland, Australia. The findings are generally consistent with existing research results in that approximately half the respondents feel that their contractual risk allocation is unfair. In addition, there is a lack of use of formal risk management methods, and the arbitrary passing down of risks from the client has increased in recent years. A better understanding is provided of the issues contributing to unequal risk allocation, decision-making and management that will help promote fairness and equality between the contractual parties in the current process of risk management.

This paper seeks to explore the genesis of the underlying risks in non-standard forms of engineering consulting services, systematically classify the risks, and develop a Risk Breakdown Structure and a generic Framework for efficient assessment of these risks, which is a prerequisite for sound risk management in the engineering consulting industry. The research adopts a mixed method approach, synthesising exploratory type multiple-case studies and questionnaire surveys, carried out in 14 engineering consulting firms having extensive experience in the delivery of non-standard consulting services. This paper provides empirical insights of the genetic makeup of risks associated with non-standard forms of consulting services. Such risks are found to be predominantly linked to design office based activities that underline the importance of design function in engineering consulting practice. Loss of reputation and/or goodwill is rated as the most severe potential impact on consultants. Proposed Risk Assessment Framework provides the engineering consulting industry with a functional tool for efficient risk management.	[Piyadasa, W. M. Sarath C.; Hadikusumo, Bonaventura H.

Consequently, the objective of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the performance of local construction projects; and to elicit perceptions of their relative importance. A comprehensive literature review was deployed to generate a set of factors believed to affect project performance. A total of 120 questionnaires were distributed to 3 key groups of project participants; namely owners, consultants and contractors. The survey findings indicate that all 3 groups agree that the most important factors affecting project performance are: delays because of borders/roads closure leading to materials shortage; unavailability of resources; low level of project leadership skills; escalation of material prices; unavailability of highly experienced and qualified personnel; and poor quality of available equipment and raw materials. Based on these findings, the paper recommends that: 1) project owners must work collaboratively with contractors and facilitate regular payments in order to overcome delays, disputes and claims; 2) project participants should actively have their input in the process of decision-making; and 3) continuous coordination and relationship between project participants are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance.

J	Odusami, KT				Odusami, KT			Perceptions of construction professionals concerning important skills of effective project leaders	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The purpose of this study was to identify the most important skill of an effective project leader as perceived by the significant actors in the construction industry. A total of 120 questionnaires drawn from six construction-related professionals, comprising architecture, building, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering, estate surveying, and quantity surveying were collected and used for the study. These professionals were employed in clients' organizations (N=40), consultancy firms (N=48), and contracting firms (N=32). Frequency counts of the responses were computed, from which the mean item score for each skill was calculated to obtain the relative importance index. The relative importance indices were then ranked from the highest to the lowest for the clients, the consultants, the contractors, and the weighted average. The results showed that the most important skill is decision making for the client and for the three groups combined. The consultants agreed that leadership and motivation is the most important skill for the project leader. This is followed by decision making. The contractors ranked communication as the most important skill of an effective project leader. In the overall analysis, there is no significant difference in the perceptions of the three significant actors regarding the ranking of the skills.

J	Adesi, M; Owusu-Manu, D; Murphy, R				Adesi, Michael; Owusu-Manu, De-Graft; Murphy, Roisin			Strategic competences for pricing quantity surveying consultancy services	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organization; Management; Construction; Strategic management; Estimating	CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGERS; ENGINEERING SERVICES; LEADERSHIP; BLUEPRINT; FIRMS	Purpose Professional quantity surveying (QS) services are critical to successful delivery of construction projects within planned budget, quality and duration. The supply of QS professional services is largely dependent on the price level of services and the willingness of clients to pay. The pricing of professional QS consultancy services has been confronted with a myriad of pricing challenges due to rapid changes in the business environment; the pervasive influence of information technology; and the complexity of clients' expectation. It is therefore necessary for QS consultancy firms to develop strategic competences for the pricing of their services. In addition, numerous studies have not given the pricing the pricing of professional services the requisite attention. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategic competences for pricing professional QS services. Design/methodology/approach The study was positioned within the positivist tradition. As a result, the quantitative approach was adopted using a survey questionnaire to collect data from QS consultants. The sample size of the study was 79 professional quantity surveyors chosen by using simple random sampling technique from a population of 372 registered professional QS of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors. Using the (2) test and factor analysis, the study established relationship between strategic competences and pricing of QS services. Findings The study found that strategic competences for pricing QS professional services is significantly related to the managerial and professional competence of QS consultants. The strategic competences of QS consultants identified by this study include business management, services cost management; and production capabilities. Practical implications This study provides an empirical basis for QS consultancy firms to focus on strategic direction of their contractual arrangement with clients. Practically, resource configuration and on strategic competences for professional service pricing would create price leadership. Originality/value The study advances the pricing knowledge within the QS practice by demonstrating the nexus between strategic competences and the pricing of QS professional services which hitherto this study have not been effectively investigated.

J	Balali, A; Moehler, RC; Valipour, A				Balali, Amirhossein; Moehler, Robert C.; Valipour, Alireza			Ranking cost overrun factors in the mega hospital construction projects using Delphi-SWARA method: an Iranian case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Hospital construction projects; cost overrun factors; SWARA method; Delphi method; success criteria	FUZZY SWARA; SELECTION; DECISION; RISK; COPRAS	Completing a project according to the anticipated budget is one of the most important criteria in a successful construction project. As mega hospital construction projects face various kinds of limitation which affect the cost dramatically, many developing countries such as Iran have focused in these kinds of projects. Only a few studies have been conducted which are associated with cost overrun factors in hospital construction projects in developing countries. The aim of this study is to identify and rank cost overrun factors in mega hospital construction projects of Iran. Delphi and SWARA methods were used in order to align experts' opinions in categorizing cost overrun factors and weigh the cost overrun factors, respectively. These factors were then allocated to consultants, employers and contractors. The results illustrated that "Unacceptable quality of work which leads to rework" with score of 0.458, "Not allocating sufficient budget from the government during the project" with score of 0.429 and "Lack of supervisors' technical knowledge" with score of 0.44 were the most crucial factors in contractors, employers and consultant groups, respectively. The identified factors inform the main literature on hospital projects and results in decreasing cost overruns in the mentioned projects.

J	Cheung, SO; Wong, PSP; Wu, AWY				Cheung, Sai On; Wong, Peter S. P.; Wu, Ada W. Y.			Towards an organizational culture framework in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizational culture in construction; Artifacts; Factors; Framework	PERFORMANCE	Organizational culture gives identity to an organization. Notwithstanding the individuality of the staff members, their actions are collectively bound by the organizational culture. A review of the literature in this topic reveals that despite a number of organizational culture models have been developed, these are mainly for generic business settings and there has yet one developed for construction contracting organizations. This paper reports a study for this purpose conducted in Hong Kong. Firstly, artifacts of organizational culture were long-listed through a literature review. Construction professionals working for developers, consultant offices and contractors assessed the appropriateness of using these artifacts to identify organizational culture in construction. Through a principal component factor analysis, these artifacts are arranged into a seven-factor organizational culture framework. The seven factors are 'Goal settings and accomplishment', 'Team orientation', 'Coordination and integration', 'Performance emphasis', 'innovation orientation', 'Members' participation' and 'Reward orientation'. The ANOVA result suggests no significant difference in the rankings across respondents working for developers, consultants and contractors. The relative importance rankings among these factors were also assessed according to their significance scores. The findings of the study suggest that the construction contracting organizations in Hong Kong favor culture of clear goals with stability. They are less externally focused with a relatively lower emphasis on innovation. These findings suggest construction maintains a local industry mentality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

This paper discusses different maintenance and repair-budget models in use or under development which, if understood by engineering managers, can be applied to develop an appropriate level of funding for maintenance and repair. For those organizations applying total quality management (TQM) techniques, these budget models can also be used to improve or benchmark organizational performance against similar organizations.

To be competent is to have the ability to apply the set of related knowledge, skills and abilities to perform a task effectively. This paper examines the competency requirements for quantity surveyors (QSs) in the face of changing and increasing client needs. Design/methodology/approach Based on a detailed meta-analysis of the literature, 12 basic/core and 16 evolving competencies are identified. Primary data were gathered through a field survey involving practicing QSs from client, consultant and contractor organisations, and university students undertaking QS programmes in Malaysia. The data obtained were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical tools. Findings The significance of the basic/core and evolving competencies are presented. Overall, the most important contemporary skills are cost planning, valuation of works, measurement/quantification and contract documentation. The evolved roles require expertise in communication and negotiation, ethics and professional conduct and value management. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates there are misaligned expectations of the proficiency levels needed to provide contemporary and future services between practitioners in client/consultant organisations, contractors and new generation students. Originality/value The findings provide guidance on the education, training and practice of quantity surveying to deal with emerging challenges in the dynamic built environments in Malaysia and beyond.

J	Lindhard, S; Larsen, JK				Lindhard, Soren; Larsen, Jesper Kranker			Identifying the key process factors affecting project performance	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance; Knowledge management; Communication; Success factors; Failure factors	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; QUALITY PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; MODEL	Purpose - A construction project traditionally involves a variety of participants. Owners, consultants, and contractors all have diverse opinions and interests, but they all seek to ensure project success. Success is habitually measured as performance output regarding cost, time, and quality. Despite previous research mapping the success and failure factors, construction managers seem to have difficulty in attaining success. To provide clearer guidance on how to fulfill success criteria, the purpose of this paper is to identify the underlying factors that affect performance and thus project success in construction processes. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based on a literature review provided 25 key process factors divided into five key categories. Based on the responses from commonly involved construction parties, the factors were ranked and tested for significant differences between the parties. Findings - The top five most important process factors were found to relate to the sharing of knowledge and communication. Moreover, testing the ranking for significant differences between owners, consultants, and contractors revealed five differences. The differences related to the interpretation and importance of trust, shared objectives, project coordination, and alternative forms of coordination. Originality/value - All respondents identify improved knowledge sharing and communication as the key to improved cost, time, and quality performance and are therefore the areas where construction managers need to focus their resources. Thus, improved experience sharing and communication will increase the likelihood of project success, through improving competences, commitment, and coordination.

J	Ding, ZK; Zuo, J; Wang, JY; Zillante, G				Ding, Zhikun; Zuo, Jian; Wang, Jiayuan; Zillante, George			Searching for niche market for engineering consultants Case of regional supervision systems in China	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; Benchmark; Principal component analysis; Focus group; Niche market; Supervision system	BENCHMARKING; IMPROVEMENT; ADOPTION	Purpose - A growing number of foreign consulting firms have been engaged in the Chinese construction market where the supervision system, as a kind of engineering consultant service has been widely implemented. However, the performance of supervision system varies significantly across regions. Therefore, foreign consulting firms are in desperate need of related performance benchmarking statistics to determine the niche market. A major issue is lack of a quantitative method to objectively evaluate regional supervision systems' performance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A new regional construction supervision system benchmarking model was developed via the principal component analysis method. This model is based on key performance indicators drawn from annual official statistics. This list of key indicators was refined by means of a focus group with selected experts. Consequently the performances of all 31 regional supervision systems were calculated and ranked. Findings - Results indicate a general gap between coastal and inland regions. The various development trends of top 10 regions are analyzed and the underlying reasons are explored. Furthermore, the regions deserving more attention or currently lacking in development are identified. The supervision industry in China is shifting from a labor-intensive industry to a knowledgeintensive industry. Originality/value - The proposed model provides a single quantitative parameter to conveniently benchmark the performance of various regions. The findings are vital for the benchmarking and clarification of future endeavor of the regional supervision systems and for foreign enterprises that are planning to enter the real-estate market in China.

Despite the large body of literature, there are still empirical inquiries to investigate the ERP system implementation from end-users' perspectives as well as from different organizational contexts. To address these issues, we set a project-based sector as our population of interest and seek to understand how project management practices are interrelated with end-users' cognitive perception, and in the end, with their behavioral intention of using the ERP system. In doing so, this study incorporates the best practices of ERP system implementation projects, internal support, external (consultant) support, and functionality selection, into the extended technology acceptance model (TAM) that includes belief constructs and socioenvironmental construct (subjective norm). The empirical analyses show that managerial practices and socioenvironmental factor are significantly related to the original TAM variables in the context of ERP system. One of the interesting findings is the negative effect of consultant support on perceived usefulness, but positive effect on the perceived ease of use, suggesting a useful reference for future research. This study extends the existing literature by investigating potential managerial and socioenvironmental factors affecting user adoption behavior in a different organizational context. This study would also benefit project-based sectors by offering valuable managerial insights that enable them to appreciate and improve end-users' ERP system acceptance and utilization.

J	Mpofu, B; Ochieng, EG; Moobela, C; Pretorius, A				Mpofu, Bekithemba; Ochieng, Edward Godfrey; Moobela, Cletus; Pretorius, Adriaan			Profiling causative factors leading to construction project delays in the United Arab Emirates	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; United Arab Emirates; Construction industry; Construction delay; Construction practitioners; Delivery of projects	PERFORMANCE	Purpose - A voluminous amount of research has been conducted on project delay in the recent past; however, the persistence of the problem demands that a relentless quest for solutions is upheld. It can be argued that the problem is likely to be more pronounced in areas where development pressure is the highest. One such area is the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the construction industry is said to have reached an unparalleled position in the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most significant causes of delays in the UAE construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted targeting three key types of stakeholders, namely clients, contractors and consultants. Validity and reliability were achieved by first assessing the plausibility of construction delay variables in UAE. The verification took place after the interpretation of quantitative data, this involved presenting the findings to the main participants. The validation took place after the verification process. Rigour was achieved by engaging participants previously engaged in UAE and focussing on verification and validation, this included responsiveness of the researchers during group discussions, methodological coherence, appropriate sampling frame and data analysis. Findings - From the analysis, the study unveiled a number of important causes of construction delays in the UAE, ranging from unrealistic contract durations to poor labour productivity, with consultants and clients seemingly shouldering the bulk of the " blame game". It was evident that all the three main stakeholders in a construction project (clients, consultants and contractors) need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. The research also confirms that delays are country specific and appear to be time related hence they should be viewed within the social, economic and cultural settings of the UAE. Research limitations/implications - A major limitation of the current study was the use of a single approach to facilitate data collection. Practical implications-It was evident that practitioners need to change their existing practices in order to ensure timely delivery of projects. Continuous coordination and relationship between practitioners are required through the project life cycle in order to solve problems and develop project performance. Originality/value - As suggested in this study methods should be put in place to reduce long and bureaucratic processes within the client's organisations, not only to fulfil the requirements of the contract but also to suite fast-track projects.

J	Alsugair, AM				Alsugair, AM			Framework for evaluating bids of construction contractors	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Bid evaluation is one of the major challenges that face owners and consultants in both the public and private sectors in selecting the best construction contractor. Selecting the best one requires a sophisticated knowledge and experience to ensure that the contractor is technically and financially capable to accomplish the project on time, within budget, and as specified. In this paper, a framework for evaluating bids of construction contractors in Saudi Arabia is developed. The framework is developed for lump contracts using postqualification of contractors. The framework includes identifying the factors involved in bid evaluation, the impacts and weights of these factors, and the factor's score. Also, the procedure for evaluating contractors bids is discussed using an example.

J	Sewchurran, K; Barron, M				Sewchurran, Kosheek; Barron, Michelle			An Investigation Into Successfully Managing and Sustaining the Project Sponsor-Project Manager Relationship Using Soft Systems Methodology	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						benefits realization; value management; project sponsor; relationship management	MODEL	This article explores the role played by the project sponsor and project manager in successfully delivering information technology [IT] projects. It describes the common issues of the client-consultant relationship, comparing the perspectives of project managers and project sponsors gathered from the literature and through interviews. The research further explores the underlying reasons for the existence of the issues that impact the successful delivery of IT projects. This article goes beyond identifying critical success factors and uses a systemic inquiry to learn about the influences that shape attitudes, actions, and perspectives. The research setting is a South African business consulting company. The findings are that the fundamental influence on the client-consultant relationship is the lack of understanding and appreciation of each other's environments; that is, project sponsors are rooted in an operational environment, and project managers are rooted in a project environment. Because of this lack of understanding and appreciation, communication barriers exist. In order to overcome these barriers, both project managers and project sponsors need to engage in an ongoing dialectic relationship to understand and appreciate each other's respective environments. Establishing an appreciation of each other's environments enables project managers and project sponsors to be more understanding of the demands within each environment as well as the impact environment has on project delivery.

J	Vijverberg, G				Vijverberg, G			Basing maintenance needs on accommodation policy	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						accommodation policy; accommodation scenarios; maintenance; facilities management; building stock; The Netherlands		Managers and maintenance consultants in The Netherlands are working to objectify the inspection of real estate, and to increase the possibilities of controlling long-range maintenance expectations and setting priorities. However, in this view maintenance policy is still largely determined from the 'bottom up'; technical maintenance requirements play a predominant role. However, maintenance and investment practice ought also to be based on a 'top-down' vision of the desired level of functional performance of a particular building and of the total stock of buildings in the future. This vision would result in accommodation scenarios for these buildings to which a maintenance policy can then be adapted. Such a maintenance policy would link together the top-down and the bottom-up approaches.

In the UK, quantity surveyors (or cost consultants) have a perception that more energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings cost between 5% and 15% more to build from the outset. This common assumption is not backed up by recent research and should be questioned. Construction professionals need to be informed of the whole life cost and environmental impact of buildings so that they can encourage key stakeholders to make more sustainable choices. These emerging issues together with practical tools are considered with case studies from recent projects.

J	Bowles, G; Morgan, J				Bowles, Graeme; Morgan, James			An evaluation of the performance of a large scale collaborative procurement initiative in the social housing sector	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Financial performance; Collaboration; Partnering; Social housing; Procurement efficiency		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors relating to the implementation of a new procurement initiative that affect performance and value for money (VFM). The study is based on a four-year research project carried out on behalf of the Scottish Government to monitor and evaluate the performance and efficiency of a bulk procurement vehicle for social housing. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers had a brief to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the procurement process and its influence on cost and efficiency targets. The study employed a mixed method approach with annual rounds of qualitative and quantitative data collection from project stakeholders including the contractors, consultants, clients and sponsor. Confidential semi-structured interviews were conducted on conclusion of the project to gauge views on how well the procurement process worked from the various perspectives and to reflect on the influence of the process on VFM. Findings - The procurement programme failed to achieve the capital cost and efficiency savings targets quantified at the outset and on this measure alone VFM was not demonstrated, although there were a number of reported benefits. A major factor was the extent of process and behavioural change required from the project team and, although a procurement consultant was engaged to facilitate this, the theoretical benefits of "best practice" were not realized. The picture was further complicated by rapidly changing economic conditions experienced, and debate about the robustness of original cost savings targets. Research limitations/implications - The findings and conclusions are of relevance and interest to clients and construction organisations undergoing change through adopting novel procurement processes. Originality/value - The empirical nature of the study provides a comprehensive evidence base for the performance of a collaborative procurement programme and an understanding of the potential difficulties in attaining the theoretical benefits of procurement innovation.

Risk ranking and analysis in target cost contracts: Empirical evidence from the construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Risk analysis; Construction industry; Target cost contracts; Guaranteed maximum price contracts; Hong Kong	PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE	The construction industry is often characterized by the traditional adversarial working relationships between contracting parties. There has been a strong call for applying target cost contracts to align the interest of owners and contractors together. By doing so, it aims to achieve a win-win situation under a partnering arrangement within the construction industry. Even though a multitude of research studies have been undertaken on target cost contracts (TCC) or guaranteed maximum price (GM P) contracts, not many of them have focused on the risk management and analysis of these procurement strategies. This paper aims to identify, rank and compare the key risk factors encountered with these forms of procurement based on an empirical questionnaire survey geared towards the clients, contractors and consultants in Hong Kong. Despite the limited number of completed TCC and GM P (TCC/GMP) construction projects in Hong Kong, the chosen sample was perceived to be truly representative of the survey population. A four-level data analysis framework was applied in this paper, including descriptive statistics, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney U test. The research findings showed that the client group, contractor group and consultant group are in general agreement on the impact of individual risks. The identification of the key risk factors and their relative significance is important in the risk management of target cost contracts and guaranteed maximum price projects, which, if properly done, would enhance the value for money throughout the whole procurement process. This research study also helps various key project stakeholders to be equipped with better knowledge and understanding of TCC/GMP scheme by paying close attention to those high-risk factors and then the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation measures in a proactive manner.

Construction delays in Hong Kong civil engineering projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction delays are common in civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, inevitably resulting in contractual claims and increased project cost. This study was aimed, first, at gathering the perceptions of civil construction practitioners on how significant are the causes of delay; and, second, investigating whether the suggestions as stated in the report of the Construction Industry Review Committee (the Committee comprises members with good standing and knowledge in the construction and related fields as well as those from other professions who are responsible for examining the current state of the construction industry in terms of its output quantity, the quality of work, its environmental friendliness, site safety, its workforce and the system of supervision) are applicable to and effective at mitigating the corresponding delays with reference to a ranking order established using the mean score method. The extent of the differences in perception among the different respondent groups on these two issues was also examined using the rank agreement factor (RAF), percentage agreement (PA), and percentage disagreement (PD). The differences in the perceptions of the respondents on the significance of delays and the actual causes of delays for the six projects studied were also examined. The results of the study showed that the respondents tended to admit their own faults as shown in the top ten significant causes of delay. A strong consensus was found between the client and consultant groups on the significance of the various causes of delay (PA=74%) and the effectiveness of mitigation measures (PA=67%) compared with the other pairs of groups. The consultant and contractor groups held extremely different perceptions regarding the significance of various delay causes (RAF=4.9 and PD=32%) and the effectiveness of corresponding mitigation measures (RAF=6.2 and PD=47%). It is believed that the findings can provide much more insight for the construction practitioners as well as the researchers and thus help to improve the productivity and overall performance of civil construction projects in Hong Kong.

J	Yap, JBH; Abdul-Rahman, H; Chen, W				Yap, Jeffrey Boon Hui; Abdul-Rahman, Hamzah; Chen, Wang			Collaborative model: Managing design changes with reusable project experiences through project learning and effective communication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication management; Construction; Design change; Overruns; Project learning	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; CHANGE MANAGEMENT; DELAY MITIGATION; COST OVERRUNS; KNOWLEDGE; REWORK; LITIGATION; IMPACTS; QUALITY; SYSTEM	This paper empirically studies the importance of managing design changes in dealing with time delay and cost overruns in construction projects. The main objective of this paper is to identify the causes of design changes and the implications on the Malaysian construction projects measured in terms of cost and time. It also aims to determine how rework induced from the design changes is detrimental to project performance and to suggest recommendations on how to overcome the related problem with project learning and effective communication in building construction. To investigate the factors giving rise to design changes, a total of 43 causes were first identified through a comprehensive literature review. The factors are categorised into client, consultant, contractor, site and external-related themes. This is followed by a qualitative research study involving semi structured interviews with 12 experienced industry practitioners comprising of clients, consultants, and contractors. Critical incident technique employing content analysis is used to analyse the interviews transcripts in detail to provide a rich picture of the causes of design changes, the implications for project delivery performance, enablers of effective communication, enablers of project learning and types of reusable project knowledge. The research findings were further integrated to develop a collaborative model to manage design changes using effective communication and project learning approach. This model highlights the importance of effective communication and project learning towards improving the level of competency and cohesiveness of project team in managing future projects. Capturing and sharing of reusable project experiences is essential towards maximising the benefits of past experiences (lessons learned), shortening the learning curve and adding value to future projects in design change management.

J	Bossink, BAG				Bossink, BAG			Managing drivers of innovation in construction networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; Netherlands; innovation	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; INFORMATION; ADOPTION; BUILDERS	Various drivers of construction innovation are distinguished and classified in four distinctive categories: environmental pressure, technological capability, knowledge exchange, and boundary spanning. Innovation drivers in these categories are active at the transfirm, intrafirm, and interfirm level in the network of organizations in the construction industry. Empirical research in the Dutch construction industry illustrates that the innovation drivers are used by managers of the authorities, clients, architects, consultants, and contractors to stimulate and facilitate innovation processes. It also exemplifies that driving innovation on the transfirm, intrafirm, and interfirm level in the network of organizations is an opportunity for managers of both public and private organizations to develop, improve, and renew their organizations' positions in the market, the quality of their organizations' projects, and the cooperative structure of the industry as a whole.

J	Rojas, EM; Aramvareekul, P				Rojas, EM; Aramvareekul, P			Labor productivity drivers and opportunities in the construction industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRENDS	The study of labor productivity in the construction industry is gaining increasing attention as the industry faces multiple problems related to its workforce. This paper presents the results of a survey instrument applied to determine the relative level of relevance of construction labor productivity drivers and opportunities. Owners, general contractors, electrical contractors, mechanical contractors, consultants, and others participated in this survey. Management skills and manpower issues were identified as the two areas with the greatest potential to affect productivity according to survey respondents. Surprisingly, external factors, which are often cited as a major cause for reduced productivity in the construction industry, were considered to be one of the least relevant productivity drivers. These results suggest that respondents consider the improvement of labor productivity within their reach and control rather than determined by external conditions.

Qualitative data from ERP adoption projects and consultants working with ERP implementations have been collected. This study empirically identifies customization drivers and explains their relationship to customization. The results suggest that high customization may occur because of: unnecessary redevelopment of functionality that is available in the ERP system standard, resistance to change based on cultural issues and low project acceptance, insufficient weight given to the implementation team's recommendations, and the implementation team's lack of opposition to customization requests. The results of this study also explain how these problems occur and why they lead to over-customization.

Smart devices are considered as the objects interconnected in the IoT; therefore, they play a fundamental role in the implementation of digital solutions during the execution of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to assess the critical factors for a successful implementation of smart devices in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was performed in the Dominican Republic. This country, located at the heart of the Caribbean, presents an economy that strongly relies on the construction industry. Following a systematic approach, a qualitative data collection and analysis was performed based on semi-structured interviews and content analysis to professionals of construction companies in the Dominican Republic, enquiring the concept of smart devices and critical success factors for implementing the devices in the industry. Findings The key success factors obtained from the contestants were leadership, technology awareness, company size, usability of proposed solution, cost of implementation and interoperability. Originality/value This paper provides information to clients of the construction sector regarding the benefits of embedding smart devices into their business activities. Furthermore, this study provides a better understanding of the key factors to be considered by construction organisations when embedding smart devices into their projects. This study also provides recommendations for distinct stakeholders of the construction sector, such as policy makers, clients and technology consultants. Policy makers should especially consider factors such as technology awareness and leadership to develop the right policies for the integration of the IoT in construction projects. Technology consultants should be aware of the latest case studies of successful implementation of smart devices and IoT systems in the world in order to adapt and implement smart devices and IoT in their projects.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Potential for implementing relational contracting and joint risk management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper focuses on the outcomes of the second survey in a broad Hong Kong-based study on joint risk management (JRM) through relational contracting (RC). The questionnaire survey itself focused on issues relating to the formation of a coalesced team for JRM at the postcontract stage, comprising owners, consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Results indicate the greater importance of more relational, trust, and joint responsibility-related factors in general, both for selecting different parties and for building a successful relational contract. While some differences in group perceptions emerge, respondents recommend mobilizing project participants at earlier stages of projects, that is, mostly before the contract award, and they strongly support the JRM option for managing various unforeseen risks. Respondents also suggest adjustment/extension of contract provisions for managing unforeseen events, indicating emerging preferences for flexibility in contracts. All these are indicative of a perceived trend toward more RC, teamworking, and collaborative working environments.

Due the complex nature of the procurement problems such as prequalification exercises, the robust models are rarely attempted. The research reported in this paper presents an overview of potential suitability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for contractor/consultant prequalification transactions in the construction project procurements. Furthermore, the performance of SVM is compared with specific artificial neural network outcomes. The results obtained from practical datasets indicate encouraging potentials for SVM applications in the procurement problems such as prequalification and contractor selection. Hence, a SVM-based decision support framework is proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Aibinu, AA; Al-Lawati, AM				Aibinu, Ajibade Ayodeji; Al-Lawati, Ahmed Murtadha			Using PLS-SEM technique to model construction organizations' willingness to participate in e-bidding	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						E-bidding; Procurement; Consultants; Contractors; Clients; Suppliers; Structural equation modeling; Partial least square	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; E-BANKING	The push for the use of e-bidding is on the increase. In many countries, e-bidding has become part of the public procurement reform. However, previous studies have reported the low uptake of e-bidding in the construction industry. This study develops a theoretical structural model representing the impact six latent variables on the willingness of construction organizations to participate in e-bidding. Data from a questionnaire survey of 64 respondents from clients, contractors, consultants, and suppliers organizations was used to analyze the model. The result of the data analysis suggests that perceived barriers, cost, the perceived benefits of e-bidding and security concerns are the factors influencing willingness participate in e-bidding with perceived barriers being the most significant influencing factor. The perception about the adequacy of the existing traditional paper-based tendering and the perception about the non-readiness of business partners are the underlying barriers that need to be addressed when introducing e-biding. This study also discovers that when the respondents concern about the cost of e-bidding is high, their reported willingness to participate in e-bidding is higher when the perceived benefits is high that when the perceived benefits is low. To enhance the participation of the industry in e-bidding, public sector and large private clients would need to take leadership by making bidder's capability for e-bidding and e-project management at all project phases a criteria in bid evaluation. E-bidding developers and promoters need to use test project cases to monitor, measure, and document the benefits of e-bidding. To disseminate the perceived benefits, promoters would need to work closely with industry professional associations to develop promotional programmes linked to continuous professional development (CPD) points. The analytical approach used in this study should assist other researchers who might wish to address a similar research problem under a similar data and model constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	PREDPALL, DF				PREDPALL, DF			DEVELOPING QUALITY-IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES IN CONSULTING ENGINEERING FIRMS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The New York metropolitan offices operating unit of Woodward-Clyde Consultants has been implementing a quality improvement process since late in 1991. After a six-month period in which the awareness of quality management was discussed in the 130-person operation, a quality-improvement committee was formed. The committee supported the formation of quality action teams, whose purpose was to improve certain processes initially identified by the employees. As the client feedback system is implemented, opportunities for process improvement come from clients as well. All employees are receiving training in the scientific method of problem solving (including systems theory) as well as the more philosophical and behavioral aspects of quality (i.e., profound knowledge as Deming calls it). In the first 24 months of this quality effort, several positive results have been seen: employee turnover has decreased; employee morale has improved; and clients have provided useful feedback.

The limits and benefits from the client and user perspectives are also explored. The interest in using LCC approaches for economic evaluation of investment decisions is large. However, constraints exists at a number of levels: uncertainties related to the long term forecasts used, difficulties in achieving relevant input data and lack of experience in using LCC models, incentives for consultants and contractors. Nonetheless, the LCC perspective is proving to be most useful during the design phase where the possibilities of cost reductions related to operation and maintenance are large. LCC can provide motivation for environmental progressive building despite the sometime higher initial cost. The implication for expanding the use of LCC are considered for government, clients/developers, professionals.

J	Shoura, MM; Singh, A				Shoura, MM; Singh, A			System interrelations of organizational variables	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper studies some of the organizational variables in project management. It is shown that only a few variables have a significant direct impact on the management system. The paper focuses on system variables in the emerging modem engineering and technology-based medium- and large-sized organizations such as contracting firms, consultants, developers, and the U.S. Army. This paper studies the interrelations among the system variables and their total effect on the management system. It examines the organizational system through a study of organizational variables-planning measures, power bases, conflict management, role pressures, organizational structure, team management, and strategies for success. It establishes that three variables-planning measures, team management, and strategies for success-have higher relevance than others in the complex environment of organizational variable interrelationships. Their higher significance on the management system makes them both important and sensitive. Other variables affect the system directly to a lesser degree, and indirectly through their interrelation with the most relevant three.

J	Karna, S; Junnonen, JM				Karna, Sami; Junnonen, Juha-Matti			Designers' performance evaluation in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Customer satisfaction; Performance measures; Design management; Critical success factors; Project participants satisfaction	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SATISFACTION; QUALITY	Purpose - In a construction project, "participants' satisfaction" is one of the main dimensions used for measuring the successfulness of a project. Designers perform a major role in attaining the project goals and managing project complexity during production. The purpose of this paper is to examine the designers' performance as evaluated by the main participants: the client, the project consultant/manager and the main contractor, and to identify the main success factors of designer performance using the participants' evaluation. The study also aims to examine how the economic size of a project affects the project participants' assessment of the designer's performance. It is assumed that as the size of a project increases, so does the complexity of the project, which will affect the scope of work and demands on the designers' operational performance for the specific project level. Design/methodology/approach - The Finnish project evaluation and benchmark database was used in this study as empirical data. The quantitative data consists of surveys on the project level and are based on a multi-dimensional standard evaluation wherein the main participants evaluate each other's performances. The client, project consultant and main contractor evaluated the designer's performance. The data of the study consisted of a total of 892 evaluations. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the differences between the project participants' assessments based upon the different economic sizes of the projects. Findings - Contractors were satisfied with the designers' performance in small projects, whereas the client and the project consultant/manager rated the designers' performance most successful in large projects. This result may be due to small projects are typically simple and less complex, in which case design solutions are generally well-defined. Nonetheless, the participants' level of satisfaction follows the same factors. The main problems in the designers' performance were related to the design content: the flawlessness and comprehensiveness, as well as the compatibility and consistency of designs. These factors were emphasized particularly in the client's low satisfaction of the designer's performance. However, project participants were satisfied with the collaboration with designers; however, room for improvement could be found in internal communication and collaboration within the design teams. The findings illustrated that the assessment of the success rate of a project was party-specific, which was clearly affected by the size of the project, as large projects appeared to be more complex than smaller ones. Practical implications - The findings suggested that there is a need to develop project-specific practices in managing multidisciplinary design teams. Additionally, particularly in large projects, designers should focus more on solving problems and design requirements occurring at the construction site. However, this should be implemented in such a way that this does not interfere with the design activities conducted with the client and project management. While client satisfaction is low in the small projects, designers should focus more on customer-oriented methods to serve client needs better. Originality/value - In construction project management studies, there is a need to measure the importance that various participants assign to different success factors. Since project success factors depend on project type, a more project-specific approach is suggested to identify the main parameters for measuring project success. This study provides a holistic approach of the designers' performance, which contributes to the theory of project success and designers' performance improvement.

The project employed a Collaborative Website (CoWeb), which allowed easy creation and modification of webpages without any security measures. Students posted their designs at several points during the term and six distant expert consultants provided critiques. This project demonstrates that a relatively simple representation tool, one that allowed students and critics to interact on editable webpages, can usefully open up the design space of the architecture studio. However, care is needed in understanding how computer tools relate to the tasks and rituals of interaction that go on in everyday architecture studio pedagogy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	FUNK, JL				FUNK, JL			JAPANESE PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES - A SUMMARY AND PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES	This paper summarizes the current literature on Japanese product development strategies such as multifunctional problem solving, close relationships with suppliers and customers, incremental improvement, and learning and it develops several propositions about how Japanese firms might be implementing these strategies differently than U.S. firms. It uses a detailed case study of Mitsubishi's Semiconductor Equipment Department, published material on Japanese and U.S. product development methods and organization structure, a second case study of Yokogawa Electric, and the author's experience as an internal consultant for a large U.S. manufacturing firm to develop these propositions. These sources suggest that Japanese firms are implementing these strategies using a unique combination of organic and mechanistic mechanisms. Japanese organizational characteristics, such as open offices, product-oriented organizations, and decentralized decision making, suggest a more organic method of implementation while characteristics such as high levels of formalization, detailed schedules, and elaborate temporal and spatial office structures suggest a more mechanistic method of implementation than are used by U.S. firms.

Factors leading to construction projects' failure in Jordon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Jordanian construction industry; project failure; construction projects; Drewin's Open Conversion System	COST OVERRUNS; DELAY FACTORS; MANAGEMENT	The construction industry is contemplated as one of the most essential and supportive pillars of the business environment in Jordan. Notwithstanding, the construction industry continues to struggle to achieve higher levels of success. An increasing number of projects in the construction industry have failed. However, research on the causes of failure is scarce. Thus, this study aims to identify the main factors and causes for construction projects' failure in Jordan. To fulfil the study objectives, 50 factors were recognized through a literature review and were categorized referring to Drewin's Open Conversion System; the most widely identified factors were assessed using complied data in a survey of construction industry contractors, consultant engineers and clients, and senior experts' interviews in the sector. The results show that major factors leading to construction projects' failure are related to the internal hierarchy of the system, especially that of the contractor.

J	YISA, SB; NDEKUGRI, IE; AMBROSE, B				YISA, SB; NDEKUGRI, IE; AMBROSE, B			MARKETING FUNCTION IN UK CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING AND PROFESSIONAL FIRMS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The failure of construction firms to adopt modern management systems has been remarked on by many authors. The marketing function has come in for particular criticism. This inadequate attention to marketing is also manifested in the paucity of reported research and helpful general literature on the subject. This paper reports on research carried out to address this problem. After a thorough literature review, a questionnaire survey of construction firms was undertaken to investigate their current marketing strategies and practices. The survey results indicate that firms are increasingly realizing the importance of marketing, with contractors being ahead of professional firms in the planning and implementation of marketing activities. It is however noted that marketing is being conducted in an ad hoc manner. Only one out of three firms surveyed employ marketing professionals or make use of services of external marketing consultants. There is a need for better understanding of what marketing really is and ways of improving its planning and implementation by both professionals firms and contractors.

However, most of the traditional KM methods suffer from their "reactive mode" of problem solving. To cope with this problem, a newly developed model, the Integrated Proactive Knowledge Management Model (IPKMM), is proposed in this paper. A leading engineering consulting firm in Taiwan was selected as a case study to implement the proposed model. The system implementation of IPKMM, the Integrated Proactive Knowledge Management System (IPKMS), is verified with real world cases. A novel Business Intelligence Index (BII) is also proposed in this paper to evaluate the relative competitiveness of different KM models. It is confirmed from the case study that IPKMM can significantly improve the efficiency of problem-solving and the competitiveness of an engineering consulting firm in the service market. This study demonstrates that IPKMM has great potential in enhancing emergent problem-solving for engineering consultants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The advice of several organizations and researchers is summarized to describe expectations for ideal constructability. Actual current constructability practice, based on results and analysis of a Constructability State of Practice survey, is described. Approximately 100 owners, architects, engineers, consultants, contractors, and construction managers answered the survey's ten questions and provided written comments. The results provide a picture of current constructability practices in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry and progress in recent years. Major conclusions include: (1) constructability has gained acceptance throughout the industry; (2) constructability efforts are clearly beginning in early project phases; (3) a wide variety of constructability techniques and new technologies are being implemented; and (4) obstacles to improving constructability remain, but may be changing. Finally, recommendations are provided based on areas where constructability practice can still be improved. This report is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers.

The process could also be adapted to the needs of other project participants, and many points referred to in the article can be directly applied to them. Any project risk management process must be tailored to the particular circumstances of the project and of the organization undertaking it. First, the article explains a complete or generic project risk management process to be undertaken by organizations with the highest level of risk management maturity in the largest and most complex construction projects. After that, factors influencing possible simplifications of the generic process are identified, and simplifications are proposed for some cases. Then the application to a real, project is summarized. As a final validation, a Delphi analysis has been developed to assess the project risk management methodology explained here, and the results are presented.

However, there is no consensus on the relative severity of various causes of delay because severity may change with respect to project characteristics, such as the type of project and/or procurement type. Public-private partnership (PPP) has been utilized extensively in recent years, and the number of public construction works worldwide that adopted the PPP has increased gradually. However, the delay causes specific to PPPs have not been investigated deeply. Moreover, the perceptions of different stakeholders on causes of delay in PPP projects have never been investigated, although the perception difference between stakeholders is considered an important issue in delay management. In this study, the perceptions of three key stakeholdersnamely, consultants, the private sector, and the public sectoron delay causes in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects performed in Turkey, which is one of the leading countries in terms of number of PPP projects and the total value of PPP projects, were investigated. The delay causes specific to BOT projects were evaluated by conducting a workshop to determine the causes of delay in the Turkish market. The identified delay causes were evaluated using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) by 11 participants who represent consultants, the private sector, and the public sector. The correlations between the respondents were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This study showed that the most important delay causes are related to the uncertainties and changes. In particular, private sector participants emphasized the importance of certainty on political and governmental issues and minimization of changes in design to avoid delays in BOT projects. In contrast, the respondents from the public sector proposed that a detailed feasibility study and preliminary plan should be prepared and the transfer stage should be planned carefully. Finally, different perceptions were observed among the stakeholders at the stages where the collaboration of the stakeholders is limited.

J	Ling, FYY				Ling, FYY			Key determinants of performance of design-bid-build projects in Singapore	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						design-bid-build; performance criteria; performance management; quality control; selection criteria; success factors; Singapore	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; MODEL	What are the factors affecting the performance of design-bid-build projects? Ten performance metrics and 60 factors are identified that project team members can use to measure and manage the success levels of construction projects in four broad categories: cost, time, quality and administrative burden. A survey and correlation analysis of 65 design-bid-build projects in Singapore is used to suggest the factors that affect each performance metric significantly. Contractor characteristics are the key determinants affecting the highest number of performance metrics. The most significant variable is the contractor's past record for completing projects on budget and to an acceptable level of quality. Based on this evidence, it is recommended that clients and consultants pay closer attention to a wider array of characteristics (not just the initial price) involving contractor selection. Another key determinant is the project character with the most important variable being the percentage of repetitive elements.

J	Sturts, CS; Griffis, FH				Sturts, CS; Griffis, FH			Pricing engineering services	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DESIGN BUILD	Technology has an incredible impact on the pricing and profitability of engineering services. Historically, pricing for engineering services has been based on labor-hours. However, some in the industry have experienced at least a tenfold increase in efficiency because of computer-aided design and the development of three-dimensional computer models. Consequently, the labor-hours spent on a project no longer adequately represent the value of the engineering services rendered. There is a need for engineers, designers, and consultants to revise old, and develop new, pricing strategies. The writers discuss current and foreseeable issues and constraints facing engineers today. On April 16, 2003, the ASCE San Francisco Younger Member Forum, (YMF) met to discuss the topic of pricing for engineering and consulting services. The presentation, discussion, and conclusions as well as a discussion of the current state of the marketplace and future technical developments in the industry are included in this paper. Pricing and contracting strategies are discussed and analyzed, and a call is made to industry, academics, and practitioners alike to address the pricing and perception problems outlined in this paper.

J	Cole-Colander, C				Cole-Colander, C			Designing the customer experience	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						client; common language; customer focus; design; design quality		As the role of the professional changes, the importance of 'the client' and 'the user' is increasing. Two initiatives in the UK have sought to improve design quality by bridging the gap between the client and the user on the one hand, and the client and the designer on the other. These initiatives, 'Designing the Customer Experience' and 'Design Quality Indicators' (DQIs), seek to address the divergent goals and impenetrable language that often inhibit communication between client and architect. Designing the Customer Experience aimed at transferring design thinking from the retail sector and led to an Agenda for Change, which included an investigation into how to find a common language between clients and their design consultants. The DQIs build on this agenda and provide a tool for the uninitiated as well as the professional to allow each to express and evaluate the design quality of a building. The extent to which these initiatives have been and potentially can be successful in changing professional relationships with client and user and so improving design quality is assessed.

J	Vidogah, W; Ndekugri, I				Vidogah, W; Ndekugri, I			Improving management of claims: Contractors' perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION	There is high incidence of disputes arising from construction contract claims. Even with the most expert understanding of construction contract clauses and the most equitable risk-allocation regime, claims will continue to present problems if they are poorly managed in practice. The research reported in this paper was aimed at identifying shortcomings, and their causes, in claims-management practice. It consisted of a comprehensive review of literature on the subject, a postal questionnaire survey of, and interviews with, contractors and consultants, and case studies of claims on projects. A major finding is that claims management is not treated as a management function on the same footing as estimating, planning, scheduling, and cost control. It is poorly resourced and performed in an ad hoc manner. As a consequence claims-related issues are too often put in abeyance until project completion when necessary resources are released from recognized functions. Issues, documents, and information normally at the center of disputes have been identified. These have to be the focus in decision making, in training, and in redesigning relevant company information systems, and must change management strategies.

Differentiation of Evaluation Criteria in Design-Build and Construction Manager at Risk Procurements	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Procurement; Bidding; Qualifications-based selection (QBS); Best-value (BV) selection; Design-build (DB); Construction manager; Evaluation criteria	MODEL; QUALIFICATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; REQUESTS	The procurement processes used in the alternative contracting methods of design-build (DB) and construction manager at risk (CMAR) are heavily focused on best-value and qualifications-based selection. However, previous research has not examined the effectiveness of owners' evaluation criteria in differentiating among competing bidders. The objective of this study was to document the selection outcomes of the bidders in DB and CMAR projects and identify which evaluation criteria had the greatest differentiation in scores for competing bidders. The results were compared with previous research on the procurement of architectural and engineering consultants and design-bid-build (DBB) contractors. The study sample consisted of 362 bidders for 63 DB and CMAR projects in the United States and Canada. The statistical analysis results showed that scores on interviews and technical proposals had the greatest differentiation, while cost proposal scores had minimal differentiation. These findings provide practical guidance for owners and bidders regarding how to prioritize evaluation criteria and how to respond to them.

Using Gaussian and hyperbolic distributions for quality improvement in construction: Case study approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SIGNALS	The Gaussian distribution and the 6 sigma principle have been widely used in the field of construction quality management with great success. This paper proposes a theoretical study on a new hyperbolic distribution using the 6 sigma principle to improve quality in construction management. The hyperbolic and Gaussian distributions are then numerically compared by estimating their important statistical properties, such as population in range, number of defects, yield percentage, and defects per million opportunities. The impacts of these factors are briefly discussed to give guidance to organizations in the construction industry on how to lower cost and improve project quality by prevention. A case study showing the cost data of a construction consultant company is presented. The data's population in range and defects per million opportunities are estimated using Gaussian and hyperbolic distributions. In this particular case study, the hyperbolic distribution is shown to be more effective in quality improvement by prevention than the Gaussian distribution. This also validates the hyperbolic distribution as a suitable distribution for construction quality management.	[Tam, Vivian W.

Cost overrun in the Malaysian construction industry projects: A deeper insight	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Malaysia; Construction industry; Project management; Cost variance; Project cost data	PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; TIME	The construction industry drives economic growth and development in Malaysia, but unfortunately, its projects often suffer from cost overruns (that is, negative cost variance such that final project cost exceeds contract sum). This can lead to conflict and litigation, or in the extreme, projects may even be abandoned. To better understand this phenomenon, a questionnaire survey of Malaysian quantity-surveying consultants was undertaken to obtain project characteristics and cost performance data, in relation to a sample of 359 recently completed construction projects. Data were analysed in terms of project financial outturn based on: contract values; project sector; type of project; procurement route; nature of projects; and tendering method used. The findings offer stakeholders descriptive statistical cost performance information in relation to these characteristics. These statistics will support first-order project management decision-making within Malaysia particularly; and internationally more generally, with a view to helping minimise project cost variance in the future.

Senior construction professionals in Hong Kong were interviewed in a two-stage survey to identify a comprehensive list of factors (and their indicators) for measuring client satisfaction in the context of engineering consulting services. From the survey data, the clients' level of satisfaction with those factors and the indicators were prioritized. The resulting list of priorities showed the collective opinion of 47 senior and experienced professionals working in the field on what services provided by consulting firms were the most or least satisfactory in Hong Kong. The data obtained from the 47 professionals were further employed to establish a client satisfaction function using multiple linear regression for deriving strategies for consultants to achieve client satisfaction. The approach of this research is useful to engineering consulting firms, not only in Hong Kong, but also in other places for identifying and improving on their own weak areas to enhance the quality of services for their clients.

This shift toward alternative project delivery systems, such as design/build, has resulted in demand for additional guidance for owners and practitioners. This paper provides the results of an industrywide survey and three in-depth case studies. The survey results indicate large-scale growth in the use of design/build project delivery for water and wastewater facilities throughout the United States. The findings from the case studies indicate that common practices exist with regard to selecting a delivery system, contracting, allocating risk, evaluating proposals, determining the level of design in the request for proposals, using consultants, establishing trust, identifying key players, and permitting. These results serve as best practices for owners and practitioners using design/build delivery for the first time.

However, the process of implementing new technology involves numerous challenges, and the performance of new technology can be impaired when unidentified risk factors are present during implementation. A complete understanding of the risk factors can enable BIM users to execute early responses to the potential risks, thus increasing the possibility that BIM is implemented successfully. In this study, 13 risk factors related to the technical, management, personnel, financial, and legal aspects of BIM adoption were identified. Based on the results of a questionnaire survey distributed to architects, engineering consultants, academics, and construction companies in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry in Taiwan, relationships between risk factors were identified using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method.

To achieve the objectives, a literature review and questionnaire survey was conducted and data were collected from 381 projects performed by 51 companies. The results confirmed that the client contributed most to rework. 41 of the 51 companies (80.4%) experienced CRR, and 226 of the 381 projects (59.3%) experienced CRR, which increased project cost by 7.1% and caused 3.3 weeks' delay on the average. Additionally, "replacement of materials by the client" was the cause with the highest frequency of occurrence, while "change of plans or scope by the client" contributed most to CRR and exerted most impact on project cost, schedule and quality performance.

Although project governance has been widely studied with the aim of improving participants' relational behavior, limited research examines the distinct effectiveness of various governance mechanisms on influencing relational behavior, especially in megaprojects. Through examining three varieties of governance mechanisms-contract, trust, and institutional support-a hierarchical moderated regression analysis has been used to explore the impact of each of the governance mechanisms in facilitating the relational behavior of megaproject participants and further team performance. The analysis is based on data collected from 202 contractors and consultants working at megaprojects in China. Results unveiled that both contractual term specificity and its interaction with trust can facilitate relational behavior. Project uncertainty moderates the relationship between governance mechanisms and relational behavior, thus affecting project team performance.

After collecting data from 135 BIM experts from various capital projects in the mainland of China, 95 value flows among 7 BIM-related stakeholders were quantified, including 69% intangible value and 31% tangible value flows. Owners were then selected as focal organizations to analyze 49,775 value cycles starting from and ending with owners. 9 top-ranked value cycles, 3 most important stakeholders (BIM consultants, general contractors, and subcontractors), and 20 top value flows were identified and discussed to enable owners to formulate effective strategies to drive BIM value realization. These results can provide a visualized tool to quantify the perceived value of BIM stakeholders and to formulate value-based strategies to encourage the "buy-in" decisions by stakeholders.

J	Johnstone, S; Wilkinson, A; Dainty, A				Johnstone, Stewart; Wilkinson, Adrian; Dainty, Andrew			Reconceptualizing the Service Paradox in Engineering Companies: Is HR a Missing Link?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Engineering industries; human resource management (HRM); service; solutions; strategy	PRODUCT-SERVICE; BUSINESS SERVICES; PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGIES; AEROSPACE; SUPPORT	Many global engineering organizations have gradually shifted away from the provision of tangible products toward the provision of high-value-combined product-service solutions. This business paradigm is purported to represent a key strategic opportunity for such firms, and has attracted the attention of practitioners, consultants, and researchers. However, it has also been recognized that many firms fail to generate increased financial returns, the so-called the "service paradox." Despite an emerging international research literature which alludes to cultural and human resource challenges, few studies have explicitly explored such issues from a human resource (HR) perspective. Informed by two in-depth case studies of global engineering organizations in the U.K., this paper examines the HR challenges and reveals the complex realities of enacting product-service (PS) strategies in practice. It reveals that even where services have proved profitable, firms may still encounter various HR challenges, and struggle to fully exploit their service strategies. Addressing such challenges may represent a key enabler in delivering integrated product-services in organizations attempting to mesh distinctive engineering and service paradigms.

Causes, Effects, Benefits, and Remedies of Change Orders on Public Construction Projects in Oman	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Change order; Delay; Project completion; Cost overrun; Oman		Change orders are usually issued to cover variations in scope of work, material quantities, design errors, and unit rate changes. This paper discusses variations in public construction projects in Oman by investigating causes of variations, studying their effects on the project, identifying the beneficial parties, and suggesting remedies to alleviate related problems. Tasks included an analysis of four actual case studies and conducting a field survey via a questionnaire. It was determined that the client's additional works and modifications to design were the most important factors causing change orders, followed by the nonavailability of construction manuals and procedures. The most important effects of change orders on the project were found to be the schedule delays, disputes, and cost overruns. The contractor was found to be the party most benefiting from the change orders followed by the consultant and then the client. A set of remedial actions were suggested and respondents viewed that the revision of registration of consulting offices would be the most important action followed by establishing standard documents for design procedures and building a national database about soil conditions and services.

This study mainly aims to link knowledge enabling factors (KEFs) to various organizational performance outcomes (OPOs) of project-based firms. Through a questionnaire survey, data about KEFs and OPOs are collected from project-based firms in the Vietnamese construction industry. First, the performance degree of KEFs in project-based firms is explored using mean score method. Then, the linkage between KEFs and OPOs is explored using regression analysis. Accordingly, various shortlists of important KEFs that may significantly affect various organizational performance aspects measured by different OPOs are identified. Some key KEFs that may have a significant effect on many OPOs are also highlighted. The results of this study may provide project-based firms with some useful information about the effects of KEFs on various organizational performance aspects. Hence, project-based firms could formulate appropriate KEFs-based management strategies to improve various organizational performance aspects effectively.

The aim of this paper is to elaborate significance, role and types of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in the construction industry and show how different management perspectives perceive the indicators. A literature review was carried out in order to generate a listing of KPIs, used among academe and the industry. Afterwards, using surveys and semi-structured interviews, the data was gathered from more than 30 South-East European construction companies. Results were analyzed, producing a final set of 37 indicators. This study identified a low level of awareness of KPI models and performance management processes among the companies. Furthermore, the analysis showed a substantial difference in perception of KPIs among investors, consultants and contractors, which consequently led to a compiling list of KPIs. The top ten KPI's are: Quality, Cost, Number of investor interferences, Changes in project support, Time increase, Client satisfaction, Employees' satisfaction, Innovation and learning, Time and Identification of client's interest. The paper concludes with final remarks and guidelines for the implementation of KPIs in practice.

The qualitative research strategy was adopted, using in-depth face to face interviews. Participants were seven each of Contractors and Consultants using data saturation to limit the number, through purposive sampling technique. Data were analyzed using content analysis technique. The most critical impacts of accidents and hazards on the GCI were identified as slow-down of work, increase in cost of project and poor performance of work. The findings of the study provide knowledge on impacts of accidents and hazards to stakeholders of the GCI and the government in general. Serious steps should be taken by stakeholders to enforce construction health and safety (CHS) practices on construction sites to reduce the high frequency rate of accidents and injuries and the high incidence rate in the GCI. The courts should be encouraged to impose fair and adequate compensation on employers and occasionally punitive or exemplary damages to deter and prevent occurrence of accidents and hazards at construction sites. CHS-related issues have to be given the needed research and academic attention in order to reduce accidents and hazards on sites.

Understanding the Interplay of Organizational Climate and Leadership in Construction Innovation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Innovation; Leadership; Innovation climate; Learning transfer climate	TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; ORIENTATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ANTECEDENTS; COMPETENCE; CREATIVITY	Innovation can create value for an organization and its stakeholders. In developing an innovation blueprint in complex contexts, such as construction, previous studies have alleged that transformational leadership is an important determinant of innovation. This study aims to investigate the role of innovation climate and learning transfer climate on the relationships between leadership and innovation in the construction sector. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 158 returns from 500 respondents (client developers, construction consultants, and contractors in China). The findings reveal that (1) support for innovation (innovation climate factor) moderates the effects of intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration (transformational leadership factor), and contingent rewards (transactional leadership factor) on innovation, and (2) performance self-efficacy (learning transfer climate factor) moderates the effects of intellectual stimulation (transformational leadership factor) and contingent rewards (transactional leadership factor) on innovation. This study reveals the intertwining relationships between leadership, climates, and innovation and lays a platform for further longitudinal, qualitative studies. Managerial implications are discussed; different leadership and management climates need to be strategically adopted and nurtured in dynamic organizational environments.

It has been well received by construction professionals for its guidance in solving delay and disruption issues. This research attempts (1)to compare the Protocol's core features with the existing references for the contracting parties and (2)to determine the feasible use of the Protocol's distinguished features into the Malaysian construction industry as a case study. The distinguishing features were identified after reviewing and comparing the local contract forms and the Protocol. Subsequently, the questionnaire survey was carried out with local developers, contractors, and consultants based on an inductive reasoning approach. Statistical and variance analyses were conducted to determine the acceptance level of the Protocol's features. The results show that most of the features were agreed to by the respondents; for instance, the guidelines on float identification, concurrency identification, proper procedures on work program, and so on. The findings render useful information for future contract drafting by incorporating the guidelines into local contract forms, particularly for commonwealth countries.

These innovations may be in the form of safer, less labour intensive, or cheaper methods and processes. The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the Australian construction industry is providing an environment where user-based innovation is being supported and implemented. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative study was undertaken to provide an insight into actual experiences of the implementation of user-based innovation. The data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews providing case studies on multiple aspects of the implementation of innovative construction technologies. The cases involved a cross section of advances, including product, tool, and system technologies. Findings - The main motivation behind developing the technologies was problem solving. The associated industries of manufacturing and retail, as well as consultants within the construction industry present the greatest barriers to implementation. Originality/value - This research provides a better understanding of the factors that are preventing the successful implementation of user-based innovative construction technologies in small firms.

J	Ben Bonham, M				Ben Bonham, Mary			Leading by example: new professionalism and the government client	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						built environment; client leadership; innovation; integrated project delivery; professional practice; sustainable construction	PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; INNOVATION	The capacity of government client bodies to lead other industry actors in the creation of a more sustainable built environment is assessed. A framework is introduced that records the legislation, guiding principles and policies influencing government clients towards new professional practices embracing dynamic interactions between people, process and technology. The framework is used to analyse case studies related to two US government client organizations: the General Services Administration (GSA) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The study finds that GSA and NREL are actively seeking innovation and influencing their consultants, contractors and other US government agencies through their policies and programmes, notably by piloting new professional practices associated with integrated project delivery and open communication. The initiatives and their effectiveness are further studied in a broader, international context of emerging best professional practices.

J	Chen, WT; Liao, SL; Lu, CS; Mortis, L				Chen, Wei Tong; Liao, Shen Li; Lu, Chun Sheng; Mortis, Leonard			Evaluating satisfaction with PCM services for school construction: A case study of primary school projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						PCM; Satisfaction evaluation; School construction	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT	The lack of school construction professionals in Taiwan typically leads to poor construction scheduling and quality. Professional construction management (PCM) is thus introduced to minimize defects in school construction projects. However, satisfaction with PCM services remains unknown because there is no evaluation for such services. This study presents a satisfaction evaluation model for PCM services based on client needs. Based on the five phases of a project life cycle (PLC), the proposed model was used to measure satisfaction with PCM services provided to 19 school construction projects in central Taiwan. It was found that the clients of school construction projects were seeking greater PCM assistance during the planning and construction phases than during any other PLC phase. Compared with other phases, the bid and tender phase received the least demand for PCM assistance. Furthermore, the PCM consultant failed to provide consistent service quality, especially for services during the planning and design phases. Applying PCM to school construction projects is believed to be a feasible approach for improving the quality of Taiwanese school construction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The existent literature has predominantly focused on risk misallocation as the allocation of risk to the inappropriate party. Notwithstanding, risk misallocation includes use of inappropriate mechanisms, incomprehensive allocation and use of inappropriate resources. This paper developed causal networks resulting in risk misallocation. The causal networks are developed from 15 purposive semi-structured interviews from a heterogeneous sample and supplemented sequentially by 198 questionnaire survey responses in the building sector selected randomly from construction clients, contractors and consultants. The causal networks depict how the processes of risk identification, risk analysis, risk control measures and risk allocation could lead to risk misallocations. The findings suggest that the risk control/response stage has potential for various forms of risk misallocation in comparison to any other stage. Networks presented are a basis for improvement in professional practice for construction professionals as they manage risk on various projects.

J	Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM				Rahman, MM; Kumaraswamy, MM			Relational selection for collaborative working arrangements	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; PRINCIPLES; CONTRACTS; SUCCESS	Procurement arrangements for collaborative working arrangements (CWAs) should arguably provide suitable protocols under which different project partners can interact effectively and maintain harmonious relationships and mobilize their collective efforts towards common project objectives. Technical abilities of different project partners for carrying out the works are important. Also critical are their "soft" or "relational" qualities to work jointly and synergistically in the project team. The aims of the reported study are to examine the importance of a single set of different factors for selecting consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and clients for CWAs; and to assess the relative importance of various factors and strategies for building CWAs. Data were collected internationally from 17 countries through a questionnaire survey and statistical analyses were conducted. Results attribute varying degrees of importance to various factors for selecting different project partners and suggest an interrelated and consolidated selection approach in general, except for "selecting" clients. The study confirms that trust and business ethics related factors and strategies are more helpful for CWAs than some others. Outcomes of this study are expected to benefit both industry practitioners and researchers, in exploring, designing, and implementing suitable CWAs and selecting appropriate project partners.

In the United States, ASCE assigned a near failing grade of D- to the condition of water system infrastructure. Therefore. municipalities face a great challenge of managing the expected large replacement and new installation projects of water mains. This research aims at designing a robust model ill order to assess the condition and predict the performance of water mains. Data are collected from three different Canadian municipalities: (1) Moncton (New Brunswick): (2) London (Ontario) and (3) Longueiul (Quebec). An integrated model and framework, using all analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and artificial neural network (ANN), are developed. Ill addition. all automated, User-friendly, web-based infrastructure management tool (CR-Predictor) is developed based oil the integrated AHP/ANN model to assess water main condition. The developed tool and models are validated in which the), show robust results (98.51%)-the average validity percent. They are expected to benefit academics and practitioners (Municipal engineers, Consultants, and contractors) to prioritize inspection and rehabilitation planning for existing water mains.

J	BETTS, M				BETTS, M			SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PROJECT-MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								There is increasing evidence that the nature of corporate planning in business is moving toward external strategic concepts of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). There is some evidence that this is beginning to happen in the larger contracting and development enterprises in construction. The construction sector in most economies is still largely dominated by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). There has been little evidence of SCA being applied by SMEs. It is argued by some that such concepts are inapplicable to the SME segment of the construction industry. This case study documents the results of a strategic-planning workshop undertaken for an Australian project-management consultancy. The paper describes the background to the company and gives full details of the strategic-planning discussions and assessments made. These resulted in a business strategy being identified. The extent to which this strategy was implemented and whether it resulted in an SCA for the company is considered in light of events at the strategic-planning session. The result is a detailed example of the way that strategic-planning concepts can apply at the SME level and an evaluation of the extent of their success in implementation.

Beyond the 'iron triangle': Stakeholder perception of key performance indicators (KPIs) for large-scale public sector development projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project performance management; Large construction projects; Key performance indicators (KPIs); Thai construction industry		Performance measurement criteria vary from project to project. Despite much work on the subject, there is no commonly agreed framework of performance measurement on mega projects. To bridge this gap, this research targets to investigate the perception of the key performance indicators (KPIs) in the context of a large construction project in Thailand. The study explores the significance of key performance indicators in perspective of various construction stakeholders (client, consultants, and contractors). Findings indicate that the traditional measures of the iron triangle (on-time, under-budget and according to specifications) are no more applicable to measuring performance on large public sector development projects. Other performance indicators such as safety, efficient use of resources, effectiveness, satisfaction of stakeholders, and reduced conflicts and disputes are increasingly becoming important. This implies that the Thai construction industry is slowly departing from the traditional quantitative performance measurement to a rather mix of both quantitative and qualitative performance measurement on large-scale public sector development projects.

Mobilizing Institutional Knowledge for International Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institutional differences; Institutional knowledge; International business; Knowledge management; Organizations	DYNAMIC THEORY; FIRMS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY	Multinational engineering consultants, contractors, and real estate developers work on projects in various countries, encountering many challenges that arise from cross-national differences. These projects frequently bring together diverse participants in an unfamiliar environment. In these situations, firms are exposed to different "institutions"-regulations, norms, and cognitive-cultural beliefs-that can increase misunderstandings, delays, and costs. Knowledge of these institutional elements is critical to create a project that is both locally sustainable and profitable for the firm. Departing from institutional theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, we conduct exploratory research based on interviews from informants in 15 firms to identify the methods that multinational real estate developers, contractors, and engineers use to transfer and mobilize institutional knowledge for their global projects. We contribute to theory by adding to the developing literature that uses institutional theory to examine differences on global projects and by analyzing the specific methods firms use to transfer institutional knowledge internally, across projects and divisions. Ultimately, this research, combined with the work of others, can develop new processes for firms engaged in international projects to enhance their mobilization of institutional knowledge, and thereby improve the outcomes of international projects.

However, currently it is hard to quantify the results and make a proper determination of the quality of the PCM design service because the evaluation mechanism and procedures have not been completely implemented yet. To deal with the problem, this study investigates owners' opinions and thereby establishes the representative performance indicators of PCM design service. An effectiveness analysis method and a neural network method are successfully combined, so as to construct an evaluation approach of PCM service performance in the design stage. This approach can offer a listing of rank and level of design service performance in PCM projects, and further provides a simple appraisal table, so that the owner can effectively measure the performance of PCM design service. Finally, through the case study, this approach is verified to be reasonable and acceptable in practice. The approach can be an effective tool when measuring the PCM design service performance and can help owners to evaluate and choose PCM consultants in the design stage. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

How to successfully implement an ERP system in an organization is always a hot research topic for researchers as well as a pending problem for an organization that wants to implement it. This research is a case study on the selection of system suppliers and contract negotiation during the ERP implementation of a local construction company in Taiwan. After reviewing the common key success factors discussed in the literature, this study discussed seven issues: coding system, working process reengineering, priority of ERP functionality implementation, customization, participant roles, consultant role and performance level of subcontractor, which also affected the implementation. Lessons learned from the case study in discussed seven issues are valuable for a construction company in deciding to implement an ERP system. This research suggests that additional case studies are necessary for the successful application of ERP systems in the construction industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Initially, a detailed comparative review was carried out to identify the most significant causes of delay at the international level. Based on the latter and the opinions of distinguished members of the industry, a survey questionnaire was designed and distributed to a total number of 242 members of the Cyprus Scientific and Technical Chamber. The analysis of the results obtained by 54 respondents indicated particular common-practice issues that affect completion in construction projects in Cyprus, such as duration of delays, Extension of time (EOT) awards and agreements, recording methods and programmes of works. Ultimately, by using the importance of delay causes as perceived by the respondents it was determined that in Cyprus construction industry 'variations requested by the client' (70%), 'mistakes and missing information from consultants' drawings' (55%), 'low productivity' (55%), 'difficulties in financing of the works by the contractor' (52%) and 'inadequate programming of works' (50%) to be the main causes of delay in Cyprus. Based on the results, specific practices are recommended for the control of delay in the completion of construction projects.

In this regard, the aim of this study is to identify the most frequent, severe, and important causes of schedule delays affecting public constructions projects in Burkina Faso to enhance the managerial capability of project managers. This research was conducted by questionnaire survey to solicit the causes of schedule delays from 140 Burkinabe experts (clients, contractors, and consultants). After analyzing their frequency, severity, and importance index using a quantitative statistical method, the top five most important delay factors were ranked as follows: financial capability of the contractor, financial difficulties of the owner, equipment availability of the contractor, slow payments for completed work, and poor subcontractor performance by the contractor. A comparison of the causes of schedule delays in 11 countries to validate the results of the study showed that financial capability of the contractor was not only the most encountered factor in delays for Burkina Faso's construction industry, but also appeared in many other Asian and African countries.

However, little is known about this conjecture in the business-to-business (B-to-B) service context: whether B-to-B service firms utilize external knowledge and ideas for innovation, and if so, which types of partners they collaborate with in their innovation activities. This research is a step toward filling this void. Tobit regression analysis on secondary data was performed using various types of external partners as sources of innovation to determine the innovation performance of transportation and logistics service firms. The results show that customers, suppliers, and competitors (in descending order) contribute to service improvement, and customers contribute to the development of services that are new to the firm. In contrast, the use of universities and consultants as sources of innovation does not seem to immediately affect innovation performance in the transportation and logistics service industry.

J	Loosemore, M; Richard, J				Loosemore, Martin; Richard, Justin			Valuing innovation in construction and infrastructure Getting clients past a lowest price mentality	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Innovation; Construction; Performance; Collaboration; Bidding		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to continue the discussion about the actual and potential role of clients in driving more innovation in the construction sector through interviews with some of the Australian construction industry's leading clients, contractors and consultants. Design/methodology/approach - This paper synthesises previously disconnected literature reports interviews with 46 of Australia's leading clients, contractors and consultants. Findings - The findings confirm the importance of client leadership, yet also shows that lowest price remains the dominant selection criterion in tenders. Many clients lack the insight and tools to play a leadership role and are unwilling and unable to employ strategies to foster better performance and more innovation because of internal governance constraints, a poor understanding of how built assets contribute to core business objectives and a narrow understanding of their central role in driving innovation. The authors conclude that in reality, the potential for investment in innovation is restricted to the relatively few large companies who are lucky enough to deal with sophisticated clients which procure buildings on a frequent basis. The vast majority of the industry are left to work with clients who procure buildings very rarely, who want the lowest possible price for their investment and who do not see them as a key long-term asset in the success of their core business. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on 46 interviews. It represents and external perspective on client leadership. Further research is needed with clients to validate the results and provide a counterpoint. Practical implications - The practical implications of this research are that clients need to be more wary of equating low price with good value. While the merits of competition are widely lauded, the research shows that clients can extract more value from the construction industry by an integrated project strategy that does not lock-in solutions too early, that provides scope and time for innovation to happen, which encourages collaboration, early involvement and which distributes risk and opportunity fairly and openly. According to the research, many clients are unwilling and unable to do this because of internal governance constraints, a lack of tools to value innovation in bids, a poor understanding of how built assets contribute to core business objectives and a narrow understanding of their central role in driving innovation. Social implications - Given the planned infrastructure programme in Australia and many other countries, the potential productivity and efficiency benefits to be derived from this research are significant. These saved resources would then be available for further investments in social and economic infrastructure. Originality/value - This paper's originality lied in the synthesis of previously disconnected literature on construction innovation, efficiency and productivity.

Methodology to extract underlying basic assumptions of a public sector construction project culture: an exploratory case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project culture; basic assumptions; exploratory case study; methodologies; sub-cultures; public sector; project team; Sri Lanka	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; PRIVATE-SECTOR; VALUES	Identifying underlying basic assumptions of a construction project team brings insightfulness to cultural studies and is useful for managing project changes. However, methodological issues create barriers to such studies due to difficulties in capturing basic assumptions. This paper adopts an exploratory case study of a public sector building construction project to identify an appropriate methodology for data collection and test the ability to analyse the collected data for the purpose of extracting underlying basic assumptions of a construction project culture. Data were collected using interviews and observations, and analysed by code-based content analysis. Research findings confirm the suitability of questioning on internal integration and external adaptation problems of the construction project team to extract basic assumptions while highlighting the necessity of questioning on conflicting and critical situations of the project. Accordingly, several basic assumptions for client and consultant sub-cultural groups were identified. The methodology proposed in this study can be extended to explore basic assumptions of contractor sub-cultural group and then of the whole project.	[Samaraweera, Aparna; Sandanayake, Y.

Empirical Framework for Making the Bid/No-Bid Decision	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bids; Decision making; Data analysis; Construction industry; Contractors; Bidding; Bid; no-bid; Decision making; Data envelopment analysis	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; UP SIZE DECISIONS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; FIRM PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; PROJECTS; MODEL; DEA; SELECTION; SYSTEM	Deciding whether or not to bid on a particular project is regarded as one of the major challenges faced by construction contractors. This decision-making problem involves the consideration of several factors. These factors are related to project, client, consultant, competitors, and market. Although several researchers have targeted the subject of bidding in construction, few of them have tackled the bid/no-bid problem in particular. The purpose of this paper is to propose an empirical framework for making the bid/no-bid decision. The proposed framework consists of two consecutive components. Component 1 determines key bidding factors that are considered by contractors when evaluating bids. Senior managers at top contracting organizations were interviewed to identify factors that affect the bid/no-bid decision. Component 2 utilizes data envelopment analysis (DEA) to make the bid/no-bid decision. The strengths of utilizing DEA include its input-output framework, which facilitates incorporating many factors in the decision-making process. The proposed framework offers construction contractors a systematic approach for making the bid/no-bid decision. The model is practically illustrated based on 39 bids that were collected from eight contractors.

Such notices allow parties to mitigate any potential impacts in terms of time and/or cost. Nevertheless, the time bar clause forfeits a contractor's claim, if the notice of claim is not submitted within the stipulated time in the contract, giving rise to numerous disputes. The purpose of this study is to identify the disputes surrounding the time bar clause in the FIDIC 1999 Red Book, which is an internationally used Standard Form of Contract (SFoC) for building and engineering works designed by the employer. After identifying the sources of disputes and modifications to the standard provisions via a comprehensive literature review, the researchers conducted an online questionnaire survey with 61 construction contract professionals (employers, contract consultants and contractors) and semi-structured interviews with four contract specialists to determine the level of agreement with the identified sources of disputes and modifications to standard provisions. Sources of disputes and modifications were ranked based on the Relative Agreement Index (RAI) from the survey. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed to identify agreement/disagreement and the reasons for the agreement/disagreement.

J	Lim, BTH; Loosemore, M				Lim, Benson T. H.; Loosemore, Martin			The effect of inter-organizational justice perceptions on organizational citizenship behaviors in construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Inter-organizational justice; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Project management	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; INFORMATIONAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS; COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR; CLAIMS PROCESS; WORKPLACE; MEDIATOR; ROLES	Project management literature has long argued that inter-organizational justice is a key driver of successful construction project delivery. It is argued that when people believe business transactions are fair, they are more likely to exhibit positive organizational citizenship behaviors such as working harmoniously, giving discretionary effort, respecting others, and collaborating to resolve problems. However, there has been little empirical evidence to support these assertions. To address this knowledge gap, an online survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers from across the construction project supply chain was undertaken. The results show that project participants' organizational citizenship behaviors are influenced by their perceived interpersonal justice in business transactions. However, the findings also offer a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and inter-connectedness of these relationships in showing how one type of inter-organizational justice acts on another in influencing project organizational citizenship behaviors. The results indicate that interpersonal justice is a key ingredient in bringing about positive organizational citizenship behaviors in construction projects and that project performance can be enhanced if project managers treat project participants with politeness, respect, and dignity.

The questions of how energy benchmarking is currently conducted, and how it might be improved using rapidly growing quantities of self-reported data, are examined. A case study of commercial office buildings in New York City demonstrates how the rapid growth in self-reported data presents both new opportunities and challenges for energy benchmarking for buildings. A critique is presented for the scoring methodology and data sources for Energy Star, one of the largest and most successful benchmarking certification schemes. Findings from recent studies are examined to illustrate how this certification currently works in the marketplace. Self-reported building energy data are rapidly growing in Portfolio Manager (the user interface to Energy Star) due to mandatory energy benchmarking laws, and can be used to improve Energy Star's current scoring methods. These self-reported data are tested and improved for analysis by applying theories and methods of data quality developed in computer science, statistics and data management. These new data constitute a critical building block for the development of energy efficiency policies, and will affect how government, consultants, and owners measure and compare building energy use.

Causes of claims in road construction projects in the UAE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						claims; construction industry; road projects; United Arab Emirates	MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; DISPUTES; DELAY	Claims are inevitable in construction projects and road construction projects in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are no exception. A claim is a request for time and/or monetary compensation for damages incurred by any party to the contract. The number and frequency of claims have increased over recent years due to the increase in the size and complexity of these projects. These claims result in cost overruns, schedule delays and adversarial relationships amongst the contracting parties. The objective of this paper is to identify and assess the most frequent causes of claims in road construction projects in the UAE in addition to the root causes that contribute to the occurrence of claims. Sixteen causes were identified through a literature review. A survey was then developed and distributed to construction professionals experienced in claims in road construction projects. Fifty-one surveys were completed. The reasons and their root causes were ranked based on the weighted average of the responses. Variation was identified as the most frequent cause of claims, followed by contractor's delay and inadequate site investigation before bidding. The results show that consultants and clients have strong agreement on the ranking of the claims and weak agreement with the contractors.

BIM for construction safety improvement in Gaza strip: awareness, applications and barriers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; application; barriers; safety performance; construction	MANAGEMENT	The objectives of this paper are to elicit the perception of contracting parties regarding building information modelling (BIM), the most important safety-related applications of BIM and the barriers to adopting BIM in the local construction industry. Data for this study were collected through a questionnaire survey. A total of 75 questionnaires were randomly distributed to contractors, owners and consultants, and 37 were returned, representing a 49% response rate. The findings indicated that 33% of the respondents had no knowledge of the concept of BIM, 28% of the respondents' organizations are not using BIM and if used it was implemented to a limited extent. The results indicated that 'hazard identification and minimization' and 'safety training and education' are the most important safety-related applications provided by BIM tools to improve safety performance in construction. Lack of universal use in the construction sector and insufficient training availability are the highest ranked barriers to adopting BIM in construction to improve safety. The research results may assist BIM developers to introduce the best applicable tools to improve safety performance in the construction industry. It is recommended that training courses be conducted regarding BIM concept and the benefits of its application in the construction industry.

Proper analysis of compensability and quantum of a delay event is of prime importance. Any delay analysis application can be considered as a result of the combination of contract documents, scheduler, record-keeping mechanism at the site, communication among project participants, delay analyst, and delay analysis methodology. The main purposes of this study are to identify the shortcomings frequently encountered in the implementation of delay analysis applications in all stages of a construction project, to address the responsible element, and to propose a set of rules to overcome these shortcomings and obtain accurate and reliable results. For this purpose, 17 shortcomings were identified. Moreover, an integrated approach is developed which is composed of a set of rules solving all of the identified shortcomings, and a flowchart guiding the parties from scratch until the end of the project. This study is unique in its nature as it encompasses all stages of a construction project that contribute to a delay analysis application. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Birgonul, M.

However, the number of projects using IPD remains small, partly because of the lack of a fair incentive scheme. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fair profit distribution scheme among stakeholders of IPD projects. This study uses cooperative game theory as the method for analyzing profit distribution among the designer, construction contractor, owner and BIM consultant. The Shapley value is used as the solution to the cooperative game theory because it can assess the marginal contribution of each stakeholder to the coalition. In addition, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are used to assess the risk levels of each stakeholder to modify the profit distribution based on the marginal contribution. A modified Shapley value model, which includes four categories of risk factors, i.e. operation, economic, profit and market risks, was established in this study. The results show that the modified Shapley value can help establish a fair profit distribution scheme for the IPD projects. Practitioners are also encouraged to focus on information sharing to reach the full potential of IPD.

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Public-private partnerships; procurement; public sector procurement; China	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONCESSIONAIRE SELECTION; TRANSACTION COSTS; CONTRACTS	Procurement models play a key role in determining the success of a public-private-partnership (PPP) project because they can help the government select the best bidder. Yet, few studies have systematically examined the selection of different procurement models. A content analysis is performed to discuss the institutional and legal framework along with the features of different procurement models in China. A multinomial logistic regression model is then applied to empirically investigate the relationship between the selection of different procurement models and the internal characteristics of the projects, including the investment, duration, operation mode, sector and region. Besides, a questionnaire survey to Chinese officials participating in PPP project procurement is conducted to identify the critical factors affecting the selection preferences. The regression analysis shows that the PPP project procurement model selection in China varies significantly with the internal characteristics of the projects. Moreover, the three most important factors identified are the laws and regulations, internal characteristics of the projects and advice from consultant agencies. These results indicate that the PPP project procurement model selection in China does matter. Helpful policy suggestions for the governments of China and other countries are also provided.

However, despite its importance, few academic studies investigate project-level performance during the environmental review and engineering design or examine which factors influence it significantly. In this study, we observed 560 transportation projects that the Georgia Department of Transportation completed from 2011 to 2015. We modeled distinct processes for three National Environmental Policy Act document typesprogrammatic categorical exclusion, categorical exclusion, and environmental assessmentand investigated detailed durations for environmental review activities associated with regulatory agency relation management, consultant relation management, and internal project management. Adopting task complexity theories, we then examined the influence of four dimensions of task complexity on project performance, measured by the overall durations of the environmental review and engineering design.

This study aims to identify CSFs in terms of the different project players and their objectives in the context of Singapore's construction industry. To achieve this objective, 32 CSFs were first identified and classified into four major categories: (1) project characteristics, (2) contractual arrangements, (3) project participants, and (4) interactive processes. Then the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed to establish a hierarchical model of the factors' relative importance. To facilitate systematic analysis on their importance, 12 experts with at least 10 years of industry experience were surveyed; then, through the use of the Expert Choice software, the CSFs addressing budget performance, schedule performance, quality performance, and overall project success were identified. The results of this study may serve as a tool in the construction industry to rapidly assess the possibility of achieving project objectives. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000597.

This study aims to explore relationships of key stakeholders to propose a set of improvement actions for building maintenance management (BMM) in NZ's state schools. The research employed a sequential mixed-methods approach encompassing interviews with school managers at the exploratory stage and questionnaire surveys completed by school managers and the Ministry staff to identify the maturity level of BMM. The interviews' findings were used to map roles and responsibilities of people involved in BMM and develop the measurement model used in this study. Based on data from the questionnaire, relationships among key stakeholders in BMM were examined using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The research hypotheses of correlation among the stakeholders were tested and validated. The questionnaire results were also analysed to identify the maturity level of stakeholders' responsibilities in BMM. Suggestions were made for improving BMM for NZ's state schools focusing on training programmes, reporting system, performance evaluation, and lesson sharing. The results could assist stakeholders to review their current BMM and identify the areas in need of improvement.

Research was conducted to find the construction delay causes and mitigation measures. Literature reveals that different countries experience various causes of delays and significances of these causes are different based on project types. This study explores delay causes in Kazakhstan's construction industry and analyzes their influence on different types of construction projects. Fifty-five delay causes relevant to construction projects in Kazakhstan have been identified through literature review and primary interviews with selected construction professionals. Afterwards, a comprehensive survey was conducted among the industry professionals. The survey results show that different delay causes have different importance based on the project types (industrial, residential, commercial, etc). Moreover, project parties (client, contractor and consultant) have different views on the delay causes. Accordingly, the study ranks delay causes based on project parties and project types and compares their correlations. Finally, recommendations for the most prominent delay causes have been provided. This study provides better understanding on delay causes and gives important guideline for stakeholders of Kazakhstani construction industry and other construction professionals in the world to control their projects. Similar studies can be conducted in other countries to identify causes and remedial measures for delays.

Given the current state of risk for infrastructure, municipalities face challenging decisions to plan the integrated repair/renewal of road, water, and sewer (RWS) networks. The research presented in this article identifies a methodology and framework that facilitates decision-making processes used during corridor rehabilitation project planning. A risk-based decision-making approach is developed to aid integrating repair/renewal of RWS assets. The risk model was developed using a mixed Delphi-Analytical Hierarchy Process approach. The impacts of four main consequences of failure with eighteen subfactors were considered. The RWS networks indices were amalgamated and grouped into an overall integrated risk index using K-means Clustering technique. Data provided by the City of Guelph was used in a case study in order to demonstrate the model features. Results show that pipe/road size and accessibility factors had the highest impact on the integrated risk index. The developed models can be used by researchers and practitioners (municipal engineers and consultants) to prioritize corridor rehabilitation projects thereby easing the challenge faced by stakeholders regarding the future of municipal infrastructure.

Although a considerable body of literature has discussed when and how PBFs use agents, little is known about the nature of the agency relationships between PBFs acting as principals and their agents and how these relationships may be associated with the practices used by PBFs to govern their agents' behaviour. The purpose of this conceptual study is to provide further insight into the characteristics of PBFs' agency relationships and to identify and describe alternative approaches used for managing them. Our analysis reveals that PBFs' agency relationships differ significantly regarding actor goals, risks, and availability of information across the project life cycle. Based on our findings, we propose a typology of the upstream agency relationships of a PBF consisting of four ideal types: operational, trustful, volatile, and strategic agency relationships. We argue that the development of agency relationships is a dynamic process which is contingent to the temporal orientation of the principal and the agent as well as congruence of goals between the principal and the agent.

Based on how they procure consultants and contractors, it is argued that public clients have the power and are in the position to act as "innovation supporters" and "change agents." However, the client's role as a driver of change and innovation is oversimplified and there is a need for further investigation into the client's ability to drive industry change. This paper presents a case study of a public client's initiative to drive industry change through the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM). We do this by investigating the process of intra-organisational change at the public client by mapping the client's absorptive capacity for change. The case study shows difficulties in turning the external knowledge into actual transformation when implementing a systemic innovation such as BIM. Findings contribute to the literature on public clients as drivers of change and innovation in construction and are relevant to research on public clients as drivers for industry change and innovation and to research on BIM as a game changer.

However, there is a limited understanding of the extent of its adoption in construction in African countries. Therefore, this research investigated the state of e-tendering in the South African construction industry using data derived from an online questionnaire survey involving 593 respondents, and oral interviews with selected construction clients, professional consultants, contractors and supply chain managers conducted in 2014 in South Africa. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analyses. It was found that 26% of the respondents were involved in e-tendering, and that 72.4% of them used e-mail, while 21% used web-based systems to support the execution of e-tendering activities. It was also revealed that the main benefits were reduction in transaction cost, and turnaround time of the tendering process, while the barriers to e-tendering in construction were slow Internet connectivity; resistance to change; expensive Internet services; and the inability of small-, medium- and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) to afford the technology, training and skills needed to engage in e-tendering. The paper concludes by suggesting ways for ensuring a critical mass uptake of e-tendering and maximising its benefits in the South African construction industry.

With the increasing complexity and size of the construction projects in India, the number and frequency of claims, also bound to increase, which adversely affects the construction environment. So, an early prediction of these claims is crucial to avoid their costly negative impacts. This paper aimed to develop artificial neural network models to predict the frequency of claims in construction projects. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a total of 39 factors causing claims were identified first, and then refined by Delphi interview with 10 experts. Subsequently, a questionnaire was further developed and disseminated to different owners, contractors, and consultants' organizations working in the Indian construction sector, which received 206 valid replies. The questionnaire data were then utilized to develop and validate the construction claims frequency prediction models. For this, an artificial neural network approach was used to construct the models. These models will help the construction professionals in predicting the frequency of occurrence for different types of claims throughout the course of the project and enable them to select the best strategy available to avoid or mitigate their occurrence at an early stage.

The 3D thermal models can be further used for many applications by building occupants, owners, and outside consultants to make retrofit decisions. Existing buildings represent the greatest opportunity to improve building energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. This research aims to help decision makers improve their buildings by providing reliable, visual information about their buildings' energy performance using the developed hybrid light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system. The 3D thermal model described consists of point clouds of building geometry with thermal data on each point, including temperature values (degrees C) and thermal color generated on the basis of the temperature value. Window detection algorithms were developed in this study to create virtual thermal points on window glasses because a LIDAR system is unable to collect geometric data from transparent objects. The system's technical feasibility has been successfully demonstrated through intensive lab and field experiments on residential and small commercial buildings.

Some academics propose only a financial - not a physical or a functional - definition of valuation modelling. An alternative method is proposed here to assess the risk premium for both property valuation and assessment of worth which is directly based on the property market, rather than the traditional financial model of risk premium determination or reliance on the individual expertise of a property valuer. The proposed method is based on the empirical relationship between discount cash flow (DCF) inputs and output, and can be based on the prices of comparable properties. In the traditional approach, the fact that financial modelling approximates real property to a financial asset class arguably emphasizes the illiquid nature of real property. As a consequence, all the attributes including sustainability indicators are normally not taken into account by property valuers and consultants. The market increasingly requires green buildings and development; through the use of the proposed model this need can be included in the data for risk premium estimation, in the valuation process, and, generally speaking, in the body of knowledge informing the property market.

J	Awad, A; Fayek, AR				Awad, Adel; Fayek, Aminah Robinson			A decision support system for contractor prequalification for surety bonding	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Prequalification; Bonding; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Surety underwriting	SELECTION CRITERIA; CONSTRUCTION; MODEL	In the construction bonding business, a complex and comprehensive prequalification or assessment process is done to evaluate contractor, project, and contractual risks. Previous studies have focused mainly on contractor prequalification from the owner's or consultant's perspective. There remains a need for a model to evaluate the contractor and project-specific aspects (i.e., project team and contractual risks) from the surety bonding perspective. This paper identifies and classifies the most relevant evaluation criteria that surety underwriters and brokers consider when evaluating a specific construction project for bonding purposes. Several data collection techniques (questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, and interacting group meetings), with highly experienced surety experts, were conducted to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of the evaluation criteria. Both fuzzy logic and expert systems are combined to develop a decision support system (DSS) for use in contractor and project evaluation. An approach for fuzzy membership function estimation is presented using a traditional membership function estimation technique, integrated with data of contractor prequalification cases.

David			Estimating Preconstruction Services for Bridge Design Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Preliminary-cost estimating; Design-cost estimating; Case-based reasoning	NEURAL-NETWORK; COST-ESTIMATION; MODEL	Preconstruction services play a vital role in ensuring timely approval of infrastructure funds and successful execution of construction projects. Most state DOTs use simple methods such as a percentage of estimated construction costs that has proven to be unreliable. Several studies have developed statistical models using historical data to improve current practices. However, such models have performed poorly, and practitioners have not utilized these models. This study develops and evaluates data mining models such as multiple regression and artificial neural networks and concludes that such models do not provide sufficiently accurate estimates of preconstruction service fees and hours. Subsequently, it proposes an alternative approach using a case-based reasoning (CBR) technique that uses similarity scoring to retrieve the most similar projects. The historical preconstruction service fees and hours of similar projects can be used to estimate preconstruction service fees and hours for a new project and make any adjustment necessary. A spreadsheet tool is developed to implement this CBR technique. The tool provides a simple and flexible platform that enables engineers to extract necessary data and help them in making data-driven estimates. Thus, the tool is expected to aid state DOT engineers in negotiating with consultants with higher confidence.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have been used to overcome such problems. However, due to a number of technical and organizational barriers, ERP implementation is very challenging. The major objective of the research reported in this paper is to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) of ERP implementation in the construction industry in developing countries. In this respect, based on an extensive literature review, 14 CSFs were identified and a questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the role of those CSFs on the performance of ERP implementation. The data is collected from 90 construction firms from Turkey. The statistical analysis results show that top management support and commitment, clear goals and objectives, project team competence, effectiveness of the project leader, and cooperation between team members are the most significant drivers of success. Factor analysis was also employed on the data and the findings suggest three dimensions, namely (1) human factors, (2) organization, and (3) technology. Findings of the research reported in this paper are expected to help senior managers and consultants implement ERP systems in construction firms in an effective manner.

Although the model has been tested and supported by many questionnaire surveys, EFQM has never been validated on real self-assessment scores obtained from companies. Therefore this study validates the model on scores from 34 construction companies in South Eastern Europe. The analysis shows that: a) there is an enabler excellence construct that is obtained by each enabler criteria; b) there is a result excellence construct that is obtained by each result criteria; and c) the EFQM model is most suitable for Contractor type organizations. Furthermore, we have found that the EFQM weights do not entirely correspond with the construction industry. Therefore we present new weights for the better use in the construction. Although this study proves EFQM to be a good representation of TQM in the construction industry, further improvements are needed. This is especially evident within investor and consultant type organization, where the criteria of Policy and Strategy, Leadership and Processes, People results and Client results showed certain limitations.

As a precursor to decreased rework and enhanced safety performance, this study appraised the correlative causes of rework and safety incidents. To do this, 20 rework causes that undermine safety performance were first identified through the literature review. Using a survey questionnaire involving Malaysian construction professionals (owners, consultants, and contractors), the causes were prioritized based on frequency, severity, and importance indices. The five leading rework-safety causes were ranked as follows: poor coordination, insufficient communication, poor subcontractor management, improper supervision and inspection, and poor site management. Spearman's rank correlation tests revealed a significant agreement between the respondent groups. An exploratory factor analysis identified the five major underlying causal dimensions of rework and safety incidents to relate to the substandard management of equipment and machinery, poor project management practices, inherent dangerous, dirty, and difficult (3D) characteristics, improper production planning and work pressure, and inadequate personnel competency and knowledge. This paper bridges the identified knowledge gap concerning the dimensionality of rework and accident causation in construction, and the findings provide guidance for devising preventive measures for simultaneously addressing rework and safety problems.

The effect is a reduction in employees' work time. The proposed method is based on the 1) level of digitalized and automated activities, the 2) complexity of the activities, and the 3) complexity of the processes in the workflow. The method was applied at a construction company that has no enterprise resource planning (ERP), and the method's accuracy was evaluated by information technology consultants who have performed planning, construction, and operation in relation to ERP. The result shows that the effect of management business was the largest; most of this effect was on data management and review. After users became familiar with ERP, the reduction in data input time increased. The analysis method takes less time and costs less than using surveys to measure the work time and satisfaction of ES users. It can also identify processes in which the effect increases or decreases, thereby guiding any modifications of the ES before it is introduced.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to focus on this issue in the Malaysian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - This paper targeted professional project consultants, who are identified as architects, engineers, and quantity surveyors, as the internal construction stakeholders. The personal-OV and the level of OC of the stakeholders were evaluated through a questionnaire survey. To achieve the research objective, comparative and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Findings - The results generated by the analyses indicated a high level of value conflicts in the construction organizations which significantly and negatively affected commitment of the internal stakeholders. Originality/value - Value conflicts in construction organizations are the agenda of this paper while not many empirical studies have been conducted on this issue in Malaysia. This paper through investigating the potential effect of value conflicts on the stakeholders' commitment reveals the importance of interaction between personal and OV in construction organizations which contributes to the extant literature of organizational behaviour as to the construction literature.

This has enabled the development of several private and public construction firms. However, the performance of EDCs is still a matter of concern. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to identify and prioritize risks of EDCs operating in the federal road construction projects. Forty-seven risk events were identified through an in-depth literature review. A questionnaire survey was conducted with professionals from the three main contracting parties (contractors, consultants, and the client) to prioritize the identified risk events in terms of their relative significance. The study outlined the ten most significant risk events namely, shortage of cash, inadequate planning, lack of access to foreign currency, delay in possession of site, frequent breakdown of equipment, delay in delivery of material and equipment, financial failure, inflation, delay in payments and poor commitment and coordination within the contractors' team. This study provides an insight into contractors' risks with a focus on domestic contractors engaged in the road sector. The findings of this study will be helpful to construction firms to develop an appropriate risk management system to effectively mitigate their risks.

Risk Assessment and Allocation in Highway Construction Projects in the UAE	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Risk management; Risk assessment; International construction; Highway construction projects; United Arab Emirates (UAE)	MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; MARKET	Highway construction projects carry substantial risks. This paper highlights the risks associated with highway construction projects in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Thirty-three risks are identified through detailed literature review. A questionnaire is then developed to solicit the opinion of construction professionals as to the probability and impact of those risks in addition to their proper allocation. Fifty-one surveys were completed and used in the analysis. The priority of each risk is calculated by multiplying the probability with the impact for each risk. The priority helps identify the most significant risks. The relative importance index (RII) for the risk priority is calculated based on all responses for each risk. The most significant risks include inefficient planning, unexpected ground utilities, quality and integrity of design, delays in approvals, and delays in expropriations. Internal project risks are found to be more significant than external risks. Contractors and consultants are in agreement on the risk rankings. Recommended allocation of risks is also presented. This research assists project managers to better estimate risks prior to the commencement of a project and allows them to develop proper mitigation measures at an early stage of a project.

Operational Framework for Managing Construction-Contract Administration Practitioners' Perspective through Modified Delphi Method	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contract management; Contract administration; Delphi; Performance assessment; Operational framework		Effective construction contract administration (CCA) is a core competency for the management of construction projects. The consequences of poor contract administration can be catastrophic, and it may necessitate extensive investigation of factors affecting the CCA performance. This paper presents an operational and systematic multidimensional contract administration performance framework (CAPF) in order to assist the client, the consultant, and the contractor to effectively plan, manage, measure, monitor, and control the CCA performance. Past research, semistructured interviews, and a two-round Delphi study were used to identify the importance of 93 operational key factors in 11 project management categories that affect CCA performance. The worst-case scenario of the mode score, mode value, and standard deviation to mean ratio (SDMR) were conducted to check the overall agreement on Delphi rounds. The mean value and interrater agreement (IRA) analyses were applied to quantify the significance and strength of the agreement of the identified factors on project performance. Furthermore, the external validity of the framework was validated by two real construction projects and the results indicated substantial improvements in CCA performance by better implementation and introduction of new factors. This study contributes to the construction management body of knowledge by introducing a comprehensive framework that would cover the limitations of the existing studies.

J	Sohi, AJ; Bosch-Rekveldt, M; Hertogh, M				Jalali Sohi, Afshin; Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian; Hertogh, Marcel			Practitioners' Perspectives on Flexible Project Management	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Complexity theory; Organizations; Uncertainty; Bibliographies; Standards organizations; Planning; Agile project management; construction industry; flexible project management; planning phase; Q-methodology	LARGE ENGINEERING PROJECTS; FLEXIBILITY; COMPLEXITY; RISK	Literature defines two main streams in project management: mechanistic and organic. Mechanistic reflects the traditional waterfall approach and organic reflects a more adaptive approach. The organic approach became known by the awareness of dynamic project environment and changing requirements. The organic approach is characterized by flexibility. Accordingly, scholars and practitioners tried to define flexibility and find ways to make project management more flexible. However, scientific literature about practitioners' perspectives on making project management flexible is lacking. Therefore, this paper explores practitioners' perspectives on project management flexibility by the use of Q-methodology. The scope of the paper was narrowed down to the front-end phase of infrastructure projects. Two types of organizations were targeted: client and consultancy organizations. Data were gathered from 43 respondents from six organizations (three client and three consultancy organizations) in The Netherlands. The results of the study reveal three distinct perspectives on flexibility for both organization types (client and consultant): flexibility by trust, flexibility by scope management, and flexibility by proactive management.

The dual concern theory is applied to this study as a theory foundation. Design/methodology/approach The Sri Lankan commercial building industry is currently experiencing a construction boom after 30 years of civil war. Creating a dispute free environment through well conflict management is one of the main ways to keep the continuous demand and development of construction. However, the Sri Lankan construction sector is arranged in such a way that they directly approach the dispute resolution rather than avoiding the dispute initially through proper conflict management. Four cases are selected for this study with the intention of conducting meetings with three main stakeholders of each case who represented client, consultants and contractors, respectively. Findings The research findings reveal that compromising is the most common conflict management style used by the industry. Forcing style obtained the second place in the ranking whereas obliging and avoiding received third and fourth places. Originality/value This study is conducted to provide a full picture of conflicts faced by the Sri Lankan commercial building industry and their proper management so that the future projects will use this information to diminish the destructive effects of conflict situations and provide a real value for money.

The aim of this research is to investigate what happens when a project team has to collaboratively innovate to address radical design challenges in a construction setting. We focus on the role of a full-scale mock-up of a facade in transforming the design intent for a building by Frank Gehry into design realization. The concept of boundary objects is used as an analytical lens via a case study methodology utilizing non-participant observation of weekly meetings and workshops over a period of 10 months covering client, consultant and contractor involvement. The research shows the role of mock-ups in radical construction settings is in tension along three delivery dimensions: performance, aesthetic and technical construction. Task completion competed with the requirements for experimentation around innovative problem solving with the how to construct it problem left unresolved. The findings suggest that co-location and synchronicity are critical conditions for collaborative and innovative problem solving in radical construction contexts. Project teams need to create open-ended 'moments' for iterating critical objects and the interactions that take place around them.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors that project managers experience as having the greatest effect on time, cost, and quality, and to discover whether the effects of these factors are significantly different from each other. A questionnaire with 26 factors identified from interviews was sent to the full population of publicly employed project managers. Factors were ranked using the relative importance index and tested for significant differences using Friedman's test. Wilcoxon's test was used in a post-hoc analysis. From the findings it was determined that the most influential factor for time is unsettled or lack of project funding; for cost, errors or omissions in consultant material; and for quality, errors or omissions in construction work. The main conclusion of this research is that project schedule, budget, and quality level are affected in significantly different ways. Therefore, a project manager cannot handle such critical issues by focusing only on schedule or budget complications; nor can he or she assume that time, cost, and quality are equally affected.

J	Landin, A; Nilsson, CH				Landin, A; Nilsson, CH			Do quality systems really make a difference?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						management systems; balanced scorecard; ISO 9000; quality assessment; organizational performance; Sweden		The purposes of this study were to ascertain whether Swedish construction companies measure the impact of their quality systems (such as ISO 9000) and, if so, whether the 'balanced scorecard' approach is a useful technique as a measure of performance. The balanced scorecard approach requires each organization to look at itself from four different perspectives to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance: the financial perspective, the customer perspective, the process perspective, the innovation and learning perspective. Twelve Swedish construction sector companies (clients, architectural-engineering consultants, contractors) with well-established quality systems were studied. The results indicate two important points. First, the balanced scorecard can be successfully used to measure the performance of quality systems in the construction process. Second, the organization and learning perspective is neglected in the Swedish construction process. The use of the balanced scorecard highlighted the fact that a lack of balance often exists between the four perspectives. While it is tempting to conclude that investments in quality systems increase organizational performance, there is little (if any) evidence that this is the case. Many investments in quality systems appear to be based more on blind faith than on facts. Tools are only valuable if they improve results, there is a need for further understanding the costs and benefits of quality systems in engineering and construction organizations.

J	Lam, KC; Oshodi, OS				Lam, Ka Chi; Oshodi, Olalekan Shamsideen			Using Univariate Models for Construction Output Forecasting: Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Econometric Techniques	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Box-Jenkins; Forecasting; Construction output; Support vector machine	PROPERTY PRICE; HONG-KONG; DEMAND; INVESTMENT; MARKET	Forecasting of the volume of construction works plays an important role in ensuring that stakeholders (contractors, consultants, government, etc.) formulate policies for strategic long-term planning in the construction sector. In construction economics, research efforts targeted at construction output forecasting have been limited due to the lack of availability of quantitative data. To address this problem, the current study explores the use of univariate modeling techniques in construction output forecasting. Three univariate modeling techniques [namely, Box-Jenkins, neural network autoregression (NNAR), and support vector machine (SVM)] were used to predict output of various construction sectors. In the literature, the Box-Jenkins model is considered a benchmark univariate method due to its simplicity, sound theoretical basis, and predictive performance. Out-of-sample forecasting was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the developed models. The results of the study revealed that the SVM model can reliably and accurately predict residential, maintenance, and total construction output in the medium term. The univariate models reported here can be implemented using historical data on construction output in other countries; this is particularly useful in cases where data are inadequate for multivariate models. The developed SVM model can serve as a tool for estimating future trends in construction output.

However, the dearth of primary research material is partly attributed to the lack of a suitable methodology with which to study projects. Social network analysis (SNA) is proposed as an analytical tool to explore coalition governance. Primary data are presented for three European case studies employing quite different approaches to the use of financial incentives in project governance. The case studies investigate pain share/gain share arrangements implemented under a prime contracting procurement approach; an unusual use of activity-related penalties in the French system of procurement; and the use of guaranteed maximum price supplements within a UK standard form of (without contractor's design) building contract. The use of SNA enables the observation of a number of transaction sets and the formulation of a framework for the quantification of construction project governance. The first case study demonstrates the decentralization of client-orientated financial management, from consultant quantity surveyor to a number of multidisciplinary cluster leaders. The second case study illustrates the importance of incentive contiguity in effective project governance. The third case study uses SNA to demonstrate the way in which financial governance could be transformed through the transference of client-orientated financial management from the client and their professional adviser to the main contractor.

Inter-organizational unfairness in the construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Business relations; fairness; injustice; risk; supply chain	ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; CORRUPTION; PERCEPTIONS	There are numerous examples of unfair inter-organizational business practices in the construction industry. Conflict and confrontation, corruption, bid-shopping, insecurity of payment and supply chain exploitation are just some examples which have been documented over several decades in many countries. There have been numerous initiatives to make the construction industry a fairer business environment, but these have been largely developed in a conceptual vacuum. Consequently, few advances have been made in making the industry a fairer place to do business. To address the lack of theory in this area and provide a conceptual foundation for future improvement, theories of organizational justice were used as the basis for a survey of 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. The findings reveal that mainstream theories of justice may need refinement and reorganization to be applied to a construction industry context. Furthermore, in contrast to much previous research, the results indicate that levels of interpersonal, social and informational justice are high within the Australian construction industry. However, they also show that more can be done to improve levels of procedural and distributive justice, particularly in relation to subcontractors and suppliers in the construction supply chain. Many of these findings are transferable to other countries which are culturally, contractually and organizationally similar to the Australian construction industry.

However, there is evidence that in many developing countries, public clients do not adequately consider H&S in the procurement of public projects. This study therefore sought to understand this issue by exploring the constraints that hinder public clients from adequately promoting H&S in public works procurement. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with public clients and contractors, and a survey was conducted with public clients, contractors, and consultants. The interview data was analysed using inductive thematic analysis, while the survey data was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Nine themes of constraints including regulatory; budgetary; human resource constraints; lack of management commitment; lack of H&S knowledge and education; unethical procurement practices; political influence; absence of guidance materials; and poor attitude towards H&S were identified. Based on the findings, this study recommended strategic interventions to promote the consideration of H&S in public procurement. This study contributes to the broader research on H&S management by focusing specifically on public clients in developing countries and providing an in-depth understanding of the issues which have implications for both developing and developed countries.

J	Ning, Y				Ning, Yan			Quantitative effects of drivers and bathers on networking strategies in public construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Drivers; Barriers; Network strategies; Singapore; Public projects	RELATIONAL EMBEDDEDNESS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; PLS-SEM; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSEQUENCES; CONTRACTORS; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	Past studies have found that network strategies can contribute to better company and project performance. The adoption of network strategies is motivated by a set of factors (i.e., drivers), but also faces numerous challenges (i.e., barriers). The appreciation of the factors motivating and deterring networking strategies is beneficial to the successful implementation of network strategies. In the context of public construction projects, this study aims to examine the quantitative effect of drivers and barriers on three network strategies (i.e., trust, information sharing and joint problem solving). The results of a questionnaire-survey of 104 public projects show that the adoption of network strategies in public construction is mainly cost-driven. The results indicate that four barriers impede network strategies in public projects: (i) a lack of continuity and (ii) ethos of public services are harmful to trust; (iii) institutional constraints hinder information sharing; and (iv) a lack of capability is a hurdle to information sharing and trust. It is also found that one barrier (i.e., ethos of public services) has a positive influence on trust between clients and consultants. Recommendations on enhancing network strategies through the appreciation of drivers and bathers are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Shah, JB				Shah, JB			Innovative design/build approach: Ambassador bridge project	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The Ambassador Bridge, the busiest international crossing between the United States and Canada, is privately owned and operated, linking Detroit-Mich., with Windsor, Ontario. Since its inauguration in 1929, the bridge has not gone through any major upgrades or expansions. Due to many national and international developments (North American Free Trade Agreement) and significant increases in commercial traffic, the bridge required a major upgrade and expansion. The owners desired to complete the design and construction of a $3,000,000 truck-exit ramp within 12 months. The owners proposed a turnkey agreement that included several unique demands, such as 100 years of service life with 25 years of maintenance-free structure. Additionally, unique guarantees on costs and schedules, concealed conditions, and indemnifications were requested. The contract negotiated included many of the requested features that can be practically enforceable under the current professional practice, and construction liability laws and regulations. An independent business entity was utilized to address many of the owners' requirements, including hiring a construction company through a bidding process. The project was designed and built, according to state and federal standards, within the budget and the tight schedule of 12 months. The project was subsequently expanded under the same design/build contract to include an additional two phases at the cost of $8,500,000. The owners and consultants received many accolades and awards from civic and professional groups, including ASCE.

Several studies have been focused on identifying leading complexity indicators; however, the complexity indicators from the perspective of primary stakeholders (owners, contractors, and consultants) have been rarely studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to utilize the systematic Delphi method to identify, rank and weight the complexity indicators based on the primary stakeholders' perspectives associated with US construction projects. Additionally, the shared entity-based complexity indicators (ECIs), as well as the weighting of entity-based complexity categories were determined and analyzed. Therefore, 101 potential ECIs were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Then, thirteen senior subject matter experts (SMEs), and three academic advisors were selected and invited to participate in a workshop to determine significant ECIs and then rank and weight them. The results reveal that the ECIs associated with complexity categories "scope definition" and "project resources" received the highest aggregated complexity weights in the aspect of the primary stakeholders. Although this study has been conducted based on US construction projects, the results would provide helpful guidance for international construction projects. Moreover, this study would assist the primary stakeholders in allocating resources properly in order to manage project complexity worldwide.

J	Silungwe, CKT; Khatleli, N				Tembo Silungwe, Chipozya Kosta; Khatleli, Nthatisi			An analysis of the allocation of pertinent risks in the Zambian building sector using Pareto analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building projects; pareto analysis; zambia; pertinent risks	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTORS; PROJECTS; SUCCESS	In most instances, the construction client allocates risk by selecting the methods for procurement, payment and the contract form. Nevertheless, how favourably the contractor views the risk allocation has a bearing on the project outcome. This research identifies the pertinent risks in the Zambian context and establishes how they are allocated in terms of types of contract clauses used and response mechanisms employed. A mixed-sequential approach was followed, comprising 15 semi-structured interviews, 198 questionnaire-survey respondents and document analysis (eight projects using various standard forms of contract). The respondents comprised of clients, consultants and contractors involved on medium- to- large-scale building projects. Findings show the pertinent risks in the industry were due to shortcomings of the design team and clients' shirking. Using a Pareto analysis, a pervasive propensity was found for passive risk acceptance and wanton risk transfer by the client. Modifications were found, aimed at negating the clients' responsibility for risk. The originality of this research lies in its methodological approach and its focus on how risks are allocated. Findings can help practitioners to better allocate risk and promote the achievement of desired project outcomes through careful selection and utilization of mechanisms, allocation of risk and use of contract clauses.

Albeit the promising nature of the UAE's AEC industry, that sought to embrace the latest technologies, the research revealed that, BIM is not yet widely utilised. The UAE was selected as a case study due to the diversity of its local AEC industry, whereby the AEC market has attracted contractors, consultants, suppliers from across the globe. This research adopted a mixed methodological approach using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to gather data from BIM users and non-users. The research investigated the perceived benefits and challenges of adopting BIM and the impact of short and long-term initiatives that can be deployed to drive the effective diffusion of BIM. The study found that there is irrefutable evidence of a lack of impetus to generate interest in BIM from an industry that has in fact undermined the pace of BIM adoption. This paper offers a set of practical recommendations not only for the government to accelerate the transition to BIM, but also to BIM late adopters.

To investigate the salient issues, 23 widespread problems plaguing the global construction industry were first observed from a detailed literature review. A questionnaire was administered in Malaysia to solicit the viewpoints of 117 construction practitioners (clients, consultants, and contractors) to prioritize these problems appropriately according to the importance index, which also considered the frequency of occurrence and severity of the problems. The five most critical problems were ranked as follows: changes of design during construction, cost overruns, late completion, competitive tendering procedures, and late payment. Spearman's rank correlation tests affirmed the homogeneity of perceptions among the primary stakeholder groups. Next, a principal component analysis (PCA) manifested six major underlying dimensions of these problems, relating to a three-dimensional (3D) stigma, poor site coordination and management, incompetency of construction stakeholders, slow technology adoption, haphazard decision-making, and inefficient administrative processes. A comparison of the principal factors with other selected countries was performed for validation purposes. The results of this research can guide practitioners and researchers to focus on human- and management-related construction problems when devising strategic action plans to improve the construction industries of developing countries.

Seeking a flexible mechanism to facilitate project management, which is more adaptive to changes, is the initial motivation for conducting the present study. Agile Project Management provides new opportunities for management based on the acceptance of change as an unavoidable ingredient of the project management process in the construction sector. However, applying all the agile solutions would need a tremendous amount of initial investment. Therefore, the present study aims to introduce and prioritize the agile enablers for the change management of construction projects. For this purpose, the most critical changes were identified through a questionnaire survey among 60 Iranian first-grade consultant and contractor companies in the field of construction. Subsequently, 12 experts experienced in the area of change management in construction projects selected the most appropriate agility strategies for facing the prioritized changes through semi-structured interviews. Based on the achieved results, the most effective agility solutions in the change management are: continuous resource monitoring & improvement, flexible workflow, client's participation, facilitated communication, and receiving requirements during the project which accelerate responding to the changes through a repetitive and incremental process based on continuous learning and short-term planning.

Studies indicated that the estimation of contingency sum is associated with challenges, where some contractors consider contingency as part of their profit and this has resulted in disputes amongst consultants and contractors. Researches in developing economies (Ghana) have focused on the generic determination of cost contingency with little on the perspective of quantity surveyors who are the main players in the determination of contingency. The aim of this study was to identify the main triggers influencing the determination of contingency sum for building works from the perspective of Ghanaian quantity surveyors. Through literature, triggers were analyzed and ranked with relative importance index, also, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to measure the degree of agreement amongst public and private quantity surveyors. Though all the categories were relevant, economic, exogenous and technical were paramount. Taxation was among the least influential triggers. This study provides information for players in building sector on triggers that require attention and also help them establish their own cost data, which will assist Quantity Surveyors and policy makers in their budgetary preparation for future projects.

J	Loosemore, M; Lim, BTH				Loosemore, Martin; Lim, Benson Teck-Heng			Intra-organisational injustice in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; People; Fairness; Human resource management; Justice; Organizations	PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; FAIRNESS; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose - Increasing workforce casualisation, under representation of women and other minority groups, racial discrimination, corruption and poor safety are just some of the documented examples of intra-organisational injustice in the industry. Typically these issues are problematised separately using different theoretical frameworks, yet at the most fundamental behavioural level they have a common cause which lies in the "unjust" treatment of one person by another. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the conceptual understanding of these hitherto separated but conceptually linked problems. Design/methodology/approach - A survey 135 consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers from across the Australian construction supply chain. Findings - Surprisingly despite widespread academic concerns about injustice in the construction industry, there are not significant concerns within the industry community. Contrary to much research about the poor culture of the construction industry, the results indicate that the relatively low levels of perceived injustice are institutional rather than cultural. The research also highlights the plight of middle management, which appear to consistently suffer the highest levels of injustice across all its theoretical categories. Research limitations/implications - Sample size and Australian focus. Practical implications - Informs organisational policies to reduce injustice in the construction industry. Social implications - By reducing injustice, this research will improve the fairness of business practices in the construction industry. Originality/value - Application of justice theories to conceptualise unfair construction practices.

Thus, preventing its causes would be an efficient strategy to improve performance of the construction projects. This research set out to highlight, ascertain and rank the critical causes of scope creep with respect to their level of occurrence and to their influence on cost and time increase for the building construction projects in the Sub-Saharan countries of D.R.Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, preventive strategies were also provided. A questionnaire survey was conducted among consultants, contractors and clients, and a total of 141 questionnaires were collected from both countries. The survey results analysed by the mean of t-test technique showed that there is a significant difference in the likelihood of occurrence and in the level of influence on cost and time overruns for majority of the 37 causes resulting to scope creep between the two countries. Also, there is significant difference in the importance level of majority of the eleven best practices in preventing scope creep. This study grants a vital contribution to control scope creep in D.R.Congo and Rwanda, and in the countries with the same condition.

J	Rahman, MM				Rahman, M. Motiar			Barriers of Implementing Modern Methods of Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Preassembly; Industrialized building; Modern methods of construction; Barriers; Prefabrication; Modular construction	HONG-KONG; PREFABRICATION	Modern methods of construction (MMCs) offer many benefits, but their uptake is low. Their contribution to the construction industry is also low. As such, this study examined the importance of various barriers to wider adoption of MMCs. Results are presented from statistical analyses of 160 questionnaire responses from the U.K. and China. The results validate the importance of 26 factors out of 29 used in the survey. Cost related issues are the most important barriers to implementing MMCs, although respondents from the two countries clearly disagree on the relative importance of different factors. Clients have consensus on the importance of fewer barriers than contractors and consultants, which is expected to help adopt MMCs. Large organizations displayed fewer consensuses than medium-sized organizations, who also displayed fewer consensuses than small organizations. This was interpreted to help the industry in adopting MMCs, because larger organizations control smaller organizations in most cases. Moreover, respondents with experience in MMCs consider that there are far less barriers to adopting MMCs than those with no experience in MMCs. Factor analysis surfaced seven interrelated components, suggesting the need for an integrated and holistic strategy to overcome the barriers. These outcomes are expected to allow policymakers to precisely identify the issues relating to the low uptake of MMCs and to devise appropriate strategies for their wider adoption.

However, this important phenomenon has been largely overlooked by the extant literature. Drawing upon cross boundary KM theories and the ES implementation literature, this exploratory case study investigates how user representatives facilitate cross boundary KM and what mechanisms are used to be effective. The implementation of ES by Alpha (pseudonym) was examined because it involved a wide range of organizational units and stakeholders, which made cross boundary knowledge flow difficult. Results show that user representatives played a pivotal role as they used a variety of mechanisms for crossing physical boundaries, cognitive boundaries, and social boundaries. Aprocessmodel was developed to reveal how boundary-crossing mechanisms affect KM via creating a common knowledge space, shared knowledge, and knowledge adaptation. This study makes three theoretical contributions. It develops an integrated model for understanding the cross boundary mechanisms by user representatives, extends prior research on cross boundary KM from a vendor perspective only to a client perspective, and it broadens research on user participation with the ES implementation context. This research also has significant implications for practitioners such as user representatives, project managers, and consultants.

J	Ibbs, W; Liu, M				Ibbs, William; Liu, Min			An improved methodology for selecting similar working days for measured mile analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Construction claims; Construction; Labor productivity; Measured mile; Statistical analysis; Similar workdays		Quantifying economic losses on construction projects caused by labor inefficiencies is often a difficult and tedious task. A widely accepted way to quantify such losses is by using the "measured mile" approach. This technique compares the productivity achieved during an unimpacted or minimally impacted time period with productivity realized during an impacted period. The dependability of the periods that are chosen is vital and plays a key role in the determination of merit, liability and quantum. The work performed during the measured mile period should be substantially similar to the work that was affected. As currently practiced though, choosing the periods for measured mile analysis is usually made in a largely subjective manner. The objective of this article is to introduce and illustrate the statistical clustering method as a tool for selecting the similar working periods. This new approach is advocated because it determines similarity of work condition using objective criteria. The method is agile and can be easily applied in practice by project managers or construction consultants. In this paper the factors that affect the similarity of work are identified, and the clustering procedure is developed. An example is also included to show how the method works in practice.

Procurement of Design-Build Services: Two-Phase Selection for Highway Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In the United States, public agencies are adopting the design-build (DB) delivery method for delivering highway projects after having used the traditional design-bid-build method for generations. In the 2002 design-build contracting final rule, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) strongly encourages the use of two-phase selection procedures for DB procurement. This paper takes a case study approach to investigating the use of a two-phase process for selecting providers of highway design-build services. Using two DB projects in central Texas as case studies, the writers have analyzed project documentation and performed interviews with 37 project participants involved in procurement, including owner representatives and legal consultants. For the first case, the writers selected the $1.3 billion SH-130 tolled expressway project in central Texas. Procurement of the SH-130 DB contract was performed before the FHWA rule on DB contracting was released. In addition, the writers examined procurement activities for the $154 million DB contract for the SH-45 SE tolled expressway, which was procured by the same owner in 2004 following procedures identified in the FHWA rule. As a result, a process was developed that included activities to be performed between the delivery method decision and the contract execution. This process model tracks the differences between the SH-130 and the SH-45 SE processes that are attributable to the latter's adoption of the FHWA Rule.	[Migliaccio, G.

The objective of this study is to analyze and integrate several dynamics that have an impact on the adoption of SAP ERP system depending upon the modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Drawing from the TAM, four variables - actual usage, behavioral intention to use, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness - are synthesized and integrated with panoptic empowerment, consultant support, learner-learner interaction, learner-teacher interaction, mastery goal orientation, personal innovativeness, satisfaction, top management support, trialability, and user guidance to develop a research model. Our sample is gathered through the end users that have experience on the SAP ERP system in an emerging country, Turkey. The structural equation modeling approach is able to be applied since our sample size (N = 584) is large enough. The SmartPLS is used to conduct the analyses which indicate that out of 23 hypotheses, 20 of them are supported. Moreover, this paper conducts a mediation effect analyses. The implications of the results are reviewed, and the recommendations are provided for further studies. This article links the theory and practice in SAP ERP systems by proposing a model, which offers novel perceptions for engineering managers who are in search of adopting the SAP ERP system.

Large quantities of concrete and time are wasted during building construction due to management procedures, construction processes and reworks. Besides, the final construction quality cannot fully meet customer requirements. This paper explores practical solutions for construction process and quality improvement by using prefabricated composite structure (PCS) based on Six Sigma method. The D-M-A-I-C model of Six Sigma has been applied to conduct the analysis of the construction process, to discover essential factors to improve and thus to achieve higher customer satisfaction. This research finds out what influences construction process, construction quality and then adopts design and technique correction measures. It improves the construction process, quality resistance to various performances and proposes the best mix proportion. These improvement measures help to overcome and reduce considerably concrete cracking and slippage in building construction. Based on Design for Six Sigma model (Define, Characterize, Optimize and Validate: DCOV) and using the finite element analysis model (ANSYS), this study develops for scientific and economical use in construction industry a composite steel-concrete model. The proposed approach falls into three phases. Based on measurement and construction process analysis from Six Sigma black belt consultant, construction managers, Engineers, clients, architects, the model helps to find and eliminate critical defects and failure before they occur.

To overcome this problem, clients in the construction industry sometimes use schedule incentive/disincentive (I/D) contracting strategy. However, previous studies have shown that inadequate understanding and wrong implementation of schedule I/D provisions could result in unintended results. Moreover, the use of the I/D contracting method is in its initial stages in many countries such as India. The purpose of this paper is to identify various factors that are essential for schedule I/D success in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among experienced professionals (clients, contractors and consultants) from across the Indian construction industry. Findings Top success factors related to clients in the descending order of their importance are: realistic targets; detailed guidelines for I/D implementation; close coordination with other stakeholders; correct estimation of I/D duration and amount; and imposing disincentives after due consideration. Meanwhile, factors related to contractor organisations are: continuous monitoring and control; thorough understanding of schedule I/D targets; specific considerations in appointing senior project personnel; effective communication; and proper labour management. Originality/value This research highlights the specific roles of both clients and contractors in the success of schedule I/D projects in developing countries such as India.

Causes of Delay in Construction Projects in the Oil and Gas Industry in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Delay time; Construction management; Oman; Case studies; Industrial facilities; Delay; Construction projects; Oil and gas industry; Oman	MANAGEMENT; RISK	Several studies investigating the causes of delay in projects in the construction industry have been conducted worldwide. This study investigates the causes of delay in construction projects in oil and gas processing facilities in Oman and serves as a case study for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Using a questionnaire, data were collected from 59 project managers employed in different organizations in the oil and gas industry in Oman. The survey results showed a high degree of agreement among the perceptions of project stakeholders, clients, contractors, and consultants on the causes of project delay, and there is no evidence to suggest that the causes of project delay differ significantly according to organization size or organizational ownership. Moreover, seven factors were identified as the major causes of project delay. Although six of these identified elements are general factors that can account for delay in any project in any industry, one of thempoor interaction with vendors in the engineering and procurement stagesis found to be unique to construction projects in the oil and gas industry. The findings of this study could be of value to organizations that are planning to conduct construction projects for oil and gas processing facilities in Oman and other nations with similar environments, such as the GCC countries.

The core of their activity consists of collaborative projects, which are characterised by specific management and Human Resources practices located at the junction of different cultures and employment statuses. Almost four years after they were launched, what can we say about the dynamic of these collaborative projects? What is the reality of such collaboration when it involves multiple partnerships bringing together employees from different occupational cultures and Human Resources Management systems? The aim of this longitudinal research, which is based on the observation of two collaborative projects in one of the most largest clusters in France, is to discuss management and HR issues in such a setting. A literature review highlights the need to open up the 'black box' of collaboration within projects and encourages examination of both manager's coordination efforts and the actors' motivation to cooperate, as well as the role played by HRM practices. Thus observation of the conduct of the projects over two years reveals that collaboration, far from being a given within these projects, is the product of a process of social construction that might be fostered by better managerial support.

Optimum Outcome-Sharing Construction Contracts with Multiagent and Multioutcome Arrangements	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Incentive contracts; Optimization; Cooperation; Multiple arrangements	AGENCY THEORY; MORAL HAZARD; INCENTIVES; OWNERSHIP; PRINCIPAL; BEHAVIOR	Incentive contracts are widely used in construction to not only provide motivation but also to develop a cooperative relationship among project players. However, establishing the best outcome sharing is seen as a challenge to those involved in contracts design. Although the optimization of incentive contracts has been approached by a number of researchers, there is no guidance on optimum incentive contracts with multiagent/multioutcome arrangements. This paper develops the optimum multiagent/multioutcome sharing model in incentive contracts with a risk-neutral owner and risk-averse agents (contractors, consultants). Optimization, principal-agent theory, and utility theory provide the basis for the development. The application of the model is addressed in different scenarios. The paper demonstrates that adopting optimum effort by agents is an effective strategy that avoids project time overruns and also gives maximum savings to all contracting parties. It is shown that: at the optimum, outcome (time, cost, quality, and safety) sharing is positively related to an agent's contribution and negatively related to the agent's effort cost; as the correlation of the outcomes or the level of agent risk aversion increases, agents prefer low outcome sharing; and outcome variances and outcome sharing are related negatively which means that high outcome variances result in low outcome sharing. The contribution of this study lies in providing insights into designing optimum incentive contracts with multiagent/multioutcome arrangements.	[Hosseinian, S.

Design/methodology/approach The review of published empirical studies, a national survey of transportation agencies and case studies of highway agencies form the basis of the conclusions in this research. In addition to the national survey, with 46 of 50 agencies participating, the research presents case studies from five highway agencies in the United States including the following: California, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota and Virginia. These five case studies were selected from agencies that have extensive experience in delivering ACM projects. The case studies involved a thorough procedural review and structured interviews of agency personnel. The agencies then validated the results and conclusions. Findings The results showed that implementing ACM projects requires different knowledge, skills and management and coordination efforts than traditional design-bid-build (D-B-B) projects. The study found that the key success factors of implementing ACMs are the following: (1) establishment of an ACM champion; (2) active involvement of key staff throughout the ACM project development process; (3) appropriate use of consultants and (4) ACM training and staff development. Originality/value This research is the first attempt to examine the staffing needs and utilization for ACM projects.

However, many projects have been abandoned or canceled owing to an insufficient understanding of risk factors, lack of awareness of the financial consequences of risk, and a limited understanding of risk bearers' capacity to handle risks. Using a mixed research method, this study identified critical risks in PPP toll road projects in Vietnam that affect the projects' financial viability, determined the PPP partners capable of managing these risks, and explored the causes to these risks and their management strategies. Empirical data collected from quantitative and qualitative studies revealed 22 risks critically affecting toll road projects' financial viability in Vietnam, either by inflating projects' cash outflows or reducing projects' cash inflows in a commonly used net present value (NPV) analysis model. This confirms the important role of government support and guarantees in the mitigation of the risks in developing countries and indicates that governments need to actively get involved in managing these risks and planning for the associated government support. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of risk management in PPP toll road projects in Vietnam, which will not only benefit public management, policy consultants, and investors, but also academics interested in studying PPP projects in developing countries.

J	Ngacho, C; Das, D				Ngacho, Christopher; Das, Debadyuti			A performance evaluation framework of development projects: An empirical study of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) construction projects in Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Constituency Development Fund; Development projects; Performance evaluation framework; Key performance indicators; Kenya	SUCCESS FACTORS; CRITERIA; DELAYS	The present work attempts to develop a multidimensional performance evaluation framework of development projects by considering all relevant measures of performance. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this performance evaluation framework, it has considered the case of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) projects constructed between 2003 and 2011 in Kenya and collected the viewpoints of 175 respondents comprising clients, consultants and contractors involved in the implementation of CDF projects with regard to their perception on 35 performance related variables. A five-point Likert scale was used as a response format for different variables with the assigned values ranging from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the collected data which gave rise to an instrument consisting of 27 items representing six factors. The findings further reveal that the items constituting these six factors essentially represent six key performance indicators (KPIs) namely time, cost, quality, safety, site disputes and environmental impact. The relative influence of each KPI towards overall performance of construction projects shows that time is the most important measure followed by cost while safety comes last in order of importance in the performance evaluation of CDF construction projects. The findings of this study have significant bearing on other similar kind of development projects undertaken in developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

However, reliance on information technology is associated with risks. The purpose of this paper is to offer a better understanding of the emerging contractual and legal risks, which might influence the successful adoption of BIM, in order to facilitate the successful implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach The risks used in the study were documented from the literature, and primary data were collected by a questionnaire survey. The analysis of the results was driven by univariate and inferential statistics (Analysis of Variance) to identify the emerging contractual and legal risks. Findings The findings showed that there were little significant differences in the mean rating of the occurrence of contractual and legal risks between the respondents. The study confirmed that emerging risks are likely to be related to BIM documentations, intellectual rights and liability, missing data and misplaced assumptions among project stakeholders. The results showed that BIM success depends on close collaboration, at the outset of the project, with the client, designers, contractors and consultants. Originality/value Important legal and contractual risks have been identified in the application of BIM. It renders a new understanding of the risks that might influence the successful adoption of BIM.

The relationship between job demands, job control, workplace support, and experiences of stress in the South African construction context is investigated, using hierarchical regression, factor analysis and structural equation modeling to explore the strength of thirteen factor relationships with perceived stress. Data were gathered from an on-line questionnaire survey response sample of 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers. Predictors displaying a significant relationship with occupational stress are the presence of work life imbalance, the need to 'prove' oneself, hours worked per week, working to tight deadlines, and support from line managers in difficult situations at work. Existing theories of occupational stress are confirmed but not completely supported. The construction industry should give attention to how the need to work long hours is justified. Organizations should look to improving managerial and collegial support for construction professionals, but be careful in engaging in socializing and project team-building activities. Further research will need to focus more deeply on construction-specific job demand factors; explore why women professionals appear to experience more stress than men; and aim to develop reliable early-warning detection techniques for construction professionals.

J	Harris, M				Harris, Mike			Competitive Precinct Projects: The Five Consistent Criticisms of "Global" Mixed-Use Megaprojects	PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						urban megaprojects; competitive cities; neoliberal globalization; urban renewal; urban planning	NEW-YORK; URBAN; COPENHAGEN; GOVERNANCE; CITIES	Mixed-use megaprojects on state-owned land have been increasingly occurring around the world over the past few decades. This article reviews the body of literature that has emerged on these projects during this period and investigates a number of projects more deeply by reviewing original planning documents and undertaking interviews with government officials, consultants, and other insiders. Project motives, delivery methods, and built outcomes have been examined in order to contextualize their emergence and proliferation, leading to a typological understanding, defined in this article as competitive precinct projects. A content analysis of 30 reviews covering 42 mixed-use megaprojects in 20 countries reveals remarkable global consistency in thematic criticisms. Framed in this article as the "five consistent criticisms of 'global' mixed-use megaprojects," they pose a significant barrier to addressing increasingly complex urban challenges as well as to their successful management from inception to delivery. While the consistent criticisms represent patterns that have endured within a globally active urban development type for over three decades, this research shows that rather than being a neoliberal hegemony, there are mixed political and ideological aims and outcomes across projects and sometimes within the same project. A typological understanding allows patterns to be examined and understood, variances and hybridity to be evaluated, and more sophisticated future directions to be mapped out in the pursuit of broader based and city-scale project outcomes.

J	Ndekugri, I; Braimah, N; Gameson, R				Ndekugri, Issaka; Braimah, Nuhu; Gameson, Rod			Delay analysis within construction contracting organizations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SYSTEM; CLAIM	Delayed completion of a construction project is often caused by a complex interaction of a combination of events, some of which are the contractor's risks and others are the project owner's. The apportionment of the liability to give effect to the risk allocation has therefore been a matter of great controversy. Many delay analysis methodologies have been developed over the years for performing this task. This paper reports on an empirical study into the current practice in the use of these methodologies in the United Kingdom, as part of a wider study aimed at developing a framework for improving delay claims analysis. The part of the study reported here was based on a questionnaire survey of key informants. The issues investigated include the categories of staff within contracting organizations who contribute to delay claims analyses, the awareness, use and reliability of existing delay analysis methods and the obstacles to their use in practice. The main findings of the study are that: (1) the preparation of delay claims often requires input from commercial managers (quantity surveyors), schedulers, site managers, external claim consultants and estimators; (2) commercial managers have the greatest involvement; (3) claims analyzed using the as-built versus as-planned and the impacted as-planned techniques are often successful although there is considerable literature on the shortcomings of these techniques; and (4) the main obstacles to the use of the methods relates to deficiencies in project records and scheduling practice.

We contribute to the discussion by analysing the Center for Properties and Facilities of the University of Helsinki. We ask (1) what kind of information tools for facility management the maintenance personnel use; (2) how the design data was handed over in the University's central library project; and (3) how designers and facility managers find the possibilities of integrating BIM models and maintenance information systems. In the library project, the data was handed over and archived for potential later use. The information for the maintenance manual, however, was collected separately by an outside consultant. The designers thought that models should be simplified to meet the needs of the maintenance. The representatives of the Center did not see that uses of BIM models would provide a significant added value in relation to the potential provided by the maintenance information systems already in use. They found as a possible next step the transfer of some information from BIM models to their facility management and maintenance systems. A partial, stepwise integration of the systems seems to be a realistic way forward.

B.; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Determining Significant Risks in the Variability between Design-Stage Elemental Cost Plan and Final Tender Sum	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design stage; Elemental cost plan; Final tender sum; Significant risks; Variability	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; ACCURACY; MANAGEMENT	Several researches have indicated that pre-tender estimating inaccuracies are significantly influenced by the level of risk information available to estimators. This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between design-stage elemental cost plan and final tender sum (contract sum) in traditionally procured commercial building projects. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant ones during design development. Project data from New Zealand were obtained through online questionnaire and interview surveys to determine the construction consultants' perspectives. Responses to the survey were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk, coefficient of variation, and Kendall's coefficient of concordance. A ranking of mean scores of the survey responses enabled the most significant risk factors to be determined. Interviews were analyzed by using thematic and documentary methods to complement survey responses on risk identification. Thus, interview survey prioritized five from the top 10 risk factors obtained by using quantitative approach. The primary contribution of this study is to provide quantitative confirmation of the more general statements made in the literature from around the world and therefore add to and consolidate existing knowledge. Moreover, as risk elements are inherent in construction project developments globally, these findings have important ramifications for all construction projects in expanding and clarifying existing knowledge on what is needed for reasonable budgetary performance and successful delivery of construction projects.

The law (commonly referred to as the Brooks Act) was adopted by many states (a total of 41 as of the end of 2001) and local jurisdictions. One of the states that adopted qualifications-based selection (QBS) of architectural/engineering (A/E) services is New York state. The New York state law, however, does not cover local jurisdictions, and New York City continues to use competitive pricing as its primary method of selecting A/E consultants. This report outlines the findings of a recent study performed on QBS in an attempt to evaluate some of the claims put forward by proponents and opponents of QBS. The study was based on past literature as well as recently procured projects in New York City and relevant project data from these projects. The study is based primarily on information provided by the New York City mayor's Office of Contracts during a public hearing on QBS (December 1999) and additional information on A/E firms from a representative data sample from the original data. Among the findings of the study was that presumed cost savings in design services for existing price-dominant practices were actually insignificant and most definitely offset by escalating costs in the construction phase.

Key barriers to increase construction productivity: the Singapore case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction productivity; barriers; contractors; migrant workers	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY	This study investigated the barriers to achieving high construction productivity in Singapore with the view to providing further input into policy formulation and action to enhance the industry's productivity performance. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which was sent to all the 3032 members of the Singapore Contractors Association and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Statistical t-tests and factor analysis were conducted on the 109 valid responses using the SPSS software. The findings were validated via in-depth interviews with subject matter experts. The top three barriers are "delays in providing information to contractors", "poor skills of workers" and "inadequate pre-project planning and pre-work planning". The sources of these barriers are consultants and contractors, suggesting that these stakeholders should cooperate to improve productivity. The research findings for Singapore construction industry is unique in that most of the labourers on site are migrant workers from overseas. Nonetheless, the findings may be useful to countries that employ labourers mainly from overseas such as those in the Middle East and certain parts of Europe. This study adds to knowledge by identifying the most significant barriers to productivity improvement and providing suggestions to address them. To improve productivity, all participants should change their mind-set, attitudes and behaviours. Clients should support productivity initiatives and be more proactive concerning productivity through tender evaluation criteria, setting productivity targets and paying for productivity premium. Contractors should develop corporate productivity policies, monitor productivity closely and purposefully adopt measures to increase productivity of their projects.

Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature highlighted a lack of comprehensive research to evaluate CDWM performance of key project stakeholders, like owners, contractors and consultants. After the identification of 22 performance variables through a pilot study, a first questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the views of respondents toward CDWM performance. The 132 responses were analyzed using factor analysis to determine specific CDWM performance factors, which formed a conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM. Furthermore, a practical index (PI) was proposed to integrate the feasibility and effectiveness of CDWM strategies. The values of PI were employed to prioritize CDWM strategies from data collected in a second questionnaire survey. Findings The validated results from factor analysis revealed that the conceptual performance evaluation framework of CDWM consists of six factors; and the attitude toward CDWM emerged as the foremost critical factor. The prioritization of PI values indicated that raising CDWM awareness among construction stakeholders was the most feasible and effective strategy for CDWM. Originality/value This CDWM performance evaluation framework is one of the first to holistically evaluate CDWM from key stakeholder perspectives. In addition, the PI firstly enables quantitative integration of the feasibility and effectiveness of CDWM strategies.

J	Negash, YT; Hassan, AM				Negash, Yeneneh Tamirat; Hassan, Abdiqani Muse			Construction Project Success under Uncertainty: Interrelations among the External Environment, Intellectual Capital, and Project Attributes	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction project success; External environment; Intellectual capital; Fuzzy Delphi; Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory	IMPACT; AHP; IDENTIFICATION; CRITERIA	Prior studies have focused on identifying and ranking critical success factors (CSFs), but both their interdependence and the vagueness resulting from human judgment have been neglected. Furthermore, there is a need to explain CSFs from the short- and long-term planning horizons. This study aims to identify, rank, and examine the interdependence of the critical factors affecting construction projects in low-income economies. The study applied the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to validate subfactors identified from the literature. The hierarchical relationship between success factors and linguistic preferences is considered by using a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) methodology. The former is applied to rank the relative weights of the factors and subfactors, and the latter is used to discover the nature of their interrelationship. The results indicate that over the short term, the relationships with the clients, consultants, designers, top management, and the financial situation of the contractor are essential. However, for strategic management and long-term success, the most influential factors are the external environment and the types of projects undertaken. Therefore, the economic climate, technical and professional capabilities, and costs, funds, and resources should be the primary concerns when establishing the project goals. Furthermore, this study provides managerial and theoretical implications to guide construction projects from both short- and long-term perspectives. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Causes of disputes, factors affecting dispute resolution and effective alternative dispute resolution for Sri Lankan construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Alternative dispute resolution; construction industry; disputes; Sri Lanka	ADJUDICATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS; BOARDS	Construction industry is typically vital to the economy of any country. It appears that on-going large-scale building and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have attracted numerous international contractors. Moreover, in Sri Lanka, there are several foreign investors, and to-be-funded mega government projects at their inception and initial stages, increasing competition which has already been fierce. However, these massive projects under various stakeholders with different interests usually initiate conflicting claims, if not resolved, will likely lead to disputes, and filing law suits. Once a dispute is crystallized, there are commonly used alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. However, the causes leading to the claims to form a dispute, and the effective ADR methods are largely dependent on the perspective of the stakeholders. This research aims to identifying those dispute causes, factors affecting the selection of dispute resolution methods, and the most effective ADR method in the perspective of different parties to construction projects in the Sri Lankan construction industry. First, an extensive literature review was carried out to identify the ADR context in Sri Lanka. Second, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted involving professionals representing various stakeholders such as contractors, clients and consultants. Survey responses were then analyzed using special purpose statistical software (SPSS). To determine the statistical significance difference among stakeholders' perception, Kruskal-Wallis H test was used with a 90% confidence level. This research thus provides additional insights into causes of claims and ADR selection from different perspectives.	[Illankoon, I. M. C.

Literature suggests that effective communication is vital for achieving improved project performance. The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the barriers to effective communication in the Nigerian construction industry, using attribution theory paradigm. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaires detailing 15 barriers to effective communication were administered to consultants and contractors engaged in the Nigerian construction sector. In total, 100 valid responses were analysed using mean score, factor analysis and factor score. Findings - Unclear project objectives, ineffective reporting systems and poor leadership were ranked as the most significant barriers to effective communication. Factor analysis uncovered that the principal reasons responsible for ineffective communication include: managerial and technical barriers and credibility and background barriers. Practical implications - The results provide information on barriers which needs to be addressed in order to improve communication in construction projects in Nigeria. There is a need to conduct post-completion reviews of construction projects so that project team members can learn and share knowledge on past experiences. Although the present study was conducted in the Nigerian context, it is envisaged that the research outcome will be widely applicable to other developing countries. Originality/value - The study provides insights on the perceived barriers to effective communication in Nigerian construction projects. The paper presents the direction for further research aimed at improving communication in construction projects in Nigeria.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research design used semi-structured interviews, and observations in team meetings and the work environment to identify characteristics in the work environment which influenced employee engagement. Findings Workplace characteristics that influence employee engagement relate to the project challenges, the problem-solving nature of work, and achieving specified outcomes within time allocations. Human factors including the manager's behaviours with feedback and recognition of effort, mentoring, and encouraging collaboration are important in team environment. The potential for learning and knowledge development from the project and with the team positively influence engagement. Research limitations/implications This study examines the characteristics of an established project team of 13 consultant engineers from eight nationalities, and forms a basis for future comparison with other project teams with different job types and demographic profiles. Practical implications This study contributes to project management (PM) research by broadening the focus from human factors influencing employee engagement to project challenges and knowledge development, with implications for managers in project-based organisations in terms of job design, development of team climate, team processes and their own behaviours. Originality/value This study contributes to human factors in PM literature through exploratory research into the antecedents of employee engagement.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the causal causes of schedule overrun and cost escalation of highway projects in Egypt in order to be used as independents variables in mathematical models for predicting the percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation of such projects in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of a randomly selected samples yielded responses from 40 owners, 15 consultants and 56 contractors. The survey includes 38 schedule overrun factors and 26 cost escalation factors. The effectiveness degree of the identified factors has been identified by the triangle fuzzy approach. Findings - The results of the survey show that "contractor's technical staff is insufficient and ineligible to accomplish the project" is the most important cause of schedule overrun, while the major cause of cost escalation is inadequate preparation of the project concerning planning and execution. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is predicting the percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation of highway projects in Egypt. Through the application of the linear regression analysis method and statistical fuzzy theory, four predictive models have been developed and it has been noted that the linear regression-based model shows prediction accuracy better than statistical fuzzy-based model in predicting percentages of schedule overrun and cost escalation.

Prioritizing complexity using fuzzy DANP: case study of international development projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complexity; DANP; Fuzzy logic; International development project; Research framework	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; DEMATEL; CONSTRUCTION; CRITERIA; MODEL; MANAGEMENT	Purpose This paper aims to propose a comprehensive framework for prioritizing complexity criteria. The framework was validated by applying in infrastructure international development (ID) project as a case study. Design/methodology/approach A literature review highlighted the limitations of existing complexity prioritization methods. Then, a combination of the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) was employed as a foundation to develop a three-stage complexity prioritization framework. Focus group discussion and questionnaire surveys were used to practically test the framework in the infrastructure ID projects. Findings The three-stage complexity prioritization framework was validated to be reliable and feasible. The findings showed ability of consultants, scope uncertainties, site compensation and clearance, communication between stakeholders, administrative procedure and project duration were the most significant complexity criteria of ID projects in the Vietnamese context. Practical implications The framework is a robust tool that enables the researchers to grasp the interaction of complexity criteria for complexity prioritization. Later studies can apply the proposed framework, with some minor revisions, to assess the interaction of criteria in other research topics in, and beyond, project complexity. Results of the case study suggest project stakeholders focusing on complex interactions among criteria to reduce project complexity. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive complexity prioritization framework that grasps the interrelationship of complexity criteria. For stakeholders of ID projects, the findings provide insightful perspectives to understand complexity, which can help to enhance project performance.

Using a mixed methodology approach, focus group discussions with financier stakeholders in the UK's PFI/PPP industry were used to identify 23 criteria relevant for evaluating completion risk in funding applications. These criteria were put in a questionnaire survey to wider audiences of financiers of PFI/PPP projects in the UK. A series of statistical tests were performed, including reliability analysis, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, descriptive statistics, principal rank agreement factor (PRAF), and regression analysis. After identifying 21 reliable criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk, the general agreement of three major financier stakeholders (senior lenders, equity financiers, and infrastructure financiers) on all criteria were examined through the Kruskal-Wallis test and PRAF. A regression model, constructed and validated with input from another team of expert financiers, revealed five key criteria influencing the bankability of completion risk in PPP megaprojects. These include (1) a construction contractor with years of experience of successful completion of megaprojects, (2) the construction contractor's financial strength, (3) the existence of tried-and-tested technology for the construction of project, (4) the availability of an independent technical consultant (ITC), and (5) the existence of a fixed-price turnkey (FPTK) construction contract. The research findings will provide PFI/PPP contractors and clients with valuable strategies for satisfying financiers' requirements in delivering large-scale infrastructure PPP projects.

J	Leung, MY; Chan, YS; Chong, A; Sham, JFC				Leung, Mei-yung; Chan, Yee-shan; Chong, Alice; Sham, Janet Fung-Chu			Developing structural integrated stressor-stress models for clients' and contractors' cost engineers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							WORK-ENVIRONMENT; A BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATIONS; SUPPORT; BURNOUT	Estimation is not a purely scientific task. It requires cost engineers equipped with a wide knowledge of construction and a professional ability to make judgments. However, stress will deaden their use of knowledge and influence their professional judgment in estimating. In the construction industry, cost engineers can generally be divided into two main groups: clients' cost engineers in consultant firms or in a development company who serve clients; and contractors' cost engineers in construction companies working for the contractors. This study investigates the causal relationships between the stressors and stress of clients' and contractors' cost engineers. Two stressor-stress integrated models were developed for these two cost engineer groups by using the structural equation model. The findings revealed some stressors that affected both clients' and contractors' cost engineers: (1) poor environment, role conflict and work underload affect their stress positively; (2) social support and Type A behavior affect their stress negatively; and (3) work underload induces stress via the role conflict among cost engineers, their supervisors, and the organization. On the other hand, some deviations between these two groups of cost engineers also occur: (1) social support acts as a source of stressors of clients' cost engineers; (2) a private life stressor only affects the stress of contractors' cost engineers; and (3) a closed interactive looping relationship among role conflict, Type A behavior, and work underload affects contractors' cost engineers. Based on the results of this study, some recommendations are suggested to manage cost engineers' stress well.

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was administered to design, consulting, construction, and facility management firms in the USA to seek information about the state of sustainability efforts in these firms relative to strategic planning, marketing, business management, financial management, organizational structure, and people management. chi(2) tests were performed on the data collected to determine if statistically significant differences exist between the project participants relative to sustainability efforts. Findings - Sustainability efforts are related to a firm's strategic positioning, reputation and experience, and hiring/employment policies, while profit margins are not higher in sustainable projects compared to traditional projects. Statistically significant differences were detected in three of the six items investigated, indicating conflicting interests among the parties. Research limitations/implications - The study's limitation is that it is limited to sustainability efforts in the USA. Practical implications - It is concluded that sustainability demands have changed the nature of design, construction, and operation of buildings in ways that deserve special attention on the part of all parties involved. Originality/value - The firms that participate in building construction projects need to adopt management practices that accommodate sustainable building design, construction, and operation in order to remain competitive in a market where demand for environmental sustainability has grown significantly in recent years.

However, public projects usually face more constraints in adopting RC, as close relationships may lead to allegations of corruption. The aim of this study is to undertake a comparative analysis of drivers and barriers to adopting RC practices in public construction projects in two different markets viz, a centrally planned economy and a free market economy by investigating practices in Beijing and Sydney. The survey research design was adopted and data of public construction projects in Beijing and Sydney were collected using a structured questionnaire. The results revealed that relationship quality and level of harmony among contracting parties are significantly good in both cities. In Sydney, the level of inter-personal relations between contractors and consultants is significantly higher than in Beijing. It was found that the same 18 factors drive contracting parties in Beijing and Sydney to adopt RC practices, and in 6 instances, these are significantly greater drivers in Sydney. The barriers to adopting RC practices are totally dissimilar in both cities. Contracting parties in Beijing could not adopt more RC practices because of a lack of training in relational arrangement and public clients lack initiative in adopting RC practices. The conservative industry culture that encourages preservation of the status quo is also prevalent in Beijing. In Sydney, the only significant barrier is public sector accountability concerns. To cultivate readiness to embrace RC practices, it is suggested that industry professionals and the government adopt recommendations highlighted in this study according to the type of market structure.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify and classify barriers to PPP projects implementation in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were collected through the administration of questionnaires to public sector authorities, concessionaires, local lenders, consultants, and contractors already involved in PPP projects. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean score, Kruskal-Wallis test, and factor analysis. Findings - The study identified 58 barriers and the analysis of the total ranking among stakeholders revealed that all the identified barriers were considered as serious barriers influencing PPP projects in Nigeria. The result of Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that except for 18 (out of 58) identified barriers, there was no statistical significant difference in stakeholders' perceptions on barriers to PPPs project implementation in Nigeria. The study through factor analysis grouped the identified 58 barriers into ten principal factors with their components. Practical implications - This study provides an in-depth understanding on Nigeria's PPP market environment current context in terms of prevalent barriers influencing PPPs project. This would be beneficial to PPP stakeholders in decision making and planning towards PPP projects implementation. Originality/value - The findings would be valuable in assisting all stakeholders, particularly potential local, and foreign private investors to recognise major barriers in the implementation of PPP projects in Nigeria and thus helping them to develop strategies for penetrating Nigeria and developing countries PPP market successfully. This study results are crucial as not many empirical studies have been conducted in Nigeria.

Even though eco-innovating is a key trend in industry today, relatively little research has been conducted on its implications for the automobile industry. In this article, the attitude toward the environment while innovating is analyzed using the SEM (Structural Equation Model) technique, applied to a data set of 223 Spanish automotive companies. Results of a statistical analysis with this data set show that companies which focus on processes and products when innovating tend to be more environmentally oriented and tend to highlight the importance of information sources more than those which do not have a focus on process and product innovation. Further, our results show that companies which see market information sources (coming from suppliers, clients, competitors, and external consultants) as important in the process of innovation and development of new products and markets are also more environmentally oriented. The consistency in our findings suggests that companies which look for more operational flexibility, increased production capacity, reduced labor costs per unit, or reduced energy consumption per unit when innovating are also more prepared to adopt an environmental orientation. These results have important managerial implications for firms that are trying to go greener as it highlights the variables that should be considered in their effort to be more environmentally oriented and the key elements to lead companies from innovation toward eco-innovation. Learning from this study will help managerial decision-making. The variety of variables analyzed allows practitioners to discover conclusions relevant to the engineering management field.

One of these approaches is to leverage the value of emerging information technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architectural design. Leveraging these potentials requires promoting an appropriate context for the implementation and adoption of these new technologies. In response to the turbulent and multifaceted socio-technical nature of modern information technologies and the environmental uncertainty, architects enhance enablers to advance the architectural design process. Enablers are the preeminent factors that facilitate the implementation of new technologies and contribute to the sustainable development of projects and organizations. Given the lack of dedicated studies on the enablers affecting BIM application, this study aims to identify and classify these enablers in the architectural design phase. Following a systematic literature review approach, a comprehensive list of enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase was identified. The prepared survey questionnaire was distributed to 205 construction experts (i.e. project managers, employers, consultants, and contractors). The collected data were analyzed with the Robust Exploratory Factor Analysis method, ended up with classifying 36 enablers into four main categories: human skills, environmental, technological, and organizational factors. The findings of this study, considering the organizational enablers, recommend that the support of government officials to implement a particular validation process for BIM adoption is crucial. The contribution of this research lies in identifying and classifying enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase, with the potentials to be applied in real work practices to improve BIM capabilities and enhance BIM initiatives in construction projects.

Many problems, such as little cooperation, lack of trust, and ineffective communication resulting in adversarial relationships between contracting parties, are facing the construction industry. Partnering is perhaps one of the most innovative developments in delivering a project efficiently and reducing construction disputes. It provides a sound basis for a "win-win" climate and synergistic teamwork. Project partnering in the Hong Kong construction industry has gained in popularity since 1994. A number of potential factors contributing to partnering success have emerged and deserve further study. This paper presents a review of the development of the partnering concept in general and identifies critical success factors for partnering projects from the Hong Kong perspective in particular. Through a postal questionnaire survey geared toward project participants with hands-on partnering experience, the opinions of various parties--clients, consultants, and contractors were sought and evaluated in relation to partnering success factors. The relationship between the perception of partnering success and a set of success factors hypothesized in the study was derived using factor analysis and multiple regression. The results indicated that certain requirements must be met for partnering to succeed. In particular, the establishment and communication of a conflict resolution strategy, a willingness to share resources among project participants, a clear definition of responsibilities, a commitment to a win-win attitude, and regular monitoring of partnering process were believed to be the significant underlying factors for partnering success.

J	Gambo, N; Said, I; Ismail, R				Gambo, Nuru; Said, Ilias; Ismail, Radzi			Comparing the levels of performance of small scale local government contractors in Northern Nigeria with international practice	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management effectiveness; Construction management; Performance management; Performance measures; Performance monitoring	CONSTRUCTION; DELAYS; BENCHMARKING; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; TIME	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance levels of small scale local government contractors (SSLGCs) in northern part of Nigeria with international practice. Previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. This continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like Nigeria. There is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. A questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The contractors' performance was compared by using ANOVA with post hoc. Findings - The results indicated that the SSLGCs in Nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to SSLGCs in northern part of Nigeria. Practical implications - The study provided the criteria for evaluation of SSLGCs' performance in Nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. Social implications - The study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in Nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. Originality/value - This study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry.

Ghodrati			Predicting Seismic Retrofit Construction Cost for Buildings with Framed Structures Using Multilinear Regression Analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Regression models; Cost modeling; Cost and Schedule; Regression analysis; Construction-cost estimation; Seismic retrofit projects	RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; DURATION; MODELS	Attempts to predict construction cost represent a problem of continual concern and interest to both practitioners and researchers. Such an attempt is presented here for the specific challenge of cost prediction when undertaking seismic retrofitting of existing structures. Using multilinear regression analysis, 14 independent variables were analyzed to develop parametric models for predicting the retrofit net construction cost (RNCC). Half of these variables have never previously been studied in the literature. The required data for this study were collected from 158 earthquake-prone public schools in Iran, each having a framed structure. The backward elimination (BE) regression technique was used to identify any variables that made a statistically significant contribution to the RNCC. The suitability of the BE technique for this identification was examined and demonstrated using a number of model-selection criteria. Rather surprisingly, building age and compliance with the earliest practiced seismic design code were found to be insignificant predictors of the RNCC. As reflected by the BE technique, the significant predictors were building total plan area, number of stories, structural type, seismicity, soil type, weight, and plan irregularity. The causal analysis performed between the RNCC and these variables showed that the first two variables have the greatest influence on the determination of the RNCC. The primary contribution to the construction industry is the introduction of a simple double-log cost-area model for predicting seismic retrofit construction cost. The introduced model enables engineering consultants, managers, and policy makers to simply predict this cost at the early planning and budgeting stage of seismic retrofit projects.

J	Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Ho, PKM				Wong, PSP; Cheung, SO; Ho, PKM			Contractor as trust initiator in construction partnering - Prisoner's dilemma perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Partnering has been advocated for use in construction as a project-delivery approach to curb dispute and enable a cooperative contracting environment. Successful construction partnering is perceived to derive benefits to both developers and contractors. In view of significant implications to successful project delivery, there has been a surge of research and studies on construction partnering. These studies typically focus on the partnering process as well as the identification of critical success factors. Among the various success factors that underpin partnering success, establishing trust among partners is considered the most important. Moreover, skeptics have been swift to point out that establishing trust in construction is daunting. A better understanding of the role of trust and its manifestation in partnering efforts is therefore of both academic and practical value. In this study, motivating trust in construction partnering is described within the classic framework of "the prisoner's dilemma," which suggests the trust cycle can be kick-started if construction partners put cooperation before competition and self-interest. This paper reports a study that is designed to suggest a suitable candidate for the trust initiator. As such, the critical trust factors for two groups of construction partners in Hong Kong-developers/consultants and contractors-are first identified. It is found that "performance" and "permeability" of partners are the two most critical trust factors. "Performance" describes the partner's competence and problem-solving ability as perceived by their counterpart. "Permeability" reflects the partner's openness in sharing information. The result of a multiple-regression analysis further suggests that the contractor is in a position to initiate trust through competent performance and maintaining effective communication with the client. In this manner, the trust cycle can expand with reciprocal trustworthiness from the client.

J	Adafin, J; Rotimi, JOB; Wilkinson, S				Adafin, Johnson; Rotimi, James O. B.; Wilkinson, Suzanne			Risk impact assessments in project budget development: quantity surveyors' perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Elemental cost plan; final tender sum; New Zealand; quantity surveyor; traditional building procurement; variability	CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS; ACCURACY; MANAGEMENT	One aspect of construction project budgeting requiring attention is the inaccuracy of early estimates during design development. Accuracy of estimates is important to project owners and their financiers. However, inconsistent risk information makes this difficult to achieve. Proper risk analysis could offer a partial solution by reducing the variance between design-stage elemental cost plans (ECPs) and final tender sums (FTS) of construction projects. This study first identifies risk factors that influence variability between ECPs and FTS. It further evaluates the identified risk factors through risk measurement to determine the most significant during design development. Data for the study were sourced from 62 practicing quantity surveyors (QS) through an online questionnaire survey. Survey responses were analysed by using descriptive statistics, risk mean analysis (RMA), degree of risk measure and Spearman's correlation. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software facilitated the analysis, and top ten risk factors were found important for practicing quantity surveyors in New Zealand (NZ). The identified risk factors were responsible for the variability observed. The values obtained from the analysis would enable greater accuracy in the forecast of FTS by quantity surveyors. As a main contribution, the study creates awareness of the risk factors that should be given considerable attention by consultants at project outset, to guard against wide variation between the design-stage ECPs and FTS. This knowledge could assist quantity surveyors to pro-actively manage their client's fund. In addition, these findings can assist in the development of a predictive model that construction industry practitioners in NZ could use for reliable estimation of FTS from the design-stage ECP.

Indeed, what gets measured gets done. The real scope of quality improvement in construction projects is the difficulty and-maybe-lack of quality measurement methods. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors influencing the quality performance of highway projects in Egypt. Furthermore, this paper also contributes to develop models to measure the quality level of these projects. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is conducted to compile a list of factors influencing the quality of highway projects. The resulting list of factors is subjected to a questionnaire survey which was sent to owners, consultants and contractors of highway projects in Egypt. Furthermore, linear regression analysis and statistical fuzzy approaches are adopted for modeling process. Findings - The survey results show that availability of experienced staff in the owner's and contractor's teams during the project execution, asphalt quality and type used in the construction process, pavement is not designed according to the regional conditions, and contractor's labors and equipment capability are among the most important factors influencing quality performance. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is to develop models to measure the quality of highway projects in Egypt. The first model is based on the linear regression analysis, while the second one is based on a statistical fuzzy approach which is a hybrid approach from the fuzzy logic and regression analysis. Validation of the models reveals that the linear regression and the statistical fuzzy models can accurately assess expected quality of any future highway projects at confidence levels 68.97 and 87.44 percent, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach - Reviewing literature and interviewing with local experts selected from the Iranian construction industry, top 58 delay factors were identified and categorized into six major groups. The interrelations among these factors were, then, modeled using the system dynamics (SD) approach. The resulting causal loop diagrams obtained from SD were used subsequently for identifying the most significant factors influencing and influenced by delay through the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The impact of factors on each other was finally determined based on the opinions of 63 experts selected from the Iranian community of consultants, contractors, and clients. Findings - According to the analysis, eight out of the 58 factors were identified as the most influencing factors on delay, and nine factors were found to be the most influenced factors by delay in the field of delay analysis. The study also concluded that factors related to labors are the most important and influential factors. In addition, factors related to client were the most influencing factors and external-related factors were the least important ones. At the end, some recommendations to reduce variation of delay in the construction projects are presented as well. Originality/value - Considering the interconnected structure of the factors, the paper identifies the most important factors interacting with time delay in construction projects.

Modeling relational transaction and relationship quality among team members in public projects in Hong Kong	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Relationship quality; Relational contracts; Public projects; Prediction; Hong Kong	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; PLS-SEM; EMBEDDEDNESS; NETWORKS; CONTRACT; ORGANIZATIONS; SELECTION; SUBCONTRACTOR	Prior studies have found that relational contracting (RC) practices are helpful in nurturing good relationships among project team members. These empirical studies, however, did not differentiate by project type (i.e., public or private projects). In reality, the situation faced in public projects would be different from that of private projects since for example, some public sector participants may be indifferent to, concerned about or indeed opposed to, building close relationships with private sector counterparts. In the context of public construction projects, this study aims to develop models to explain the association between relationship quality and the extent to which RC practices are adopted. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey in Hong Kong, China. Using Multiple Linear Regression and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), models for predicting the relationship quality among project team members were developed. The mathematical equations were validated by a case study. The models show that the relationship quality among project team members can be predicted by the extent to which these RC practices are implemented: (i) adoption of flexible strategies; (ii) readiness to compromise on unclear issues; (iii) willingness to commit on a long-term basis; (iv) attitude towards teamwork; (v) trust among team members; (vi) sharing of project information; (vii) understanding among team members; and (viii) alignment of the objectives of different parties. The models are recommended to public clients, consultants and contractors that aim to achieve good relationships in public projects. 0 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ling, Florence Y.

Empirical Study of the Risks and Difficulties in Implementing Guaranteed Maximum Price and Target Cost Contracts in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guaranteed maximum price; Target cost contracting; Pitfalls; Risks; Difficulties; Hong Kong.		Over the past few decades, both the guaranteed maximum price (GMP) and target cost contracting (TCC) arrangements have been regarded as alternative integrated procurement strategies for clients to mitigate risks, minimize claims, integrate the diverse interests of a complex construction project, and offer incentives to provide value-added services. However, the adoption of GMP/TCC contracts may also generate significant risks and difficulties that merit considerable attention. This paper aims to provide a concise review of the potential pitfalls of the GMP/TCC scheme in general and identifies the key risk factors and potential difficulties associated with GMP/TCC in comparison with other procurement strategies in construction in particular via an empirical survey of clients, contractors, and consultants in Hong Kong. The survey data gleaned from 45 valid replies were analyzed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, and Spearman's rank correlation test. The survey results indicated that "involvement of inexperienced or claim-conscious contractors in a project procured by a GMP/TCC contract" was considered to be the most significant risk factor; while "design development must keep pace with main contractor's program for tendering the domestic subcontractors' works packages" as the major difficulty in implementing GMP/TCC projects. The research findings derived from this study are particularly essential in assisting the contracting parties to mitigate the detriments brought about by potential risks or difficulties when embarking on GMP/TCC contracts. It has also generated valuable insights into developing effective recommendations for alleviating the barriers to GMP/TCC success for future construction projects.	[Chan, Daniel W.

Web-based visualisation for look-ahead ground imaging in tunnel boring machines	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ground prediction system; Visualisation; GPR; Seismic sensors	PENETRATING RADAR; GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; FACE; PREDICTION; TBM; CONSTRUCTION	Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) are large multi-million pound machines used to excavate underground tunnels. In order to make best use of the high-speed performance of a TBM and guarantee the safety of excavation, it is important to know the local geology, structures and ground properties ahead of the TBM cutter head, especially in complex geological conditions (e.g. karst caves). By working with experienced geophysical experts, tunnelling engineers/consultants and TBM manufacturers, we propose a novel web-based visualisation platform to help TBM operators efficiently manage, process and visualise the TBM parameters, the geology map created by geo-experts based on boreholes, and especially the imaging data captured by an on-board ground imaging system for "seeing through" the ground beyond the excavation surface. Informative visualisation interfaces were designed to facilitate interpretation of the imaging data and adding annotation by users; algorithms were developed for automatic detection of features and probable events by fusion of radar and seismic imaging data; and a back-end database was designed to store all such relevant information for supporting more advanced interpretation in the future. The web-based architecture not only allows the visualisation platform to be directly linked to on-board sensors (e.g. ground penetrating radars, seismic sensors), but also allows users away from the job site to access the captured data using a standard web browser, enabling a collaborative interpretation process. The data processing, management and visualisation platform presented in this paper is flexible with respect to different imaging sensors and modalities, so it is highly adaptable for any other ground imaging systems for tunnel geology inspection, underground utility surveys, etc.	[Wei, Lijun; Khan, Muhammad; Mehmood, Owais; Dou, Qingxu; Bateman, Carl; Magee, Derek R.; Cohn, Anthony G.] Univ Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Mehmood, Owais] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England	Wei, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.	l.j.wei@leeds.ac.uk			European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [280712]	We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 280712.

J	Koops, L; van Loenhout, C; Bosch-Rekveldt, M; Hertogh, M; Bakker, H				Koops, Leonie; van Loenhout, Ceciel; Bosch-Rekveldt, Marian; Hertogh, Marcel; Bakker, Hans			Different perspectives of public project managers on project success	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Organizational culture; Government; Performance criteria; Management; Construction management	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; PERCEPTION; CRITERIA; CLIENT	Purpose - The authors argue that public project managers do not consider the iron triangle ( cost, quality and schedule) primary important in measuring the success of their projects. To investigate which success criteria are important to public project managers, the authors interviewed 26 Dutch project managers who are employed by the government and who are responsible for managing infrastructural projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this research the Q-methodology is applied. Q-methodology helps to find for correlations between subjects across a sample of variables. Q-factor analysis reduces the individual viewpoints down to a few factors. A factor can be seen as the mathematical representation of an "average" perspective shared by a group of people. Findings - Findings are based on the individual rankings of 19 success criteria; the authors distinguished three common perspectives: the holistic and cooperative leader, the socially engaged, ambiguous manager and the executor of a top-down assignment. In none of the perspectives the iron triangle criteria formed the top three to measure project success. Research limitations/implications - The research results may have a national character. The way project success is perceived by public project managers may be culture dependent. For this the authors expand the research to other countries in the near future. Practical implications - This paper contributes to the understanding of the public project manager by their private collaboration partners, like consultants, engineers and contractors. This will help them to understand their client and contribute to better collaboration in projects. Originality/value - This paper shows that the difference in work attitude and value frame in the public sector leads to a specific view on project success.

J	Jadidoleslami, S; Saghatforoush, E; Heravi, A; Preece, C				Jadidoleslami, Samereh; Saghatforoush, Ehsan; Heravi, Amirhossein; Preece, Christopher			A practical framework to facilitate constructability implementation using the integrated project delivery approach: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Constructability; integrated project delivery; mass housing projects; integration; coordination		Having integrated contractual strategies for projects and developing a transparent and unambiguous contract is highly effective for properly implementation of constructability. This study uses integrated project delivery (IPD) as the most recent contractual delivery approach to facilitate easier constructability implementation in the construction industry. The aim of this study is to present a practical framework to reduce changes and duplications, and facilitate constructability through focusing on the IPD approach. A case study on mass housing projects in Tehran is applied to provide supportive research data. This study uses qualitative analyses of data from both literature and the case study. Previously, comprehensive studies have been done by the authors through conducting a meta-synthesis technique. Outputs of the study, which were barriers and solutions to facilitate constructability implementation, are used in this study as presumptions. Data was collected from in-depth interviews with expert, including owners, consultants and contractors. The results were classified and compared with each other through descriptive and pattern analyses using the NVIVO Software. As determining constructability of a project needs experience and expertise, lack of constructability can be due to late or improper decision making in planning and design. The outcome of this study shows that `IPD implementation facilitates such harmony and coordination. The case is from Tehran of Iran. Given the geographical restriction of this case study that was in Iran, there were not adequate experts in the field of IPD. Currently, in Iran, these concepts are just implemented in large projects. This study uses IPD as the most recent contractual delivery approach to facilitate easier constructability implementation in the construction industry. Having coordination between construction and pre-construction stages is very significant to reduce duplications and improve real implementation of designs.

J	Shoar, S; Chileshe, N; Payan, S				Shoar, Shahab; Chileshe, Nicholas; Payan, Shamsi			Assessment of the causes and effects of design deficiencies for large construction projects using social network analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article; Early Access						Project management; Design management; Causal factors; Social network analysis; Soft systems	SOFT SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY; CENTRALITY; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; REWORK; ERROR; MODEL; DOCUMENTATION; CAUSATION; DELAYS	Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the latent interrelationships of causes and effects of design deficiencies (DDs) and to identify the most crucial ones by considering the interactions among them. Design/methodology/approach First, through a comprehensive literature review, the most critical causes of DDs were identified. The review eventuated in a list of 22 causes and 12 effects, which were categorized into six groups. Second, through the rules of system dynamics and the interactions between the causes and effects were modeled and illustrated using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). With the aid of semi-structured interviews with 20 competent experts, the resultant CLDs were also validated. Third, the opinions of 54 experts, who were chosen from the Iranian community of clients and consultants, were solicited concerning the degree of influence which each factor (causes or effects) exerts on others. Finally, the social network analysis (SNA) approach was deployed to analyze and prioritize factors based on the gathered data from experts. Findings SNA results indicated that factors such as "design firms' staff rework" and "design firms' loss of reputation" are the most central factors affecting DDs. The model results also identified that factors such as "schedule variance", "workload" and "lack of quality control and supervision during the design phase" have the highest overall impact on DDs. In the end, some recommendations to address major factors and links were also put forward. Overall, more communications between the pair of stakeholder groups and continuous learning from project experiences are believed to be the main strategies. Originality/value It is believed that this study has provided a comprehensive understanding of causal mechanisms among factors, which can assist project managers of different parties (clients, contractors and consulting firms) in taking more effective actions to ameliorate the quality of design documents.

J	Meng, XH; Brown, A				Meng, Xianhai; Brown, Andrew			Innovation in construction firms of different sizes: drivers and strategies	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Innovation; Construction; Strategic management	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; LEVEL INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; KNOWLEDGE; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT; ORGANIZATIONS	Purpose The importance of innovation has been increasingly highlighted in construction as a large and complex industry sector that is more challenging than ever before. To bridge the knowledge gap about how firm size affects innovation in construction, the purpose of this paper is to explore firm-level innovation through an empirical investigation and compare innovation in construction firms of different sizes in terms of drivers and strategies. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a combination of a literature review, a group of qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire survey. In this research, the questionnaire survey is the main instrument to collect empirical data. Main contractors, subcontractors and specialist contractors as well as suppliers of labor, material and equipment are used in this research to represent construction firms of different sizes. On the other hand, client organizations, design firms and management consultants are not included in this research. Findings This research provides clear evidence for the embrace of innovation in construction. Many forces can drive construction firms to innovate and many strategies can be applied to construction innovation. Innovation drivers can be either internal or external. On the other hand, innovation strategies fall into four categories: technology, resource, marketing and management. For innovation drivers and strategies, both commonalities and differences can be found among construction firms of different sizes. Originality/value The finding of commonalities describes the general trend of innovation development in construction. It also encourages all construction firms to innovate regardless of firm size. On the other hand, the finding of differences enables construction firms of different sizes to realize what forces better drive their innovation and what strategies are more appropriate for their innovation. A thorough understanding of innovation drivers and strategies offers an important framework for construction organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice.

J	Olatunji, OA; Aje, OI; Makanjuola, S				Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred; Aje, Olaniyi Isaac; Makanjuola, Sina			Bid or no-bid decision factors of indigenous contractors in Nigeria	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Supply chain management; Sub Saharan Africa; Tendering; Bidding; Subcontracting	BIDDING MODELS; CONSTRUCTION; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT	Purpose - The decision to bid or not to bid for new projects determines contractors' propensity for business success or failure. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that affect the decision of indigenous construction contractors to bid or not to bid in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis was conducted on data from questionnaires received from 64 engineering management employees of leading construction companies which are members of Nigeria's Federation of Construction Industry. The study identified 41 significant decision factors often considered by Nigerian indigenous contractors before the bid. Mean item scores were obtained for each of the factors. Principal component analysis was used to point out the most significant decision factors. Findings - Results revealed significant orthogonal relationships between the factors. Only 11 of the 41 factors are statistically significant to influence contractors' decision to bid or not to bid. Most of the significant items were amongst the least rated items by the participants. The post hoc decision factors include consultant's interpretation of project specifications, previous relationship between the intending bidder and client, availability of other projects at the time of bidding, technological complexity of the project under consideration and prequalification requirements. Others include the propensity for resource price fluctuation, business capacity of partners, amount of own work vs subcontracted work, required rate of return on investment and difficulty in obtaining finance. Originality/value - The practical implication of these findings are as follows: the orthogonal relationship between the decision factors implies non-linear relationship between the factors and actual decision to bid or not to bid, and that bid success is often not predictable by bid behaviour; many of the bid decision factors rated highest by indigenous contractors seldom impact the contractors' actual bid decisions; local and international players can adopt the significant decision factors elicited in this study for managing their structures for inter-organizational partnerships.

J	Al Kuwaiti, E; Ajmal, MM; Hussain, M				Al Kuwaiti, Eisa; Ajmal, Mian M.; Hussain, Matloub			Determining success factors in Abu Dhabi health care construction projects: customer and contractor perspectives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; success factors; health care; prioritization; AHP; UAE	MANAGEMENT; SERVICE; DESIGN; IMPACT; PPP; ERP	The importance of project management and its success has been growing along with increasing investment in the construction field. This study aims to identify, categorize and prioritize the critical success factors for health care construction projects in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the success factors for health care construction projects. The analytical hierarchical process was then applied to prioritize the main criteria and sub-criteria of health care construction project success factors. This study consists of 10 main criteria and 36 sub-criteria relevant to health care construction projects. The respondents of this study consist of two main groups: customers and contractors. The customers were selected from one of the leading governmental hospitals in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the contractors are from a major contracting company operating within the health care industry. From each respondent group, leadership positions were selected from relevant departments, including finance, operations, marketing, engineering and supply chain management. The findings of the study show that the leading critical success factor groups are financial capability and management. Moreover, top management support, adequate funding, availability of resources and effective strategic planning were found to be top factors affecting project success. Differences in priorities were observed between customer and contractor perspectives based on the different roles of each stakeholder. To highlight, customers ranked management and financial capability as the two most important factors, respectively. However, contractor respondents indicated financial capability as most important, followed by management and strategy factors, which scored as equally important. As results shown in this study are obtained from only customers and contractors, future studies could include consultants and regulatory authorities, along with considering more success factors.

J	Chiu, WYB; Ng, FF				Chiu, Wai Yee Betty; Ng, Fung Fai			Enhancement of organizational commitment through propensity to trust	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Social exchange theory; Organizational commitment; Construction industry; Employees attitudes; Quantity surveying	SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; NORMATIVE COMMITMENT; TURNOVER INTENTIONS; MEMBER EXCHANGE; ANTECEDENTS; JOB; CITIZENSHIP; PERFORMANCE; SUPPORT; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the perception of propensity to trust and organizational commitment of quantity surveyors and examine if propensity to trust among working partners enhances organizational commitment of quantity surveyors. Design/methodology/approach - Organizational commitment and propensity to trust is linked through the framework of social exchange. Quantitative approach with questionnaire survey is employed to investigate whether propensity to trust would enhance organizational commitment. Questionnaires are sent to the quantity surveyors who are professional members of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and are working in the Hong Kong construction industry. In total, 71 valid responses are obtained for data analysis. Findings - Contrary to prediction, propensity to trust does not show significant relationship with both affective and continuance commitment. The two propensity to trust scales show different results on the relationship with normative commitment (NC). When working relationship is taken into consideration, quantity surveyor's propensity to trust the partner who has the worst working relationship has significant and positive impact on the surveyor's NC level; whilst quantity surveyor's propensity to trust the partner who has the best working relationship does not has significant positive impact on the surveyor's NC level. Practical implications - To improve propensity to trust among quantity surveyors, consultant companies should provide professional-related training programme to quantity surveyors as to explore their potential. The provision of training programs would also help quantity surveyors feel that they are supported by the organization, which would improve their commitment to the organization. Originality/value - This is the first study to apply the social exchange theory to study organizational commitment within the quantity surveying profession and construction industry, which provides a new point for understanding the concept amongst the profession and industry.

Design/methodology/approach A parallel questionnaire survey of client, consultant and contractor organisations was conducted in Hong Kong to test hypotheses relating three facets of the empowerment concept and five project-level antecedents. Hierarchical linear modelling and ordinary least square regression were employed to test the hypotheses. Findings The analyses show that dynamic project environments, high project team integration and high interdependence of project tasks lead to high individual psychological empowerment, while public-client projects (compared with private-client projects), a hostile project environment and high client integration lead to a low individual psychological empowerment. Uncertainty in project technology also leads to high team psychological empowerment, while hostile project environments lead to low team psychological empowerment. Further, dynamic project environments lead to more empowering work climate, while hostile project environments lead to less empowering work climate. However, project team integration, project complexity, project lifecycle and quasi-public-client projects (compared with private-client projects) have no significant association with the empowerment of individuals and teams. Originality/value This study examined task-related factors (i.e. project in this case) which traditionally have not been the focus of studies examining the antecedents of empowerment. Further, project-level antecedents and their link to an integrated perspective of empowerment comprising a sociostructural perspective, a psychological perspective and a team-based perspective are examined, which is a significant departure from the unitary perspective of empowerment taken in most previous studies.

Previous studies have found that one strategy that may reduce the inspection workload is prioritizing construction activities for inspection. However, reducing the number of inspections also has its risks, such as functional failures and reduced design life. Thus, available inspection resources should be allocated to the activities with significant risk consequences if inspection is reduced. The objective of this paper is to develop a risk-based inspection protocol to facilitate efficient allocation of available inspection resources to minimize the risks associated with reduced inspection. First, the risk consequences associated with reduced inspection are identified for various construction activities linked to transportation projects. Based on data collected from 23 state departments of transportation, 58 engineers and inspectors from the Indiana Department of Transportation and 20 inspection consultants in the Midwest, the subjective perceived probabilities associated with the occurrence of each risk consequence are encoded by using fuzzy analysis, from which the risk impacts due to reduced inspection are obtained. The construction activities are prioritized based on the risk impacts associated with reduced inspection into five priority levels. The greater the risk impacts are as a result of reduced inspection, the higher the priority would be for inspection of that activity. Thus, the proposed protocol can be used for resource allocation based on risk impacts. The proposed list of prioritized construction activities can assist project and program managers in state departments of transportation in better allocating their limited inspection resources while reducing the risks due to reduced inspection.

Edward; El Asmar, Mounir; Cho, Namho			Earned Value Management System State of Practice: Identifying Critical Subprocesses, Challenges, and Environment Factors of a High-Performing EVMS	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							SAFETY CULTURE; NOMINAL GROUP; CONSTRUCTION	For more than five decades, Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) have been applied by organizations to manage their projects in different industries. However, many organizations still struggle to apply Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques to assess and reliably control their project outcomes. This work investigated the state of practice of EVMS. This paper identifies challenges facing practitioners, critical EVMS subprocesses, and key EVMS environment factors, based on a large survey of 294 expert respondents. Sample respondents had project management experience of greater than 20 years on average, and represented a diverse set of projects and industries (e.g., capital projects, aerospace, defense, energy, and others). The responses from this survey helped craft an agreed-upon set of definitions for EVM, EVMS, EVMS maturity, and EVMS environment that are all provided in this paper. Moreover, out of 10 total EVMS subprocesses, planning and scheduling was ranked as the subprocess with the greatest impact on EVMS, by far. When ranking the top factors that impact the EVMS environment, the following factors rose to the top: organizational culture; efficient EVMS development process; leadership's past EVMS experience; effective and accountable leadership; and quality and level of data available. Moreover, leadership attitude toward EVMS was found to be the most critical EVMS challenge, by a wide margin. Comparing different perspectives, the data showed that project/program owners consider EVM implementation costs to be a major challenge, while contractors and consultants consider adequate calendar time needed for preparing EVMS to be a critical EVMS environment factor. Overall, this paper contributes to the engineering management body of knowledge by identifying the most important subprocesses and factors of a high-performing EVMS applied to a diverse array of complex projects and programs (e.g., aerospace, defense, construction, software, etc.) and uncovering corresponding key challenges.

Critical Factors Determining Bid/No Bid Decisions of Contractors in Qatar	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bidding decision; Tendering; Construction projects; Constructability; State of Qatar	MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	To bid or not to bid for construction projects is a crucial strategic decision for contractors' sustainability in the industry. The high complexity and uncertainty associated with such a decision-making process, which involves several multitudes and reflection of numerous internal and external determinants, necessitate further exploration of the prominent factors underpinning contractors' decisions. Following the announcement of awarding the "Federation Internationale de Football Association" (FIFA) 2022 World Cup hosting rights to the State of Qatar on December 2, 2010, the State is pledging to spend tens of billions of dollars on hundreds of new projects. Thus, the objective of this case study is to identify, explore, and rank the relative importance of the critical factors determining contractors' decisions to bid or not bid for local construction projects. To achieve this objective, a structured questionnaire survey comprising 43 factors that were shortlisted based on relevant previous investigations on bidding practices in the construction industry, and the input of local industry experts and professionals, was distributed to a statistically representative sample of contractors. Using the "Relative Importance Index" technique, the following critical factors are identified: (1) previous experience with the employer, (2) need for work, (3) current workload, (4) previous experience in similar projects, (5) size of project, (6) identity and reputation of the employer in the industry, (7) financial stability of the employer, (8) availability of other projects, (9) promptness of the employer in the payment process, and (10) tender documents quality level. The outcomes reported in this study can be used to provide employers, consultants, contractors, and policymakers, guidance for focusing, acting upon, and controlling the cardinal factors perceived to impact contractors' bidding behaviors in an environment on the brink of undergoing an unprecedented boom in demand for faster delivery and lower cost of constructed facilities.

J	Yap, JEBH; Leong, WJ; Skitmore, M				Yap, Jeffs Ey Boon Hui; Leong, Wen Jie; Skitmore, Martin			Capitalising teamwork for enhancing project delivery and management in construction: empirical study in Malaysia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Teamwork; Team effectiveness; Dimensions; Temporary project team; Project management	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; DELAYS; MODEL; COLLABORATION; TEAMS	Purpose Teamwork in the construction industry has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial circles. Most importantly, improving team effectiveness will increase the likelihood of successful project delivery. Recognising the factors influencing team dynamics is important for enhanced team performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on a detailed literature review, a survey questionnaire containing 10 aspects and 25 attributes of teamwork relevant to construction is used to collect feedback from Malaysian construction practitioners from client, consultant and contractor organisations to prioritise these hypothesised variables. The data are then subjected to reliability analysis, descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and frequencies), a one-sample t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and exploratory factor analysis. Findings The significance of these aspects and attributes is then presented. The three most crucial aspects are "project performance", "decision-making capability" and "problem-solving ability". The most influential attributes are "effective communication between project team members", "efficient team leadership", "well-defined team responsibilities and roles", "clear team goals and objectives" and "good collaboration between all project leaders". The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA reveals five attributes having statistically significant differences with respect to company size, namely "clear team goals and objectives", "commitment to the project", "adequate resources", "team or task processes" and "creativity and innovation". Six underlying dimensions are found, comprising (1) participative engagement and task commitment; (2) team responsibility structure and accountability; (3) culture of trust and respect; (4) leader's skills and abilities; (5) top management support; and (6) synergic working environment. Practical implications - The identification of these dimensions for team effectiveness provides rigorous basis for formulating useful team-building strategies for integrating a collaborative environment among project stakeholders and consequently improving project performance. Originality/value This paper bridges the identified knowledge gap concerning the dimensionality of teamwork attributes in construction-based setting and adds to existing knowledge of how team effectiveness can be leveraged to improve project performance in the construction management literature.

The recent advancements in various structural systems have made the selection of the appropriate structural system for a specific project a challenging decision-making process. This process involves different economic and technical criteria representing the availability of experienced technicians and engineers and necessary machinery and construction materials. Economic life cycle, environmental protection related issues, safety of the project site, and vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes are also issues related to the country and location in which the construction project takes place, and they should also be addressed in the decision-making process. In this paper, a new algorithm combining two well-known multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, elimination and choice expressing the reality III (ELECTRE III) and preference ranking organization method for enrich evaluation II (PROMETHEE II), have been specially developed for ranking of structural systems. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to group decision-making cases. In addition, the decision matrix data, criteria weights, preference, indifference, and veto thresholds are set as interval values to consider uncertainties in the decision-making procedure. The proposed methodology considers veto threshold, provide complete ranking, exempts the preference functions and includes conceptions such as risk, uncertainty, and reliability with interval approach. The proposed algorithm has been utilized in selecting the appropriate structural system in a low-rise multihousing project in Iran. In this case study, sixteen criteria have been used to select the best structural system between eight alternatives considering relevant uncertainties in the judgments of three groups of stakeholders (owner, consultants, and contractors). The results of the case study showed that the proposed methodology can be used as a proper tool for decision making in the construction management processes.

J	Daniel, EI; Pasquire, C; Dickens, G; Ballard, HG				Daniel, Emmanuel Itodo; Pasquire, Christine; Dickens, Graham; Ballard, Herman Glenn			The relationship between the last planner (R) system and collaborative planning practice in UK construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						UK; Construction planning; Collaborative planning; Construction sector; Last planner system; Production planning and management		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how the newly emerging UK practice of "collaborative planning" (CP) for construction project delivery aligns with the advocated principles of the global last planner system (LPS) of production planning and control. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed, qualitative, exploratory approach was adopted for the study. This entailed qualitative data through three techniques, namely: semi-structured interviews, documents analysis, and structured observation. In total, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted over a 12 month period with lean construction consultants, clients, main contractors, and subcontractors drawn from the building, highways and infrastructure and rail sector. In all, 15 projects were visited where practices were observed. Findings - The study reveals that the current practice of CP in the UK partially aligns with the LPS principles. Where practitioners have heard of the LPS they believe it to be the same practice as CP. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to 30 interviews, observation of 15 projects and document analysis. The aim of the study is not to generalise the findings, however, since the study examined top construction companies and practitioners in the UK and the findings were consistent across the sample, some conclusions could be made. The study is also limited to examining the construction phase only, future studies should incorporate the design phase. Practical implications - A clear identification of the elements of current practice compared to the components of the LPS provides a contribution to the future practice of project production planning and management in the construction industry. Social implications - The study highlights a continuing resistance to collaboration within the industry. This resistance is subtly embedded within implemented practices even though they are based on collaborative working for their success. Originality/value - This is among the first studies in the UK that comprehensively examines and reports the application of LPS/CP practice in construction across the major construction sectors. Future studies could build on the findings from this work to develop an approach/methodology to improve the current practice.

J	Chan, EHW; Au, MCY				Chan, Edwin H. W.; Au, Maria C. Y.			Relationship between organizational sizes and contractors' risk pricing behaviors for weather risk under different project values and durations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; CULTURE	A problem that always annoys building employers and their consultants when drafting building contracts is whether it is more cost efficient to retain certain risks with themselves or to transfer the same to contractors, and it has long been a difficulty to accurately estimate the cost for transferring risks to the other contract party. It is a very common market practice to remove contractors' entitlement to extension of time due to inclement weather, and in view of the significant impacts that inclement weather posed on construction progress, it would be helpful to assess the associated costs for such risk allocation exercises in order to ensure that it is a cost-effective transaction. The costs for these potential weather-caused delays are priced by contractors in their returned tenders. This risk-pricing behavior is affected by the contractor's risk perception and risk attitude. However, merely working out contractors' risk perception and risk attitude patterns is inadequate, as they may vary in accordance with different organizational sizes and project backgrounds. Therefore, further studies should be carried out on the implications of project information, such as project value and contract period, on different-sized contractors' risk behaviors. In this research, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the weather-risk-pricing behavioral patterns of various-sized contractors under different given project scenarios. The survey revealed that the impacts of project value and contract period (and, thus, the intensity of work and scale of exposure to weather risk) were significant on contractors' risk behaviors, and these impacts varied in accordance with different organizational sizes. The medium-sized contractors' pricing behaviors were rather constant under different project values and contract periods, while both small and large contractors behaved differently when the intensity of work and scale of risk exposure varied. Despite the fact that contractors of various sizes behaved differently in some given scenarios, the number of days of delaying cost allowed by them in returned tenders were generally less than the actual number of days of inclement weather affecting work.

An empirical survey of the motives and benefits of adopting guaranteed maximum price and target cost contracts in construction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guaranteed maximum price; Target cost contracting; Motives; Benefits; Hong Kong		In light of increasing project complexity, constraints on programme schedule and limited budget, there exists a strong call for changes in contracting procedures in construction. Both the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and Target Cost Contracting (TCC) approaches with a gain-share/pain-share arrangement have been advocated to achieve better value for money and more satisfactory project performance. This paper aims to review the prevailing practices of GMP/TCC in general, and explore the motives and benefits of implementing the GMP/TCC scheme in comparison with the traditional fixed-price lump-sum contract in particular. The research study is based on a comprehensive literature review and an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey for evaluating the relative importance of motives and benefits associated with GMP/TCC in Hong Kong. The survey data collected from 45 valid completed questionnaires were analysed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and one-way ANOVA test. The perceived benefits were measured and ranked from the perspectives of the client, contractor and consultant for cross-comparison. The survey findings indicated that the three most common motives of clients behind their decision of adopting GMP/TCC include: (1) to generate an incentive for contractor to achieve cost saving; (2) to develop better working relationship within the project team; and (3) to tap in contractor's expertise in design and innovation. The top three perceived benefits of applying GMP/TCC were found to be: (1) early settlement of final project account; (2) improved partners' working relationship under a partnering arrangement; and (3) capability of integrating contractor's expertise in building designs and innovations prior to construction. The research results are particularly essential in assisting key project stakeholders to realise the potential benefits derived from the use of GMP/TCC contracts and in generating more useful insights into alternative integrated contracting strategies for the construction industry, so as to drive for excellence in overall project performance.

J	Hu, ZZ; Zhang, XY; Wang, HW; Kassem, M				Hu, Zhen-Zhong; Zhang, Xiao-Yang; Wang, Heng-Wei; Kassem, Mohamad			Improving interoperability between architectural and structural design models: An industry foundation classes-based approach with web-based tools	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Data Model; IFC; Model Conversion; Structural Analysis; WebGL	INFORMATION EXCHANGES; BIM	Medium and large construction projects typically involve multiple structural consultants who use a wide range of structural analysis applications. These applications and technologies have inadequate interoperability and there is still a dearth of investigations addressing interoperability issues in the structural engineering domain. This paper proposes a novel approach which combines an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based Unified Information Model with a number of algorithms to enhance the interoperability: (a) between architectural and structural models, and (b) among multiple structural analysis models (bidirectional conversion or round tripping). The proposed approach aims to achieve the conversion by overcoming the inconsistencies in data structures, representation logics and syntax used in different software applications. The approach was implemented in both Client Server (C/S) and Browser Server (B/S) environments to enable central and remote collaboration among geographically dispersed users. The platforms were tested in four large real-life projects. The testing involved four key scenarios: (a) the bidirectional conversion among four structural analysis tools; (b) the comparison of the conversion via the proposed approach with the conversion via direct links among the involved tools; (c) the direct export from an IFC-based architectural tool through the Application Program Interface (API), and (d) the conversion and visualization of structural analysis results. All these scenarios were successfully performed and tested in four significant case studies. In particular, the conversion among the four structural analysis applications (ETABS, SAP2000, ANSYS and MIDAS) was successfully tested for all possible conversion routes among the four applications in two of the case studies (i.e., Project A and Project B). The first four steps of natural mode shapes and their natural vibration periods were calculated and compared with the converted models. They were all achieved within a standard deviation of 0.1 s and 0.2 sin Project A and Project B, respectively, indicating an accurate conversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hwang, BG; Zhao, XB; Tan, LLG				Hwang, Bon-Gang; Zhao, Xianbo; Tan, Lene Lay Ghim			Green building projects: schedule performance, influential factors and solutions	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Singapore; Buildings; Green building; Retrofitting; Delay; Schedule	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; LESSONS; DELAYS	Purpose - The purposes of this paper are to: investigate schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; identify the critical factors that influence the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects; and provide solutions to improve schedule performance of new and retrofitting green building projects. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey were conducted and responses were received from 34 firms experienced in green building projects in Singapore. After the data from the survey had been analyzed, face-to-face interviews were conducted with two senior project managers to solicit comments on the survey results. Findings - This study identified the degree of project delay in 98 new green building projects and 51 retrofitting green building projects in Singapore. The result indicated that 22 percent of the Singaporean green building projects were plagued with delay and retrofitting projects had a significantly higher likelihood of delay and significantly longer extension than new projects. In addition, "consultant cooperation to solve problems" was the most influential to schedule performance of both new and retrofitting green building projects, and the two project groups agreed on the overall ranking of the factors affecting schedule performance. Research limitations/implications - There may be geographical limitation on the conclusions drawn from the findings. Also, the sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. In addition, the majority of the respondents were contractors as other project players were reluctant to respond to the survey. Practical implications - This study provides a clear understanding of the schedule performance of green building projects as well as the critical factors that should be highlighted when constructing green building projects. Also, strategies to overcome the negative impact of these factors allow practitioners to better deal with the potential causes of delay and to attain the schedule performance. Originality/value - Although construction delays have been widely investigated in previous studies relating to construction management, few have attempted to analyze the schedule performance of new and retrofitting green buildings. Thus, this study adds significantly to the existing research on both green building and construction delay.

There is currently no framework for implementing lean construction specifically tailored to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) construction industry. Existing lean construction frameworks are focussed on other countries and are less applicable in the KSA due to differences in socio-cultural and operational contexts. Design/methodology/approach This study employs the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique for data collection and analysis. First, following a survey of 282 construction professionals, 12 critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing lean construction in the KSA construction industry were identified by Sarhan et al. (2016). Second, 16 of these professionals who have 15 years or more experience were exclusively selected to examine the contextual relationship among the 12 CSFs. A row and column questionnaire was used for a pairwise comparison of the CSFs. A matrix of cross-impact multiplications (MICMAC) was applied to analyse the questionnaire data to develop an ISM model that can serve as a framework for implementing lean construction. Third, the framework was subjected to further validation by interviewing five experts to check for conceptual inconsistencies and to confirm the applicability of the framework in the context of the KSA construction industry. Findings The findings reveal that the CSFs are divided into four clusters: autonomous, linkage, dependent and driving clusters. Additionally, the findings reveal seven hierarchies of inter-relationships among the CSFs. The order of practical application of the CSFs descends from the seventh hierarchy to the first hierarchy. Originality/value The new framework is a significant advancement over existing lean construction frameworks as it employs an ISM technique to specify the hierarchical relationships among the different factors that contribute to the successful implementation of lean construction. The primary value of this study is the development of a new framework that reflects the socio-cultural and operational contexts in the KSA construction industry and can guide the successful implementation of lean construction. Therefore, construction industry operators such as contractors, consultants, government departments and professionals can rely on the framework to implement lean construction more effectively and successfully.

Design/methodology/approach Interview-based exploratory research strategy was used to survey senior managers and directors of medium- to large-sized road contracting firms in NZ. Empirical data were analyzed using the multi-attribute analytical technique. Findings Results revealed 70 productivity constraints faced by the RPMRCs in NZ; in diminishing order of influence, these constraints were aggregated into eight broad categories as follows: finance, workforce, technology/process, statutory/regulatory compliance, project characteristics, project management/project team characteristics, unforeseen circumstances and other/external factors. The most important constraints in each of the eight broad categories were presented. Research limitations/implications The key limitation of the research is that it was based on feedback from a limited number of participants which were less than the minimum required to represent the views of the potential participants in the sampling frame for the study. As a result, the findings may not be reliably generalized beyond the scope of the data used. Further research on the subject is recommended to ensure that the representation of the views of the individuals and companies that comprised the sampling frame is achieved. The current findings could be formulated as propositions or hypotheses to be tested in future confirmatory research. Practical implications At the industry level, the findings could provide the basis for the skill development programs of the NZ RPMRCs. The application of the research findings by the RPMRCs and consultants could result in significant improvement in the productivity of the NZ roading sector and the sector's enhanced contribution to the economy. Originality/value Currently, there is little research on the priority constraints to productivity and performance in the NZ roading sector. The findings contribute to knowledge by revealing critical factors constraining productivity performance of the NZ RMRCs and the associated improvement measures. New and more enriching viewpoints were provided on how contractors could leverage their limited resources to address the identified key constraints.

J	Amuda-Yusuf, G; Mohamed, SF				Amuda-Yusuf, Ganiyu; Mohamed, Sarajul Fikri			Essential features of a building services standard method of measurement in Malaysia	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Malaysia; Standards; Construction management; Cost estimates; Building services; Quantity surveying	COST ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; PROJECTS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the need to develop building service standard method of measurement (BSSMM) that would provide a home ground advantage and a framework for managing the cost of building services by quantity surveyors. Design/methodology/approach - A review of previous research on the rules of measurement was carried out. This exercise provides the basis for questionnaire design which was administered to quantity surveyors in Malaysia construction industry. Findings - The results indicated the need to develop BSSMM. In total, 23 variables were identified as essential features of such standard method of measurement. These variables were grouped into three categories and a priority ranking of them was carried out. The analysis revealed a strong agreement among quantity surveyors on the priority ranking of the essential features of the BSSMM. Research limitations/implications - Although, the research would assist industry stakeholders in developing BSSMM that reflects local and international best practices, there is need to further investigate how the rules of the BSSMM could be aligned with construction industry classification systems. Practical implications - The availability of information and computer technology (ICT) tools has transformed the traditional practices in the industry and offered values to quantity surveyors, but if quantity surveyors' tools cannot be consolidated and incorporated into emerging ICT applications, then QS collaboration will be difficult, and the requirements for electronic data exchange will be impractical. Therefore, this type of standard method of measurement will facilitate cross-referencing and coordination between BoQ and other documents such as drawings, specifications and tender produced by other project participants and thereby lay efficient foundation for effective collaboration of quantity surveyors in BIM model. In addition, the BSSMM will not only comply with local industry practices, it will also be internationally compatible. Originality/value - Adoption of a structured format based on BSSMM to present building services cost information is essential in view of the increase in the value and complexity of building services in modern buildings. However, there is need to enhance quantity surveyors' knowledge in the technology and cost management of building services so as to ensure the reliability of cost advice provided to clients. This goal would be partly achieved through education and training of Quantity Surveyors/Cost Consultants in the interpretation and use of the rules of an SMM.

J	Zhang, XL; Bao, HJ; Wang, HD; Skitmore, M				Zhang, Xiaoling; Bao, Haijun; Wang, Hongdi; Skitmore, Martin			A model for determining the optimal project life span and concession period of BOT projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management; Build-operate-transfer; Project life span; Concession period; Optimization	OPERATE; BUILD	The concession agreement is the core feature of BOT projects, with the concession period being the most essential feature in determining the time span of the various rights, obligations and responsibilities of the government and concessionaire. Concession period design is therefore crucial for financial viability and determining the benefit/cost allocation between the host government and the concessionaire. However, while the concession period and project life span are essentially interdependent, most methods to date consider their determination as contiguous events that are determined exogenously. Moreover, these methods seldom consider the, often uncertain, social benefits and costs involved that are critical in defining, pricing and distributing benefits and costs between the various parties and evaluating potentially distributable cash flows. In this paper, we present the results of the first stage of a research project aimed at determining the optimal build-operate-transfer (BOT) project life span and concession period endogenously and interdependently by maximizing the combined benefits of stakeholders. Based on the estimation of the economic and social development involved, a negotiation space of the concession period interval is obtained, with its lower boundary creating the desired financial return for the private investors and its upper boundary ensuring the economic feasibility of the host government as well as the maximized welfare within the project life. The outcome of the new quantitative model is considered as a suitable basis for future field trials prior to implementation. The structure and details of the model are provided in the paper with Hong Kong tunnel project as a case study to demonstrate its detailed application. The basic contributions of the paper to the theory of construction procurement are that the project life span and concession period are determined jointly and the social benefits taken into account in the examination of project financial benefits. In practical terms, the model goes beyond the current practice of linear-process thinking and should enable engineering consultants to provide project information more rationally and accurately to BOT project bidders and increase the government's prospects of successfully entering into a contract with a concessionaire. This is expected to generate more negotiation space for the government and concessionaire in determining the major socioeconomic features of individual BOT contracts when negotiating the concession period. As a result, the use of the model should increase the total benefit to both parties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

J	Mok, KY; Shen, GQ; Yang, R				Mok, Ka Yan; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping; Yang, Rebecca			Stakeholder complexity in large scale green building projects: A holistic analysis towards a better understanding	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder; Case study; Social network analysis; Green building project	SOCIAL NETWORK; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	Purpose In response to the world's rising awareness on sustainability, industry players and policymakers are devoting great efforts to bolster green building developments. Every green building project (GBP) involves numerous stakeholders and potentially incompatible concerns. Despite the associated environmental, economic and social benefits, GBP developments have often confronted managerial barriers which are actually emerged from stakeholders - the actual key determinants of a project. Holistically analyzing the complexity of stakeholders in GBPs is, therefore, crucial to improving GBP management and achieving greater sustainability for all involved. The purpose of this paper is to analyze stakeholder complexity in large GBPs using a holistic framework which integrates both empirical and rationalistic analytical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The complexity of stakeholders in GBPs can be considered from three aspects - identifying stakeholders, assessing stakeholder interactions and analyzing stakeholder concerns. The proposed stakeholder analysis framework uses both empirical methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and rationalistic methods (e.g. chain referral sampling and social network analysis) to analyze GBP stakeholder complexity. Case study of a lab-enabled commercial GBP in Hong Kong was undertaken to illustrate the framework. Findings The framework enables a holistic, objective and effective stakeholder analysis; leading GBP leaders toward a complete understanding of project stakeholder complexity. The case study findings bring managerial insights to GBP leaders on the general SNA-related stakeholder dynamics and the important stakeholder concerns, of large Hong Kong GBPs. The findings diagnose general connectivity structures of GBP stakeholders, identify influential and peripheral actors in GBP information exchange, and suggest clues to improve their dynamics. In addition, ten key stakeholder concerns were identified, including comprehensive governmental standards and procedures, clear sustainability goals at the outset, effective stakeholder engagement, adequate design flexibility, and a can-do attitude of contractors and consultants - which are all vital for successful GBP development. The underlying reasons of these concerns and recommendations to addressing them were also discussed. Originality/value Many existing GBP stakeholder studies appear to use a single analytical perspective to assess project stakeholder complexity, but this may not gain a full understanding. The holistic stakeholder analysis framework used herein combines empiricism and rationalism. It helps to bring GBP leaders and implementers toward a more informed project decision making, a more thorough understanding of stakeholder complexity, as well as a more effective engagement of stakeholders.

J	Subramanyan, H; Sawant, PH; Bhatt, V				Subramanyan, Hariharan; Sawant, Priyadarshi H.; Bhatt, Vandana			Construction Project Risk Assessment: Development of Model Based on Investigation of Opinion of Construction Project Experts from India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analytical hierarchy process; Contract administration; Project risk management; Student t-test		Risk is involved in every business, and the construction industry is no exception. Most of the project management issues that impact a project arise from associated uncertainties. The Indian construction industry is worth about $120 billion and this could grow considerably, driven by major projects across the country. There are a number of problems in the construction industry in India that are attributed to various factors. The focus of the present research is to identify factors that influence the smooth completion of a project and develop a risk assessment model. The authors of the paper have made an attempt to analyze the present risk condition in the construction industry by meeting experts in the field to collect first-hand information as a first step towards risk assessment and suggest a risk response strategy. A total of 93 risk factors were identified and listed under various subgroups in this paper. A questionnaire was prepared on the basis of a literature review and was filled by six contractors, four owners, five project management experts, having more than 20 years of experience in the construction field in India. As the factors are represented in qualitative terms, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used. The result of the study is listed, in which the percentage contribution of various factors to smooth completion is shown. Because the findings are based on a small cross section of experts, Student's t-test, a significance test, has been applied to know the significance of test findings on the general construction industry. The study results are reduced further into two groups for simplification and better understanding. The first group covers owner-, contractor-, project manager-, finance-, and resource-specific risks; and the second group covers risk pertaining to project-, architect/consultant-, external environment-, and contract-clause-specific factors. The analysis results indicate that the risks specific to the first group are found to be 10.5 to 12.0% with a standard deviation less than 1.66, whereas the percent apportionment of second group ranges from 9.5 to 13%, a larger range than the first group of factors with standard deviation up to as high as 3.3, indicating wider variation, thus making it difficult to predict their occurrence in a project. The findings are also confirmed by the project disputes related to various projects discussed in the paper. The risk response strategy suggested in this paper will be useful in mitigating the adverse effects of risk in project completion in the Indian construction industry. A planned approach in handling a project-specific and external-environment-specific risk coupled with a proper contract administration can mitigate overall risk to a greater extent in the Indian construction industry.

J	Sospeter, NG; Rwelamila, PMD; Gimbi, J				Sospeter, Nyamagere Gladys; Rwelamila, Pantaleo M. D.; Gimbi, Joaqium			Project management challenges for post-disaster reconstruction projects in Angola: a public sector perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Angola; Challenges; Post-disaster reconstruction (PDR); Project management; Public sector	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION; BUILDING BACK; DISASTER; INFRASTRUCTURE; RECOVERY; PROCUREMENT; EARTHQUAKE; LESSONS; ACEH	Purpose Despite the extensive research on post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP), there is a paucity of studies that examine critical challenges for the project practices in post-war-developing countries, particularly, Africa. The purpose of this research is to investigate the key project management challenges impacting the post-disaster reconstruction projects (PDRP) during the construction and planning stages in Angola, with an aim to fill the knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach The primary data was collected from 130 project management practitioners working with planning, provincial government organisations including consultants, and contractors within the Angolan public sectors organisations. Response data was subjected to descriptive statistics, mean scores, and inferential statistics (One samplet-tests) and Kendall's concordance. Findings The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of the ranking of the 21challenges affecting the PDRP among the groups; with statistically significant differences amongst the 10 challenges. Based on the overall sample, 6 out of 10 critical challenges are between (24-25) levels of agreement close to the mean. The results of the mean score ranking indicate that "working with poor or restricted access to location", "project culture that fits the needs of local people"; "improving the capacity of local government", "minimizing the negative effects of local people" and "relocation issues by establishing property rights during the reconstruction project" were the five critical challenges to managing PDRP whereas "improving information and communication processes", "securing adequate resources (material and machinery)", "dealing with rising costs of materials and labour" were considered to be the least critical. Research limitations/implications The study was restricted to one province and Country (out of 18) namely, Luanda, Angola. Therefore, the findings may not be generalized to public sector organisations operating in different countries with different contexts, political settings and disaster complexities. Practical implications The establishment of challenges in PDRPs helps the key stakeholders by providing the foundation to project teams to address the challenges during planning and construction stages, and thus improving project delivery in the future. Understanding the uniqueness of PDRPs and interdependency of project management from the implementing organization is of particular value for the managers of future projects and other decision-makers, especially in the emerging countries. Moreover, the findings could be used to reflect on the need to formulate policies appropriate to post disaster environments, which among other issues could address building policies, which could include land ownership regulations and procedures together with property rights. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge on the subject within a previously unexplored post-war context with a focus on public organizations perspective. The study provides insights on the challenges affecting the post-disaster reconstruction across the Angolan public sector.	[Sospeter, Nyamagere Gladys; Rwelamila, Pantaleo M.

J	Kassem, MA; Khoiry, MA; Hamzah, N				Kassem, Mukhtar A.; Khoiry, Muhamad Azry; Hamzah, Noraini			Theoretical review on critical risk factors in oil and gas construction projects in Yemen	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction project; Oil and gas; Yemen; Risk factors	COST OVERRUNS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MANAGEMENT PRACTICES; DELAY; TIME; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; IMPACT; MODEL	Purpose The oil and gas construction projects are affected negatively by the drop in oil price in recent years. Thus, most engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies are opting to optimize the project mainly to mitigate the source of risks in construction to achieve the project expectation. Risk factors cause a threat to the project objectives regarding time, cost and quality. It is additionally a vital component in deviating from the client's expectation of productivity, safety and standards. This research aims to investigate the causes of risk in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review from various sources including books, conference proceedings, the Internet project management journals and oil and gas industry journals was conducted to achieve the objectives of this study. This initial work was predicated strictly on a literature review and the judgments of experts to develop the risk factor framework for the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Findings The authors found a few studies related to risk factors in oil and gas construction projects and shared a similar view about general construction projects. However, only a fraction of the factors accepted have included the variances of other studies on a regional basis or specific countries, such as the Yemen situation, due to the differences between the general construction industry and oil and gas industry. Moreover, the factors of these attributes were still accepted due to their applicability to the oil and gas industry, and no significant variances existed between countries. Research has indicated that 51 critical factors cause risks in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Such risk factors can be divided into two major groups: (1) internal risk factors, including seven critical sources of risks, namely client, contractor, consultant, feasibility study and design, tendering and contract, resources and material supply and project management; and (2) external risk factors, including six sources of critical risk factors, namely national economic, political risk, local people, environment and safety, security risk and force-majeure-related risk factors. A risk factor framework was developed to identify the critical risk factors in the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to the oil and gas construction projects. Practical implications Practically, this study highlights the risk factors that cause a negative effect on the success of oil and gas construction projects in Yemen. The identification of these factors is the first step in the risk management process to develop strategic responses for risks and enhance the chances of project success. Social implications The identification of risks factors that cause the failure of construction projects helps develop response strategies for these risks, thereby increasing the chances of project success reflected in the oil and gas sector, which is a main tributary of the national economy in developing countries. Originality/value This research is the pioneer for future investigations into this vital economic sector. Given the lack of resources and studies in the field of construction projects for the Yemeni oil and gas sector, the Yemeni government, oil companies and researchers in this field are expected to benefit from the results of this study. The critical risk factors specific to the oil and gas construction projects in Yemen should be further investigated with focus only on Yemen and its oil and gas industry players.

J	Alade, K; Windapo, AO				Alade, Kehinde; Windapo, Abimbola Olukemi			Developing effective 4IR leadership framework for construction organisations	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						4IR; 4IR leadership; Construction; Effective leadership; South Africa	EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE; TRAITS; STYLES; PERSONALITY	Purpose Globally, the business organisations are experiencing a transformation due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The need for an effective 4IR leadership has placed new demands on organisations to develop and select leaders to effectively lead the organisations in the 4IR era. Hence, it becomes important to understand the attributes for an effective 4IR leadership. This study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. The hypothesised relationships from the framework were tested using a survey of 416 senior construction executives across the nine provinces of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the study objectives, an online survey was sent to construction firms across the nine provinces of South Africa. "Construction", for the purpose of this study comprised building and civil engineering firms listed on the construction industry development board (cidb) register of contractors in South Africa. The target group was the upper echelon executives, i.e. Chairman, CEOs, managing directors and chief operating officers, and the survey was directed to contact e-mail of the study samples. The professional service providers (architects, consultants and surveyors) were not part of the survey sample. The database of the organisational leaders was obtained from the cidb. The online survey was created on the 23rd of August 2019 and closed on the 23rd of April 2020, thereby making the duration of the survey eight months. The total number of respondents at the time of closure of the survey was four hundred and sixteen (416). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of the results. Findings This study validates the effective 4IR leadership framework as proposed by Alade and Windapo (2019) by empirically examining relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership. The findings from this study have shown that effective 4IR leadership is positively associated with leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Hence, an effective 4IR leader must spread the knowledge and understanding of the 4IR opportunities and threats in the organisations. The leader must ensure that the executives in the construction organisation become change conversant and ensure that the employees acquire 4IR skills. Multiple leadership intelligence is essential to effective 4IR leadership. These multiple intelligence are the ability to adapt knowledge and skills to different situations, ability to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, a high level of understanding, ability to process and analyse information and ability to utilise knowledge from many disciplinary boundaries. Research limitations/implications This study is focused on construction business organisations in South Africa. As such, similar studies on 4IR leadership effectiveness can be carried out in other countries and across other organisations. Future studies should also consider using a case study approach specifically focused on organisations with high implementations of 4IR technologies. Interacting with the leaders of such organisations and their employees will give a broader perspective in understanding the reasons of their effectiveness. Practical implications The leadership of construction organisations must partner with the academia, industry players and team members in their efforts to implement 4IR in their organisations. Also, the existence of a positive association between leadership traits and effective 4IR leadership implies that to ensure a 4IR-driven work process in construction organisations, the leadership must embrace disruption and quickly respond to change. Further, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that appropriate leadership styles are required for effective 4IR leadership. The appropriate leadership style for effective 4IR leadership requires the leadership of construction organisations to delegate some of the 4IR function. The 4IR function must be performed based on the challenges that are associated with 4IR. The positive correlation between leadership intelligence and leadership styles makes it possible to conclude that the competencies of leadership of construction organisations in a 4IR-driven change depend on the level of leadership intelligence of the executives of construction organisations. It is evident that 4IR will change the business environment; hence, leadership intelligence is required to adapt construction organisations to the change dynamics. This study has provided information on what 4IR leadership entails in construction organisations. The study has contributed a framework for ensuring effective and smooth flow 4IR implementation in construction organisations through a purposeful leadership that combines leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Social implications This research will be useful to government agencies and board members of construction organisations, in appointing leaders to see the construction industry and organisations perform better in the 4IR era. Young individuals who are also aspiring to take on leadership role in the industry will benefit from this study. Originality/value This study is a new and original research that seeks to investigate the need for an effective 4IR leadership in construction business organisations. Construction as an industry is usually criticised for her slow response to change. Since leadership is required to drive the change agenda, this study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised.
