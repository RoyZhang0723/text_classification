To address this, the response of an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) to the 2010 Haiti earthquake is analysed from a project governance perspective. The aim is to assess the understanding and applicability of project governance to NGOs operating in disaster relief situations. Drawing on an extensive review of extant literature, the dimensions of project governance are identified and a conceptual framework is developed as a basis for the investigation. The findings indicate that while the NGO does not explicitly recognise project governance as a concept, nine of its dimensions are particularly evident in the NGO's oversight of its project work. The research also reveals that effective project governance not only fills the governance gap between corporate governance and project management, but also between disaster relief and project management.

Design/methodology/approach The setting for this study is Sri Lanka, a country currently recovering from civil war and natural disasters and host to a large number of national and international NGOs involved in development projects. Data collection was conducted using a quantitative survey which obtained 447 responses. Multivariate analysis of data was conducted using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings The study confirmed that overall project success in NGOs could be assessed in three levels: project management (PM) success, project success and NGO success. The results conclude that there are strong associations among the three levels of project success; moreover, PM success and project success are indispensable for achieving NGO success. Originality/value This study extends existing research to confirm the presence of the three levels of project success and the interconnections among them. These findings can support subsequent research on development projects and also support the design of holistic evaluation tools to support project practices in NGOs.

Studies have documented their approaches and strategies, yet little is still known about how they organize and how their projects help them to achieve their mission. The authors propose a contextualized and historical perspective to better understand how and why NGOs organize by projects, and how this strengthens their strategy and commitment to local development.

Transformational leadership and project success: The mediating role of team-building	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project success; Team-building; Transformational leadership	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; MODERATING ROLE; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; TRUST	Although the effect of transformational leadership on project success is empirically supported, less is known about the mechanisms that explain this effect. To address this issue, we propose the mediating role of team-building as a possible explanation of the relationship between transformational leadership and project success. Based on a field survey of 200 development project managers in the Ethiopian Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) sector, the results of our study indicate that team-building partially mediates the effect of transformational leadership on project success. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.	[Aga, D.

As with other organizations delivering projects, ID NGOs seem to be failing many stakeholders due to poor delivery of results. Lack, and mismanagement, of social links and knowledge resources have been identified as the biggest challenges of ID NGOs in reaching vulnerable beneficiary populations. We have explored ID NGOs' social capital and knowledge management systems in order to propose an integrated model to optimize ID NGO project management through social resources embedded into organizational structures. The integrated model we propose enables multi-stakeholder engagement in all phases of project life cycle, building a culture of accountability and respect. This model also helps promote smart and flexible solutions to the "wicked " problems ID projects often grapple with, as well as timely adaptation to changed circumstances and unforeseen or challenging events.

J	Golini, R; Kalchschmidt, M; Landoni, P				Golini, Ruggero; Kalchschmidt, Matteo; Landoni, Paolo			Adoption of project management practices: The impact on international development projects of non-governmental organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project management tools; International Development; NGO	FRAMEWORK; MATURITY; PARTICIPATION; INDICATORS; CRITERIA	International Development (ID) projects carried out by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are considered one of the pillars for providing assistance to developing countries, but these projects are reported to have high failure rates and their performance is often considered not satisfactory. Only recently researchers started to consider project management (PM) practices as possible remedy for the poor performance of ID projects. Following this direction, we have conducted a large-scale survey among project managers working for NGOs and dealing with ID projects to assess the extent of adoption of methodologies and tools. Moreover, this study assesses the impact of the PM practices on project performance. We present an analysis and discussion of the evidence from this international survey administered to almost 500 project managers. The results indicate different levels of maturity in the adoption of PM tools that are related to project success in both the short and long term. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Previous research largely focused on the negativity surrounding living in refugee camps and mostly ignored the input of refugees. This study explores the possibilities of involving refugees in architectural design and construction decisions in the camps. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a qualitative interpretive research approach and employs exploratory ethnographic methods. Participatory design (PD) principles are applied to design and construct community place projects in two refugee camps in Greece. Findings The findings demonstrate that, despite the technical and institutional challenges of employing PD approaches in refugee camps, there are observed positive impacts on the wellbeing of refugees and impacts on the hosting communities. Practical implications This paper contests the negativity surrounding refugee camps and has implications on research, practice and society as well as a positive impact on NGO organisations, policy-makers and other stakeholders involved in the governance of refugee camps. Originality/value This paper addresses a critical issue concerning how to include refugees in the design, implementation and maintenance of refugee camps to improve their well-being and fight the feeling of "otherness" for both refugees and host communities. This study extends research on refugee camps by collaborating with refugees to improve their lives within the camps. This research contributes to architectural management and construction studies by providing practical recommendations related to PD methods in new contexts.

J	Boudet, HS; Jayasundera, DC; Davis, J				Boudet, Hilary Schaffer; Jayasundera, Dilanka Chinthana; Davis, Jennifer			Drivers of Conflict in Developing Country Infrastructure Projects: Experience from the Water and Pipeline Sectors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Infrastructure; Pipelines; Water supply; Construction management; Public-private partnerships; Fuzzy sets; Public participation; Conflict; Developing countries		Despite the considerable scholarship focused on infrastructure investment in the developing world and the substantial sums of money spent each year on developing-country infrastructure, little attention has been given to understanding the drivers of conflict that shape the trajectory and cost structures of these massive investments. The manifestation of conflict among stakeholders in infrastructure projects ranges from the renegotiation of contract terms by project partners to popular protests among consumers of privatized services. The principal objective of this research is to identify combinations of country, project, and stakeholder factors that are associated with the emergence of legal and political conflict within natural gas and oil pipeline projects and water supply concessions and leases. The analysis includes data from 26 infrastructure projects spanning 31 countries and uses an analytical approach derived from Boolean algebra. Country-level characteristics, such as extent of democracy and rate of international NGO membership, are found to be important elements in the recipes for conflict among water supply projects but not for pipeline projects. Local impacts such as service price increases (water supply) and limited provision of oil and gas to the project host country (pipelines) are also important drivers of conflict for both subsectors. The involvement of one or more international financial institutions is also associated with the emergence of conflict in projects. Contrary to expectations, public consultation is associated with conflict in both subsectors. Overall, the study findings suggest that several factors associated with conflict in infrastructure projects can be minimized with careful project design. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000333.
