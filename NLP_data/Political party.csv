A Fuzzy Approach for the Allocation of Risks in Public-Private Partnership Water-Infrastructure Projects in Developing Countries	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Water supply infrastructure; Risk allocation; Public-private partnership; Fuzzy set theory; Public and private sectors	SYNTHETIC EVALUATION; SUPPLY PROJECTS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; RANKING; SYSTEM	The allocation of risk between public-sector and private-sector parties in a public-private partnership (PPP) contract is a critical element of success that should be based on an assessment of the party best able to manage it. Assessing the risk-management capability of a contracting party to reach an efficient risk-allocation decision is subjective and implicit because it requires value judgments and experiential knowledge of expert practitioners. This paper draws on a set of established risk-allocation criteria (RAC) and the fuzzy-set approach to examine the allocation of five key risk factors related to PPPs in water supply infrastructure projects. The fuzzy set is used to deal with ambiguity in the linguistic RAC to minimize the fuzziness and bias in qualitative expert knowledge that characterize real-life decision-making. To explore how the risks should be allocated, three rounds of a Delphi questionnaire survey was conducted to elicit knowledge of practitioners with hands-on experience related to PPP projects in the water sector by requesting them to evaluate the risk factors on each risk-allocation criterion. The RAC and experiential knowledge were modeled to reflect capabilities of the public-private parties and to suggest the risk-allocation decisions for the corresponding risks. The results show that the risks should be shared between the government and the private sector, rather than wholly transferring specific risks to a particular party. This paper shows that it is possible to effectively distribute risks between the public-private parties based on fuzzy-set theory, RAC, and qualitative expert knowledge. The method has a merit of enabling decision-makers to utilize qualitative linguistic terms to assess risk-management capabilities of public-private parties and of predicting risk-allocation strategies in a contract. Also, the paper hints that, in developing countries, governments may take some political actions to make a water-infrastructure project to be executed via the PPP mode more attractive to private investors.

Credit enhancement factors for the financing of independent power producer (IPP) projects in Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Independent power producer; Credit enhancement; Asia; Public private partnership	CHINA	Public and private parties give a number of guarantees and commitments in the form of credit enhancement for successful investment and implementation of independent power producer (IPP) projects in Asia. A research is thus conducted to find the suitable credit enhancement factors for these projects. From 27 out of 28 credit enhancement factors that were validated by IPP professionals, factor analysis revealed five factor groupings which are - (1) shareholders' credit enhancement, (2) host government's credit enhancement, (3) multi-lateral development banks (MDBs), export credit agencies (ECAs) and other parties' credit enhancement, (4) capital structure mechanism, and (5) commercial bank's credit enhancement. From these critical credit enhancement groupings, it is further noticed that contingency equity support, standby credit guarantee, subordinated debt mechanism, financing with political risk insurance from MDBs and ECAs, escrow account, and standby letter of credit are of great importance for financing decision of IPP projects in Asia.

Additionally, identifying efficient and effective use of resources has been a challenge. The study sought to identify intangible resources that will enhance the profitability strategies of small construction firms. Purposive sampling was used to identify professionals who were Owners/managers. Relative Important Index was used for ranking and Kendall's coefficient of concordance to measure the degree of agreement of the ranking among the professional groups. Employer's experience, client trust, employee experience, patent and copy-right, networking were the key intangible resources. There was a high degree of agreement between the selected professionals on the ranking. Small construction firms are encouraged to improve their understanding of the political and economic environment in which they operate. This study highlights intangibles resources that parties in the building construction industry should be conscious of. It further provides an opportunity for researchers in construction management to interrogate the impact of these resources within the wider industry as the study was limited to building professionals.

J	Kuru, K; Artan, D				Kuru, Kadir; Artan, Deniz			A canvas model for risk assessment and performance estimation in public-private partnerships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public-private partnerships (PPP); risk assessment; performance estimation; risk factors; critical success factors; compensation mechanisms; contract drafting; analytical hierarchy process (AHP)	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; PPP PROJECTS; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; POLITICAL RISKS; CHINA; ALLOCATION; RANKING; CSFS	Public-private partnership (PPP) is being widely used to meet the growing infrastructure and service demand. However, previous literature draws attention to distressed or failed PPP projects due to significant risks. In the quest for assessing risks and estimating the performance at the outset of a project, there is a need for a practical tool allowing in-depth analysis of the project conditions. This paper aims to develop a PPP Canvas which enables assessment of the project risk factors and determining the related compensation mechanisms that can be used to mitigate these risks or allocate them to the parties in a balanced way. The Canvas also helps to estimate a project performance score based on the significance coefficients determined by the Analytical Hierarchy Process. AHP results show that stability of economic environment, political support and government intervention are the most important risk factors in the local context. AHP can be repeated for each specific PPP project, as part of the PPP Canvas process, to foster discussion and analysis of the risks and compensation mechanisms across different geographical locations and PPP project types. The paper adds a new dimension to PPP risk assessment by making use of the Business Model Canvas approach and the inclusion of contractual compensation and penalty mechanisms. As the stakeholders become more informed of the project conditions and the risks involved, they can make better decisions throughout the project life-cycle and can benefit from the identified compensation mechanisms in contract drafting.

However, PPPs in the water sector have witnessed many failures in both developed and developing countries, not only resulting in hefty financial burdens for the parties involved but also eroding public confidence and trust in the private sector participation in water services. In this study, we first explored the socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and social-political failure drivers (FDs) that resulted in the failures of 36 international water PPP projects. The relative significance of the FDs was evaluated through a questionnaire survey of international PPP experts. A hierarchical structural failure model was then developed using interpretative structural modeling that graphically displays the causal relationships of the FDs. Finally, cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification [matrice d'impacts croises-multiplication applique a un classement (MICMAC)] analysis established the degree of the relationships between the FDs. The hierarchical structural failure model can serve as a tool to avoid potential problems in order to prevent the occurrence of next failure drivers, thus increasing the chance of success of water PPPs.

However, actual empirical research works in this research area are limited. This paper reports the first stage of a research study, which aims to identify and assess the principal risks for the delivery of PPP projects in China and to address their proper risk allocation between the private and public sectors. An empirical questionnaire survey was designed to examine the relative importance of different risk factors and to analyze the allocation of risk factors to different parties in PPP projects. A total of 580 questionnaires were sent out, and a total of 105 valid responses were obtained for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to investigate whether significant difference in perception existed first between the private and public sectors and second between industrial practitioners and academics in China. The empirical findings show that the three most important risk factors for PPP projects in China are (1) government intervention; (2) government corruption; and (3) poor public decision-making processes. These findings reveal that the Chinese government intervention and corruption may be the major obstacles to the success of PPP projects in China. A major cause for these risks may be attributed to inefficient legislative and supervisory systems for PPP projects in China. After conducting the Mann-Whitney U test on the 105 survey respondents, the empirical findings indicate that the perceptions of all 34 risk factors in China between the private and public sectors were not significantly different. Similarly, there were no significant differences between academics and industrial practitioners except that the former perceived the problem of government corruption to be more severe than did the latter. For risk allocation, the empirical results indicate that the public and private sectors were in general consensus with most of the risks identified. The major risks that the public sector preferred to accept are within the systematic risk category, especially political, legal, and social risks. The private sector preferred to retain the principal risks within the specific project risk category, especially construction, operation, and relationship risks, in addition to economic risks within systematic risk category. The remaining risk, environment risk, is preferred to be shared between the two sectors. This research study enables international construction companies to better understand how risks should be assessed and allocated for PPP projects in China. It also assists in risk response planning and control for future PPP projects in China. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000049. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Yeung, John F.

The prevailing production-engineering perspective too often assumes that organizations are unitary entities where all parties strive for the common goal of 'improved performance'. An alternative perspective is developed that considers the diffusion of lean construction across contested pluralistic arenas. Different actors mobilize different storylines to suit their own localized political agendas. Multiple storylines of lean construction continuously compete for attention with other management fashions. The conceptualization and enactment of lean construction therefore differs across contexts, often taking on different manifestations from those envisaged. However, such localized enactments of lean construction are patterned and conditioned by pre-existing social and economic structures over which individual managers have limited influence. Taking a broader view, 'leanness' can be conceptualized in terms of a quest for structural flexibility involving restructuring, downsizing and outsourcing. From this perspective, the UK construction industry can be seen to have embarked upon leaner ways of working in the mid-1970s, long before the terminology of lean thinking came into vogue. Semi-structured interviews with construction sector policy-makers provide empirical support for the view that lean construction is a multifaceted concept that defies universal definition.

Based on a model describing the main risks affecting a project, a linear regression analysis is conducted on a data set of privately financed health care projects in the United Kingdom to explore the main factors that might have significant relationships with the annual unitary charge payment. The results reveal that the economic and political environment, the hospital capacity, the construction duration, and the concession period are significant factors of the price paid by the granting authority. The study confirms that the unitary charge is not only affected by investment, operations, and financial life-cycle costs, but also by risk factors and the level of risk allocated to the private sponsors. The proposed methodology might help both public and private parties in improving a private finance initiative project's compensation design, in order to achieve a higher value in privately financed infrastructures. The given model might also support the process of better determining the amount of annual payment based on select drivers and appropriately transferred risk factors.

The aims of this study are to: (1) illustrate and cluster the financial viability risk factors in accordance with the PPP WWTP projects' nature, (2) assess the risk factors' criticality degrees according to their severity and frequency levels of the financial viability, and (3) pinpoint the suited allocation of the financial viability risk factors between the public and private parties. Design/methodology/approach Relying on the previous analysts' endeavors, the questionnaire method, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach and the hypothetical normal distribution curve model; the severity, frequency, criticality and allocation preference of 32 financial viability risk factors were assessed from 12 Egyptian PPP experts. Findings The data analysis yielded that foreign exchange risk, currency risk/inflation, license risk, construction cost-overrun and late site handover are the key factors in arising the financial viability risk issue in the PPP WWTP projects. Considering the discussion of these key risks, the study summarized that the financial viability's key risk factors are notably be affected by the economic, political and administrative circumstances of the host county. Additionally, the inflation lesion was found to be the core reason of most of the key risk factors. Originality/value This research originality stems from its contribution to address the gab in the PPP risk assessment literature of the concessionaire's financial viability in the WWTP projects in a country of developing economy as Egypt. This, first, enriches the scholarly based knowledge of the PPP projects' risk analysts of the developing countries. Accordingly, it moves the current PPP risk assessment research further to deeply apprehend these markets' risks. Second, it equips the policymakers in the public and private sectors of such projects with a map that clarifies their assigned risk factors and the responsibilities that each party should bear to generate a mutual stable investment environment for achieving their aims successfully. This, indeed, paves the way for more private investments to be involved in the developing markets' PPP projects with a profitable satisfactory level for the private concessionaire. In the same vein, more WWTP projects, which are highly needed for the public sector and its people, are executed.

Research on cost performance has mostly focused on one of the involved parties, either the client or the contractor. Not many research efforts discuss the cost contingency performance of projects. This research discusses the cost performance and cost contingency of projects in the execution phase from the perspective of a client as well as a contractor. Using a case study approach, 95 projects are investigated: 44 client projects and 51 contractor projects. The results show that depending on the perspective, projects can have cost overruns or cost underruns. Comparing the total realized and estimated costs, projects experienced on average about 16% underrun from a client perspective. From a contractor perspective, projects experienced on average up to 2% overrun. The estimated cost contingency in the client's projects was on average 2.64% more than the required cost contingency. The estimated cost contingency in the contractor's projects was on average 5.41% less than the required cost contingency. These differences are explained by pessimism bias and technical reasons on the client's side. On the contractor side, optimism bias and technical and political reasons play a role, resulting in opportunistic behavior. The findings help practitioners to enhance their cost estimates by avoiding both pessimistic bias and optimism bias behavior-for example, by using historical data from earlier projects. Further investigation into the influence of market conditions on cost estimates is suggested.

Design/methodology/approach - Review literature on definitional confusion in general and on governance in particular and develop a method for defining an internally consistent group of terms, then apply this to a group of terms in the governance arena. Findings - Several important subjects commonly arranged under the governance banner do not actually constitute governance (strategy, behaviour, decision making). Research limitations/implications - Further work is necessary to remove similar confusion in other closely related areas, including power itself and authority as well as project and general management terms such as responsibility and accountability. Practical implications - Projects and business alike can potentially achieve significant improvements in efficiency and effectiveness through gaining consistency across current models, frameworks, policies and procedures thus reducing cross-boundary conflict. Social implications - Creation of a unifying feature within the project and management literature, shifting the understanding of the boundaries and limitations of governance. These definitions will help progress governance from complexity to simplicity, from an art to an understandable practice, from a concept that has been hijacked for partisan and political gain to a lean social tool which can be put to use for the benefit of organisations, whether public, charitable or private. Originality/value - The value is clarity-resulting in the avoidance of confusion and misunderstanding together with their consequent waste of time, resources and money.

C.; Xiong, Wei; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.; Li, Qiming			Perception of Residual Value Risk in Public Private Partnership Projects: Critical Review	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Partnerships; Private sector; Risk management; Infrastructure; Public private partnerships; Residual value risk; Risk identification; Cumulative effects of risk categories; Key risk indicators	INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; POLITICAL RISKS; BOT PROJECTS; E-GOVERNMENT; CHINA; PPP; MANAGEMENT; SECTOR; MODEL; SUSTAINABILITY	Given the increased demand for public facilities and the lack of funds and skills to maintain, repair, and replenish the existing facilities, public private partnerships (PPPs) have been widely adopted and have significantly contributed to the development of new infrastructure built throughout the world. However, because many PPP projects will be transferred back to the host governments upon expiry of the concession period, problems related to the subsequent management of PPP projects have not yet been thoroughly studied. Residual value risk (RVR) is a critical concern when the projects revert back to the public sector. Through an extensive literature review and an open-ended questionnaire survey, the perception of RVR in PPP projects is elaborated in this paper, which aims to present a precise definition and meaning of RVR in PPP projects. The survey results indicate that RVR is viewed as an important concern by professionals and academics. The definition of RVR can be phrased as the risk that on expiry or earlier termination of the service contract, the asset (tangible or intangible) is not in accordance with the value originally estimated by the government at which point the private party agreed to transfer it to the government; as a result, public sectors may suffer the loss of the residual value, and the private sector partner may also suffer the loss of compensation from the government owing to a different residual value. Six critical risk factors leading to RVR are identified in this paper: (1)downfall of product or service performance; (2)functional problems; (3)decrease of profitability and low possibility of refinancing; (4)deterioration of maintainability; (5)decline in operability; (6)failure of sustainability. On the basis of the proposed RVR model, the cumulative effects of the interaction of different risk factors are identified. The proposed RVR definition and its associated RVR risk factors in PPP projects can be considered for use by the public sector to better regulate and manage PPP projects and to facilitate the development of PPP projects from the perspectives of regulatory and financial planning.

Investigating the causes preventing the fulfillment of construction contract requirements	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction management; Questionnaire survey; Contractor failure; Contract requirements	BUSINESS FAILURE; PROJECTS; PERSPECTIVE; TIME	Purpose Construction contractors in Palestine, as in many other developing countries, suffer from many problems. One of their main problems is their inability to meet contractual requirements, such as completing projects within time, at the agreed cost and to the desired quality. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the causes of the non-fulfillment of contractual requirements in three different types of projects: building, road and electro-mechanical projects. Design/methodology/approach Two methods were adopted to collect the data - qualitative and quantitative. In total, 65 causes were identified from the literature and qualitative semi-structured interviews with professional experts. These causes were classified into five categories: managerial, financial, contractor capabilities, regulations and laws and political. In the quantitative approach, a questionnaire was developed and then distributed to 50 professional experts: 20 building experts, 15 road experts and 15 experts in electro-mechanical projects. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess the importance, from the perspective of the subject matter experts, of the causes that had been identified. About 35 responses, which represent a combined response rate of 70%, were received. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with the mean, standard deviation and degree of importance for each of the identified causes being determined, and the SPSS software platform used to rank them. Findings The results reveal that the most important reasons why contractors did not fulfill their contractual requirements in building projects were that contracts were awarded to the contractor offering the lowest price, and the profit margin was low because of intense competition among contractors. In road projects, the most important causes were the poor estimation of the equipment required and a lack of standardized conditions in the construction sector, while in electro-mechanical projects, the most important causes were the inability of the contractor to estimate the cost of the project accurately because of unclear bid documents and a lack of contractor capital. Originality/value The results of this study will be useful to stakeholders and Palestinian contractor unions. They can be disseminated to give guidance so that contractors can avoid these problems in future construction projects and enhance their compliance with contractual requirements. Moreover, knowing about these causes may lead to the reduction of conflicts and disputes between contractual parties (owners and contractors), which in turn will be reflected in the work quality and reputation of contractors.

J	Sarmento, JM; Renneboog, L				Sarmento, Joaquim Miranda; Renneboog, Luc			Anatomy of public-private partnerships: their creation, financing and renegotiations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Concessions; Public-private partnerships; Renegotiations; Transports	TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE; LATIN-AMERICA; CONTRACTS; RISK; CONCESSIONS; MONEY; PPPS; EXPERIENCE; SUBSTANCE; MARKETS	Purpose - As public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become more widespread, doubts and criticisms about this type of infrastructural projects have emerged. The authors describe the PPP framework, discuss the financial structure and risk-sharing processes, and dissect the structure and organisation. The authors address the following questions: what are the main organisational characteristics of PPPs? How does the private sector structure and finance PPPs? And why and how are PPP contracts renegotiated? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on extensive theoretical and empirical research, which is presented in a literature overview on PPPs and their renegotiations. A comprehensive review is carried out and two case studies are developed to investigate the reasons behind success and failure of PPPs and the renegotiation of contracts. Findings - Incomplete contracts and the long duration of concessions can bring uncertainty and change to PPPs. Joint decision making can be difficult due to different parties involved. Renegotiation outcomes tend to rely on the position of the government. In Fertagus, the private sector asked for financial help led to a very balanced agreement. Conversely, Lusoponte renegotiations were initiated by the government, which significantly changed the project. Instead of relying solely on commercial revenues, Lusoponte was substantial financed by public funds. Research limitations/implications - Incomplete contracts and the long duration of concessions bring about much uncertainty to PPPs. Ex post decision making in PPPs in the wake of changing risks is difficult as it necessarily involves negotiations between the public sector and the private firm. The paper shows that marked differences in renegotiation outcomes emerge. In one case study, the private sector asked for financial help and the negotiation outcome was a very balanced agreement. Conversely, renegotiations in a second case were initiated by the government mainly for political reasons, resulted in a significant change in the PPP's structure, risk, financing, and returns, and yielded a large public losses. Practical implications - Contrasting successful and unsuccessful PPPs enables the reader to examine the opportunities and pitfalls in case of PPP renegotiations, which frequently occur. He can gain insight in the determinants of negotiation outcomes and the importance of a governmental PPP entity as well as of an independent monitor such as a court of audits. Originality/value - This paper should be useful for both academics and practitioners and should help increase the understanding of the several stages, structures, and renegotiation processes associated with PPPs.
