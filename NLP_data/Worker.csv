J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Framework for Identifying Competencies of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Career progression path; Craft workers training; Labor performance	SKILLS; EDUCATION; TRAITS	Any occupation requires a certain set of competencies at a given employment level. Although in the construction industry the competency requirements for mid- and upper-level employees are very well defined, such clear definitions at the workers' level are missing. Literature suggests that along with practical skills, workers require additional socioemotional, cognitive, and technical competencies to perform their work efficiently. Therefore, through a nationwide survey of 598 industrial professionals in India, 6, 9, and 13 competencies were identified for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled categories of workers, respectively. These competencies included attitude, motivation, and physical strength for unskilled workers; self-confidence and technical knowledge for semiskilled workers; and writing, reading, mathematical, and problem-solving skills for skilled workers. These results will have threefold implications. First, they will assist training providers designing an effective worker training program. Second, they will help the development of a career progression path for the workers. Third, if the identified competencies are considered in workers' categorization process, then the latter will become more robust than the existing one, in which only practical skills are considered.

Feeling Positive and Productive: Role of Supervisor-Worker Relationship in Predicting Construction Workers' Performance in the Philippines	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Supervisor-worker relationship; Leader-member exchange; Work performance; Positive emotions; Labor and personnel issues	LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE; ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR; JOB EMBEDDEDNESS; MEDIATING ROLE; VOLUNTARY TURNOVER; OUTCOMES; SATISFACTION; METAANALYSIS; RESOURCES; EMOTIONS	Given the complex and dynamic nature of construction work, workers rely heavily on their supervisors for task allocation and ongoing guidance and support. Their relationships with supervisors can directly affect their performance, and by extension, project performance and organizational effectiveness. It is thus of utmost importance to investigate the impact of this working relationship on workers' psychological, behavioral, and performance outcomes. Based on data collected from the construction industry in Philippines using a time-lagged research design, this paper investigates the role of supervisor-worker relationships in predicting workers' emotions, job embeddedness, and in-role and extra-role performance. The results reveal that a high-quality working relationship between workers and their supervisors can facilitate workers' positive emotions, leading to enhanced job embeddedness and superior performance. As such, organizations are recommended to equip supervisors with the awareness, knowledge, and skills to facilitate high-quality relationships with their workers. This research contributes to the construction literature by adding empirical evidence to explain whether and why high-quality worker-supervisor relationships actually influence construction workers' performance. It also increases understanding of individual construction employees' performance and well-being from a social-psychological theoretical perspective. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Wearable sensors for monitoring on-duty and off-duty worker physiological status and activities in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety and health; Worker monitoring; Wearable sensors; Worker physiology; Usability study	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; HEALTH PROTECTION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; VALIDITY; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; PROMOTION; PRODUCTIVITY; ACTIGRAPH	Total Worker Health (R) (TWH) integrates occupational health and safety with the promotion of workers' off-duty wellbeing. Wearable sensors (e.g., activity trackers and physiological monitors) have facilitated personalized objective measurement of workers' health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the TWH concept is relevant to construction workers, especially roofing workers, as they encounter high on-duty health and safety risks and have poor off-duty lifestyles. This study examined the reliability and usability of wearable sensors for monitoring roofing workers' on-duty and off-duty activities. The results demonstrated the usability of these sensors and recommended a data collection period of three consecutive days for obtaining an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75 for heart rate, energy expenditure, metabolic equivalents, and sleep efficiency. The participants exhibited significant variations in their physical responses, health statuses, and safety behaviors. Moreover, several issues were identified in the application of wearable sensors to TWH evaluations for construction workers including roofers.

Exploratory Case Study of Pictorial Aids for Communicating Health and Safety for Migrant Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Communication; Migrant; Pictograms	COMPREHENSION	Approximately 8% of UK construction workers are from overseas. Migrant workers face several barriers, including language and communication difficulties, which have obvious implications for the management of health and safety (H&S). This paper examines the effectiveness of pictorial aids for communicating hazards and controls to migrant workers on construction sites. A lexicon of critical H&S terms was developed through content analysis of worker induction guidance. A pictorial inventory of images was developed, tailored to the lexicon. The images were tested for comprehension among 50 migrant workers. A threshold of 85% correct interpretations of each image was set. 23 images failed and were altered before retesting to satisfactory levels. Workers from European countries identified more images correctly than workers of African and Indian origin. Workers with less than 5 years' experience scored lower than more experienced workers. Pictorial aids can communicate simple hazards and controls. Cultural differences may distort comprehension. Images should supplement existing communication methods, not substitute them.

A questionnaire survey was conducted in Jakarta (the capital city) and Bandung (one of Indonesia's major cities). The results revealed that workers in different occupational groups and managerial positions perceive differently the conditions of job facets and that there are different levels of job satisfaction among different categories of workers. This research indicates that workers care about the quality of their work and company's performance and that these aspects affect significantly their job satisfaction. Reward is also revealed to have an important influence on workers' job satisfaction.

Cross-Trained Staffing Levels With Heterogeneous Learning/Forgetting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cross-training; dual resource constrained (DRC) systems; flexibility; forgetting; learning; parallel systems; productivity; staffing; task heterogeneity; worker heterogeneity	CONSTRAINED JOB SHOPS; TASK COMPLEXITY; ASSIGNMENT POLICIES; WORKER FLEXIBILITY; OPERATING POLICIES; LABOR FLEXIBILITY; TRANSFER DELAYS; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPACT	A skilled workforce is an increasingly expensive resource for organizations. Determining minimum staffing levels to meet production requirements is critical to competitiveness. This paper investigates the effects of several exogenous and controllable factors on minimum staffing levels in parallel dual resource constrained (DRC) systems in the presence of heterogeneous individual learning and forgetting throughout a fixed-planning horizon. We examine factors of worker selection policy, task heterogeneity, individual cross-training level, time-schedule granularity, and the production requirement. We explore two cases of parallel systems in which a system consists of an equal number of workers and tasks and another with more tasks than workers. Results show that a best worker subset requires fewer workers than an average subset, greater task heterogeneity requires fewer workers with an equal number of workers and tasks. The magnitude of this effect is stronger with an average subset or less slack in the system capacity. Unlike previous studies with homogeneous workers or without considering learning and forgetting, setting a maximum allowable individual cross-training requires more workers. Further, the results suggest that the magnitude of this effect becomes greater with a best subset worker group or more slack in capacity. The time-schedule granularity does not affect the minimum staffing levels.

The competitive construction industry forces companies to increase their labour skill to remain their positions in the industry. It is universally agreed that the skilled worker is one of the main fuels to run construction industry. A skilled worker must have a professional training, minimum 2 years working experience, and have the knowledge of construction materials, equipment and safety and physically fit. To check the status of the worker against nine main parameters of skilfulness of the worker is the key to the study. A questionnaire was designed with very deep literature research and expert opinion. The data were collected through questionnaire survey amongst the construction workers in Bangladesh. The percentages of workers found in this study having full knowledge and practicing regulation of construction safety, materials, equipment's and tools, labour codes and building code are 19.35%, 6.45%, 9.68%, 4.87% and 2.30%, respectively. The workers in the study area having the professional training, minimum education and minimum working experience are 6.45%, 46.06% and 62.50%, respectively. A total of 62.25% workers are found physically sound. Building code practices and awareness building is the driving key to enhance skills of worker.

J	Jannadi, MO				Jannadi, MO			Occupational hazards scheme of social insurance in Saudi Arabia: Overview	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Workers'-compensation laws are enacted to protect injured workers. When a worker is injured, he/she and his/her family may suffer two types of economic expenses. The first expense is the loss of his earning capacity and the second is the medical expenses necessary for his/her recovery. If a worker dies because of a work-related injury or sickness, his/her survivors lose the income he/she would have otherwise earned. This loss is very substantial. Different countries have initiated workers' compensation schemes to protect workers from such potential contingencies. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Kingdom) has achieved remarkable progress during the past two decades. This progress has reflected a better picture of Saudi Arabia and put it on a higher rank among the nations. The workers' compensation law is one of the major achievements that has been made in the Kingdom. It plays an important role in labor protection. This paper focuses on the workers' compensation law in Saudi Arabia. A detailed description of the workers' compensation law known as the occupational hazards branch (OHB) of social insurance in Saudi Arabia is provided.

J	Azeez, M; Gambatese, J; Hernandez, S				Azeez, Mohammed; Gambatese, John; Hernandez, Salvador			What Do Construction Workers Really Want? A Study about Representation, Importance, and Perception of US Construction Occupational Rewards	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Occupational rewards; Rewards perception	RISK PERCEPTION; JOB REWARDS; SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; IMBALANCE; SATISFACTION; ANTECEDENTS; EMPLOYEES; STRESS	The construction industry in the United States employs thousands of workers in various jobs and accounted for over $645 billion of the US Gross Domestic Product in 2017. Given the reported labor shortage, it has never been more important for the construction industry to have a qualified and motivated workforce. To do so, the industry needs to understand the current status of occupational rewards and how they are being perceived by construction workers. This paper describes research that aims to address this issue by investigating workers' perspectives of occupational rewards in the construction industry. The study utilizes responses from 176 construction workers across different states, different job responsibilities, and different work conditions. The research contributes to the construction industry by providing a unique perspective on occupational rewards through the lens of construction workers. The study identifies the rewards that are available to workers, rewards that are needed by workers, and factors that impact workers' reward satisfaction. By understanding these three aspects of occupational rewards, the industry will have a better chance of attracting and retaining the right workers for the job and motivating the available workforce for the allocated tasks. The study also contributes to the body of knowledge by facilitating a new and holistic view of rewards and the factors influencing rewards in construction. Findings from the research indicate that workers in general, are satisfied with the rewards that they are receiving, where job responsibility was found to be the reward that is received the most. However, workers' needs showed a commonality of financial importance. Furthermore, reward satisfaction was found to be influenced by 11 factors, 8 of which are occupational, and 3 sociodemographic factors.

Therefore, there is a need for developing technology that assists workers and safety managers in identifying hazards in complex and dynamic construction environments. This study develops a framework for an automated system that detects hazardous conditions and objects in real-time to assist workers and managers. The framework consists of three independent pipelines for localization of workers, semantic segmentation of the visual scene around workers, and detection of static and dynamic hazards. The framework can be used to automate and augment the hazard detection ability of workers and safety managers in construction workplaces. In addition, the framework offers several computing contributions including an improved real-time worker localization method and an efficient architecture for integrating pipelines for entity localization and object detection. A system developed based on the proposed framework as a proof of concept and was tested in indoor and outdoor construction environments. It achieved over 93% accuracy.

Accordingly, this study developed an automated noise exposure assessment model to enhance the health of construction workers. Therefore, a model was developed to predict the noise level in real time, considering the equipment and work types at construction sites, and to automatically assess the noise exposure of the workers in the short and long terms. A case study conducted showed that conventional regulation standards should be strengthened to have an impact on the health of construction workers. The developed model can help construction companies manage construction noise and protect construction workers from excessive noise by providing scientific evidence of noise exposure to policymakers committed to guaranteeing the health of workers.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Exploring the Relationship between Construction Workers' Communication Skills and Their Productivity	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biases in data; Communication competence; Correlation analysis; Significance test	READING-SKILLS; SAFETY; ATTITUDE; PROJECT; HEALTH	In this globally connected world, construction sites are becoming multicultural workplaces. Workers from different places, cultures, and social backgrounds are increasing workplace diversity. However, the literature shows that workplace diversity can have a negative influence on workers' performance. The findings suggest that, when workers who speak different languages must collaborate on a project, their workplace communication is poor, which ultimately affects construction labor productivity (CLP). To date, this claim has been based only on theoretical constructs, and no empirical research on the subject has been conducted. Therefore, the present study attempts to address this gap by investigating the relationship between the four communication skills of construction workers-listening, reading, speaking, and writing-and CLP. To do so, survey instruments were developed to measure all four communication skills of the workers. Subsequently, the language of the survey instruments was translated into the local language of the workers, and all four communication skills of 114 construction workers were measured. In the next step, the same workers' productivity was measured directly at construction sites. The data on the workers were collected from six construction sites in India where a training yard facility was available. Through regression analysis, the relationship between the four communication skills and productivity was established. The result is that, of the four communication skills, an increase in listening and writing skills impact the productivity of workers positively, while an increase in speaking and reading skills affect it negatively. Thus, the study concludes that instead of enhancing the speaking skills of the workers, contractors must focus on improving the listening and writing skills of workers to enhance CLP.

A majority of these construction workers are semi-skilled or unskilled, which puts a great deal of demand on the construction workers and predisposes them to stress at work, which in turn leads to ill health. This study was aimed at evaluating the occupational stress and other factors in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and their impact on the quality of life of these workers. Standard questionnaires were used for assessment and six occupational groups were studied. The construction workers worked long hours and were burdened with stress and most of the workers reported musculoskeletal pain in the body parts that were mostly used during the tasks performed. These workers scored poor in all the domains of the quality of life. These data will provide a baseline for risk evaluation and would increase the effectiveness of preventive measures to be undertaken and a basis for further research in long-term follow-up studies.

Broken Promises: Implications for the Job Insecurity and Job Performance of Chinese Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Psychological contract breach (PCB); Job insecurity; Work performance; Organizational justice; Labor and personnel issues	PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH; ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR; MEDIATING ROLE; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; EMPLOYEE CITIZENSHIP; LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; RESOURCES THEORY; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; JUSTICE; CONSERVATION	Construction workers' performance significantly impacts project outcome and ultimately organizational competitiveness. Departing from prior construction process-focused and site condition-focused research on worker performance, this research investigated the interactive effects of psychological contract breach (PCB), organizational justice, and tenure on workers' job insecurity and job performance. Data collected from the construction industry in China revealed that PCB increased workers' perceived job insecurity, which in turn reduced their job performance. These negative effects were stronger for those workers who perceived lower organizational justice (i.e.,unfair treatment from the organization) and those with longer organizational tenure. As such, organizations are recommended to understand and continuously manage construction workers' psychological contracts and cultivate fair organizational practices to reduce their job insecurity and enhance their performance. This research contributes to the construction literature by adding a novel social-psychological perspective to understanding worker performance. By integrating the theoretical lens of PCB and organizational justice to investigate construction workers' performance, this paper further highlights the value of an interdisciplinary approach to advancing knowledge in the construction discipline.

J	Welfare, K; Sherratt, F; Hallowell, M				Welfare, Katherine; Sherratt, Fred; Hallowell, Matthew			Perceptions of Construction Work: Views to Consider to Improve Employee Recruitment and Retention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							QUALITATIVE RESEARCH	With increasing demands for new infrastructure and a decreased availability of skilled construction craft workers, the need to recruit and retain workers is becoming critical. It is important to understand the preferences of workers and, consequentially, ensure that positive attributes of the job are preserved and negative attributes are mitigated in practice. To better understand the preferences of construction workers, 222 interviews were conducted with workers on active commercial construction sites in Colorado. Workers were asked simple, open-ended questions about their jobs and work preferences using a social constructionist approach. The results indicate that workers most enjoy seeing tangible results, social interaction with coworkers, problem-solving, challenging and diverse work tasks, and working with their hands. Conversely, negative attributes were work pressure, indirect communication, mandates from upper management, dangerous work, and a feeling of indifference perceived by their coworkers. These results improve understandings of the fundamental reasons why construction workers are attracted to their profession. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Choi, B; Ahn, S; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Ahn, Seungjun; Lee, SangHyun			Construction Workers' Group Norms and Personal Standards Regarding Safety Behavior: Social Identity Theory Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety behavior; Group norm; Social influence; Social identity	GROUP SELF-ESTEEM; DISTINCT ASPECTS; CLIMATE; CATEGORIZATION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; ATTITUDES; COMMITMENT; MOTIVATION; ECONOMICS	A number of researchers have proposed and demonstrated that worker behavior is one of the main factors in construction safety. Working within the parameters of worker safety awareness and behavior, many researchers have recently suggested that shared values and customs, i.e., group norms, play an important role in shaping individual workers' safety behavior. Regarding how individuals' behavior is under the influence of group norms, the social identity theory suggests that people perceive themselves as a member of a group, depersonalize the self, and base their beliefs and behavior on the norms of the group. Despite the clarity of this configuration, the extent to which construction workers' safety attitudes and behaviors are influenced by group norms, and the degree to which social identification is involved in this process, remains unclear. In particular, the transient nature of construction worker employment and multiple identities that a construction worker might hold make it difficult to understand the influence of group norms on workers' safety behavior. To address these knowledge gaps, this paper aims to identify the (1) influence of group norms on a construction worker's personal standards regarding safety behavior, (2) current status of construction workers' social identities, and (3) impact of social identification on the influence that group norms have on construction workers' personal standards regarding safety behavior. To achieve these objectives, empirical data were collected from 82 construction workers and nine project managers from three different construction sites using behavioral economic experiments along with surveys, and the data were analyzed using quantitative methods, such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and t-tests. The analyses demonstrate that there is a measurable difference between construction workers' personal standards and the norms desired by project managers regarding safety behavior and that construction workers' personal standards regarding safety behavior are significantly influenced by their perceived group norms. The analyses also demonstrate that construction workers identify themselves with the different groups to which they belong (e.g., workgroup, trade, union, company, project) to significantly different degrees and that the salience of social identity with a group moderates the influence that the group's norms have on personal standards regarding safety behavior in construction workers. These findings suggest a new way of thinking about safety management in construction; promoting project-wide positive norms combined with improved project identity can be an effective means of improving workers' safety behavior in construction projects.

While several studies have highlighted the relationship between aptitude and employee performance, very few have tested such a relationship using empirical data, especially in the construction domain. Therefore, to address this gap, this study attempts to establish the relationship between construction workers' aptitudes and their productivity. To achieve this aim, first the aptitude of the workers was measured using a general aptitude test battery (GATB). Second, the productivity of the same workers was measured via direct observation at construction sites. Subsequently, by applying various regression models to the data collected on 112 workers, best-fit curves were developed between aptitude and observed productivity. The results revealed that the physical aptitude of the workers impacts performance more than mental aptitude. Moreover, spatial and clerical perception have a negative impact on performance. The study concludes that aptitude is an important performance indicator of any construction worker, and thus, to enhance labor productivity, contractors must ensure the availability of high-aptitude workers on site.

In this regard, an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely applied to assess individuals' stress by analyzing brain waves in the clinical domains. With recent advancements in wearable EEG devices, EEG's ability can be extended to field workers, particularly by non-invasively assessing construction workers' stress. This study proposes a procedure to automatically recognize workers' stress in construction sites using EEG signals. Specifically, the authors collected construction field workers' EEG signals and preprocessed them to capture high-quality signals. Workers' salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, was also collected to label low or high-stress levels when they work at sites. Time and frequency domain features from EEG signals were calculated using fixed and sliding windowing approaches. Finally, the authors applied several supervised learning algorithms to recognize workers' stress while they are working at sites. The results showed that the fixed windowing approach and the Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 80.32%, which is very promising given the similar accuracy of stress recognition in clinical domains where extricate and wired EEG devices were used and the subjects engage in minimal body movement. The results demonstrate that the proposed field stress recognition procedure can be used for the early detection of workers' stress, which can contribute to improving workers' safety, health, wellbeing, and productivity.

Thus, this research extends employee commitment scholarship to the construction context to investigate the interactive effects of workers' perceived organizational injustice and tenure on their subsequent organizational commitment, via the mediating role of psychological strain. Longitudinal data from 179 construction workers revealed that worker's perceived organizational injustice increased their psychological strain, which, in turn, reduced their organizational commitment. This indirect negative effect of organizational injustice on organizational commitment via psychological strain was found to be stronger for less-tenured workers. Thus, to promote and maintain a committed workforce, construction organizations should ensure their organizational routines, procedures, and supervisory practices enhance workers' perceptions of fairness. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying processes through which workers' organizational commitment can be eroded (or strengthened), enriching the understanding of the social-psychological aspects of performance management.

Complaining: about occupational safety and health: a harrier for collaboration between managers and workers on construction sites	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Boundary work; manager-worker relation; negotiation; mechanisms; typology	BOUNDARY-WORK; TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; HUMOR; CULTURE; ORGANIZATION; IDENTITY; BEHAVIOR; JOKING; RISK	Collaborative safety practices between construction site managers and workers are considered essential in occupational safety and health (OSH). However, establishing joint OSH engagement between managers and workers is still a challenge. Little is known about how managers and workers' "complaining" about OSH affects collective OSH action and the quality of manager-worker relations. Drawing on an understanding of complaining as "boundary work", this study empirically analyses how managers and workers' verbalisations either downplay (collaboration) or build (demarcation) boundaries. Interviews and observations between managers and workers were carried out on a construction project in Denmark to identify why and how complaining is used. A typology consisting of four "complaining" mechanisms was developed, highlighting their associated relational dynamics: (1) Shifting responsibility for advancing OSH, (2) Defending oneself against strained working conditions, (3) Dealing strategically with criticism, and (4) Blaming other occupational groups. Complaining about OSH as boundary work - both collaboration and demarcation - between managers and workers furthers professional fragmentation and conflicts OSH collaboration, yet it occurs in a "safe space" for professional disagreement. We suggest that these communicational aspects and associated relational dynamics should be an area of increased focus in order to promote managers and workers' OSH collaboration.

The construction industry is one of the most stressful occupations. Current stress-assessment tools rely either on a subject's perceived stress (e.g., stress questionnaires) or an individual's chemical reaction to stressors (e.g., cortisol hormone). However, these methods can interrupt ongoing tasks and therefore may not be suitable for continuous measurement. To address this problem, the authors aim to develop and validate a framework for noninvasive and nonsubjective measurement of worker stress by examining changes in workers' physiological signals collected from a wearable biosensor. The framework applies various filtering methods to reduce physiological signal noises and extracts the patterns of physiological signals as workers experience various stress levels. Then, the framework learns these patterns by applying a supervised-learning algorithm. To examine the performance of the proposed framework, the authors collected a physiological signal from 10 construction workers in the field. The proposed framework resulted in a stress-prediction accuracy of 84.48% in distinguishing between low and high stress levels and 73.28% in distinguishing among low, medium, and high stress levels. The results confirmed the potential of the proposed framework for assessing workers' stress in the field. Automatic predictions of workers' physical demand levels based on physiological signals is described in a companion paper. This study, along with the companion paper, contributes to the body of knowledge on the in-depth understanding of construction workers' stress on construction sites by developing a noninvasive means for continuous monitoring and assessing workers' stress. The proposed stress-recognition framework is expected to enhance workers' health, safety, and productivity through early detection of occupational stressors on actual sites.

J	Tang, S; Golparvar-Fard, M				Tang, Shuai; Golparvar-Fard, Mani			Machine Learning-Based Risk Analysis for Construction Worker Safety from Ubiquitous Site Photos and Videos	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ACTION RECOGNITION; SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VISION; HAZARDS	This paper proposes a new method for single-worker severity level prediction from already collected site images and video clips. Onsite safety observers often assess workers' severity levels during construction activities. While risk analysis is key to improving long-term construction site safety, omnipresent monitoring is still time-consuming and costly to implement. The recent growth of visual data captured actively on construction sites has opened a new opportunity to increase the frequency of worker safety monitoring. This paper shows that a comprehensive vision-based assessment is the most informative to automatically infer worker severity level from images. Efficient computer vision models are presented to conduct this risk analysis. The method is validated on a challenging image dataset first of its kind. Specifically, the proposed method detects and evaluates the worker state from visual data, defined by (1) worker body posture, (2) the usage of personal protective equipment, (3) worker interactions with tools and materials, (4) the construction activity being performed, and (5) the presence of surrounding workplace hazards. To estimate the worker state, a multitasked recognition model is introduced that recognizes objects, activity, and keypoints from visual data simultaneously, taking 36.6% less time and 40.1% less memory while keeping comparably performances compared to a system running individual models for each subtask. Worker activity recognition is further improved with a spatio-temporal graph neural network model using recognized per-frame worker activity, detected bounding boxes of tools and materials, and estimated worker poses. Finally, severity levels are predicted by a trained classifier on a dataset of images of construction workers accompanied with ground truth severity level annotations. In the test dataset assembled from real-world projects, the severity level prediction model achieves 85.7% cross-validation accuracy in a bricklaying task and 86.6% cross-validation accuracy for a plastering task, demonstrating the potential for near real-time worker safety detection and severity assessment.

J	Guo, HL; Yu, YT; Xiang, T; Li, H; Zhang, D				Guo, Hongling; Yu, Yantao; Xiang, Tian; Li, Heng; Zhang, Dan			The availability of wearable-device-based physical data for the measurement of construction workers' psychological status on site: From the perspective of safety management	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety management; Construction worker; Unsafe behavior; Psychology; Wearable devices	BEHAVIOR-BASED SAFETY; INDUSTRY; EMOTION; LIFE; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; PERCEPTION; ATTITUDES; CULTURE	Workers' unsafe behaviors have been recognized as one of the main causes to construction accidents, while the existing research shows that workers' psychological status on site has a direct influence on their behaviors. Thus monitoring workers' psychological status may benefit the reduction of unsafe behaviors on site, thus preventing accident from occurring. However, due to the lack of appropriate methods to collect jobsite workers' psychological data, it is difficult for the existing research to reveal the relationship between psychological status and unsafe behavior. This research proposes an efficient wearable technology-based method to collect jobsite workers' psychological data to support such an analysis. Wearable-device-based physical data collection has been regarded as a promising approach to study human's psychological status in the field of psychology, and applied to pedagogy and clinical psychology, but seldom in the construction industry. The purpose of this research is to study the availability of the approach in construction safety management. To do this, an on-site experiment was conducted to collect workers' physical data via using wearable devices, as well as psychological data through the use of PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) and DRM (Day Reconstruction Method). Based on the data, the correlations between workers' psychological status and physical data are analyzed. The results show that jobsite workers' physical data is available for the measurement of workers' psychological status. This research will contribute to the research on jobsite workers' psychology in the context of real construction sites, as well as the identification of the mental causes of workers' unsafe behaviors on site, thus improving the performance of construction safety management.

Construction Craft Workers' Perceptions of the Factors Affecting Their Productivity	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LABOR; INDUSTRY; MOTIVATION; TRENDS; MODEL	In efforts to quantify craft workers' perspective of construction productivity, a nationwide survey involving 1,996 craft workers was employed. The survey quantified the relative impact of 83 productivity factors, which had been identified through a series of focus group sessions involving craft workers conducted on construction jobsites located throughout the United States. The findings show that craft workers do have a good understanding of the factors affecting their daily productivity, and most of the adversarial factors affecting productivity can be addressed by site management teams. Factors involving tools and consumables, materials, engineering drawing management and construction equipment were identified as having the greatest impact on productivity from the craft workers' perspective. A statistical comparative analysis was employed to distinguish the significant factors encountered by craft workers on projects with relatively low perceived productivity. The research further examined the differences in the perceived relative magnitude of productivity factors' influence on construction productivity based on respondents' union status and trade. These findings will be beneficial for engaging craft workers in productivity improvement and improving the efficiency of construction jobsites.

This paper investigates the impacts of worker multifunctionality in a heterogeneous serial production system in the presence of individual differences in experiential learning and forgetting. The tradeoffs of multifunctionality and cross training are examined in conjunction with several process characteristics and operational decisions including staffing level, system bottleneck position, task similarity degree, and worker rotation interval. The results show the relationships between the preferred level of worker multifunctionality and both process characteristics and operational decisions. In several cases, minimum multifunctionality and short worker rotation intervals provide improved system performance. Additionally, process characteristics, such as the position of the system bottleneck and the degree of task similarity, have impacts on individual learning-forgetting behaviors and, subsequently, on decisions relating to multifunctionality levels and system performance.

Yet the literature provides little guidance for engineering managers, workers or researchers trying to understand how practices designed to enhance productivity will impact the safety of operational workers. The present research addresses that gap by simultaneously examining operational "best" practices such as quality management and just-in-time and performance outcomes such as productivity and worker safety. To control for the myriad of potential problems with self-reports of worker safety performance, we match secondary data provided by the state of Oregon with managers' self-reported responses to operational practices. The results show that the relationship between operational practices and safety outcomes is nuanced with just-in-time harming worker safety, an impact that can be mitigated by the adoption of team-based work up to a point, as the relationship between JIT and team-based work is U-shaped.

Unsafe behaviors, a direct cause of accidents, have been studied extensively, but few scholars have examined the role of social capital in improving workers' safety behaviors. Based on the social capital perspective, this paper explored how to improve the safety behaviors of construction workers in order to provide a theoretical basis for the study of improving workers' safety behaviors. Through a literature review and analysis, this paper presented the research hypothesis, constructed a structural equation model (SEM), and explored whether workers' social capital can affect their safety behaviors. The results showed that the structural and relational dimensions of workers' social capital have a significant and direct influence on their safety behaviors, whereas the cognitive dimension does not. The structural and cognitive dimensions significantly affect safety competency, but the relational dimension has an insignificant effect on safety competency. Safety competency significantly affects safety behaviors and has several mediating roles between the structural and cognitive dimensions and safety behavior. This paper provides a theoretical basis for enabling management personnel to develop and improve workers' safety behaviors based on interpersonal relationships. It shows that the interaction, trust, and common language between workers help to improve workers' safety behaviors. This research offers a theoretical basis for studies of construction workers' safety behaviors and helps construction companies improve workers' safety behaviors and their on-site safety from the perspective of social capital.

In the construction industry, many accident investigations reveal that workers' unsafe behaviors are the most frequent and direct causes of on-site accidents, and thus need to be addressed urgently. Based on cognitive and social psychology theories and existing accident causation models, this paper develops a CM-CWUB by adopting a five-stage form, specifically representing the construction workers' cognitive processes when confronted with potential hazards on construction sites. Using a cognitive perspective can reveal the mechanism of human error and thus can elucidate how unsafe behaviors are produced. The five stages include obtaining information, understanding information, perceiving responses, selecting response, and taking action, with obtaining information and selecting response as the two key stages. Obtaining information elaborates construction workers' observations and processing of hazard information on sites by themselves, and selecting response adopts the theory of planned behavior to reflect various factors of influence when workers select unsafe behavior. Based on the developed model, cognitive failures that would lead to construction workers' unsafe behaviors at different cognitive stages are then systematically analyzed.

However, measuring the level of workers' motivation at workplace is not always straightforward because the workers' motivation is a function of various personal and external factors. This paper proposes a fuzzy rule-based model for evaluating the motivation level of construction workers using their working patterns. The motivation level evaluated using the fuzzy rule-based model was compared with motivational levels determined by the traditional Vroom's expectancy theory or Expectancy-Instrumentality-Valence (EIV) method. EIV method used questionnaire surveys and interviews to determine workers' motivation. The results of fuzzy rule-based models aligned closely with the EIV model, especially for the middle range of motivation levels. Compared to traditional EIV model, the fuzzy rule-based system is simple to implement and found to be very pragmatic in construction field settings.

The nature of the construction industry results in a comparatively high incidence of serious injuries and death caused by falls from a height, musculoskeletal disorders and being struck by objects. This paper presents a new concept that can tackle this problem in the future. The central hypothesis of this study is that it is possible to eliminate injuries if we move the human construction worker off-site and remotely link his/her motions to a Robotic Construction Worker (RCW) on-site. As a first steppingstone towards this ultimate goal, two systems essential for the RCW were developed in this study. First, a novel system that combines 3D body and hand position tracking was developed to capture the movements of human construction worker. This combination of tracking enables the capture of changes in the orientations and articulations of the entire human body. Second, a real-time simulation system that connects a human construction worker off-site to a virtual RCW was developed to demonstrate the proposed concept in a variety of construction scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the future viability of the RCW concept and indicate the promise of this system for eliminating the health and safety risks faced by human construction workers.

Affective leadership styles would create shared values, commitment and teamwork amongst organisational members, which correspondingly enhances overall goal achievement. More of this knowledge area is required of the construction industry in New Zealand, particularly from the viewpoint of workers. This study investigates the relationship between leadership styles and worker performance outcomes for construction organisations in Wellington, New Zealand. Data were obtained from workers using the well-known Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to determine the relationship between identified leadership attributes and worker performance outcomes. The study found that there was a significant relationship between all of the leadership style attributes and worker performance outcomes. Specifically, transformational leadership was found to be the most prominent leadership style adopted. The result shows that workers accomplished set tasks and goals as an outcome of this leadership style. Regarding leadership attributes, the study found that managers exhibited more of Idealised Influence (Attributed) and Inspirational Motivation attributes than others. Also, it was found that managers' failure to engage with worker and respond to urgent matters when required (Lassiez-Faire and Management by Exception (Passive)) were identified as major deterrents to the performance of workers. This study provides extended knowledge on the importance of leadership styles with the New Zealand construction industry.

To prevent adverse impacts on work performance, measuring emotional states should take precedence to better understand how workers' emotions vary while they are working. Among many methods available to measure emotional states, electroencephalogram (EEG) has a great potential for quantitative measurement by overcoming a possible bias from the survey-based subjective assessment of emotions. Although EEG-based emotion measurement has been tested and applied only in a laboratory environment, recent advancements in wearable EEG sensors, which are portable, wireless, and affordable, open a new door toward nonintrusive field emotion measurement. This study thus investigates the feasibility of measuring workers' emotions in the field using a wearable EEG sensor. To do this, a bipolar dimensional emotion model, which consists of valence (from displeasure to pleasure) and arousal (from relaxation to excitement) dimensions, was applied to quantify workers' emotional states. Then, workers' valence and arousal levels were measured using a wearable EEG sensor during their ongoing tasks. The validity of the EEG-based emotion measurement was examined through a comparison with cortisol levels obtained from workers' saliva samples, which has been accepted as a reliable physical measure of emotions. The results demonstrate the applicability of a wearable EEG sensor for measuring workers' emotions, particularly valence levels, which remain crucial to understanding workers' emotional states. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on in-depth studies for understanding workers' emotions in the field by providing a means to continuously and nonintrusively measure workers' emotions while they are working.

Work-life imbalance is identified as a major detrimental factor in attracting young people to join the industry. Previous research on work-life balance (WLB) has focused on shift workers, females, and managerial and professional individuals. There is still a paucity of literature on WLB for manual workers, in particular, manual workers in the construction industry. This paper aims to investigate how workers perceive their WLB and identify the factors that affect WLB in the construction industry. Based on interviews with the chief executives and senior officers from key trade unions, a questionnaire survey was conducted covering all types of construction manual workers including building, civil engineering, and electrical and mechanical (E&M) workers. A total of 970 valid answers were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings identified workplace support as the most critical area of concern. Additionally, work-life balance was found to have significant effects on the perceived health and safety of workers. The sample size of this study is so far the largest of its kind. This study helps us make informed suggestions for improving work-life balance in the construction industry, and hence its attractiveness to the younger generation to solve the labor aging and shortage problems.

J	Karimi, H; Taghaddos, H				Karimi, Hossein; Taghaddos, Hosein			Impact of Age on the Strength of Experience and Education Role in Fatal Injuries Prevention in Iranian Construction Craft Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fatal injury prevention; Experience; Education; Age; Craft worker; Human reliability; Human error management	OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; ACCIDENTS; INDUSTRY	Over the past two decades, the construction industry has encountered the challenge of rapid aging of craft workers in many countries. In addition, the shortage of skilled workers that has emerged over the past three decades in various countries have forced project managers, at least in some regions or periods of time, to execute projects with less skilled or experienced workers. There has been increasing attention from researchers and practitioners on fatal injury preventive solutions. However, the industry still suffers from a relatively high and substantial disproportion in fatal injuries compared to other industries. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by elucidating the fatality rate fluctuations in the different age groups of craft workers and empirically examining the interaction of adverse impact of higher age and preventive influence of higher educational attainment and skill and experience level of craft workers on fatal injuries in construction projects. A total of 6,326 accidents were analyzed, which occurred in construction projects in the province of Tehran, Iran between 2011 and 2017. The study found the higher experience and educational attainment of craft workers significantly mitigates the severity of accidents from fatal injuries to nonfatal ones in young and middle-aged craft workers. However, the effectiveness of both factors decreases gradually when craft workers get older. Both factors' strength will be dominated by the adverse impact of age on the older workers, which results in a high fatality rate between the age of 65 and 75.

J	Ji, TT; Wei, HH; Cheng, JY				Ji, Tingting; Wei, Hsi-Hsien; Cheng, Jiayu			UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF CO-WORKER SUPPORT ON CONSTRUCTION SAFETY PERFORMANCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RISK THEORY: AN AGENT-BASED MODELING APPROACH	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agent-based modeling; construction safety; construction management; co-worker support	CLIMATE; BEHAVIOR; MANAGEMENT	Co-worker safety support has been given prominence in manufacturing and transportation field for its positive effect on individual workers' safety; however, there is little evidence to show if such supporting role of co-workers is significant in improving project-level safety performance in construction workplace. This study adopts agent-based modeling (ABM) to understand the effectiveness of two distinct co-worker-safety-support actions on the safety performance of a construction project. Based on the risk theory, the ABM model simulates a construction site where worker agents reinforce steel bars with the likelihood of suffering crane-related incidents. The results indicate that both co-worker-support actions can significantly reduce the occurrence of nonfatal incidents but shows little influence in fatal incidents, and in reducing high-severity incidents, the action of warning peers to leave the hazardous area has the same effectiveness as reminding peers to wear Personal Protective Equipment. The present study provides a fresh insight into the safety-related role of coworkers: not only reveals how the local-level effects of co-workers' safety assistance emerge the system-level consequences, but demonstrates the effectiveness of specific peer-support actions on three levels of construction safety performance, and thereby extends our existing body of knowledge on co-worker safety support in the construction field.

J	Zhang, MY; Cao, ZY; Yang, Z; Zhao, XF				Zhang, Mingyuan; Cao, Zhiying; Yang, Zhen; Zhao, Xuefeng			Utilizing Computer Vision and Fuzzy Inference to Evaluate Level of Collision Safety for Workers and Equipment in a Dynamic Environment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th Anniversary Conference of the International-Group-for-Lean-Construction (IGLC)	2017	Heraklion, GREECE			Safety management; Collision accident; Construction worker; Computer vision; Fuzzy inference	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONSTRUCTION; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM; MODEL	The construction industry is facing unique problems in accident prevention. The existing management method for detecting workers' unsafe behaviors and unsafe states of objects relies primarily on manual monitoring, which does not only consume large amounts of time and money but also cannot cover all workers in the entire construction site. Meanwhile, the workers' perception of being at risk of injury decreases when they are concentrated in a crowded and noisy environment. In this case, it is difficult for them to take essential measures to protect themselves in the face of danger. In view of the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a method of evaluating the collision safety level of construction workers based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Specifically, the proposed model works via two modules: vision extraction and safety assessment. The vision extraction module identifies construction workers and equipment through computer vision; centroid pixel coordinates and crowdedness are then extracted from a detection box. Afterward, the spatial relationship between moving devices and workers is calculated by a pixel calibration process. In the safety assessment module, the collected status information is analyzed by evaluating the safety level of each worker and conducting accident prevention through a fuzzy inference system. The safety level, which indicates the comprehensive risk of collision between workers and equipment in a particular dynamic environment, will be displayed numerically, breaking through the limitations of conventional qualitative evaluation. Field experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed method of informing workers about potential danger situations in an objective way. Moreover, by setting a safety-level threshold, the onsite safety management personnel can take corresponding measures to avoid collision accidents when the worker's safety level is lower than the threshold.

J	Evia, C				Evia, Carlos			Localizing and Designing Computer-Based Safety Training Solutions for Hispanic Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Latino construction workers; Diversity; Computer-based training; Managing Hispanic workers		Despite the construction industry's generally positive reaction to the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in many of its functions, some of the profession's key players reside in a digital divide and do not benefit from advances in technology. Hispanic construction workers, an at-risk population with high rates of workplace accidents, are affected by that divide because they rarely take advantage of available ICTs at work. One application of ICTs that can help Hispanic/Latino workers is computer-based training (CBT) for occupational safety. However, the design of CBT materials for Spanish-speaking workers needs to go beyond basic localization of existing products in English. A radical localization approach that uses participatory design sessions with construction workers and their supervisors is proposed in this paper. This case study reports that Latino workers reacted positively and retained knowledge from CBT materials, including videos with elements of humor and without graphic representations of accidents, modeled after the genre of a television situation comedy.

In decreasing the numbers of safety incidents, society's perception of construction workers, who are the central part of the occupational health and safety issue, can be an important learning tool for these workers in terms of self-criticism. Therefore, society's perception of the responsibility of workers for occupational health and safety is presented by means of cartoons. For this objective, seven cartoons exhibited in the International Construction Accidents Cartoon Contest held in Turkey are examined through the General Theory of Verbal Humour, a semiotic analysis method. As the main finding, construction-based occupational health and safety perceptions of countries were found not to change significantly. Consequently, these results can have a function in guiding workers and worker unions to revise and manage the general perception of society about them. Moreover, such cartoons can be used as a lingua franca for occupational health and safety training in international construction projects where multinational migrant workers are employed.

J	Konstantinou, E; Lasenby, J; Brilakis, I				Konstantinou, Eirini; Lasenby, Joan; Brilakis, Ioannis			Adaptive computer vision-based 2D tracking of workers in complex environments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Tracking; Workers; Construction; Computer vision	VISUAL TRACKING; OBJECT TRACKING	Monitoring of construction workers is important in managing labour productivity. To date, the construction sector relies either on intensive manual observations or intrusive tag-based practices. Visual tracking methods can provide automated and tag-less monitoring. However, no method to date has succeeded in tracking multiple workers, as construction sites are complex environments due to congestion, background clutter and occlusions. In addition, workers have similar appearance and exhibit illumination/scale/posture variations and abrupt changes in movement over the course of their task. To address these shortcomings, we propose a vision-based method that consists of 3 models. Firstly, an adaptive model provides continuous information about the previous position of workers and their appearance features.

Safety problems caused by overworked bodies are common, and the supervision of construction workers is always flawed. In China, piecework has long been the common way to evaluate workers' workloads, because it is always inconvenient to obtain direct indicators. To improve this situation, this paper proposes a method based on smartphone sensor acquisition and the concept of labor intensity to evaluate construction workers' workloads. A sensor application based on the smartphone platform was created to effectively measure labor intensity so that the application could track construction workers' movement data in an unobtrusive way. Moreover, preprocessing and a machine learning algorithm were used to classify 25 groups of experimental data. Then, the accuracy of the method was tested. It was shown that not only did the application meet the portability requirement, but its output also satisfied the accuracy requirement for supervising construction workers' activity. The research presented in this paper can help construction organizations promote the intelligent management level of monitoring workers' activity in real time and evaluating the workers' whole-day workload.

A diary study technique was used to capture the thoughts, decisions, actions, and emotions of workers in situ-when they were working in their natural setting-at multiple points in time during the workweek. An analysis of the data revealed that a group-level positive correlation existed between experiencing a disruption and initiating a fast improvised decision and action. However, some workers tended to improvise frequently when disrupted, whereas others did not. The analyses also revealed that workers' emotions fluctuated throughout the week and two emotional states-determined and interested-tended to decline following a disruption. Some of the workers also experienced increases in their negative emotions whereas others did not, suggesting that not all workers react in the same manner to disruptions. Consequently, the diary technique provided a novel approach to identifying the effect of disruptive events on worker decision making and performance.

Recent research identified that workers have difficulty becoming aware of potential risks in harsh construction environments (limited vision and hearing). In response, this study investigated a new communication method with a wearable tactile-based system to improve worker?s hazard perception. Built on past research, we identified key informational details to represent detected safety hazards, developed a tactile-based communication mechanism, and conducted a series of field trials. Results were assessed to determine the system?s reliability with respect to several scenarios, conducted in a controlled environment for safety reasons. Test results demonstrated that the system is capable of alerting workers of pre-identified collision hazards without relying on their innate sensing (hearing and vision). Findings could help workers to become aware of detected hazards in harsh environments, where it is difficult to hear alerts or spot potential hazards.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank according to severity the safety and health-related problems confronted by EM construction workers. Design/methodology/approach - Grounded theory approach was employed to construct the main categories and subcategories of the construction safety and health problems of EM workers. A two-round Delphi survey of 18 experts, who are highly experienced in managing EM workers, was conducted to rank the relative severity of the identified safety and health problems. Findings - A total of 14 subcategories and 4 categories of construction safety and health problems of EM workers were identified. Among the 14 subcategories, the most urgent and serious ones were insufficient safety materials and training in their native language, insufficient safety staff from EM origin, and safety communication barriers. In addition, safety and health problems at the corporate and governmental levels are also worth paying attention. Originality/value - This study contributes to the update on the existing body of knowledge on safety and health problems encountered by EM construction workers and revelation of their peculiar situation in Hong Kong. Findings of the study will be of value to various stakeholders in formulating safety and health measures for EM construction workers.	[Chan, Albert P. C.; Wong, Francis K.

Critical issues and possible solutions for motivating foreign construction workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INDUSTRY	A shortage of construction field workers has been a serious and chronic problem, both in developed and developing countries. As a solution to the increasing demands of the workforce, use of foreign workers has been a common practice for a country to gain laborers from nearby less-developed countries. While it can contribute to lessening the labor deficiency, foreign workers are typically less productive and often encompass diverse risks due to cultural differences, communication difficulties, and different work ethics and customs. Despite these facts, construction films do not address these issues and lag in establishing appropriate management strategies to improve the performance of foreign workers. This paper investigates key issues with respect to foreign laborers through a series of focused interviews and field surveys. Then, it draws the primary causes of low performance and presents effective general guidelines for improving foreign workers' performance. The writers also provide an analysis of case studies in South Korea for motivating foreign workers in connection with the proposed practical guidelines.

Effects of Workers' Social Learning: Focusing on Absence Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor control; Absence; Social learning; Self-regulation; Organizational behavior; Agent-based modeling (ABM)	ABSENTEEISM; CULTURE; DETERMINANTS; VALIDATION; ATTENDANCE; NORMS	Workers' consistent attendance is an indispensable condition for successful construction projects, but many construction projects still suffer from the productivity loss originating from workers' absenteeism. To deal with this problem, construction managers have mainly used formal controls (e.g.,penalties) targeting those individuals who present excessive absenteeism. However, recent research papers on absenteeism have testified to the paramount role of social factors, such as social norm, on workers' absence behavior. Despite the increasing attention being paid to the social factors of workers' absence behavior, discussion on how a social norm in favor of worker attendance control can be developed is sparse. If how such social norms emerge and how they play a role in controlling workers' behavior are clear, construction managers can invest time in promoting favorable absence norms rather than focusing on regulations targeting individuals. Therefore, this paper studies the system-level effect of workers' social learning using an experimental analysis with simulations in order to extend the knowledge of the social aspect in workers' absence behavior. To conduct the analysis, an agent-based model was developed to serve as a comprehensive model that incorporates mechanisms of workers' formal and social learning. The model was constructed by using theoretical and empirical findings on absence behavior drawn from scholarly literature. Then the constructed agent-based model was used to explore possible scenarios in organizations with simulations. With the simulation results, the following are demonstrated: (1)high social adaptation can work as a force to either increase or decrease workers' absence rates; (2)when strict self-regulation is prevalent among workers, high social adaptation can lead to the development of a positive social norm at the jobsite; and (3)when high social adaptation reinforces formal rules, this occurrence reduces the need for additional formal controls on worker behavior. The results from this paper are expected to help construction organizations in understanding the availability of social norms in favor of management, and ultimately in using the social norm for effective labor control that meets little resistance.

A comparative analysis of the utilization of multiskilling among US Hispanic and non-Hispanic construction craft workers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Multiskilling; construction craft workers; construction trades; Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers; construction management; Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA)	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; IMPACT; AVAILABILITY	Over the past couple of decades, the US construction industry has experienced an increasing shortage of craft workers, mainly among highly skilled trades, such as pipefitters and electricians. Multiskilling is one workforce strategy that has been traditionally proposed as a pathway to retain the current workforce. This study aims to understand the changes in multiskilling and the influence of race on multiskilling patterns. While many demographic populations of the US construction workforce have declined, the Hispanics population has actually grown. Unfortunately, the growth of the Hispanic workforce has primarily occurred in low-skilled construction trades. While the study finds that there are significant differences in formal training between Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers that possess only a single skill, there are no statistical differences in the formal training between multi-skilled Hispanic and non-Hispanic construction craft workers. Further, there are no difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic trade patterns among craft workers with dual-skills, but differences were found in multiskilling combinations between craft workers with more than two skills. Hence when afforded the same access to education and training, the findings suggest that differences in career progression, as measured by skill attainment across multiple trades, lessen between Hispanics and non-Hispanic construction workers.

Impact of Change Blindness on Worker Hazard Identification at Jobsites	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							SUSTAINED INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS; DETECT CHANGES; FIXATION POSITION; INVISIBLE GORILLA; DRIVING SCENES; INFORMATION; MEMORY; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; FAILURE	Due to the dynamic nature of construction sites, workers face constant changes, including changes that endanger their safety. Failing to notice significant changes to visual scenes-known as change blindness-can potentially put construction workers into harm's way. Hence, understanding the inability or failure to detect change is critical to improving worker safety. No study to date, however, has empirically examined change blindness in relation to construction safety. To address this critical knowledge gap, this study examined the effects of change types (safety-relevant or safety-irrelevant) and work experience on hazard-identification performance, with a focus on fall-related hazards. The experiment required participants (construction workers, students with experience, and students with no work experience) to detect changes between two construction scenario images that alternated repeatedly and then identify any changes. The results demonstrated that, generally, safety-relevant changes were detected significantly faster than safety-irrelevant changes, with certain types of fall hazards (e.g., unprotected edge hazards) being detected faster than other types (e.g., ladder hazards). The study also found that more experienced subjects (i.e., workers) achieved higher accuracy in detecting relevant changes, but their mean response time was significantly longer than that of students with and without experience. Collectively, these findings indicated that change blindness may influence changes in workers' situation awareness on jobsites. Demonstrating workers' susceptibility to change blindness can help raise awareness during worker trainings about how workers allocate and maintain attention.

Working in the construction industry is very stressful for them, while stress can impair their performance and safety. Mindfulness has been regarded as effective to manage stress and improve performance in general, while there is constant argument on the mindfulness characteristics. In addition, the effect of individual mindfulness characteristics on construction workers' stress and performance still remains unknown. Therefore to fill in the research gap, a questionnaire survey was administered among construction workers. Nine mindfulness characteristics (framed into three theoretical categories), three stress types and three kinds of performance were identified. The results show that mindfulness characteristics indirectly improve construction workers' performance by relieving their stress: (1) objective stress is mitigated by observation; (2) emotional stress is relieved by observation and awareness, and impairs construction workers' organizational performance; and (3) physical stress is reduced by awareness, and worsens safety performance. Mindfulness characteristics also directly improve construction workers' performance, namely description and observation enhance working performance; and awareness improves safety performance. However, the study interestingly found that the mindfulness attitude group has no effect on construction workers' stress and performance, while decentering even harms their safety performance. The implications underlying the findings are discussed. Several recommendations are made for mitigating stress and improving performance. The mindfulness characteristics are grouped into theoretical categories, and the effects of each mindfulness characteristic on the stress and performance of construction workers are identified.

Current research on unsafe behavior mainly focuses on behavior-based safety at the individual level and safety culture at the organization level; these two safety management rubrics enjoy respective advantages and are essentially complementary. This study takes a psychological approach and examines how personality traits affect unsafe behavior of construction workers. Based on the Big Five personality model and the theory of planned behavior, it is postulated that risk propensity mediates the relationships between personality traits and unsafe behavioral intention of construction workers. Structural equation modeling and bootstrapping techniques were used to analyze data collected from 533 construction workers in China. Results show that (1) personality traits, risk propensity, and unsafe behavioral intention of construction workers are related to each other; and (2) risk propensity plays a partial mediating role on the relationships between personality traits (extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness) and unsafe behavioral intention. The findings provide a deeper understanding of how the perceptions of construction workers affect their behaviors.

To explore antecedents of work-family conflict and identify which workers are more likely to exit their organisations when they experience work-family conflict, this study examines how family-supportive supervisor (FSS) affects construction workers' work-family conflict and turnover intention, and how identity salience moderates the relationship between work-family conflict and turnover intention. Data were collected from a sample of 271 construction workers. The results revealed that family-supportive supervisor reduced work-to-family conflict (WFC) and family-to-work conflict (FWC), which in turn predicted turnover intention. The results further suggested that construction workers with low work identity salience or high family identity salience were more likely to exit their organisation when they experienced WFC. Moreover, workers with high work identity salience reported a greater level of turnover intention when they experienced FWC. Findings will help managers in construction organisations deepen their understanding of work-family conflict.

During the research period, the workers' employing organization, a large contracting organization, was engaged in a competitive tender to renew their service contract. The research therefore provided an opportunity to examine the impact of health promotion interventions in project-based work environments under conditions of job insecurity. Design/methodology/approach - The sample comprised of workers contracted to provide facility maintenance and management services for a power station. Data were collected using a longitudinal survey of workers' health, weekly logs recording health behaviour, and a post-intervention evaluation workshop. Health interventions implemented sought to encourage workers to eat more fruit and participate in a physical exercise programme. Findings - Findings revealed that workers' health was generally lower than the Queensland male population when measured using a standardized norm-based tool. The log data revealed that health behaviour fluctuated over time but did not show significant or sustained improvement with the introduction of the health interventions. The evaluation workshop revealed that workers' concerns about their job security during the research period impacted their health behaviours. Originality/value - The need to address the structural and organizational factors that influence the health of project-based workers is highlighted. In particular, concerns about continuity of work may otherwise reduce the beneficial effect of health promotion programmes.

Because of the hazardous nature of the work, there is little margin for human error. Previous research shows that fatigue exacerbates human error, thus representing a critical safety factor for TD work. Although researchers have studied the causes and consequences of fatigue in laboratory settings and in other industries, there is no research specific to TD worker fatigue. To address this knowledge gap and explore the principal fatigue causes and consequences as recognized by the workers; 143 TD power company workers were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, fatigue identification and mitigation techniques relevant to TD work and the impact of fatigue in accident causation were discovered. The results revealed that TD workers perceive extreme temperatures and long shifts to be the principal causes of their fatigue, resulting in reduced work pace and the loss of attention as the primary consequences. The results suggest that fatigue laboratory research may not directly apply to field conditions.

Effective Intervention Strategy to Improve Worker Readiness to Adopt Ventilated Tools	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Health hazards; Construction equipment; Construction methods; Labor and personnel issues	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION LABORERS; ACCEPTANCE MODEL; USER ACCEPTANCE; SAFETY; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; FLOW	An effective theory-based intervention strategy is developed to improve worker adoption of a ventilated dust-control tool that reduces dust exposure by 95%. The Prevention through Design Adoption Readiness Model (PtD ARM) was employed to develop educational materials, hands-on training, and worksite cues-to-action. Educational materials were targeted to improve worker knowledge of the health risks associated with construction dusts. Hands-on training was developed with the objective of improving worker self-efficacy regarding the new equipment. Additionally cues-to-action were given to the workers. These cues were hard-hat stickers and t-shirts with reminder slogans. In a pretest/posttest experimental design with control group (n=40), questionnaire data were analyzed using independent t-tests of the gain-scores, and significant changes (p<0.05) were seen in worker self-efficacy, trust-in-technology, and overall readiness to adopt the tool. Theory-based intervention strategies were found to be effective in improving worker willingness to use ventilated tools. The most impactful intervention methods include training regarding risks to worker health, hands-on training with ventilated tools, and cues-to-action reminders to use the tools.

For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named 'WoTAS' (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based 'STriDE' (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed 'WoTAS' system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations. Eventually, understanding the worker movements will contribute towards reducing the chances of near-miss incidents on sites which have the potential to cause serious accidents.

Accurate ergonomic assessment is needed to reduce ergonomic risks. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of construction sites makes it difficult to collect workers posture data for ergonomic assessment without intrusiveness. Therefore, this paper proposed a joint-level vision-based ergonomic assessment tool for construction workers (JVEC) to provide automatic and detailed ergonomic assessments of construction workers based on construction videos. JVEC extracts construction workers' skeleton data from videos with advanced deep learning methods, then Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) is used to conduct the joint-level ergonomic assessment. This approach was demonstrated and tested with a laboratory experiment and an on-site experiment, which indicated the accuracy of the ergonomic risk scores (70%-96%) and its feasibility for use on construction sites. This research contributes to an accurate and nonintrusive ergonomic assessment method for construction workers. In addition, this research for the first time introduces two-dimensional (2D) video-based three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation algorithms to the construction industry, which may benefit research on construction health, safety, and productivity by providing long-term and accurate behavior data.

Measuring the Impacts of Safety Knowledge on Construction Workers' Attentional Allocation and Hazard Detection Using Remote Eye-Tracking Technology	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							VISUAL-ATTENTION; PERMUTATION TESTS; DRIVERS; PERCEPTION; SIMULATOR; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENTS; VIGILANCE; MANAGEMENT; SCANPATHS	Although several studies have highlighted the importance of attention in reducing the number of injuries in the construction industry, few have attempted to empirically measure the attention of construction workers. One technique that can be used to measure worker attention is eye tracking, which is widely accepted as the most direct and continuous measure of attention because where one looks is highly correlated with where one is focusing his or her attention. Thus, with the fundamental objective of measuring the impacts of safety knowledge (specifically, training, work experience, and injury exposure) on construction workers' attentional allocation, this study demonstrates the application of eye tracking to the realm of construction safety practices. To achieve this objective, a laboratory experiment was designed in which participants identified safety hazards presented in 35 construction site images ordered randomly, each of which showed multiple hazards varying in safety risk. During the experiment, the eye movements of 27 construction workers were recorded using a head-mounted EyeLink II system. The impact of worker safety knowledge in terms of training, work experience, and injury exposure (independent variables) on eye-tracking metrics (dependent variables) was then assessed by implementing numerous permutation simulations. The results show that tacit safety knowledge acquired from work experience and injury exposure can significantly improve construction workers' hazard detection and visual search strategies. The results also demonstrate that (1) there is minimal difference, with or without the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10-h certificate, in workers' search strategies and attentional patterns while exposed to or seeing hazardous situations; (2) relative to less experienced workers (<5 years), more experienced workers (>10 years) need less processing time and deploy more frequent short fixations on hazardous areas to maintain situational awareness of the environment; and (3) injury exposure significantly impacts a worker's visual search strategy and attentional allocation. In sum, practical safety knowledge and judgment on a jobsite requires the interaction of both tacit and explicit knowledge gained through work experience, injury exposure, and interactive safety training. This study significantly contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential application of eye-tracking technology in studying the attentional allocation of construction workers. Regarding practice, the results of the study show that eye tracking can be used to improve worker training and preparedness, which will yield safer working conditions, detect at-risk workers, and improve the effectiveness of safety-training programs.

J	Liu, YF; Wang, XQ; Wang, D				Liu, Yunfeng; Wang, Xueqing; Wang, Dan			How Leaders and Coworkers Affect Construction Workers' Safety Behavior: An Integrative Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety leadership; Coworkers' safety knowledge and behavior (CSK; B); Safety compliance; Safety participation; Risk perception	RISK PERCEPTION; WORKPLACE SAFETY; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; AIRLINE PILOTS; CLIMATE; MODEL; IMPROVEMENT; IMPACT; INVOLVEMENT; VALIDATION	Leaders and coworkers have a critical influence on construction workers' safety behavior, but limited attention has been paid to how they work together. This study took an integrative perspective, exploring the combined effects of leaders (safety leadership) and coworkers [coworkers' safety knowledge and behavior (CSK/B)] on construction workers' safety behavior (compliance and participation) through their risk perception. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey administered to 348 frontline construction workers in China, and hierarchical linear regression was used to test the hypotheses. Results show that both safety leadership and CSK/B positively affected workers' safety compliance and participation via risk perception. In addition, compared with safety leadership, CSK/B had a stronger impact on workers' risk perception, as well as a stronger impact on safety compliance and safety participation via risk perception. This study deepens understanding of the forming mechanism of construction workers' safety behavior by examining the mediating role of risk perception and comparing the influence of safety leadership and CSK/B. Practically, this knowledge will enable construction managers to develop appropriate strategies for fostering construction workers' safety behavior.

J	Choi, B; Hwang, S; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Hwang, Sungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			What drives construction workers' acceptance of wearable technologies in the workplace?: Indoor localization and wearable health devices for occupational safety and health	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker; Intention to use; Occupational safety and health; Technology acceptance model; Wearable technology	USER ACCEPTANCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CONSUMER; MODEL; EXTENSION; STRAIN	The use of wearable sensing devices (e.g., GPS and physiological sensors) can open a new door toward occupational safety and health management in physically demanding and hazardous construction (e.g., tracking worker's locations in dangerous working area and monitoring of worker's physiological status). These potential benefits cannot be achieved, however, if construction workers do not recognize the value of wearable devices as well as the details of their usage. This study thus investigates determinants for workers' adoption of wearable technology in the occupational work context. Specifically, the scope of this study is to test hypotheses regarding workers' intention to adopt two representative wearable devices for occupational safety and health, a smart vest with an embedded indoor GPS for location tracking, and a wristband-type wearable activity tracker (i.e., wristband) with physiological sensors. The research results indicate that perceived usefulness (PU), social influence (SI), and perceived privacy risk (PR) are associated with workers' intention to adopt (IA) both smart vest and wristband. Also, workers' experiences using wearable devices positively moderates the association between PU and IA of smart vest and negatively moderates the association between SI and IA of smart vest. In the work context, foremen are more likely to be influenced by PU than workers with regard to using a wristband. By considering the different functions, benefits, and challenges of each device, and by taking into account individual and job characteristics, the results of this study provide crucial insight into the process of motivating workers to adopt each device in their work, which can promote the continued and appropriate use of wearable technology in occupational safety and health management.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Interrelationship among Belief, Intention, Attitude, Behavior, and Performance of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Attitude; Correlation analysis; Path analysis; Theory of planned behavior	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; JOB; SAFETY; MODEL	Worker behavior is one of the factors that influences construction labor productivity (CLP). This notion is discussed extensively in the literature; however, in most of these studies, the relation between behavior and productivity is either explained theoretically or demonstrated deductively. Moreover, the literature on psychology suggests that the impact of behavior on CLP cannot be understood completely without considering the effects of three other behavioral attributes (BAs)-belief, intention, and attitude. Therefore, this study has attempted to fill this gap by identifying the interrelationship among the four BAs and CLP. To achieve this objective, an existing work-attitude scale was used to measure all four BAs of workers. Simultaneously, productivity of the same workers was measured on site. After collecting data from 109 construction workers, interrelationships between their BAs and productivity were determined through path analysis. The results found a direct and positive relationship between behavior and productivity. Moreover, attitude was identified as an attribute that cannot be influenced directly by any of the tangible factors. Therefore, the study concludes that, to change behavior among workers that will enhance CLP, contractors must focus on changing the belief systems of workers through regular training to incorporate positive information into workers' beliefs.

J	Kim, H; Ahn, CR; Yang, K				Kim, Hyunsoo; Ahn, Changbum R.; Yang, Kanghyeok			Identifying Safety Hazards Using Collective Bodily Responses of Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hazard identification; Bodily response; Inertial measurement unit (IMU); Collective sensing	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; GAIT STABILITY; BEHAVIOR; WALKING; INDIVIDUALS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MOVEMENT; WORKLOAD; STRENGTH	Current construction hazard identification mostly relies on safety managers' ability to identify hazards using their prior knowledge about them. Consequently, numerous latent hazards remain unidentified, which poses significant risks to construction workers. To advance current hazard identification capabilities, this study examines the feasibility of harnessing and analyzing collective patterns of workers' bodily responses (balance, gait, etc.) to identify safety hazards on a jobsite. To test the hypothesis that the abnormality of workers' bodily responses in one location highly correlates with the likelihood of a safety hazard in that location, this project collected data on the bodily responses of 10 subjects who participated in five experiments. These test subjects wore inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors on their body. Then the collected response data were analyzed using three metrics [average, standard deviation, and Shapiro-Wilk statistic (W)]. The data showed that the normality of workers' bodily response distributions-represented as a W statistic-highly correlated with hazard locations in every experiment, which implies that workers' bodily responses in hazardous areas are more irregularly distributed than in nonhazardous areas. This outcome demonstrates an opportunity for utilizing workers' collective bodily responses to identify safety hazards in diverse construction environments.

J	Sun, CF; Ahn, S; Ahn, CR				Sun, Cenfei; Ahn, Seungjun; Ahn, Changbum Ryan			Identifying Workers' Safety Behavior-Related Personality by Sensing	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RISK PERCEPTION; ACCIDENT PRONENESS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CONSTRUCTION; LOCUS; ATTITUDES; CLIMATE; STRESS; HAZARD; SITE	Many construction accidents are caused by workers' unsafe behavior, and evidence suggests that individuals who are not sensitive to risks are accident-prone. Therefore, identifying workers with certain personal characteristics related to habitual insensitive response to safety risks potentially can help construction managers develop individualized safety training and interventions. Although the methods by which construction managers could identify those workers with specific personal characteristics have been limited, wearable sensors provide an opportunity for construction managers to monitor individual workers' behavior without any interruptions. This study investigated whether and how sensing data about workers' behavior around hazards can reveal their personality traits related to risk-taking behavior. In particular, this research focused on a personality trait well known to be related to risk-taking behavior, locus of control (LOC). An experiment was designed to collect workers' behavioral response to various hazards in terms of gait patterns; LOC was measured using standard instruments. The analysis showed that the degree of gait change around hazards is significantly correlated with LOC score. Additionally, those with internal LOC had more consistent gait patterns over a number of repetitive exposures to the same hazard (i.e., sustained sensitivity to safety risks) than those with an external LOC. These results demonstrate the potential of using wearable sensors to identify workers with personality traits associated with unsafe behavior.

This approach regards the laydown area as a radiation source, and proactive struck-by risk detection is formulated as a location-based estimate of radiation quantity received by the worker. The position probability grid is adopted to track the worker and model their movement. The movement pattern model, which is learned from the trajectory records of the workers in the same trade, reflects the movement preferences of different trades, and the randomness model represents the randomness of worker movement. The worker's next location can be predicted by using the tracked location and movement model, and the struck-by risk can then be estimated. The methods potential for integration into currently available proximity warning systems is also demonstrated.

In this article, we draw on rich ethnographic data on their everyday experiences of working construction and living in Singapore, and we espouse the distinctive qualities and mission of ethnographically-informed methodologies to enact change in this space. The methods include in-depth interviews with 11 Tamil labourers, and the subsequent use of worker photo diaries, known as auto-photography, with a total of 108 photographs taken. All the participants either worked construction, were on medical leave, or were seeking compensation after workplace injury. The analysis of the interview data develops themes around precarity and discrimination on construction sites (precarity of work), and the exclusory social practices experienced by workers in their offsite world (precarity of place). Following the goals of decolonized research, our innovative methods have enabled Tamil construction workers to present their lives through their own lens. By involving migrant construction workers, we identify new sites of inquiry and knowledge in examining the inequalities and injustices they face.

Recent studies have also found that a strong correlation exists between viewing patterns of workers, captured using eye-tracking devices, and their hazard recognition performance. Therefore, it is important to analyze the viewing patterns of workers to gain a better understanding of their hazard recognition performance. From the training standpoint, scan paths and attention maps, generated using eye tracking technology, can be used effectively to provide personalized and focused feedback to workers. Such feedback is used to communicate the search process deficiency to workers in order to trigger self-reflection and subsequently improve their hazard recognition performance. This paper proposes a computer vision-based method that tracks workers on a construction site and automatically locates their fixation points, collected using a wearable eye-tracker, on a 3D point cloud. This data is then used to analyze their viewing behavior and compute their attention distribution. The presented case studies validate the proposed method.

There is a lack of studies on remote monitoring for improving safety and health of the construction workforce. This paper presents a new approach for monitoring ergonomically safe and unsafe behavior of construction workers. The study relies on a methodology that utilizes fusion of data from continuous remote monitoring of construction workers' location and physiological status. To monitor construction workers activities, the authors deployed nonintrusive real-time worker location sensing (RTLS) and physiological status monitoring (PSM) technology. This paper presents the background and need for a data fusion approach, the framework, the test bed environment, and results to some case studies that were used to automatically identify unhealthy work behavior. Results of this study suggest a new approach for automating remote monitoring of construction workers safety performance by fusing data on their location and physical strain.

J	Seo, J; Lee, S; Seo, J				Seo, JoonOh; Lee, SangHyun; Seo, Jongwon			Simulation-Based Assessment of Workers' Muscle Fatigue and Its Impact on Construction Operations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction operation; Simulation; Muscle fatigue; Biomechanical analysis; Quantitative methods	MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY; LOW-BACK; RECOVERY; WORKPLACE; MODEL; ELECTROMYOGRAM; BIOMECHANICS; ERGONOMICS; ENDURANCE; SHOULDER	Construction workers are frequently exposed to excessive physical demands due to repetitive lifting and material handling while performing tasks. Consequently, many construction workers suffer from a significant level of muscle fatigue that may negatively impact a project's performance. Thus, evaluating the level of muscle fatigue prior to work and implementing appropriate interventions to reduce physical demands will help to prevent adverse effects of workers' fatigue on construction operations. Even though several research efforts have suggested methodologies to evaluate muscle fatigue, the extent to which workers' muscle fatigue would affect construction performance has not yet been fully studied. To address this issue, a simulation-based framework is proposed to estimate physical demands and corresponding muscle fatigue, and thus to quantitatively evaluate the impact of muscle fatigue during construction operations. Specifically, physical demands from a planned operation modeled using discrete event simulation (DES) are estimated through biomechanical analyses. Then, the proposed dynamic fatigue models estimate the level of muscle fatigue of each worker as a function of the estimated physical demands. Workers' strategies to mitigate muscle fatigue, such as taking voluntary rests, are, in turn, modeled in the DES to understand how muscle fatigue affects time and cost performance of the planned operation. As a proof of concept, a case study on masonry work was performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework, describing the need for taking into account muscle fatigue for operational planning due to possible excessive physical demands. The results from the case study indicate that excessive physical demands beyond workers' capabilities result in reduction of time and cost performance. The proposed framework helps to better understand workers' response to physical demands by adding workers' capabilities as changing variables into traditional DES approaches, enabling pro-active management of human resources. Ultimately, the framework, which combines conventional interests on optimized operations in terms of time and cost with those of ergonomics, provides opportunities to take into account both workers' health and work performance in early design stages.

High crowdedness can result in dangerous working conditions, negative workers' behaviors, lack of concern for safety climate, and productivity loss due to saturated and insufficient working areas where workers can perform. An automatic computer vision-based technique could be a novel solution for crowdedness monitoring for proactive safety management. Non-intrusiveness and applicability in a complex outdoor environment are critical considerations for device selection on construction sites. Accordingly, a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera is selected to detect worker-centric crowdedness. This device is less intrusive for workers than wearable sensors and is also widely applied in outdoor construction sites considering complex working areas and various light conditions. Previous RGB camera-based methods for crowdedness detection simplify the proximity estimation process by assuming that the construction site is a two-dimensional (2D) planar surface. These methods use image pixels for proximity calculation. Such simplification can cause a distortion in three-dimensional (3D) spatial proximity due to 2D projection of 3D entities. Moreover, previous methods suffer from lack of reproducibility due to the view variance of a 2D camera. To address these problems, a 3D spatial crowdedness estimation method is developed by generating a 3D space for proximity and crowdedness calculation from 2D video frames. This method has been validated in laboratory and field tests. Results indicate that the proposed method enables the estimation of 3D spatial proximity between two workers within an error of 0.45 m in a real-time and view-invariant manner from a 2D video. The proposed method is expected to enable managers to accurately monitor crowdedness among workers for proactive construction safety management.

J	Lingard, H; Turner, M; Charlesworth, S				Lingard, Helen; Turner, Michelle; Charlesworth, Sara			Growing pains: work-life impacts in small-to-medium sized construction firms	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Organizations; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Small enterprises; Work-life balance; Human resource management; Employees	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; STRESS; PERFORMANCE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the quality of work-life experiences of workers in construction firms of differing sizes and explored the work conditions and circumstances that impact upon the work-life experiences of workers in small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Australian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in two stages. First, data from a sub-set of construction industry workers were extracted from a large scale survey of workers in Victoria, Australia (the VicWAL survey). The survey measured work-life interference using the Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI). Next a subset of survey respondents was identified and interviewed to gain more detailed explanatory information and insight into work-life experiences. Findings - The survey results indicated that respondents who reported working for a construction firm with between 16 and 99 employees reported significantly higher AWALI scores (indicating high work-life interference) than workers in organisations employing 15 or less or more than 100 workers. The follow-up interviews revealed that workers in small construction organisations were managed directly and personally by the business owner/manager and able to access informal work-life supports that were provided on an "as needs" basis. In comparison workers in medium-sized firms perceived higher levels of work pressure and an expectation that work would be prioritised over family life. Research limitations/implications - The research shows that the findings of work-life balance research undertaken in large construction organisations cannot be generalised to SMEs. Organisation size should also be treated as an important variable in work-life balance research in construction. Practical implications - The research suggests that a better understanding of how workers in SME construction firms experience work-life balance is important in the design and development of work-life balance programs. In particular the challenges faced by workers as companies grow from SMEs require careful consideration and management. Originality/value - Previous research has focused on the work-life balance experiences of employees in large construction firms. Little was previously known about the experiences of workers in SME construction firms. The research provides new insight into the work-life experiences of construction workers in organisations of varying sizes.

This has necessitated recourse to migrant workers to address capacity and capability requirements. Migrant construction workers hail from various backgrounds with a complex set of their needs being met through employment in NZ. Research on understanding the satisfaction levels of this category of construction workers is scarce. With recent insinuations about migrant exploitations, research investigations into this knowledge area are significant. In this study, the authors sought to establish the moderating effect of migrants' demography on the determinants of job satisfaction in NZ's construction sector. Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from migrant construction workers of Chinese extraction through a structured questionnaire survey. From 200 questionnaires administered, 108 samples were completed by migrant construction workers involved in major projects in Auckland city, NZ. Data obtained were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics to establish the moderating effects of their demography on job satisfaction. Findings Results from this study support the internal validity and reliability of these personal characteristics as moderators of job satisfaction for migrant construction workers. These results suggest the relevance of personal characteristics of Chinese migrants in any improvement initiatives being developed for this group of construction workers. Research limitations/implications The findings from this study contribute to the discourse on the relevance of construction migrants as a strategic alternative to addressing skill shortages within the NZ construction sector. They also provide evidence that contributes to an improved understanding of the migrant workforce to meet their aspirations and enhance their general well-being. Originality/value Although the study is ethnic-specific, the conclusions show the relevance of personal characteristics in the experiences of construction migrant workers. The study is representative of the catchment of temporary migrant workers in the construction industry in NZ. The study provides insights for organisations employing migrants about putting in place appropriate measures to enhance their satisfaction levels. Finally, this study's findings may contribute to policy initiatives on the optimal categories of migrants engaged on construction activities to derive the maximum benefits for NZ.

J	Ahn, S; Lee, S				Ahn, Seungjun; Lee, SangHyun			Methodology for Creating Empirically Supported Agent-Based Simulation with Survey Data for Studying Group Behavior of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS); Worker behavior; Group behavior; Social norm; Absenteeism; Quantitative methods	MANAGEMENT; SAFETY	Construction workers' attitudes and behaviors are one of the most important factors of a construction project's performance. As the attention paid to the impact of social influences and norms on worker behavior grows, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) emerges as a research tool for studying workers' group behavior. With ABMS, researchers can uncover the underlying process of group behavior emerging from individuals' interactions in an organization. However, validating agent-based simulation with real data is the greatest challenge in using ABMS for organizational behavior research. With this background in mind, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology for creating an empirically supported agent-based model for studying workers' behavior influenced by social norms. The proposed methodology suggests that empirical data collected by a questionnaire can be used for ABMS in three steps: (1) testing the agent behavior rules used in an agent-based model (i. e., testing the modeling assumptions), (2) demonstrating the model behavior's qualitative agreement with real workers' behavior (i. e., testing the simulation results against real data in a qualitative manner), and (3) creating a specific agent-based model with the model parameters that correspond to a specific empirical case. A specific agent-based model created in this way can then be seen as a scenario generator that corresponds to a specific reality and can be used to answer what if questions. Therefore, the model can be used to develop policies/interventions to improve workers' behavior in a given situation. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a study on construction workers' absenteeism that was conducted by the authors. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge of workforce management in construction; the proposed methodology provides a means of simulating workers' group behavior and developing policies/interventions to improve worker behavior at the group level in construction.

J	Choi, B; Ahn, S; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Ahn, Seungjun; Lee, SangHyun			Role of Social Norms and Social Identifications in Safety Behavior of Construction Workers. I: Theoretical Model of Safety Behavior under Social Influence	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Safety behavior; Social norms; Social identity; Social influence; Labor and personnel issues	GROUP SELF-ESTEEM; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; DISTINCT ASPECTS; PERCEIVED RISK; IDENTITY; CLIMATE; ATTITUDES; ORGANIZATION; CATEGORIZATION; PERFORMANCE	During the last several decades, behavior-based safety (BBS) has drawn a considerable amount of attention in the construction industry. The focus of BBS is on improving construction workers' safety behavior through feedback and increased self-awareness and motivation. Among the influencing factors of safety behavior, social norm is known to be a powerful mechanism that regulates workers' safety behavior. However, it is unclear how social norms are developed and through which process social norms influence an individual worker's safety behavior in construction projects. Additionally, the temporary and contract-based nature of employment in construction projects makes understanding the influence of different social norms on workers' safety behavior in construction projects especially difficult. Given this background, this paper aims to better understand the process by which different social norms exert control over construction workers' safety behavior. To achieve this goal, empirical data were collected from 284 workers from eight construction sites in the United States, Korea, and Saudi Arabia using surveys, and the data were analyzed. The results demonstrate that workers' safety behavior is influenced by perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and personal attitude, and perceived workgroup norm mediates the relationship between perceived management norm and safety behavior. In addition, it is shown that social identification with the project intensifies the relationship between perceived management norm and safety behavior and attenuates the relationship between perceived workgroup norm and safety behavior. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge on construction safety by providing an explicative model for how social norms influence workers' safety behavior, and suggest that a sociopsychological approach to promote project identity and reinforce favorable social norms in construction workers can be an effective means of improving construction safety.

Prevalence rates for the infection in the South African construction industry exceed those of most other sectors. Little is known about the testing status of different categories of construction workers. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Bivariate tests of association and bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to explore demographic determinants of testing. The results indicate that (1) age, gender, employment type, and firm predict testing status, with older workers, females, permanent workers, and workers employed by firms with proactive intervention management more likely to have been tested than their counterparts; (2) education and race are not determinants of testing status; (3) workers aged 30 years and younger are the least likely to have been tested, particularly those 20 years and younger; (4) female construction workers are five times more likely to have been tested than males; (5) permanent employees are twice as likely to have been tested than temporary workers; and (6) workers employed by firms with comparatively more proactive HIV/AIDS intervention management are more likely to have been tested. This research identifies key variables that increase or decrease the probability of construction workers being tested at sites where VCT services are offered. Consequently, it confirms that the provision of VCT services is not in itself sufficient to address worker HIV incidence and prevalence rates. Rather, constructions firms need to be much more focused on the design of these services to ensure better targeting of subpopulations that are least likely to test. The identification of these key demographic variables highlights the value of shifting away from relatively standardized VCT services in the industry to those that are company- and perhaps even site-specific. This requires a degree of innovation in VCT services that not only is grounded in the construction sector but learns and adapts knowledge and practice from other sectors of society.

In blue-collar occupations, the physical demands of manual labor have always been the major focus, but recent technological changes may come with higher demands on the intellectual capacities of workers. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to assess physical and cognitive demands that construction workers face. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a quantitative study using standardized research instruments. Construction workers of three German construction companies were asked to volunteer to participate in interviews (n=35) and a survey (n=30) that assessed the extent of physical demands and a variety of cognitive demands experienced by construction workers. Findings The results suggest that construction work is demanding in physical terms as well as in perceptual, psychomotor, social and cognitive terms. Using and updating specialized knowledge, giving advice and providing consultation, friendliness, assertiveness and reliability are important demands among construction workers. Research limitations/implications - Construction workers face an undervalued level of demands in their everyday work environment. As high demands can affect well-being and mental health, construction companies would greatly benefit from investing efforts into evaluating the multi-component demands profile of their workers and the impact on their health, in particular through the strongly increasing cognitive demands due to the ongoing digitization of the sector. Originality/value The study identified essential demands in construction work that are relevant for the workers' productivity and well-being.

Therefore, as nonintrusive and accurate solutions, various vision-based methods have been proposed to track entities in construction sites and obtain their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates. However, most existing vision-based methods realize 3D localizations by basing entity matching on the epipolar line, which brings instability in entity matching due to the calculation error of the epipolar line or failure to match entities when multiple entities are located on the same epipolar. To solve this problem, a novel framework based on reidentification is proposed to automatically match workers across two camera views, thereby obtaining their 3D coordinates in construction sites. In this framework, deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms are firstly used to detect and track workers in two camera views. Then, the reidentification (ReID) algorithm is applied to utilize tracked workers' visual features to match the workers across both two camera views and different frames. As a result, for every matched pair, the worker's pixel locations in two camera views can be obtained to calculate the 3D coordinates through triangulation. The implementation of videos recorded from a real construction project proves the feasibility and accuracy of this framework. Specifically, through utilizing the ReID algorithm to match workers, the framework achieves competitive results on workers matching with precision, recall, and accuracy of more than 99%, 93%, and 93%. Furthermore, it also effectively addresses the practical problems of ID repetition and ID switching. Meanwhile, this paper extends the application scenarios of reidentification algorithms in construction sites, thereby contributing to the future application of multiple-camera vision-based methods in construction sites.

Construction Workers' Perceptions and Attitudes toward Social Norms as Predictors of Their Absence Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor; Human factors; Social factors; Construction industry; Personnel management; Labor; Absence behavior; Absenteeism; Behavioral control; Worker attitude; Social norms; Social cohesion; Labor and personnel issues	ABSENTEEISM	Because construction operations depend on labor activity, absenteeism on a job site can damage project performance in many ways. Traditionally, construction managers have viewed absenteeism as a problem of individuals and have not paid much attention to absenteeism as a group-level phenomenon. As a result, individually focused formal rule enforcement (e.g.,issuing a penalty) has been used to reduce absenteeism in construction projects, but this approach often results in the insufficient encouragement of attendance motivation. To better manage workers' attendance on job sites, another aspect in absenteeism that has recently received attention is behavioral control of workers, including how workers perceive formal and social rules for absence, build attitudes toward these rules, and control their absence behavior accordingly. With this background, the objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between workers' perceptions/attitudes toward formal/social rules and their absence behavior by using real-world data. To fulfill this objective, a survey questionnaire was developed, data were collected from three different job sites, and statistical analyses were performed using logistic regression models. The results of the analyses show that construction workers who perceive salient social norms in their team are less likely to be absent from the job site, which implies that worker absence behavior is under the influence of social controls. It is also found that the primary mechanism by which social controls on workers' behavior take place in construction is self-categorization. The results of this research extend the current knowledge of the mechanism and the role of social controls in shaping construction workers' absence behavior. From the results, it is inferred that even a modest investment in promoting social cohesion and creating a positive prototype in teams can be an effective means of maintaining low absenteeism on a job site.

J	Brathen, K; Moum, A				Brathen, Ketil; Moum, Anita			Bridging the gap: bringing BIM to construction workers	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BIM; Implementation; Collaboration; Visualization; BIM-kiosk; Construction activities	AUGMENTED REALITY; INFORMATION	Purpose - The majority of research on the implementation and use of Building Information Models (BIM) have focused on building design and pre-construction planning. There is only limited research on the usage of BIM in the construction phase, especially by site workers. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the use of BIM by site workers through so-called "BIM-kiosks". The kiosks allow workers to access BIM models on-site. The aim of this paper is to take a closer look on the introduction of BIM-kiosks and scrutinize how and for what purpose site workers use the kiosks. Design/methodology/approach - This is a single case study of an ongoing real-world construction project. The case study is based on qualitative data which stems from observational studies, interviews as well as document studies. Findings - Site workers find opportunities for 3D visualization useful and the BIM models are appraised for efficiently handling complex elements. The findings also indicate that the use of BIM-kiosks lead to a greater level of face-to-face collaboration between workers on-site. This may happen because workers meet, both planned and randomly, to discuss in front of the kiosks while using it for visualization. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to a single case. However, some of the recommendations may be relevant to other projects. In addition, the findings demonstrate some of the potential of using BIM on-site in upcoming construction projects. Originality/value - Only a few studies have addressed the use of BIM among site workers. Thus, the findings provide practitioners and researchers insight into how current practices may be improved, as well as areas where more research is needed.

Strategies for Improving Safety and Health of Ethnic Minority Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety and health; Safety management strategies; Ethnic minorities; Hong Kong; Labor and personnel issues	DELPHI; MANAGEMENT	The construction industries of developed countries are faced with an aging workforce and a shortage of recruits. It is common for migrant workers/ethnic minorities (EMs) who are already part of the society to join the construction industry. With increasing involvement of EMs in the construction industry, effective strategies for improving their safety and health are urgently needed. The existing body of knowledge is mainly derived from research conducted in English-speaking countries with Western cultures. Research on safety of migrant/EM construction workers in multidialect Asian countries with Eastern cultures has been lacking. This study aimed to identify various strategies for improving the safety and health of EM construction workers from the Asian perspective. Twenty-two face-to-face semistructured interviews were performed with safety professionals in Hong Kong followed by two rounds of Delphi survey with 18 safety experts to verify the interview findings and rank the relative importance of the strategies. The study unveiled 14 strategies for improving the safety performance of EM workers. The three most important ones identified were (1)to provide safety training in EM native languages, (2)that government and industry associations should play an active role in promoting health and safety awareness of EM workers, and (3)to encourage EM workers to learn the local language. This study contributes to filling the research gap by evaluating the strategies for improving safety of migrant/EM construction workers in Asian countries with Eastern cultures in which English is not the first language. Research findings would assist occupational health and safety experts and relevant stakeholders in designing strategies for improving the safety and health of EM workers, which will ultimately improve overall safety performance of the construction industry.

J	Son, H; Choi, H; Seong, H; Kim, C				Son, Hyojoo; Choi, Hyunchul; Seong, Hyeonwoo; Kim, Changwan			Detection of construction workers under varying poses and changing background in image sequences via very deep residual networks	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker detection; Deep learning; Two-stage approach; Very deep residual networks	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; PEDESTRIAN DETECTION; VISION; TRACKING; RECOGNITION; EQUIPMENT; SEGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	Analyzing the location and behavior of construction workers using construction site images has been recognized as a means of providing useful information for safety management and productivity analysis. Although effective utilization of analyzed image data requires accurate and timely detection of workers in complex, continuously changing working environments, the previous methods that detect construction workers still require improvement because of the poor detection performance. This study proposes the use of very deep residual networks to accurately and rapidly detect construction workers under varying poses and against changing backgrounds in image sequences. The architecture of construction worker detection in this study is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method is divided into two stages: extracting feature maps via very deep residual networks (ResNet-152) and bounding box regression and labeling from the original image via Faster regions with CNN features (R-CNN). The experiments were conducted at actual construction sites by acquiring 1.3-megapixel and 3.1-megapixel images from a movable digital camera to verify the proposed method for images from fixed and moving cameras. Faster R-CNN with ResNet-152 had accuracy, precision, and recall rates of 94.3%, 96.03%, and 98.13% for 3241 images, respectively. The proposed method processed 0.2 s per frame (i.e., 5 frames per second) on average. The results show that it is possible to accurately and rapidly detect multiple workers in construction site images by employing very deep residual networks without relying on limited assumptions about workers' postures, appearance, and background.

Effective inertial sensor quantity and locations on a body for deep learning-based worker's motion recognition	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker; Motion recognition; Monitoring; Deep learning; Long short-term memory	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONSTRUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	Construction tasks involve various activities composed of one or more body motions. As construction projects are labor-intensive and heavily rely on manual tasks, understanding the ever-changing behavior and activities is essential to manage construction workers effectively regarding their safety and productivity. While several research efforts have shown promising results in automated motion and activity recognition of the workers using motion sensors, there is still a lack of understanding about how motion sensors' numbers and their locations affect the performance of the recognition, which can contribute to improving the recognition performance and reducing the implementation cost. Moreover, further research is necessary to seek the motion recognition model that accurately identifies various motions using motion sensors attached to the workers' bodies. This study proposes a construction worker's motion recognition model using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of motion sensors' numbers and locations to maximize motion recognition performance. The evaluation is conducted by generating different datasets containing motion sensor data collected from the sensors located on different body parts. Comparing the performance of five machine learning models trained using the datasets, the desired numbers and locations of motion sensors are identified. The quasi-experimental test with multiple subjects is conducted to validate the findings of the evaluation. Based on the findings, the LSTM network for recognizing construction workers' motions is developed. The LSTM network classifies various motions of the workers that can be utilized as primitive elements for monitoring the workers regarding their safety and productivity.

This paper describes a research study of lean and safety principles and practices with regards to worker behavior and safety practices. Specifically, the study aimed to investigate the extent of alignment between lean construction principles/practices and worker behaviors associated with construction safety. To conduct the study, the researchers used a multistep process involving a comprehensive literature review, document content analyses by an expert panel, and a survey of industry practitioners knowledgeable about lean construction. The findings support the perspective that many similarities exist between the application and impacts of lean and safety principles and practices. Lean practitioners surveyed believe that implementation of the last planner system as a lean practice is most beneficial to the following safety practices: management commitment, preproject planning, and pretask planning. The present study revealed that lean principles and practices can provide a valuable opportunity to further improve construction worker safety; however, the findings show that there is a difference between lean construction and safety management practices, revealing a gap with respect to worker behavior. Understanding and eliminating this gap is important for the industry to realize the full benefit that lean principles and practices can have on worker safety. To do so, the authors suggest expanding lean practices to further directly engage field workers and address worker behavior issues along with carefully communicating the lean message to construction personnel.

As the construction industry has an increasingly multicultural and multilingual workforce, conventional written and verbal safety communication is of limited effectiveness. CodeSafe Solutions, has developed an innovative method of communicating H&S information to field-based workers using digital media. The potential of the system was explored and two organizations in the Australian construction industry were used. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews of safety managers and workers involved in system implementation and quantitative data such as incident reports and video usage were analysed. Managers perceived the CodeSafe system to be beneficial and well received by workers. In one organization, the introduction of the CodeSafe system coincided with a reduction in injury rates. However, causal inferences about the impact of the system cannot be made. Workers involved in making the films believed films would be an effective communication tool. However, barriers to implementation of the technology include workers' reluctance to use personal smart phones, limited internet connectivity, and organizational and national regulations on mobile phone use on construction sites.

J	Lee, YJ; Park, MW				Lee, Yong-Ju; Park, Man-Woo			3D tracking of multiple onsite workers based on stereo vision	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker; Computer vision; Tracking; Entity matching; Camera calibration; Occlusion; Site monitoring	CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM	Varied sensing technologies have been delved in for positioning workers and equipment in construction sites. Vision-based technology has been received growing attentions by the virtue of its tag-free and inexpensive configuration. One of the core research works in this area was the use of stereo camera system for tracking 3D locations of construction resources. However, the previous work was limited to tracking of a single entity. To overcome the limitation, this paper presents a new framework for tracking multiple workers. The proposed framework supplements the previous work by embedding an additional step, entity matching, which finds corresponding matches of tracked workers across two camera views. Entity matching takes advantage of the epipolar geometry and workers' motion directions for finding correct pairs of a worker's projections on two image planes. This paper also presents an effective approach of camera calibration for positioning entities located a few tens of meters away from the cameras. The proposed framework is evaluated based on completeness, continuity, and localization accuracy of the generated trajectories. The evaluation results have shown its capability of retrieving 96% of actual movements, within localization errors of 0.821 m with 99.7% confidence.

Travis			Enhancing the safety of construction crew by accounting for brain resource requirements of activities in job assignment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Personalized safety management; Job assignment; Brain resources; Individual differences	MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; CLIMATE; KNOWLEDGE; TRACKING; TAXONOMY; INDUSTRY; SYSTEM; RISK	Safety management is regarded traditionally as an aggregate attribute for Human Resources (HR) in which the focus is placed on safety of construction crew by assuming same behaviour, capabilities and thus level of exposure to risk for all workers in the crew. In line with this, a team-based approach is generally adopted for task assignment to workers in construction operations. However, this approach tends to disregard the differences between skill level, experience, capabilities, learning rates and fatigue rates of different individual workers forming the team. In particular, due to differences in visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor capabilities of different workers and brain resource demands of different activities, the traditional approach may result in inconsistent workloads and uneven fatigue rates within a crew, affecting the workers' and crew's safety negatively. This paper proposes a novel framework for task assignment to construction workers in which safety of individual workers and thus the crew is ensured through optimizing workload distributions within a crew. The framework computes visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor requirements of the jobs assigned to a worker and minimizes the identified workload imbalances through collaborative execution of shared tasks. The application of the proposed framework is examined on a pipe spool fabrication operation of a refinery project in a simulation environment.

Due to the high accident rates in the construction industry it is vital for management to take necessary steps to implement programs and procedures that will increase construction safety and worker productivity. While the effects of a drug-related jobsite accident can be catastrophic for individuals and companies, management should realize that drug use among employees can be damaging to moral, productivity, and quality even if it does not result in accidents. The level of teamwork required for excellent work is harder to achieve and efforts to improve project management by team building are hurt by the absenteeism and short-term employment typical of the employee that abuses drugs. Other areas where the project management of a construction company is compromised by worker drug use are recruitment and retention of human resources, career growth management, and safety. Drug testing construction workers is an effective method for reducing the number of impaired workers on a project site, increasing overall project safety, worker morale, productivity, and profits. There are ethical and legal questions on both sides of the issue and any such management initiative must be balanced with worker rights.

J	Murray, SL; Khan, Z				Murray, Susan L.; Khan, Zafar			Impact of Interruptions on White Collar Workers	ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						White Collar Workers; Internal and External Interruptions; Multitasking; Knowledge Workers	TASK INTERRUPTION; DECISION-MAKING	An interruption is a randomly occurring, discrete event that breaks the continuity of cognitive focus on a primary task and typically requires immediate attention and demands action. This article investigates the effect of the timing of an interruption and source on both demanding and non-demanding tasks. Time logs of daily work activities from 21 white collar workers were analyzed. The findings show that interruptions have a negative impact on worker performance when they occur at the middle or end of the current/primary task. In addition, results show that the majority of the interruptions were externally generated (78%) rather than internally generated. The more demanding the tasks that were interrupted, the greater the negative impact on the overall performance. Suggestions for reducing the impact of interruptions are also discussed.

J	Gao, YF; Gonzalez, VA; Yiu, TW				Gao, Yifan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.; Yiu, Tak Wing			Exploring the Relationship between Construction Workers' Personality Traits and Safety Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction sector; Personality traits; Safety behavior	BIG 5; WORKPLACE SAFETY; VIRTUAL-REALITY; ACCIDENT INVOLVEMENT; JOB-PERFORMANCE; SCALE SCORES; RISK-TAKING; VALIDITY; CLIMATE; INJURIES	In the workplace, some workers tend to have a higher probability of incurring an accident. Such individuals might behave unsafely because they assign low priority to safety. Some evidence in the literature suggests that people's personalities could influence their safety behavior at work. However, it seems that the correlation between construction workers' personality traits and safety behavior has been insufficiently addressed in the existing literature. This paper attempts to provide evidence on this issue. Two hundred and eighty workers were surveyed to gather data concerning personality traits and safety behavior. The results indicated that across the set of Big Five personality traits, conscientiousness revealed the strongest correlation with workers' safety behavior, followed by extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In addition, agreeableness and conscientiousness were found to be positively correlated with workers' safety behavior whereas extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with workers' safety behavior. These findings seem to imply practical implications. For example, some tasks, such as operating construction machinery, require focused attention and stable emotions, which may not be suitable for people who score high in neuroticism. Site managers may take into consideration the personality traits of an individual when selecting personnel and allocating tasks.

J	Sherratt, F				Sherratt, Fred			Legitimizing public health control on sites? A critical discourse analysis of the Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						positive liberty; well-being.; health; power; Autonomy		As part of a wider programme, the UK Department of Health produced a Responsibility Deal Construction Pledge, seeking organizational commitment in improving the health of its workforce. Yet commercial involvement with the health of the worker beyond the workplace is a contentious issue, a fundamental challenge to personal freedoms. The exercise of this paternalistic or pastoral power should be questioned, and consequently the agendas and interests behind it have been explored through a critical discourse analysis of the press release of the Pledge. Workers' inability to make the 'right' decisions about their health was used as justification for corporate intervention to guide workers to their 'true' interests and the 'right' choices. The occupational health of individual construction workers on sites was negated for their wider contributions as a workforce to industry and the UK economy. Whilst the real interests of construction workers are likely to be served by a balance of good health and work, this should not be dictated by government, much less commercial organizations with vested interests in worker output. Concerns are raised for workers' health and well-being in terms of their fundamental autonomy, and an increasingly controlled relationship between productive activities and power relations.

Training data for precast component production for the past 5 years were collected in Taiwan, including 317,832 datasets for 14 production activities involving a total of 4,352 worker participations and 492 completion times. A learning curve model for workers to master the manufacture of precast component was developed, yielding the major finding that training time for workers to learn precast component production has a learning curve slope = -0.75. The training time required to reach proficiency varies from 3.87 to 26.15 days for noncomplex activities. The findings also show that four out of 14 activities can be identified as complex with a learning curve slope of -0.75. Practitioners should mainly focus on worker training for those complex activities as the critical path to improving precast component productivity. The findings also provide thresholds (in days) for all activities, which helps to quantify how much time is needed to efficiently train workers for precast component production.

Automatic Biomechanical Workload Estimation for Construction Workers by Computer Vision and Smart Insoles	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Worker; Workload; Occupational health and safety; Ergonomic risks; Biomechanical analysis; Automated image-based three-dimensional (3D) posture estimation; Smart insoles; Machine learning; Deep learning	LOW-BACK-PAIN; ERGONOMIC ANALYSIS; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; POSTURE; SYSTEM; RISK; LOAD; FATIGUE; SENSOR	Construction workers are commonly subject to ergonomic risks due to awkward working postures or lifting/carrying heavy objects. Accordingly, accurate ergonomic assessment is needed to help improve efficiency and reduce risks. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of construction activities makes it difficult to unobtrusively collect worker behavior data for analysis. To address this issue, an automatic workload approach is proposed for the first time to continuously assess worker body joints using image-based three-dimensional (3D) posture capture smart insoles, and biomechanical analysis to provide detailed and accurate assessments based on real data instead of simulation. This approach was tested in an experiment, indicating that the method was able to automatically collect data concerning the workers' 3D posture, estimate external loads, and provide the estimated loads on key body joints with an error rate of 15%. In addition to helping prevent construction workers' ergonomic risks, the method provides a new data collection approach that may benefit various behavior research fields related to construction safety and productivity management.

In order to address this site safety issue, it is necessary to provide proactive warning systems. One critical part in such systems is to locate the current positions of onsite workers and mobile equipment and also predict their future positions to prevent immediate collisions. This paper proposes novel Kalman filters for predicting the movements of the workers and mobile equipment on the construction sites. The filters take the positions of the equipment and workers estimated from multiple video cameras as input and output the corresponding predictions on their future positions. Moreover, the filters could adjust their predictions based on the worker or equipment's previous movements. The effectiveness of the filters has-been tested with real site videos and the results show the high prediction accuracy of the filters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This management approach privileges technical knowledge over knowledge based on workers' tacit and informal ways of knowing about H&S. The aim is to investigate the potential for participatory video to: (1) identify areas in which formal policies and procedures do not reflect H&S as practised by workers; (2) encourage creative thinking and elicit workers' ideas for H&S improvements; and (3) provide an effective mechanism for capturing and sharing tacit H&S knowledge in construction organizations. Interviews were conducted in two case study organizations (CSOs) in the Australian construction industry. The results suggest reflexive participatory video enabled workers and managers to view their work practices from a different perspective. Workers identified new hazards, reflected about the practical difficulties in performing work in accordance with documented procedures and reframed their work practices and developed safer ways of working. Workers described how the participatory video capturing the way they work enabled them to have more meaningful input into H&S decision-making than they had previously experienced. Workers also expressed a strong preference for receiving H&S information in a visual format and commented that video was better suited to communicating H&S know how' than written documents. The research is significant in providing initial evidence that participatory video has the potential to improve H&S in construction.

Psychological climate in occupational safety and health: the safety awareness of construction workers in South China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						safety awareness; physical working environment; social influence; psychological condition; construction workers	NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY; EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT; JOB CHARACTERISTICS; RISK-TAKING; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; STRESS; PERSONALITY; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENTS	The number of accidents on construction sites has been depressingly high in the last 10 years. A broad variety of safety measures have been implemented on sites, such as encouraging workers to put on personal protective equipment and launching regular safety toolboxes. This has tended to strengthen safety awareness and improved compliance with safety regulations. The study of discrepancies in psychological climate among workers and how psychological climate interacts with external factors thus plays a prime role in understanding safety. This paper examines external factors with psychological climate that the workers possess on their safety awareness. A questionnaire survey was conducted in the construction industry in South China (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). A research hypothesis model is thus developed for understanding the interrelationship among parameters with respect to workers' psychological conditions. It emerged that two external factors. physical working environment and social influence. affect psychological conditions, whereas negative affectivity, risk-taking tendency and perceived utility of safety measures affect the safety awareness of the workers. Of these, the physical working environment has the strongest influence on negative affectivity and the perceived usefulness of safety measures has the strongest influence on safety awareness.

Role of Personality in Construction Safety: Investigating the Relationships between Personality, Attentional Failure, and Hazard Identification under Fall-Hazard Conditions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Personality; Attention; Eye tracking; Hazard identification; Fall hazards; Construction safety; Big five personality	ACCIDENT INVOLVEMENT; JOB-PERFORMANCE; 5-FACTOR MODEL; CONSCIENTIOUSNESS; EXTROVERSION; PERMUTATION; NEUROTICISM; TESTS; EXTRAVERSION; METAANALYSIS	Workers' attentional failures or inattention toward detecting a hazard can lead to inappropriate decisions and unsafe behaviors. Previous research has shown that individual characteristics such as past injury exposure contribute greatly to skill-based (e.g., attention failure) and perception-based (e.g., failure to identify and misperception) errors and subsequent accident involvement. However, a dearth of research empirically examined how a worker's personality affects his or her attention and hazard identification. This study addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the impacts of the personality dimensions on the selective attention of workers exposed to fall hazards. To this end, construction workers were recruited to engage in a laboratory eye-tracking experiment that consisted of 115 potential and active fall scenarios in 35 construction images captured from actual projects within the United States. Construction workers' personalities were assessed through the self-completion of the Big Five personality questionnaire, and their visual attention was monitored continuously using a wearable eye-tracking apparatus. The results of the study show that workers' personality dimensions-specifically, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience-significantly relate to and impact attentional allocations and the search strategies of workers exposed to fall hazards. A more detailed investigation of this connection showed that individuals who are introverted, more conscientious, or more open to experience are less prone to injury and return their attention more frequently to hazardous areas. This study is the first attempt to illustrate how examining relationships among personality, attention, and hazard identification can reveal opportunities for the early detection of at-risk workers who are more likely to be involved in accidents. A better understanding of these connections provides valuable insight into both practice and theory regarding the transformation of current training and educational practices by providing appropriate intervention strategies for personalized safety guidelines and effective training materials to transform personality-driven at-risk workers into safer workers.

Automatic detection of human's falls from heights for airbag deployment via inertial measurements	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Suspended workers; Safety protection; Airbag; Fall detection	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; CLASSIFICATION; PREVENTION; BALANCE; SYSTEM	Workers in different industrial sectors, mainly in the construction and energy areas, face the daily risky situation of falling from the height accidentally, even wearing safety harnesses. To actively protect workers, a safety jacket is proposed. The jacket is equipped with an airbag cushion and an inertial measurement unit, located on the back, to sense the body motion hl. An algorithm deploys the airbag automatically for falls from heights greater than 1 m, leaving enough time for the airbag to be fully inflated. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated against experimental data collected during real falls performed by a professional stuntman, and during months of daily routine workers' life. Particular attention is devoted to the calibration of the tuning parameters, with the aim of the best trade-off between false positives' minimization, reactiveness, and robustness.

J	Fang, DP; Wu, CL; Wu, HJ				Fang, Dongping; Wu, Chunlin; Wu, Haojie			Impact of the Supervisor on Worker Safety Behavior in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Supervisory behavior; Worker safety behavior; Group-level safety climate; Construction projects; Behavior-based safety (BBS)	OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS; CLIMATE; LEADERSHIP; MODEL; INTERVENTION; PERFORMANCE; CULTURE; PERCEPTIONS; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY	As a major organizational antecedent of worker safety behavior (WSB), management behavior is drawing more and more academic attention because it tends to be the root cause of occupational safety accidents. The current behavior-based safety (BBS) practices in construction do not sufficiently take management behavior into consideration, which leads to superficial and nonpersistent intervention impacts on unsafe behavior. In academia, the relationship between management behavior and employees' individual behavior in construction has not been clearly studied and precisely depicted. This paper is aimed at discovering those management behaviors which can significantly impact worker safety behavior in construction projects and depict the exact impacting paths. Supervisors were on the focus because they interact with workers most profoundly and frequently among all levels of the management. Two dimensions of supervisory behavior were identified, namely (1) training and preventive action, and (2) reactive and supportive action. Group-level safety climate was used as the mediator along the influencing paths. A 3-month strictly controlled questionnaire survey was undertaken in the Hong Kong construction industry to collect empirical data. Results obtained from confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling showed that both direct and indirect impacts of supervisory behavior on worker safety behavior exist. Reactive and supportive action has a direct impact on worker safety behavior, but no impact on safety climate. Training and preventive action can influence different aspects of safety climate of the construction sites (like supervisory environment and workers' involvement), and thus improve safety conditions in a more profound (and comprehensive) manner than reactive and supportive action. This paper establishes the detailed empirical links among operational management behavior, group-level safety climate, and worker safety behavior in the construction settings, which can give significant insights into the development of safety management theories and practices. This can further help practitioners design enhanced BBS intervention approaches which can have a more sustainable and persistent impact on worker safety behavior. Specific recommendations and suggestions are provided for future BBS practices in construction. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ma, L; Guo, HL; Fang, YH				Ma, Ling; Guo, Hongling; Fang, Yihai			Analysis of Construction Workers' Safety Behavior Based on Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Personality Test in a Bridge Construction Project	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Safety behavior; Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI) personality; Accident loss; Safety period	VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; ACCIDENTS; MANAGEMENT; SEVERITY; INDUSTRY; SYSTEM; MODEL; STYLE	The construction industry has high accident rates, and construction workers' unsafe behavior is regarded as a major factor resulting in construction accidents. Behavioral psychology posits that human behavior is driven by psychology, and personality is one of the important psychological characteristics affecting human behavior. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the relationship between the personality and unsafe behavior of construction workers. This research explored the preliminary relationship between the personality type and unsafety behavior of construction workers, and analyzed the differences in safety performance from the perspective of personality types. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was used as the personality evaluation method, and a questionnaire was designed and distributed in a bridge construction project in Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 164 responses were collected, and 129 of them were valid. The results showed that (1) most of construction workers had a preference for extraversion (E) (63.6%), sensing (S) (62.8%), thinking (T) (73.6%), and judging (J) (61.3%); (2) ESTJ (24.8%), ESTP (where P is perceiving) (9.3%), ENTJ (where N is intuition) (9.3%), ISTJ (where I is introversion) (7.8%), and INTJ (7.8%) were the five most diverse personality types, exceeding half of the total number of survey; (3) ESTJ and ESFJ (where F is feeling) types of workers had higher average accident losses (3.6 and 4.0, respectively) than those with the other personality types (less than 2.0); and (4) ESTJ and ESFJ types of construction workers had relatively longer safe periods (3-4 and more than 4.0, respectively) as well. These findings will contribute to the body of knowledge in construction safety management, and help targeted construction worker safety training as well as on-site supervision, thus reducing the possibility of worker injury and improving the safety level on site.

Traditional behavior monitoring of construction workers relies on human interpretation to determine workers? semantic conditions (e.g., tasks performing, safety status). Although advanced sensing technologies provide more accurate quantitative data on worker behavior, how to effectively link the data to a worker?s semantic condition in a form that is understandable for humans remains a challenge. This paper proposed a novel posture coding scheme based on the worker?s body part relative position (BPRP) information. The proposed coding scheme compresses the quantitative 3D skeleton data into qualitative posture descriptions but keeps the body part relative space information. Afterward, an indoor motion test is conducted to validate the reliability of the proposed BPBR coding scheme. The test results showed that by employing the BPRP coding scheme, the manual and automatic posture coding could achieve consistent results. Therefore, the manual posture coding results can be transformed into human skeleton figures and then further processed by the quantitative algorithms. Correspondingly, the computer-captured human skeleton data can be easily connected to the manual observation results by interpreting the BPRB codes	[Chen, Hainan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Intelligent Syst Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiaowei] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiaowei] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Architecture & Civil Engn Res Ctr, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zhenhua] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI USA	Luo, XW (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.	xiaowluo@cityu.edu.hk		Zhu, Zhenhua/0000-0002-4554-1770	Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee Grant [JCYJ20180507181647320]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51778553]; Research Grant Council GrantHong Kong Research Grants Council; University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [CityU 2120641x5]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019 M663239]	This work was jointly supported by Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee Grant (PJ#JCYJ20180507181647320) , National Natural Science Foundation of China (PJ#51778553) , Research Grant Council Grant, University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, No. CityU 2120641x5, and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019 M663239) .

II: Assessing Workers' Physical Demand	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction worker physical demand; Physiological signals; Wearable biosensor; Supervised learning; Worker safety; Health and productivity; Occupational stress	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; GALVANIC SKIN-RESPONSE; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; MUSCLE FATIGUE; ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY; BODY-TEMPERATURE; FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EXERCISE; TIME	The construction industry is one of the world's most labor-intensive industries. In it, workers are challenged almost every day by highly demanding physical tasks. Although current methods [e.g., the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)] to investigate the physical demands of various tasks provide valuable information with which to evaluate certain manual handling tasks, they may be limited to consideration of unique characteristics of each individual (e.g., physiological characteristics) and environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperature and humidity). In other words, given the same task, different workers experience different levels of exertion. To address this problem, the objective of this research is to develop a procedure for automatic predictions of demand levels based on physiological signals collected from workers. To achieve the objective, workers' physiological signals were captured using a wristband-type biosensor while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various physiological responses were extracted from the artifact-corrected physiological signals. The rate of energy expenditure, estimated using an energy-expenditure prediction program (EEPP), was used as a baseline to separate tasks into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity activities. Then, a supervised-machine-learning model was trained by applying a Gaussian kernel support vector machine. The results led to a prediction accuracy of 90% in recognizing low and high physical-intensity levels and 87% for low, moderate, and high physical-intensity levels. The main contribution to the body of knowledge is the development of an automatic and noninvasive method for assessing workers' physical demands in the field. This study will contribute to improving construction workers' productivity, safety, and general well-being through the early detection of highly physically demanding tasks in the field.

To fulfill these research aims, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to explore the relationships among social capital (including the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions); safety competency; and safety behavior (i.e.,safety compliance and safety participation), considering safety competency as a mediation variable. Data on these variables were collected via questionnaires answered by 535 construction workers who participated in 93 completed building projects in China. In regard to safety behavior, only the cognitive dimension, represented by shared language and shared goals, had a significant positive effect on safety behavior. The structural dimension, which includes network ties between supervisors and workers as well as the centralization of supervisors, had a significant negative effect on safety behavior. The relational dimension, characterized by mutual trust and reciprocity norms, had no direct or indirect effect on safety behavior. For the mediation effect, the cognitive dimension had an indirect, positive effect on this variable, considering safety competency as the mediation variable; the structural and the relational dimensions did not indirectly affect safety behavior. This paper provides a theoretical basis for construction supervisors to develop measures to improve workers' safety behavior from the perspective of relationships between people, and it points out the important role of safety competency in safety behavior. Unlike assumptions, the high level of the network has a negative effect on safety behavior, which should cause supervisors to pay attention to workplace safety management. In general, this study can inform management methods for improving workers' safety behavior and on-site safety conditions from the perspective of social capital.

This paper examines the relationship between job satisfaction and quality of work-life (QWL) factors from the perspective of construction craft workers. The study analyzed data collected from 2002 to 2014 using the General Social Survey's (GSS) QWL questionnaire module. Thirty-four of the 78 QWL variables were found to have a significant correlation with the overall level of job satisfaction of construction craft workers. By using the exploratory factor analysis, five latent factorssafety priority and organizational effectiveness, fair rewards system, resource adequacy, physical and mental health, and job tenurewere extracted. The relative impact of the five latent factors on construction craft worker job satisfaction also was identified. The paper contributes to the overall body of knowledge by identifying latent factors of QWL that affect craft worker job satisfaction specific to the construction industry. The findings of the paper can serve as guidance for construction companies to formulate policies and practices that contribute to better QWL, which can result in improved craft worker job satisfaction, leading to better retention and job performance.

J	Kim, H; Kim, K; Kim, H				Kim, Hongjo; Kim, Kinam; Kim, Hyoungkwan			Vision-Based Object-Centric Safety Assessment Using Fuzzy Inference: Monitoring Struck-By Accidents with Moving Objects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Occupational safety; Construction sites; Labor; Construction equipment; Computer vision; Monitoring; Fuzzy inference	TRACKING METHODS; RISK ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION; METHODOLOGY; EQUIPMENT; EXPOSURE; WORKERS	Due to the dynamic environment of construction sites, workers are continuously confronted with the potential for safety accidents. Although various safety guidelines have been developed, workers cannot always be aware of everything that occurs around them when they focus on their work on noisy and congested job sites. Therefore, it is difficult for workers to conform to guidelines to protect themselves when confronting dangerous situations. To address this safety issue, this paper presents an on-site safety-assessment system for monitoring struck-by accidents with moving entities based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Computer vision is used to monitor a construction site and extract spatial information for each entity (workers and equipment). Next, fuzzy inference is used to assess the proper safety levels of each entity using spatial information. A safety level represents the potential hazard or the integrating danger that a person encounters at a particular moment. Struck-by accidents are selected as a target safety hazard for validation. The proposed system is expected to provide valuable information regarding worker safety represented as a numerical value. Using the record of safety levels, site managers can improve current working practices. For example, site managers can sound an alarm for workers when the safety level is too low.

J	Fuller, T; Hasan, A; Kamardeen, I				Fuller, Tamara; Hasan, Abid; Kamardeen, Imriyas			A systematic review of factors influencing the implementation of health promotion programs in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						Health promotion program; Health policy; Construction workers; Health and safety; Systematic review	WORKPLACE HEALTH; WORKERS; INTERVENTION; DIETARY; SAFETY; MANAGEMENT; ISSUES; RISK	Purpose The construction industry has a poor reputation for an unhealthy lifestyle and a high prevalence of health problems such as obesity, stress and hypertension among construction workers. The review examines the factors influencing the design and delivery of health promotion programs implemented by construction organisations to educate workers and promote a healthy lifestyle. It also identifies gaps in research and practices and proposes directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of 51 relevant journal articles published during 2010-2019 was undertaken to achieve the aim of the study. Findings The review reveals 46 different factors grouped into four major themes related to individuals, organisations, industry and the program, influencing the successful implementation of health promotion programs. The top ten most cited factors are cost, time, facilities and resources, transient workforce, delivery method, influence from managers, long working hours, masculine culture, production pressure and interest. The review also found a noticeable lack of studies on implementing health promotion programs in the context of developing countries, small and medium-sized construction organisations, residential sector workers, and construction professionals and female workers. Research limitations/implications The review's scope is limited to research on health promotion programs, and it did not investigate the factors affecting the health of construction workers in construction projects. Practical implications A better understanding of various influencing factors present at different decision levels will inform the future implementation of targeted workforce health promotion strategies to foster construction workers' health and well-being. Originality/value The review reveals bottlenecks that need to be addressed to successfully implement health promotion programs in the construction industry. It provides new insights that can improve existing health and workplace policies and health promotion programs in the construction industry. Finally, it identifies new research directions in a neglected but crucial area of workers' health and safety management.

J	Kazar, G; Comu, S				Kazar, Gokhan; Comu, Semra			Exploring the relations between the physiological factors and the likelihood of accidents on construction sites	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Occupational accidents; Construction safety; Physiology; Health; Sensors; Correlation		Purpose Construction work involves high-risk activities and requires intense focus and physical exertion. Accordingly, working conditions at construction sites contribute to physical fatigue and mental stress in workers, which is the primary cause of accidents. This study aims to examine the relation between construction accidents and physiological variables, indicative of physical fatigue and mental stress. Design/methodology/approach Four different real-time physiological values of the construction workers were measured including blood sugar level (BSL), electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) and skin temperature (ST). The data were collected from 21 different workers during the summer and winter seasons. Both seasonal and hourly correlation analyses were performed between the construction accidents and the four physiological variables gathered. Findings The analysis results demonstrate that BSL values of the workers are correlated inversely with construction accidents taking place before lunch break. In addition, except BSL a significant seasonal association between the physiological variables and construction accidents was found. Originality/value It is disclosed that variations in physiological risk factors at certain working periods pose a high risk for construction workers. Therefore, efficient work-cycle rests can be arranged to provide frequent but short breaks for workers to overcome such issues. Besides, an early warning system could be introduced to monitor the real-time physiological values of the workers.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Impact of Work Motivation on Construction Labor Productivity	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction labor productivity (CLP); Construction workers; Performance ratio; Productivity; Work motivation	PERFORMANCE; ATTITUDES	Poor performance of workers is a perennial problem for the construction industry worldwide. While there have been many studies reporting the influence of motivation on construction labor productivity (CLP), much of the evidence has been anecdotal in nature. Therefore, to address this gap, the objective of this study is to explore the relationships between the work motivation of workers and their productivity. The work-motivation scale was adopted for measuring the work motivation of 116 construction workers from 4 construction sites in India. Then, using nonlinear regression analysis, the relationship among their observed productivity and their motivation was established. The study reveals that amotivation, extrinsic regulation (social), introjected regulation, and identified regulation affect CLP. On the other hand, extrinsic regulation (material) and intrinsic motivation do not influence CLP substantially. The study also concludes that by increasing the motivation of workers, their productivity and their probability of staying and working at one particular site increase substantially. In this way, the findings can help training providers focus on and improve the significant motivational attributes of workers influencing CLP at construction sites.

Impact of Construction Workers' Hazard Identification Skills on Their Visual Attention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard identification skill; Eye-tracking technology; Human error; Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA); Labor and personnel issues	HUMAN ERROR-PROBABILITY; EYE TRACKING; PERCEPTION; DRIVERS; SAFETY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; AWARENESS; YOUNGER	Eye-movement metrics have been shown to correlate with attention and, therefore, represent a means of identifying and analyzing an individual's cognitive processes. Human errors-such as failure to identify a hazard-are often attributed to a worker's lack of attention. Piecemeal attempts have been made to investigate the potential of harnessing eye movements as predictors of human error (e. g., failure to identify a hazard) in the construction industry, although more attempts have investigated human error via subjective measurements. To address this knowledge gap, the present study harnessed eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impacts of workers' hazard-identification skills on their attentional distributions and visual search strategies. To achieve this objective, an experiment was designed in which the eye movements of 31 construction workers were tracked while they searched for hazards in 35 randomly ordered construction scenario images. Workers were then divided into three groups on the basis of their hazard identification performance. Three fixation-related metrics-fixation count, dwell-time percentage, and run count-were analyzed during the eye-tracking experiment for each group (low, medium, and high hazard-identification skills) across various types of hazards. Then, multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of workers' hazard-identification skills on their visual attention. To further investigate the effect of hazard identification skills on the dependent variables (eye movement metrics), two distinct processes followed: separate ANOVAs on each of the dependent variables, and a discriminant function analysis. The analyses indicated that hazard identification skills significantly impact workers' visual search strategies: workers with higher hazard-identification skills had lower dwell-time percentages on ladder-related hazards; higher fixation counts on fall-to-lower-level hazards; and higher fixation counts and run counts on fall-protection systems, struck-by, housekeeping, and all hazardous areas combined. Among the eye-movement metrics studied, fixation count had the largest standardized coefficient in all canonical discriminant functions, which implies that this eye-movement metric uniquely discriminates workers with high hazard-identification skills and at-risk workers. Because discriminant function analysis is similar to regression, discriminant function (linear combinations of eye-movement metrics) can be used to predict workers' hazard-identification capabilities. In conclusion, this study provides a proof of concept that certain eyemovement metrics are predictive indicators of human error due to attentional failure. These outcomes stemmed from a laboratory setting, and, foreseeably, safety managers in the future will be able to use these findings to identify at-risk construction workers, pinpoint required safety training, measure training effectiveness, and eventually improve future personal protective equipment to measure construction workers' situation awareness in real time.

Nevertheless, only a few studies have been conducted to analyze workers' well-being within this sector. Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources model, this study aimed to investigate whether job resources (i.e. job control and supervisor support) could independently buffer the relationship between job demands (i.e. workload, emotional demands and work pace) and psycho-physical health among alpine transit tunnel construction employees. 96 workers employed in an Italian construction company filled in anonymous self-report questionnaires investigating: job demands, job resources and psycho-physical health. Descriptive analyses, analyses of variance and structural equation models were carried out. Workers who perceived higher job control and supervisor support were less likely to experience psycho-physical malaise, even in presence of high workload and work pace. Fostering job resources is crucial to design interventions aimed at maintaining or improving construction workers' well-being.

Fatalities among Civil Infrastructure Workers: Variable Annuity with Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits Approach	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Workers; Fatalities; Finance; Options theory; Variable annuities	MORAL HAZARD; VALUATION; OPTIONS; INSURANCE	Many studies are concerned with monitoring, evaluating, expanding, repairing, replacing, financing, or otherwise sustaining the civil infrastructure. Few studies address the ongoing and evolving financial problems associated with the workers responsible for developing civil infrastructure development. According to U. S. federal statistics, civil infrastructure activities are responsible for 22% of all work-related fatalities-the highest among all industries. In 2008, 429,000 nonfatal injuries and 1,005 fatal injuries were recorded on job sites. However, civil infrastructure workers still have some of the weakest coverage of health and retirement benefits. It is crucial to have a strong system that protects workers and their families in cases of work-related fatal and nonfatal injuries. This paper developed a financial model incorporating a variable annuity embedded with guaranteed minimum death benefits. The model is based on the principles of insurance pricing, option theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and actuarial science. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the benefits of the utilized technique to employees and employers. If purchased at the age of 18, a reasonable average age for workers to start their career in the industry, coverage of $50,000 or $1,000,000 requires only annual payments of $73.47 and $1,469.50, respectively. The model provides numerical assessment for civil infrastructure fatalities by determining the risk charge equating cost and benefits for the insured workers. Furthermore, the same technique might be extended towards hedging strategies that provide income guarantees for unemployed workers. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000105.

Mental Models of Construction Workers for Safety-Sign Representation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction worker; Safety sign; Ergonomics; Mental model; Safety intervention; Labor and personnel issues	USER FACTORS; OCCUPATIONAL-SAFETY; TRAINING METHODS; DESIGN; IMAGERY; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; SUPPORT; INJURY	Previous studies have found that construction workers have considerable difficulties in safety-sign comprehension. This research examines the mental models of construction workers regarding safety-sign representations, and how user factors and referent characteristics affects these mental models. Twenty-two Hong Kong Chinese construction workers drew their mental models (pictures of the perceptions that came to mind) for 12 sign referents and described verbally their drawings. The influences of the four referent characteristics to mental model formation were not equivalent. Concreteness was the best predictor, followed by ease of visualization, familiarity, and context availability. The higher the visual imagery vividness of construction workers, the higher the proportion of their mental models for sign referents that were recognized as stereotypes. Other user factors had no significant effect on mental model formation. This knowledge of how user mental models of sign referents and how the representation was built in user minds would be beneficial for practitioners to enable better processing and practicing mental model approaches to safety-signs design for use in sites.

Automatic Recognition of Workers' Motions in Highway Construction by Using Motion Sensors and Long Short-Term Memory Networks	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction worker; Motion recognition; Monitoring; Deep learning; Long short-term memory	BODY	Monitoring and understanding construction workers' behavior and working conditions are essential to achieve success in construction projects. The dynamic nature of construction sites has heightened the awareness of the need for improved monitoring of individual workers on sites. Although several studies indicated promising results in automated motion and activity recognition using wearable motion sensors, their technical and practical feasibility was not properly validated at actual job sites. Motion recognition models have to be evaluated in actual conditions because the motion sensor data collected in controlled conditions, and actual conditions can have different characteristics. This study proposes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for recognizing construction workers' motions. The LSTM networks were validated through case studies in one bridge construction site and two road pavement sites. The LSTM networks indicated classification accuracies of 97.6%, 95.93%, and 97.36% from three different field test sites, respectively. Through the case studies, the technical and practical feasibility of the LSTM networks was properly investigated. With LSTM networks, individual workers' behavior and working conditions are expected to be automatically monitored and managed without excessive manual observation.

One major trend in construction research is quantitatively evaluating workers' psychophysiological states. With the advances in wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices, such assessment can be possible by interpreting workers' brainwave patterns. However, the recorded EEG signals are highly contaminated with signal noises, particularly ocular-related artifacts generated from blinking and eye movement. Although most of the noise can be suppressed by well-established filtering techniques, ocular artifacts cannot be eliminated easily and automatically by conventional techniques. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a procedure to reduce ocular artifacts by integrating dependence component analysis, image processing, and machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrated the potential of the proposed procedure to produce high-quality EEG signals accurately, continuously, and automatically during construction operations. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by overcoming the barriers to reliable translation of EEG signals in numerous construction-related investigations, especially those that add substantially to the understanding of the effect of workplace stressors on workers' health and safety.

The construction sample showed higher mean scores for time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based work-interference with family (WIF) than scores reported in international studies that have used the multidimensional scale. Waged construction workers, who work on-site in direct construction activity, reported higher levels of time-based and strain-based WIF than salaried workers, who work predominantly in office-based roles. Mean levels of family-interference with work (FIW) in the construction sample were generally comparable to levels reported in previous research. A principal components analysis revealed four clear dimensions of WFC. These dimensions were significantly correlated with other variables of theoretical relevance indicating acceptable criterion validity. The experience of WIF varied by workers' employment situation, sex, and work location, while the experience of FIW varied by workers' age. The results suggest that the use of global measures of WFC might mask important differences in construction workers' experiences at the work-family interface.

Exploring Training Needs and Development of Construction Language Courses for American Supervisors and Hispanic Craft Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CULTURE; HEALTH; SAFETY	This study explores the training needs of American supervisors and Hispanic construction craft workers and describes the development, delivery, and evaluation of construction-focused training courses intended to facilitate accommodation for American supervisors and assimilation of Hispanic craft workers to the United States (U.S.) industry. A survey was conducted to better understand the adaptation issues between American supervisors and their Hispanic craft workers. As a result of the survey, two unique construction language courses were developed: English as a second language (ESL) and Spanish as a second language (SSL) for construction. Evaluation feedback from initial course offerings suggest that they were useful in terms of increased confidence and improved ability to communicate. It is anticipated that the courses developed and the training provided will improve the communication channels between American supervisors and Hispanic workers, as well as strengthen the supervisor-worker relationship as the American supervisor grows aware of the existent communication differences. A model for transferring these research findings to other cultural groups and a technology-based approach for delivering these courses to the construction site are also discussed.

Managing Cultural Diversity at US Construction Sites: Hispanic Workers' Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor and personnel issues; Active culture difference; Hispanic workers; The construction industry; Safety management; Leading indicator	UNITED-STATES; SAFETY; FATALITIES; WORKPLACE; WORKFORCE; HEALTH	Communication on construction sites is crucial for improving overall construction performance. Cultural barriers influence the clarity of communication between construction supervisors and Hispanic workers on U.S. construction sites, which affects safety performance. In this study, Hispanic workers' perspectives regarding active cultural differences (ACD) were collected, analyzed, and compared to supervisors' perspectives and responses that were reported earlier. The results confirmed the existence of three active cultural differences: high power distance, collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Although the goal of the study was primarily to investigate active cultural differences, the results revealed additional important factors that affect Hispanic construction workers, such as daily work conditions, the effectiveness of government agencies' regulations, workers' legal status, and reporting nonsevere injuries. Very few, if any, empirical studies have focused on cultural diversity on U.S. construction sites. Therefore this study provides a meaningful understanding of the nature and influence of cultural differences, which in turn helps construction supervisors manage their diverse workforce as well as aids future research studies that are focused on cultural diversity.

Perceiving Interactions on Construction Safety Behaviors: Workers' Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety behaviors; Explanatory factor analysis (EFA); Structural equation model (SEM); Construction safety; Questionnaire	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; CLIMATE; SYSTEM; RISK; INVARIANCE; LEADERSHIP; HEALTH; IMPACT	This paper presents a systematic approach that incorporates structural equation modeling (SEM) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to perceive and verify causal-relationships and interactions between enablers and goals of construction workers' safety behaviors (CWSB). A sample of 450 questionnaire surveys regarding CWSB was collected from construction workers in several Chinese construction companies. EFA was used to extract eight common factors in order to identify the model structure among 28 questionnaire items. Then, SEM was employed to investigate the interrelationships among variables in the hypothesized safety behavior model. The built causal model was verified in terms of the hypothesis test and goodness-of-fit test. The impact of the path coefficient on CWSB was investigated and analyzed in detail. Results indicate that management-oriented supervision and system (F3) and leadership (F8) exert obvious positive impacts on CWSB in accordance with the path coefficients analysis, whereas psychological workers' condition (F5) and workplace conditions (F6) exert obvious negative influences. Individual differences among workers (F2) do not perform statistically significantly with workers' safety behaviors. The developed approach is capable of revealing causal-relationships, testing hypothesized models, and determining leading factors in complex project environments. This research provides insights into cause-effect relationships among the workers' perceived influential factors and goals, and the results can be used to understand the factors that the construction workers perceive as important factors in safety behaviors. This can further provide decision support on the improvement of construction safety performance in the context of the Chinese construction industry.

Many previous studies relied on interviews and/or questionnaire to assess physical fatigue in construction workers. However, these traditional methods are not only time-consuming but also limited by recall bias. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have used physiological metrics (e.g., heart rate, heart-rate variability, skin temperature, electromyographic activity, and jerk metrics) to measure real-time physical fatigue. Although physiological metrics have shown promising results for real-time assessments of physical fatigue, no state-of-the-art review has been conducted to summarize various physiological metrics in measuring physical fatigue among construction workers. Therefore, the current state-of-the art review aims to summarize existing evidence regarding the use of physiological metrics to measure physical fatigue of construction workers in real-time. This review used systematic searches to identify relevant studies and critically appraised the application of physiological metrics in measuring physical fatigue of construction workers. First, it summarizes the application of various physiological metrics for real-time measurement of physical fatigue in construction workers. Second, various wearable sensing technologies for measuring physiological metrics are identified. Third, this review discusses the potential challenges for applying physiological metrics to measure physical fatigue. Finally, future research directions to advance the development and adoption of various physiological metrics to monitor and mitigate physical fatigue in construction workers are discussed.

Comprehensive Fall-Risk Assessment of Construction Workers Using Inertial Measurement Units: Validation of the Gait-Stability Metric to Assess the Fall Risk of Iron Workers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fall risk; Gait-stability metrics; Quantitative measures; Maximum Lyapunov exponents; Inertial measurement units	LOCAL DYNAMIC STABILITY; KINEMATIC VARIABILITY; SPACE RECONSTRUCTION; SAFETY; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; MANAGEMENT; FATALITIES; TRACKING; INDUSTRY	In construction worksites, slips, trips, and falls are major causes of fatal injuries. This fact demonstrates the need for a safety assessment method that provides a comprehensive fall-risk analysis inclusive of the effects of physiological characteristics of construction workers. In this context, this research tests the usefulness of the maximum Lyapunov exponents (Max LE) as a metric to assess construction workers' comprehensive fall risk. Max LE, one of the gait-stability metrics established in clinical settings, estimates how the stability of a construction worker reacts to very small disruptions. In order to validate the use of Max LE, a laboratory experiment that asked a group of subjects to simulate iron workers' walking tasks on an I-beam was designed and conducted. These tasks were designed to showcase various fall-risk profiles: walking with a comfortable walking speed presented a low fall-risk profile; carrying a one-sided load and walking at a faster speed on the I-beam both presented high fall-risk profiles. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors were attached to the right ankle of participants' bodies to collect kinematic data for the calculation of Max LE. The results showed that Max LE offers adequate distinguishing power for characterizing the fall risk of various construction workers' tasks, and the introduced approach to compute the gait stability from IMU sensor data captured from human bodies could provide a valuable analysis of the safety-related risks present in construction workers' motions.

The modified theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was proposed by using attitudinal ambivalence to replace univalent safety attitude. Empirical data were collected from 229 construction workers in China using a detailed questionnaire. Both situational and routine safety violations were considered in this model. The results showed that LMX had significant effects on both types of safety violations through three mediators from the modified TPB framework. Specifically, attitudinal ambivalence and group safety norm mediated the relationships between LMX and both types workers' safety violations. However, perceived behavioural control only mediated the relationship between LMX and individuals' routine safety violations. Furthermore, this research supported the distinctions between situational and routine safety violations. The indirect effects of LMX on individuals' situational safety violations took place mainly through group safety norm. By contrast, the indirect effects on individuals' routine safety violations took place mainly through attitudinal ambivalence and perceived behavioural control. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications, research limitations, and future directions were discussed. The results provide some meaningful insights into how to improve safety compliance behaviours from the perspective of supervisor-worker relationships.

Linear programming approach to optimize strategic investment in the construction workforce	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; optimization; training; employees; computer programming		The construction industry in the United States and other parts of the world has been facing several challenges, including a shortage of skilled workers. A review of the relevant body of knowledge indicates that one of the key reasons for this problem is the absence of human resource management strategies for construction workers at project, corporate, regional, or industry levels. This paper addresses the issues of workforce training and allocation on construction projects. It presents a framework to optimize the investment in, and to make the best use of, the available workforce with the intent to reduce project costs and improve schedule performance. A linear program model, entitled the Optimal Workforce Investment Model, is built to provide an optimization-based framework for matching supply and demand of construction labor most efficiently through training, recruitment, and allocation. Given a project schedule or demand profile and the available pool of workers, the suggested model provides human resource managers a combined strategy for training the available workers and hiring additional workers. The input data to the proposed model consists of a certain available labor pool, cost figures for training workers in different skills, the cost of hiring workers, hourly labor wages, and estimates of affinities between the different considered skills. The objective of the model is to minimize labor costs while satisfying project labor demands. Results from application of the model to typical situations are presented, and recommendations for future developments are made.

To prevent collisions between workers and machines in excavation site construction, a real-time intelligent evaluation system to reflect worker-machine safety status was developed. The system included: (1) determination of the key factors affecting the safety of the interactive operation between workers and machines; (2) extraction of precursor semantic information related to the safety assessment for each object in the construction site based on machine vision; and (3) assessment of the safety state of a monitored object using a fuzzy neural network. A case study of excavation site construction is presented to illustrate and verify the entire process of safety assessment using the developed framework. The results show that the proposed model achieves high detection rates: 96% and 94% for tracking accuracy and 91.67% for prediction accuracy.

J	Park, MW; Brilakis, I				Park, Man-Woo; Brilakis, Ioannis			Continuous localization of construction workers via integration of detection and tracking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker; Computer vision; Tracking; Detection; Occlusion; Site monitoring	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEM	Tracking construction workers onsite yields trajectory data that can be very useful in safety and productivity monitoring. Tracking via cameras and computer vision-based methods is one of the tracking options available and deemed suitable for worker tracking in congested outdoor environments. However, this option has yet to yield a practical, robust solution, because of its poor performance in handling occlusions and maintaining trajectories over time. This is due, on one hand, to the tracking methods' degeneracy issues, and the use of detection methods only for initializing trackers. On the other hand, detection methods alone are unable to yield robust trajectories because they treat each frame independently and do not account for temporal effects. Furthermore, no detection method satisfies high performance requirements in both precision and recall. Higher precision entails lower recall. False positives or false negatives limit practical applications. To resolve these issues, this paper presents a hybrid method for locating construction workers that fuses tracking and detection together throughout the tracking process. The detection method is designed to hit higher precision while the tracking method supplements the reduced lower recall. Tracking allows entity matching across frames producing trajectories for all identified workers, while tracking of an occluded worker is automatically terminated and resumed when the occlusion gets cleared. Experimental tests on onsite videos demonstrate that the proposed combination improves overall tracking performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	He, CQ; McCabe, B; Jia, GS; Sun, JD				He, Changquan; McCabe, Brenda; Jia, Guangshe; Sun, Jide			Effects of Safety Climate and Safety Behavior on Safety Outcomes between Supervisors and Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety climate; Safety behavior; Safety outcome; Construction workers; Comparative analysis; Social identity	GROUP SELF-ESTEEM; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; INDIVIDUAL SAFETY; DISTINCT ASPECTS; GENERAL-APPROACH; SOCIAL IDENTITY; HEALTH OUTCOMES; INDUSTRY; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	Safety climate and safety performance in construction projects vary at an organization level and group level. However, the differences between supervisors and construction workers are rarely examined. This study compared the safety climate, safety behavior (safety compliance and safety participation), and safety outcomes (injuries, unsafe events, and stress) between these two social groups. The relationships among these variables were also contrasted with each other using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The data were collected from 119 supervisors and 536 site workers at 22 construction projects in China. The results show that four dimensions of safety climate were distinctly different between supervisors and workers, which is consistent with the social identity theory. Two dimensions of the supervisors' safety behavior were significantly better than those of the workers' behavior, while supervisors suffered higher stress. The relationships between safety climate and safety behavior were positively associated for both groups. However, the links from safety climate to safety outcomes and from safety behavior to safety outcomes significantly differed between supervisors and construction workers, which revealed a complementation phenomenon. This study sheds light on group-level safety performance research. It also suggests that safety professionals should take group-targeted safety intervention measures and pay more attention to supervisors' psychological well-being.

With the development of wearable sensing technologies, many researchers developed kinematic sensor-based worker activity recognition methods with considerable accuracy. However, the limitations of the previous studies remain at the challenge of using smartphones for practical implementation, fewer classified activities, and limited recognized motions and body parts. This study proposes an ANN-based automated construction worker activity recognition method that can recognize complex construction activities. The proposed methodology discusses data acquisition, data fusion, and artificial neural network (ANN) model development. A case study of scaffold builder activities was investigated to validate the proposed methodology's feasibility and evaluate its performance compared to other existing methods. The results show that the proposed model can recognize fifteen scaffold builder activities with an accuracy of 94% with 0.94 weighted precision, recall, and F1 Score.

A framework has been developed by establishing a benchmark of the critical motivational attributes found in Current management practices. The framework facilitates devising appropriate schemes by incorporating socio-economic motivational factors in overall decision-making processes. A total of 25 influencing parameters have been identified to study the relationships and impacts of worker motivation in selected Construction projects. Based oil the user's preferences and knowledge base from past projects, a ranking of these attributes has been established in the order of relative importance in motivating workers to optimum productivity. Statistical analysis Such as factor analysis has been performed oil these motivational project attributes and four major factors have been extracted. Further analysis indicates that the most critical motivational factor associated with worker productivity is the basic work environment and employment contract, which comprises 12 major subfactors.

J	Park, MW; Brilakis, I				Park, Man-Woo; Brilakis, Ioannis			Construction worker detection in video frames for initializing vision trackers	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Construction worker; Detection; Tracking; Remote sensing; Image processing; Computer vision	TRACKING	Monitoring the location of resources on large scale, congested, outdoor sites can be performed more efficiently with vision tracking, as this approach does not require any pre-tagging of resources. However, the greatest impediment to the use of vision tracking in this case is the lack of detection methods that are needed to automatically mark the resources of interest and initiate the tracking. This paper presents such a novel method for construction worker detection that localizes construction workers in video frames. The proposed method exploits motion, shape, and color cues to narrow down the detection regions to moving objects, people, and finally construction workers, respectively. The three cues are characterized by using background subtraction, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the HSV color histogram. The method has been tested on videos taken in various environments. The results demonstrate its suitability for automatic initialization of vision trackers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Namian, M; Taherpour, F; Ghiasvand, E; Turkan, Y				Namian, Mostafa; Taherpour, Farshid; Ghiasvand, Ebrahim; Turkan, Yelda			Insidious Safety Threat of Fatigue: Investigating Construction Workers' Risk of Accident Due to Fatigue	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fatigue; Construction Safety; Hazard recognition; Safety risk perception; OFER scale	ASSESSMENT SCALE; HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; WORKING PEOPLE; PERCEPTION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	The construction industry is among the most hazardous occupations. Workers are expected to fulfill physically and mentally demanding tasks in construction environments while they are exposed to numerous safety hazards. The dynamic and demanding nature of construction activities makes workers vulnerable to experience levels of fatigue on a daily basis. Fatigue is ubiquitous among construction workers and has been frequently cited as an underlying cause of the accidents. Despite the high rates of accidents in construction, research has shown that most of them can be prevented if workers identify hazards and perceive the associated safety risks. However, the impact of fatigue on the two leading safety indicators (i.e., hazard recognition and safety risk perception) has not been empirically studied before in the construction industry context. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of fatigue on construction workers' hazard recognition and safety risk perception. To achieve the research goals, 135 construction workers were recruited to participate in the study. A validated safety instrument and three subjective fatigue assessment scales were used to measure safety performance and fatigue levels of the participants, respectively. The analysis of the data showed statistically significant correlation (p-value<0.001) between fatigue and hazard recognition (rp=-0.58) and fatigue and safety risk perception (rp=-0.51). Linear regressions associated 37% of the variability in hazard recognition and 28% of safety risk perception with elements of fatigue. The findings revealed that among all aspects of fatigue, intershift recovery and acute fatigue have the most profound impacts on the safety performance of workers. A novel model was developed and tested to explain how construction workers' safety performance (i.e., hazard recognition and safety risk perception) are impacted by elements of fatigue. This study offers practical recommendations for construction professionals and practitioners to control and mitigate the undesirable influences of fatigue on workers. These recommendations are presented as the hierarchy of fatigue interventions in the order of most effective to the least effective including (1) Elimination, (2) Substitution, (3) Engineering Solutions, (4) Administrative Interventions, and (5) Personal Assistive Equipment (PAE).

Many studies suggest such pre-service fatigue can result in poor working performance and high casualty risks among construction workers. To ensure workers are well-rested before duties, contractors initiate various pre-service fatigue screening approaches. Traditional screening highly relies on the site managers' subjective judgment and workers' physical appearances due to the lack of practical, objective, and automated fatigue assessment tools. In addition, compared with physical fatigue, mental fatigue is even more difficult to be recognized merely through observation. This research proposes a novel screening method capable of measuring workers' mental fatigue with wearable electroencephalography (EEG) equipment. Through analyzing the EEG spectral parameters, such as gravity frequency and power spectral entropy, this study implemented four assessing indicators and developed a quantitative method to assess a subject's mental fatigue level. To verify the proposed method, an in-lab fatigue test was conducted. The experiment results reported that the screening targets can be successfully identified by comparing their test performance and reaction time.

Using a multiwave survey conducted in the Philippines, this paper investigated the interactive effects of construction workers' perceptions of supportive leadership and top management teams' charismatic vision on their job satisfaction, retention intentions, and actual retention. The results revealed that workers are more satisfied with their jobs when they perceive their supervisors as supportive. Job satisfaction, in turn, increased their retention intentions and actual retention behavior. Top management teams' charismatic vision further enhanced these mediated relationships. Thus, to maintain a stable workforce, construction organizations are advised to invest resources (e.g.,establishing education and mentoring programs) in developing supervisors' supportive leadership skills, ensure the top management team communicates clear organizational vision, and regularly monitor construction workers' job satisfaction. This research adds to the literature focusing on the antecedents of construction workers' behavioral and performance outcomes by empirically examining the effect of supervisors' supportive leadership as well as the critical role of top management team charismatic vision.

J	Sherratt, F				Sherratt, Fred			Shaping the discourse of worker health in the UK construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; construction worker; critical discourse analysis; occupational health; public health	PUBLIC-HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; SAFETY	The UK construction industry is in poor health, statistics show rates of occupational illness significantly higher than for workers in any other industry. Recently, the scope of occupational health management on large sites has increased as public health has become included within the organizational remit. Concerns have been raised around the consequences of this development, its close relationships to Corporate Social Responsibility, and how this is now shaping the wider discourse. To explore this phenomenon, a critical discourse analysis of UK "construction worker health" has been carried out, using the public-facing data of ten large UK contractors. Findings show that "public" has now overtaken "occupational", the latter restricted to legal compliance presented as corporate citizenship, the former championed as evidence of benevolent organizational values. Yet public health concerns are limited to those of lifestyle and individual responsibility, whilst more complex issues around the social determinants of health as associated with work are missing from the discourse, separating organizations from the impacts of their work on their workers. A contemporary mapping of "construction worker health" is developed for consideration by industry and academics to support future health initiatives and research.

To address this, organizations have implemented behavioural health promotion programmes. However, targeting workers' lifestyle behaviour without addressing relevant environmental factors is unlikely to produce significant or sustained improvement. An ecological perspective offers a different way of understanding the determinants of health, reflecting the interplay of factors at multiple levels and the dynamic, reciprocal and non-linear relationships between them. Qualitative data collected during focus groups and in interviews with workers and managers were analysed to explore factors impacting the effectiveness of a health promotion programme implemented at two work sites in Queensland, Australia. A qualitative causal loop diagram identifying determinants of construction workers' health behaviour was developed. The findings suggest that the adoption of healthy behaviours is influenced by factors operating at and between individual, family, workplace and industry levels. These factors suggest key leverage points that can be addressed in the design of future health promotion interventions for the construction industry. The research provides qualitative evidence of the need to consider workers' health in a holistic way and develop multi-level strategies to produce improved health behaviour and outcomes in the construction industry.

J	Namian, M; Albert, A; Feng, J				Namian, Mostafa; Albert, Alex; Feng, Jing			Effect of Distraction on Hazard Recognition and Safety Risk Perception	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard recognition; Hazard identification; Safety risk perception; Distraction; Injury prevention	DRIVER DISTRACTION; CONSTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; WORK	Both hazard recognition and safety risk perception are fundamental to effective safety management. When construction hazards remain unrecognized or the associated safety risk remains unperceived, the likelihood of human errors and injuries increases. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that a large number of construction hazards remain unrecognized in typical workplaces. Likewise, past research has demonstrated that safety risk is widely underestimated in construction. Therefore, to improve safety performance, a proper understanding of factors that influence hazard recognition and safety risk perception is vital. Toward achieving this goal, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of distractionswhich are ubiquitous in construction environmentson the hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception of workers. The study goals are accomplished through an experimental effort involving 70 construction workers representing various specialty trades. The workers were randomly assigned to a distracted or undistracted condition, and their hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception levels were measured using construction case images. The study findings revealed that the distracted workers recognized a smaller proportion of hazards compared with undistracted workers. However, there were no significant differences in the level of perceived safety risk between the two groups. A closer examination of the data revealed that the safety risk perception levels for the undistracted workers are positively related to their hazard recognition performance. In other words, when undistracted workers recognize a larger proportion of hazards, they also perceive higher levels of safety risk. However, no such relationship was observed for the distracted workers, suggesting that the perceived risk was unrelated to or not dependent on their hazard recognition performance. The findings suggest that workplace distractions can adversely affect hazard recognition, safety risk perception, and safety performance. Given that constuction workers are already exposed to numerous distractors in typical workplaces, contractors seeking to introduce emerging technologies such as drones, mobile devices, and smart robots must be cognizant of their potential distracting effects. The current study represents the first empirical effort investigating the effect of workplace distraction on construction hazard recognition and safety risk perception.

J	Memarzadeh, M; Golparvar-Fard, M; Niebles, JC				Memarzadeh, Milad; Golparvar-Fard, Mani; Carlos Niebles, Juan			Automated 2D detection of construction equipment and workers from site video streams using histograms of oriented gradients and colors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Histogram of oriented gradients; Support vector machine; HSV colors; Resource tracking; Performance monitoring	PROJECT PERFORMANCE CONTROL; TRACKING	This paper presents a computer vision based algorithm for automated 2D detection of construction workers and equipment from site video streams. The state-of-the-art research proposes semi-automated detection methods for tracking of construction workers and equipment. Considering the number of active equipment and workers on jobsites and their frequency of appearance in a camera's field of view, application of semi-automated techniques can be time-consuming. To address this limitation, a new algorithm based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Colors (HOG + C) is proposed. Our proposed detector uses a single sliding window at multiple scales to identify the potential candidates for the location of equipment and workers in 2D. Each detection window is first divided into small spatial regions and then the gradient orientations and hue-saturation colors are locally histogrammed and concatenated to form the HOG + C descriptors. Tiling the sliding detection window with a dense and overlapping grid of formed descriptors and using a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each resource enables automated 20 detection of workers and equipment. A new comprehensive benchmark dataset containing over 8000 annotated video frames including equipment and workers from different construction projects is introduced. This dataset contains a large range of pose, scale, background, illumination, and occlusion variation. Our preliminary results on detection of standing workers, excavators and dump trucks with an average accuracy of 98.83%, 82.10%, and 84.88% respectively indicate the applicability of the proposed method for automated activity analysis of workers and equipment from single video cameras. Unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms in automated resource tracking, this method particularly detects idle resources and does not need manual or semi-automated initialization of the resource locations in 2D video frames. The experimental results and the perceived benefits of the proposed method are discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A participatory action research (PAR) project was undertaken at construction sites in Queensland, Australia. Using the PAR framework, a needs-based health promotion planning model was implemented. Health promotion measures were designed to address the 'SNAPO' health risk factors (i.e. smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, insufficient physical exercise and overweight/obesity). At the largest site participating in the research, preliminary health assessments revealed levels of physical health that were comparable with those of the general Australian population. The construction workers' mental health was poorer than that of the general Australian population. A consultation workshop with a representative group of workers at the site identified healthy eating, smoking cessation and physical exercise as priority areas for intervention. Several health promotion measures addressing these issues were implemented, including a quit smoking programme, a 'healthy options' menu in the site canteen, healthy eating and cooking workshops and onsite yoga and stretching sessions. A subset of workers at the site reported their health behaviour in weekly 'logs'. The log data revealed fluctuations in health behaviour over a 14-week period. Evaluation interviews and a focus group revealed environmental impediments to the adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviours. Workers identified the need to provide a work environment that is supportive of healthy behaviour as critical to the effectiveness of specific health promotion measures.

Using the Thermal Work Limit as an Environmental Determinant of Heat Stress for Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Heat-stress model; Tolerance; Outdoor; Heat stroke; Rebar workers	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; HYDRATION STATUS; EXERCISE; INDEX; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; TOLERANCE; EXERTION; LESSONS; COMFORT	Construction workers are vulnerable to heat stress in summer as evidenced by deaths and injuries caused by heat stroke. Over the past centuries, many heat-stress indices have been developed to assist with the management of these problems. To address this pressing need of the industry, an enhanced model based on a multi-dimensional environmental indicator, the thermal work limit (TWL) index, is developed. Field studies were conducted between July and September 2010 in Hong Kong on ten apparently healthy and experienced construction rebar workers. Based upon 281 sets of synchronized meteorological and physiological data collected from four different construction sites, physiological, work-related, environmental, and personal parameters were measured to construct the heat-stress model. Multiple linear regression showed that a total of ten determining factors are able to predict the workers' subjective rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (adjusted R2=0.79, p<0.05). The accuracy of the TWL heat-stress model was found to be statistically acceptable (mean absolute percentage error = 4.3%, Theil's U inequality coefficient = 0.003). Alcohol-drinking habits, age, and work duration are the three most important predictors to determine the physiological responses of construction workers. The model reported in this paper provides a scientific prediction of the reality, which may benefit the construction industry to produce solid guidelines for workers working in hot weather.

Work sampling is a widely used method for this task, while suffers from low efficiency as only one worker is selected for each observation. Attentional selection asymmetry can also bias its uniform object selection assumption. Existing vision-based methods are primarily oriented towards recognizing single, separated activities involving few workers or equipment. In this paper, we introduce an activity recognition method, which receives surveillance videos as input and produces diverse and continuous activity labels of individual workers in the field of view. Convolutional networks are used to recognize activities, which are encoded in spatial and temporal streams. A new fusion strategy is developed to combine the recognition results of the two streams. The experimental results show that our activity recognition method has achieved an average accuracy of 80.5%, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art of activity recognition in the computer vision community, given the severe camera motion and low resolution of site surveillance videos and the marginal inter-class difference and significant infra-class variation of workers' activities. We also demonstrate that our method can underpin the implementation of efficient and objective work sampling. The training and test datasets of the study are publicly available.

The effect of interactions among different workers as well as the factors affecting the workers' learning behavior is assessed using the proposed ABM approach. Design/methodology/approach - For this purpose, the processes through which the competency value of worker is changed are understood and the workers' learning behavior is modeled, taking account of various influencing factors such as knowledge flow, social ability to teach and forgetting factor. Findings - The proposed model is implemented on a real steel structure project to evaluate its applicability and performance. The variation in the competency value of different workers involved in the project is simulated over time taking account of all the influencing factors using the proposed ABM approach. Practical implications - In order to assess the effect of interactions among welders as well as the welders' characteristics on their learning behavior, the competence value of different welders is evaluated. Originality/value - This research presents an ABM approach to investigate the workers' learning behavior. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ABM approach, it was implemented on a real steel structure project. The learning behavior of different welders (agents) was simulated taking account of their interactions as well as the factors affecting the welders' learning behavior. The project involved the welding of a 240-ton steel structure. The initial project duration was estimated as 100 days. In this project, it has been planned to execute the welding process using three different welders namely welder A, B and C.

J	Hwang, S; Seo, J; Jebelli, H; Lee, S				Hwang, Sungjoo; Seo, JoonOh; Jebelli, Houtan; Lee, SangHyun			Feasibility analysis of heart rate monitoring of construction workers using a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor embedded in a wristband-type activity tracker	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction worker; Heart rate; Occupational health; Remote sensing; Work physiology	ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; STRAIN; EXERCISE; RESERVE; TIME	With increasing concerns regarding occupational safety and health, managing excessive physical workloads of workers is critical to prevent workers' fatigue, injuries, errors, or accidents at physically demanding workplaces such as construction. In this regard, heart rate (HR) is an effective physiological indicator of workers' physical demands. Currently, off-the-shelf wearable activity trackers (e.g., wristband-type) can monitor a worker's HR with its embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. However, PPG signals can be highly affected by signal noises resulted from user's movements, and thus the exact HR extraction from a wristband-type PPG may not be sufficiently accurate during intensive construction tasks. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a PPG sensor embedded in a wristband-type tracker to see if it can be used for construction. Through field data collection from seven construction workers, we conduct a comparative HR analysis between a PPG sensor and an electro-cardiography (ECG) sensor in a chest strap used as ground truth. The results show that a PPG-based HR sensor in a wristband-type activity tracker has a potential for practicable HR monitoring of construction workers with 4.79% of mean-average-percentage-error (MAPE) and 0.85 of correlation coefficient for whole datasets (4.44%, 4.52%, and 533% of MAPEs and 0.89, 0.70, and 0.61 of correlation coefficients during light works with <90 bpm of HRs, moderate works with 90-110 bpm of HRs, and heavy works with >110 bpm of HRs, respectively). Because there is still room for improvement of the accuracy, particularly during heavy works, we also investigate the factors affecting the accuracy of HR monitoring using inequality statistics. From this secondary investigation, we found the major sources of error including noises from motion artifacts. With advanced noise-cancellation techniques, it is expected that that field HR monitoring using wearable activity trackers can be used to evaluate worker's physical demands from diverse construction tasks in a non-intrusive and affordable way. As a result, our work will help manage excessive workloads (e.g., flexing work/rest plans) so that a worker can sustain his/her given tasks during working time in a safer and healthier way.

JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; salaries; employees; regression analysis; training	UNION	This paper briefly characterizes today's United States (U.S.) construction workforce, and attempts to provide evidence for what the construction industry most values in its workers. It presents the social and demographic characteristics of a sample of 862 construction workers, from 19 project sites that were interviewed in 2002, as part of a research effort at the University of Texas at Austin, and compares them with broader-based Bureau of Labor Statistics data to establish the degree to which they represent the U.S. construction workforce. Via statistical analysis, the paper explores the relationships between workers' attributes and how the industry compensates them as reflected in both hourly wages and average annual incomes. The statistical results reinforce what is known about the importance of years of experience; however, it also provides evidence of the importance of number of crafts each worker possessed, and computer knowledge. Less, but significant, evidence was obtained for the importance of the number of years spent with his/her current firm, craft training hours, age, or self-assessed performance.

Different from people in other industries, construction workers are less sensitive to hazards because of their long-term exposure to risks. Therefore, maintaining construction workers' vigilance and monitoring their attention levels are critical to successful safety management practices. However, current attention-assessing approaches are post hoc and subjective and difficult to implement in construction practice. To address these issues, we propose a wireless and wearable electroencephalography (EEG) system to quantitatively and automatically assess construction workers' attention level through processing human brain signals. To validate the proposed system, we conducted an on-site experiment to analyze the EEG signal patterns when construction workers avoid different obstacles in their tasks. The results suggest EEG signal properties such as frequency, power spectrum density, and spatial distribution can effectively reflect and quantify the construction workers' perceived risk level. Especially, lower gamma frequency bands and the frontal left EEG cluster provide the most direct and observable indications of their vigilance states. These conclusions could facilitate the future implementation of wearable EEG devices through data filtering and channel optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The importance of posture-related data has drawn the attention of researchers in construction management and other fields. Accordingly, many data collection methods have been developed and applied to collect posture-related data. Despite the importance of workers' posture-related data, there lacks a review of previous data collection methods in the construction industry. This paper fills the research gap by reviewing previous methods to collect posture-related data for construction workers via 1) summarizing working principles and applications of posture-related data collection in construction management, which demonstrates the extensive use of motion sensors and Red-Green-Blue (RGB) cameras in posture-related data collection, 2) comparing the above methods based on data quality and feasibility on construction sites, which reveals the reason why motion sensors and RGB cameras have been prevalent in previous studies, 3) revealing research gaps of posture-related data collection tools and applications, and providing possible future research directions.

While considerable advancements have been made to capture complementary information from still frames, it remains a challenge to obtain motion between them. As a result, this has hindered the ability to conduct real-time monitoring. Considering this challenge, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates Red-Green-Blue (RGB), optical flow, and gray stream CNNs, is proposed to accurately monitor and automatically assess workers' activities associated with installing reinforcement during construction. A database containing photographs of workers installing reinforcement is created from activities undertaken on several construction projects in Wuhan, China. The database is then used to train and test the developed CNN network. Results demonstrate that the developed method can accurately detect the activities of workers. The developed computer vision-based approach can be used by construction managers as a mechanism to assist them to ensure that projects meet pre-determined deliverables.

Travis			Incorporating Multiskilling and Learning in the Optimization of Crew Composition	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Learning; Multiskilling; Skill level; Hybrid solution technique; Labor and personnel issues	CONSTRUCTION; PROJECTS; MODEL	The presence of multiskilled workers in a crew can increase the crew's productivity through reducing inefficiencies and supervision requirements, while also providing on-the-job learning opportunities for single-skilled workers. The effect of the presence of multiskilled workers on the learning rate of workers, which is also a function of skill level and experience, and thus on the crew's productivity, is especially significant in repetitive construction projects. This paper presents a mathematical model for identifying the optimal combination of single-skilled and multiskilled workers with different levels of experience in the crew to minimize the duration of construction projects by accounting for the overlapping effects of multiskilling, skill level, and learning on the crew's productivity. The model is applied to an illustrative case project to demonstrate the practicality of the model. The optimum crew compositions for different activities involved in the case project are identified using a solution technique which combines constraint programming (CP), statistical analysis (SA), and a genetic algorithm (GA).

Recently, Physiological Status Monitors (PSMs) were validated as an accurate technology to assess physiological conditions during typical sport science and medicine testing procedures (e.g., treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols). However, sport science and medicine testing procedures cannot simulate routine construction worker movements in a comprehensive manner. Thus, this paper investigated the validity of two PSMs by comparing their measurements with gold standard laboratory instruments' measurements at rest and during dynamic activities resembling construction workforce's routine activities. Two physiological parameters such as heart rate and breathing rate were considered. Ten apparently healthy subjects participated in the study. One of the PSMs proved to be a viable technology in assessing construction workers' heart rate (correlation coefficient >= 0.74; percentage of differences within +/- 11 bpm >= 84.8%).

J	Shang, G; Pheng, LS; Hui, WJ				Shang, Gao; Sui Pheng, Low; Jia Hui, Wee			Drivers and barriers for multiskilling workers in the Singapore construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Barriers; drivers; foreign construction workers; institutional theory; multiskilling	SKILLS CRISIS; LABOR; PERSPECTIVE; IMPACT	Construction in Singapore has always been perceived as a low productivity sector, given the slow labour productivity growth. To address the issue, the Singapore government introduced the Multiskilling Scheme (MS) in 2012, aiming to develop competent workers who are versatile in multiple skillsets. This study attempts to assess the extent of adoption of the MS in Singapore's construction industry by recognizing the benefits, drivers, and barriers of multiskilling workers. This study has a two-phased research design consisting of a survey and interviews with industry employers and government. The empirical findings indicate the strong influence of regulatory impetus towards adoption of the MS, where an incentive of lower foreign levy was granted. The significant drivers highlighted were government compliance with regulations, employers' perception of the importance of multiskilling workers for productivity improvement, and usefulness of the MS for upgrading worker's skills. Barriers to the MS were perceived to be insignificant in terms of hindering adoption, especially with firms heavily incentivized and driven by government. It is concluded that multiskilling in Singapore's construction industry has its own features. In terms of contributions, the drivers and barriers of the MS formulated under Scott's Institutional Framework are mapped, and recommendations are proposed for improvement of the MS.

However, conventional sensing approaches to recognizing workers' fall-related movements may have the following limitations: (1) wearable sensors may cause physical interference and privacy issues, and (2) the commonly used algorithms may be unsuitable for classifying undefined classes. Thus, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to learn unsafe action patterns based on a scaffold's accelerations due to workers' movements, along with four modeling strategies to recognize predefined precursor signals while rejecting undefined classes. These models achieved detection and classification F1 scores of 72-78% and 93-97%, respectively, implying that a scaffold's accelerations could include sufficient information on workers' movements to recognize their actions, and the modeling strategies could seamlessly classify predefined precursors and differentiate between predefined and unseen classes. This approach could reduce fall-related incidents by constantly monitoring workers at elevated locations and providing proactive feedback.

This study explores musculoskeletal bodily pain and the impact this has on construction workers' mental health. A mixed-method approach incorporated survey and interview data. Sixty-seven construction workers completed a survey consisting of work ability and mental health measures. Eighteen workers who completed a survey participated in an interview exploring the occurrence and management of body pain, and the impact of pain on mental health. Survey findings indicated that participants whose pain had originated from work had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress severity. Findings also revealed that depression, anxiety, and stress had a negative relationship with work ability indicators, suggesting that work ability is likely to decline when workers experience poor mental health. Key themes emerging from the interview data comprised of the expectation of pain, managing pain, impact of pain on mental health, pressure to work with pain, work ability and planning for the future, and the stigma of mental health. A conceptual model is presented which illustrates the relationship between work tasks, pain, mental health, and work ability. The model identifies that anticipated and experienced bodily pain creates harmful psychological demands for workers which impacts on their mental health.

However, it is always necessary to qualify and forecast the construction productivity using novel methods. Based on the criticism on the comprehensive literature review, this study found that the genuine relationship between workers' qualifications and construction productivity has not been recognized and modeled. Therefore, for this paper, the input data had been collected through a structured questionnaire together with the work sampling method and was then analyzed by statistical tools. The results showed that the real productivity for the 110 mm wall is less than the baseline productivity, whereas that of the 220 mm wall is higher than the baseline productivity. In addition, there is no difference in the actual productivity of brick masonry construction between worker's experience groups, whereas it is a significant difference between worker's skill groups. Based on the binary logistic regression, this study has developed a model to correctly predict the productivity for masonry work of two brick walls based on worker's experience and skill. The analysis results indicated that this performance could be obtained with the minimum and maximum correct percentage of approximately 40% and 98%. Eventually, this study proposes two useful ways to improve the skills of masonry workers so that they can accelerate construction productivity.

J	Al-Abbadi, GM; Agyekum-Mensah, G				Al-Abbadi, Ghazi Moh'd; Agyekum-Mensah, George			The effects of motivational factors on construction professionals productivity in Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction; motivation; productivity; project management; workers	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; SATISFACTION	In the current economic conditions, improving worker productivity in construction sites is becoming increasingly vital to ensure the success of projects. Multiple factors impact the productivity of workers; however, motivation is considered to be the most important factor. Past studies indicated that low productivity is one of the main challenges facing the construction industry in Jordan. This study is an attempt to explore and rank the motivational factors affecting workers productivity in the Jordanian construction sites. To achieve this objective, a mixed research strategy was adopted involving a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The questionnaire was distributed to key players within the industry and included 16 motivational factors which were derived from past research on motivation. Using the importance index technique, the top 10 factors were identified which included: (1) personal growth/career improvement; (2) pay on time; (3) decision making ability; (4) decent and respectful job; (5) rewards; (6) pay amount; (7) high responsibility job; (8) challenging tasks; (9) work appreciation; and (10) team cooperation. Semi-structured interviews were used to validate the results from the questionnaire and to further understand the importance of worker motivation. The study concluded that if organizations paid attention to these motivational factors, then worker productivity, staff retention, organizational standards and the probability of successful project delivery should all be improved.

Exploring safety management challenges for multi-national construction workforces: a UK case study	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ethnography; migrant workers; multi-national project; safety	MIGRANT WORKERS; INDUSTRY; CULTURE; UNCERTAINTY; INJURIES; HEALTH; LABOR	Large construction projects frequently operate with multi-national workforces, utilizing migrant workers to provide both skilled and unskilled labour. Multi-national workforces are also brought together through joint ventures, as companies from different countries collaborate and share their expertise to construct large and complex construction projects. A multi-national joint venture in the UK provides the case study for an examination of the safety management challenges found on such projects. Whilst language and communication issues amongst workers are typically primary concerns, here they have not been prioritized. Instead, findings are presented that illuminate more nuanced and unquantifiable problems that faced the safety management team. An ethnographically informed approach was mobilized, with the lead researcher spending three years on the site with the safety team gathering data. Analysis revealed several challenges: problems with non-UK company compliance with UK legislation and standards; differences in working practices amongst both non-UK workers and their managers; differences associated with national cultures; and problems of poor worker welfare. It is suggested that awareness of these challenges should inform both the way in which such projects are initially contracted, as well as the development of more sophisticated safety management systems that better support multi-national construction projects in practice.

The work described in this article deals with the development of a particular security system, using both existing commercial technology and specially designed equipment. The compulsory safety helmet required for all workers in construction sites is used as the base to accommodate miniature positioning and communication instruments. The position and ID of each worker is sampled periodically and sent via radio to a monitoring station, where the information is compared to a database containing the tasks and processes being performed in the site. According to this, workers and machines' positions are known in each instant, and risk situations may be recognized immediately and therefore damage can be prevented. If certain workers and particular machinery and equipment elements are not supposed to be in certain locations for safety reasons, an automated system can be used to detect the situation and make the adequate decision to prevent a possible accident. The proposed system is meant for modem construction systems where workers and automated/semiautomated machines coexist. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Construction workers' perceptions of safety climate can form at different levels and vary between subunits. A multilevel safety climate measurement tool was proposed, which identified five important safety agents, i.e. client, principal contractor, supervisor, co-workers, and individual workers. Surveys were conducted at three construction projects commissioned by Fonterra Co-operative Group. A total of 356 participants completed the survey. The data was subject to scale reliability analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that all scales achieved satisfactory internal consistency and the multilevel factorial structure was generally supported. At the organizational level, the tool measures clients' overall safety priority and safety actions, and principal contractors' general commitment to safety. At the group level, the tool measures supervisors' safety actions and safety expectations, and co-workers' general safety values and practices. The tool also measures individual safety responses reflected by safety compliance and safety participation. The measurement tool would help construction organizations to diagnose potential weaknesses in their safety management practices for safety improvement and also help to develop a social and cultural work environment that is supportive of safety at all levels.

J	Liu, QJ; Ye, G; Feng, YB				Liu, Qinjun; Ye, Gui; Feng, Yingbin			Workers' safety behaviors in the off-site manufacturing plant	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Influencing factors; Theory of planned behaviour (TPB); Construction site; Questionnaire survey; Construction safety; Safety behaviour; Off-site manufacturing plants	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; SITUATION AWARENESS; PAST BEHAVIOR; CONSTRUCTION; INTENTION; MODEL; HABIT; CLIMATE; SYSTEM; HEALTH	Purpose Although research on prefabricated construction has gained increasing attention in recent years, limited efforts have been devoted to investigating safety issues in the off-site manufacture, especially workers' behavioral intentions to work safely. Thus, research is needed to identify the motivational factors determining off-site construction workers' safety behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate workers' safety behavior by examining the determinants of behavioral intention in the off-site manufacturing plants in China. Design/methodology/approach Theory of planned behavior (TPB) was modified and used in this study to explain how the elements in the hypothesized model interact. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Structural equation modeling technique with partial least-squares estimation was used to analyze the data collected. Findings The findings of this study indicated that workers' tendency to engage in safety behavior is positively related to attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and behavioral habit, among which attitude toward the behavior and behavioral habit have most significant influences on safety behavior. This finding provides a better explanation on the pathways and the impacts of the crucial factors on the safety behaviors for the off-site manufacture. Originality/value The possible innovation of this research lies in its attempt to understand the antecedents of workers' safety behavior in the off-site construction environment, which may make original contributions to construction safety research and practice. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge in TPB. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward in order to improve workers' safety behavior in off-site construction.

J	Newaz, MT; Davis, P; Jefferies, M; Pillay, M				Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi; Davis, Peter; Jefferies, Marcus; Pillay, Manikam			Examining the Psychological Contract as Mediator between the Safety Behavior of Supervisors and Workers on Construction Sites	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Psychological contract; Safety behavior; Supervisor; Worker	LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP; INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; EMPLOYEES; MODEL; OBLIGATIONS	Issues regarding relationships between supervisor safety behavior (SSB) and worker safety behavior (WSB) are well recognized in construction management research. Nevertheless, how safety plans are articulated through the actions of supervisors to the workforce remains unclear. By conceptualizing safety from the window of the "psychological contract" (PC), this research proposes that if the "psychological contract of safety" (PCS)-if reciprocal commitments between a supervisor and a worker are fulfilled-then WSB will be positively influenced. Using a PCS scale based on employer obligations, multilevel surveys were performed at five construction sites in Sydney, Australia, and data from 352 workers associated with a mega-construction project were collected. A hypothetical model proposing the PCS as an intervention is presented. The model is validated using structural equation modeling (SEM), the data reliability and validity of the survey findings are ensured, and the goodness of fit of the proposed model was examined. The results indicate that PCS successfully mediates the relationship between two important safety agents-the supervisor and the worker. When addressing the research gap, this article explains how the concept of PCS can be further utilized to investigate safety issues that are regularly raised. In addition, new avenues for researchers and practitioners are suggested to consider the social exchange relationships at construction sites. Using the validated PCS model and understanding the level of fulfillment, construction supervisors may influence workers' behavior with greater confidence. Furthermore, when finding a low level of fulfillment of PCS, senior managers can deliver training to supervisors to improve their safety behavior to the benefit of WSB.

J	Duan, PS; Zhou, JL				Duan, Pinsheng; Zhou, Jianliang			Cascading vulnerability analysis of unsafe behaviors of construction workers from the perspective of network modeling	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Cascading failure; Complex network; Construction workers; Unsafe behavior; Vulnerability	SAFETY; RISK; INDUSTRY	Purpose The construction industry is an industry with a high incidence of safety accidents, and the interactions of unsafe behaviors of construction workers are the main cause of accidents. The neglect of the interactions may lead to serious underestimation of safety risks. This research aims to analyze the cascading vulnerability of unsafe behaviors of construction workers from the perspective of network modeling. Design/methodology/approach An unsafe behavior network of construction workers and a cascading vulnerability analysis model were established based on 296 actual accident cases. The cascading vulnerability of each unsafe behavior was analyzed based on the degree attack strategy. Findings Complex network with 85 unsafe behavior nodes is established based on the collected accidents in total. The results showed that storing in improper location, does not wear a safety helmet, working with illness and working after drinking are unsafe behaviors with high cascading vulnerability. Coupling analysis revealed that differentiated management strategies of unsafe behaviors should be applied. Besides, more focus should be put on high cascading vulnerability behaviors. Originality/value This research proposed a method to construct the cascading failure model of unsafe behavior for individual construction workers. The key parameters of the cascading failure model of unsafe behaviors of construction workers were determined, which could provide a reference for the research of cascading failure of unsafe behaviors. Additionally, a dynamic vulnerability research framework based on complex network theory was proposed to analyze the cascading vulnerability of unsafe behaviors. The research synthesized the results of dynamic and static analysis and found the key control nodes to systematically control unsafe construction behaviors.

Design/methodology/approach The research used an exploratory approach of unstructured interviews with construction workers (bottom-up approach), and the guided group brainstorming technique with the help of experienced industry professionals (top-down approach). Findings From the unstructured interviews, five inhibiting factors were identified which discourage construction workers from undergoing training. Furthermore, to recognise the causes of the inhibiting factors, 13 possible causal attributes (PCAs) were identified from the brainstorming approach. Subsequently, these PCAs were classified into five possible causal factors (PCFs) on the basis of those concerned stakeholder(s) that are most closely involved and most responsible for fixing them. Research limitations/implications The research provides recommendations to practitioners for pragmatic and permanent resolution of each of the PCFs, which serves as a framework for the construction industry to reduce the scarcity of trained workers in the industry. Also, the results may serve as a model for the planning and successful implementation of any new skill-training programme for the construction workers in any developing economy, such as India. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature by highlighting the views of construction workers on the training establishments, which very few studies have considered in the past. Also, the research provides a detailed process of brainstorming approach, which will help the research community to appreciate its use in studies related to the construction industry.

Optimizing travel distance of construction workers considering their behavioral uncertainty using fuzzy graph theory	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Site layout planning; Workers behavioral uncertainty; Fuzzy graph theory		Travel distance-mostly used in safety and cost objective functionsis the main parameter optimized in construction site layout planning (CSLP) as an optimization problem. While normal CSLP processes assume that every movement at a construction site goes through the particular paths they have assigned, this article presents an innovative method to consider worker behavioral uncertainty (WBU) in whether and how workers follow or deviate from the given paths. In this research, fuzzy graph theory (FGT) helps CSLP consider WBU and shows improved efficiency compared to conventional approaches. The new approach is illustrated in a case study project. The results are affected by WBU in terms of transportation costs and safety risks, but they are still within the range consistent with the literature. Considering WBU through the algorithm presented in this article makes the assumed travel paths more realistic and, thus, CSLP more efficient.

Limited research has been recorded in work-related musculoskeletal symptoms, especially in the construction industry. The aim of this paper is to study frequency and continuity of musculoskeletal symptoms for local construction workers. A questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. It is found that the musculoskeletal symptom is common among most construction workers. practically in their upper extremities and lower back. All respondents reported that they had experienced of at least one musculoskeletal symptom in the I I body locations including neck, shoulder, upper back, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, lower back, hip, knee, and ankle.

J	Park, J; Marks, E; Cho, YK; Suryanto, W				Park, JeeWoong; Marks, Eric; Cho, Yong K.; Suryanto, Willy			Performance Test of Wireless Technologies for Personnel and Equipment Proximity Sensing in Work Zones	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Highway work zone safety; Hazardous proximity situations; Bluetooth technology; Construction equipment safety; Construction safety; Information technologies	CONSTRUCTION; TRACKING; BLUETOOTH	The dynamic nature and limited work space of roadway work zones contribute to dangerous working environments for construction workers. This environment can result in hazardous proximity situations because pedestrian workers are required to operate in close proximity to heavy construction equipment. A total of 609 work zone personnel fatalities were reported in 2012. Previous analysis of work zone fatality data found that the majority of the pedestrian worker and mobile object struck-by fatalities resulted when pedestrian workers were struck by construction equipment. These statistics indicate that current safety practices for pedestrian workers and equipment operators are inadequate. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a proximity detection and alert system using Bluetooth sensing technology. The scope included hazardous proximity situations between pedestrian workers and construction equipment in roadway work zones at grade. Evaluation metrics were implemented to assess the tested proximity sensing systems including the cost, time and ease of calibration, required hardware, system capabilities, and many others. Commercially available radio frequency identification (RFID) and magnetic field proximity sensing systems were also evaluated to provide a basis for comparison. Various interaction scenarios between pedestrian workers and construction equipment were used in the evaluation of the system. The performance evaluation based on the statistical results showed that all the tested systems were considered reliable with minimal false alarm rates. However, the magnetic system showed a significant drop in its coverage range, while still providing reliable coverage measures, with a set of tests that were more dynamic than other sets of tests. The created Bluetooth system provided the highest level of simplicity with its minimized infrastructure, ease of calibration, and ease of installation. In sum, experimental results demonstrate that the created proximity detection and alert system (1) requires minimal infrastructure; (2) provides adequate alerts to equipment operators and pedestrian workers; and (3) provides, through an alert, an additional layer of hazard avoidance in real time during hazardous-proximity situations in roadway work zones.

It is a problem for the Chinese construction industry, where excessive job hopping is detrimental to meeting the current daunting challenges involved in the industry's transformation and efficiency improvement. To provide an exhaustive analysis of this effect, game theory is combined with social relationship networks to create an agent-based simulation model. Simulation results indicate that the frequent job moves of Chinese construction workers have a negative effect on their skill development, employment, and worker relationships, as well as results in sharp increase in employer labor costs. The findings point to the need to act for the benefit of workers and employers and maintain the development of the industry.

Struck-by object or equipment is one of the main causes of fatal accidents on construction sites. Although many regulations have been designed for preventing struck-by accidents, they still happen and lead to many injuries and fatalities. The application of real-time location systems (RTLS) on construction sites provides new possibilities in construction safety management. Previous researchers have proposed using RTLS to track the locations of workers and equipment on construction sites to improve construction safety. However, they have the limitation of cabling problems. Also, providing effective safety alerts to workers within dangerous proximity to equipment has not been well addressed. This paper aims to develop a method for detecting the proximities as well as providing proximity safety alerts to workers on construction sites using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RTLS. Here, vibro-tactile alerts representing different cases of proximities were defined. Unnecessary alerts were filtered out to avoid desensitizing workers. A number of tests were conducted on a construction site to test the prototype system developed based on the proposed method. The results indicate that the system is capable of detecting proximities and generating timely vibro-tactile alerts, which can be easily perceived by the workers.

This workforce suffers from high rates of mental health problems and low help-seeking. Accordingly, the purposes of this study were to explore relationships between WLB, mental health, attitudes towards mental health problems, along with work schedules. One hundred and forty-four UK workers in the construction industry completed measures of those three constructs. WLB was negatively associated with mental health problems and mental health attitudes. Mental health attitudes did not mediate the relationship between WLB and mental health problems with a small effect size. WLB was the strongest predictor of mental health problems. Mental health problems scores differed by work pattern groups; day time workers had poorer mental health than mixed workers. Findings will help UK construction workers, employers, and organizational researchers deepen their understanding of WLB and identify better solutions to poor WLB and mental health.

Fully understanding the causes of unsafe behaviors on site will help to prevent them, thus reducing construction accidents. The accurate and timely identification of site workers' unsafe behaviors can aid in the analysis of the causes of unsafe behaviors and prevention of construction accidents. However, the traditional methods (e.g.,site observation) of behavior data collection on site is neither efficient nor comprehensive. This paper develops a skeleton-based real-time identification method by combining image-based technologies, construction safety knowledge, and ergonomic theory. The proposed method recognizes unsafe behaviors by simplifying dynamic motions into static postures, which can be described by a few parameters. Three basic modules are involved: an unsafe behavior database, real-time data collection module, and behavior judgement module. A laboratory test demonstrated the feasibility, efficiency, and accuracy of the method. The method has the potential to improve construction safety management by providing comprehensive data for the systematic identification of the causes to workers' unsafe behaviors, such as inappropriate management methods, measures or decisions, personal characteristics, work space and time, as well as warning workers identified as behaving unsafely, if necessary. Thus, this paper contributes to practice and the body of knowledge of construction safety management, as well as research and practice in image-based behavior recognition.

Experimental approaches and policy creation are not straightforward because of the problems around existing methods of drug testing for marijuana that stem from the fact that its longevity in the body outlasts actual intoxication and a lack of scientific agreement of quantifiable long-term effects on work performance. Here, a social constructionist methodology has been adopted to explore perspectives of marijuana legalization as revealed through conversations with 50 construction site workers. Findings show that although legalization has had no impact on use among construction workers, impairment while at work remains unacceptable. A conflict now exists around personal freedoms and drug testing, leading to both resignation and dissatisfaction among workers. This could negatively influence the development of a positive safety culture on sites and hinder worker engagement with safety overall. It is recommended that companies and unions recognize that blanket testing policies are problematic in practice and support the development of accurate testing for immediate impairment from marijuana use.

Inappropriate behavior on-site can instigate serious accidents, injuries, or fatality as well as incur significant costs and loss of corporate reputation. To address this dearth within the extant literature, this paper uses Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to examine the complex relationship between the personality of Chinese construction workers (especially, bar benders) and occupational accidents. A significant relationship between personality, unsafe behaviors, and the extent of injury was identified. Using the results generated, a series of practical recommendations are proffered to reinforce behavioral safety training (and reduce accidents on-site), including suggestions for conducting training programs that can be tailored to construction workers with different personality traits.

We first present (1) role-conflict theory and exchange theory to establish the multiple dimensions of commitment (affective, continuance, and normative) and (2) social identity theory to support our argument for different foci of commitment-organization and profession. Building on these theoretical lenses, we present the literature review that compares organizational and professional commitment of project workers with respect to the three dimensions of commitment. Adopting a positivist approach and a sample of 141 project workers, we use Pearson's correlation to identify the relationship between affective organizational and affective professional, continuance organizational and continuance professional, and normative organizational and normative professional commitment. We report significant correlation between affective organizational commitment and affective professional commitment of project workers. The correlations between continuance organizational commitment and continuance professional commitment and normative organizational commitment and normative professional commitment are moderate. We then discuss the implications of these findings for the project management profession.

It comes about partly due to organizational ineffectiveness. The major attributes of organizational effectiveness are identified from literature. Means to achieving greater organization effectiveness and higher productivity are identified under the major headings of cohesion and morale of workers, adaptability, information communication, and planning. Using a structured questionnaire survey on building craftsmen in Uganda, results suggest that most workers are not satisfied with the financial reward, level of status is not able to achieve personal goals. Workers are not satisfied with the level of training. The variables are weak points in organizational effectiveness. In addition, workers are not satisfied with the level of participation in decision-making. There is a need to dwell on these grey areas in order to improve the organizational effectiveness of building firms, especially in developing countries.

A construction worker has a probability of 1-in-200 of dying on the job during a 45-year career, mainly due to fires, falls, and being struck by or caught between objects. Hence, employers must ensure their workers wear personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular hardhats, if they are at risk of falling, being struck by falling objects, hitting their heads on static objects, or coming in proximity to electrical hazards. However, monitoring the presence and proper use of hardhats becomes inefficient when safety officers must survey large areas and a considerable number of workers. Using images captured from indoor jobsites, this paper evaluates existing computer vision techniques, namely object detection and color-based segmentation tools, used to rapidly detect if workers are wearing hardhats. Experiments are conducted and the results highlight the potential of cascade classifiers, in particular, to accurately, precisely, and rapidly detect hardhats under different scenarios and for repetitive runs, and the potential of color-based segmentation to eliminate false detections.

Automated Trajectory and Path Planning Analysis Based on Ultra Wideband Data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Workforce tracking; Worksite utilization; Trajectory analysis; Worker behavior; Safety; Ultra wideband		This work studies the utility of ultra wideband (UWB) sensor technology for optimizing construction site operations. In particular, recorded trajectory signals provide important behavioral information regarding site usage that can be exploited for planning and logistical purposes. Here, post processed trajectory information from UWB signals populate an occupancy grid, which is a spatial histogram of workers, travel patterns. The occupancy grid is used for path planning and serves two purposes. The first suggests optimal paths for workers while the second generates optimal paths for vehicles. The path generation algorithm provides multiple paths, and optimality scores for a variety of path metrics, including distance, time, and worker sparsity. To generate the optimal paths, a path planning graph is generated from the occupancy grid and any automatically determined or manually specified obstacles. The algorithm applies equally to any mobile, major construction resource: workers, equipment, and materials that are tagged with a UWB tag. Vital statistics obtained from the calculated paths provide important operational information to site operations and safety managers. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000115.

Although these systems improve the visibility of the surrounding environment, detecting potential collisions with workers nearby is still restricted by the limited cognitive capacity of the operator, who is executing tasks that are themselves cognitively effortful. The aim of this study is to propose a real-time warning system using visual data acquired from cameras that are readily available in the heavy equipment to protect the workers from potentially dangerous situations involving equipment operations. For this purpose, possible collisions with workers in the workspace of heavy equipment are detected and monitored by estimating the workers' positions in three dimensions (3D) with a monocular camera on each side of the equipment. Field tests were conducted to verify the accuracy and speed of the system, as well as its applicability to actual construction sites. The proposed system was implemented on two different sizes of excavators while the excavators performed excavating and moving tasks at various construction sites. The field test results indicate that the proposed system can provide information to the operator in real time about whether one or more workers may have come into contact with the equipment during manipulation and transportation of the equipment. It is expected that the proposed method can be utilized in around-view monitoring systems to assist the operator and achieve active safety.

Design/methodology/approach Multi-wave safety climate surveys were conducted at four processing plant construction projects in New Zealand. Safety climate was measured with a multi-level measurement instrument, which measured construction workers' perceptions of client's organisational safety response (COSR), principal contractor's organisational safety response (PCOSR), supervisors' safety response (SSR) and co-workers' safety response (CWSR). Findings At the organisational level, the research identifies a general downward change trend in workers' perceptions of COSR and PCOSR. At the group level, no clear or consistent change trend is identified between the level of project completion and workers' perceptions of SSR and CWSR. Research limitations/implications The research suggests that the construction project management should consistently emphasise the importance of safety, even when they are facing production pressure. The research highlights the opportunity to examine the role of supervisors' leadership as an antecedent to the group-level safety climate and the development of workers' safety concerns for their co-workers over time. Originality/value This research provides the starting point for understanding safety climate in the dynamic and constantly changing construction project environments, in which the relative priorities change, adverse events arise and production pressures fluctuate over time.

J	Shrestha, K; Shrestha, PP; Lidder, M				Shrestha, Kishor; Shrestha, Pramen P.; Lidder, Mylinh			Life-cycle cost comparison of chip seal and striping: in-house workers versus private contractors	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Construction; Estimating; Lifestyle costing		Purpose To maintain road systems in the USA, state departments of transportation (DOTs) generally use in-house workers or private contractors. Limited studies have calculated the cost savings of hiring private contractors; however, most of them have not calculated cost savings based on life-cycle costs (LCCs). The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the LCC of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by in-house workers are cheaper than those performed by private contractors. Design/methodology/approach The paper collected the hard cost data of chip seal and stripping maintenance activities performed by state DOT in-house workers, as well as private contractors, from 2003 to 2016 from the Nevada DOT Maintenance and Asset Management division. Statistical tests were conducted to test the research hypothesis that the LCC of chip seal and stripping activities performed by in-house workers are significantly less than those performed by private contractors. Findings The study results showed that the cost per unit and LCC of chip seal and striping work performed by in-house workers were significantly less than those performed by private contractors in Nevada. Research limitations/implications - The study only collected data from Nevada DOT, so readers should use caution in generalizing the findings of this study. Additionally, factors affecting the cost of these maintenance activities for private contractors are significantly different compared to in-house contractors. Therefore, these differences may be some of the potential reasons for cost difference between these two methods. Practical implications - The practical implications of this study are that state DOT engineers need to plan for outsourcing chip seal and stripping maintenance activities only to private contractors that are cost effective, based on life-cycle cost. Originality/value The LCC analysis framework developed in this study will help state DOT engineers to determine cost savings by using in-house workers for road maintenance works.

The increasing use of construction surveillance cameras provides a cost-efficient way to estimate workers' VFOA from information-rich images. However, the low resolution of these images poses a great challenge to detecting the facial features and gaze directions. Recognizing that body and head orientations provide strong hints to infer workers' VFOA, this study proposes to represent the VFOA as a collection of body orientations, body poses, head yaws, and head pitches and designs a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) framework to automatically estimate workers' VFOA using low-resolution construction images. The framework is composed of two modules. In the first module, a Faster regional CNN (R-CNN) object detector is used to detect and extract workers' full-body images, and the resulting full-body images serve as a single input to the CNN-MTL model in the second module. In the second module, the VFOA estimation is formulated as a multitask image classification problem where four classification tasks-body orientation, body pose, head yaw, and head pitch-are jointly learned by the newly designed CNN-MTL model. Construction videos were used to train and test the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed CNN-MTL model achieves an accuracy of 0.91, 0.95, 0.86, and 0.83 in body orientation, body pose, head yaw, and head pitch classification, respectively. Compared with the conventional single-task learning, the MTL method reduces training time by almost 50% without compromising accuracy. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

An agent-based modeling approach for understanding the effect of worker-management interactions on construction workers' safety-related behaviors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction site safety; Safety management; Safety-related behavior; Agent-based modeling; Simulation	SIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; LEADERSHIP; ACCIDENTS; CULTURE; OWNERS; IDENTIFICATION; CONTRACTORS; PREDICTORS; PROJECTS	Pervasive unsafe behaviors of construction workers are the primary cause of accidents on construction job sites. The workers' safety-related behaviors are subject to a variety of factors, such as interactions with coworkers and interventions by management teams. The impacts of these factors have attracted considerable attention in academia but are yet to be fully examined. To provide a quantitative assessment of these impacts and their managerial implications in practice, an agent-based modeling approach of construction safety-related behaviors, which adopts a bottom-up architecture, is proposed in this research. This approach regards safety performance as an emergent property of the behaviors and interactions of construction workers and management teams. The development of the agent-based model is based on a range of theoretical and empirical evidence, including a cognitive analysis model for modeling worker behaviors, and site observations and surveys for the design of simulated working environment and tasks, as well as the modeling of individual behaviors and interactions. Four managerial scenarios are simulated using the proposed approach. Based on the simulation results, the effects of a number of managerial factors on the safety performance of construction workers are examined. These factors include duties of supervisors, the competency and inspection strategy of safety officers, the frequency of safety training, senior managers' involvement in safety activities and emphasis on safety goals. The effects of these factors are examined in a quantitative manner, and relevant implications for construction safety management practice are discussed. The findings prove that agent-based modeling is an effective approach for analyzing the characteristics and patterns of construction safety-related behaviors and assessing possible safety management strategies.

Safety training is regarded as an effective method for the BBS intervention. However, existing studies provide little attention to workers' personal behavior patterns that limit the persistent effectiveness of interventions. This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation approach that can enhance the effectiveness of safety training in the Chinese construction industry. The proposed approach integrates content-based personalized recommendation and MapReduce-based collaborative filtering for personalized recommendation. The personal behavior patterns of workers are automatically analyzed through data that are generated from training. Then, reasonable training materials are recommended for behavior modification. The workers' behavior modification (WoBeMo) system is designed to implement safety training. A pilot study on metro construction sites showed that the unsafe behavior rate (S) of 20 laborers who were engaged in scaffolding work decreased over 70% after intervention, and were reduced over 60% compared with another group of laborers not using the WoBeMo. Application results indicate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach on modifying workers' unsafe behaviors and improving safety performance on construction sites.

J	Irizarry, J; Simonsen, KL; Abraham, DM				Irizarry, J; Simonsen, KL; Abraham, DM			Effect of safety and environmental variables on task durations in steel erection	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								In spite of the efforts by government agencies, labor organizations, and researchers in the field of health and safety, injuries and fatalities continue to affect the construction industry. In 2002 the construction industry had the undesirable distinction of having two of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with fatalities among structural steel workers at 58.2 per 100,000 workers (fourth highest rate) and among construction laborers at 27.7 per 100,000 workers (ninth highest rate). Costs associated with construction accidents, such as increased insurance premiums and medical expenses, and loss of productivity are also concerns in the industry. It has not been demonstrated how unsafe working conditions affect worker performance, and the impact of unsafe work practices on worker performance has not been quantified. This paper describes a methodology that included direct observation of steel erection activities and statistical analysis of task duration data. The data collected at steel erection sites included safety conditions such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), elevation of the work area, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, and worker performance in the form of task durations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis of 186 of steel erection task durations collected over a six-month period showed that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). the time of day during which the operation was being performed, the elevation at which the work was being performed, and the presence of decking below the work area had statistically significant effects on the durations of steel erection tasks.

Discovering causality patterns of unsafe behavior leading to fall hazards on construction sites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Unsafe behavior; association rules; construction; fall accident; near-miss	SAFETY BEHAVIOR; TRACKING SYSTEM; NETWORK MODEL; WORKERS; ACCIDENTS; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; CLIMATE	Unsafe behavior as a direct cause accounts for some 80% of accidents in the construction industry. While numerous studies have investigated the factors that influence unsafe behavior, most of them have approached the problem from a statistical standpoint, which is unable to provide causality patterns of how unsafe behavior forms. This paper illuminates the causality patterns obtained from a series of near-miss fall incidents through a practical study using a video camera system to record and analyze the unsafe behavior of workers. A total of 1347 cases of near-miss incidents were obtained in two weeks. Association Rules method was employed to verify the revealed causality patterns of workers' unsafe behavior, and a risk matrix was developed based on the indicators of rules to classify workers' risk level. Results indicate that habits, motivation, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms are the strongest contributing factors to unsafe behavior. While results introduce a new research perspective on the concept of construction safety behavior, the practical insights gained hereby enable construction managers to better analyze the combined negative effect of causal factors on workers' safety behavior.

Measurements were made between April of 2016 and October of 2017. The environmental tests performed on scaffoldings were focused mainly on the sound level. The parameters on which we base our analysis are the value of C-weighted peak sound levels and daily noise exposure level. The noise that affects construction workers on scaffolding may influence the behaviour of workers and increase the risk of accidents. And at the same time, noise exposure laws facilitate identification of high noise-emitting activities and provide effective preventive measures that reduce noise pollution and improve work environments. The analyses carried out confirmed the qualitatively expected dependencies, and allowed us to quantify the impact of noise to which scaffolding workers are exposed. In summary, noise measurements on scaffoldings can be a valuable aid in improving working conditions. The analysis of research results allows understanding hazards related to noise in an accessible way.

J	Chiang, YH; Wong, FKW; Liang, S				Chiang, Yat-Hung; Wong, Francis Kwan-Wah; Liang, Shulan			Fatal Construction Accidents in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Fatal accidents; Labor shortage; Hong Kong	FATIGUE; WORKERS; MAINTENANCE; PREVENTION; WORKING; REPAIR; HEALTH; FALLS	The construction industry is infamous for its dismal safety records. In Hong Kong, the ratio of fatal accidents per thousand workers increases with the gross value of work performed per worker for a 21-year period between 1995 and 2015. There were more deaths when workers worked more. There has not been any significant drop in construction fatalities. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the fatal accidents, including when and how they occurred. Contextual data of fatal incidents in the construction industry of Hong Kong from 2006 to 2015 were collected from local news. The majority of victims were workers aged 45 and above, reflecting acute problems of labor aging and skilled labor shortages, which are issues not only in Hong Kong but throughout the world. Not unexpectedly, most workers died in the hot humid days in summer after working for 2 h in the morning or 1 h after a lunch break. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis suggest that more fatal accidents occurred in repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition (RMAA) works from the private sector. Hence, safety governance should be more focused on this particular sector. This is the first study to explore the overall fatalities in Hong Kong construction trades with a focus on the analysis of the relationships between the recorded variables. The findings for Hong Kong provide insight for future research on solutions to reduce accidents in the construction industry around the world. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Performance monitoring of these resources would help project managers improve the productivity rates of construction jobsites and discover potential performance issues. A typical construction workface monitoring system consists of four major levels: location tracking, activity recognition, activity tracking, and performance monitoring. These levels are employed to evaluate work sequences over time and also assess the workers' and equipment's well-being and abnormal edge cases. Results of an automated performance monitoring system could be used to employ preventive measures to minimize operating/repair costs and downtimes. The authors of this paper have studied the feasibility of implementing a wide range of technologies and computational techniques for automated activity recognition and tracking of construction equipment and workers. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods and techniques as well as describes their advantages, practical value, and limitations. Additionally, a multifaceted comparison between these methods is presented, and potential knowledge gaps and future research directions are discussed.

Emotional Engagement in Safety Training: Impact of Naturalistic Injury Simulations on the Emotional State of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Emotions; Construction safety; Simulation based safety training; Labor and personnel issues	ACHIEVEMENT EMOTIONS; OCCUPATIONAL-SAFETY; CHILDRENS MEMORY; RISK PERCEPTION; DECISION; STRESS; MODEL; FEAR; COMMUNICATION; ACQUISITION	Poor hazard recognition skills and high tolerance for risk are well-known contributing factors to high fatality rates plaguing the construction industry. The prevailing safety training techniques involve one-way delivery of slideshow presentations with written handouts that often describe common hazards and generic solutions. Such delivery does not facilitate active learning, development of contextual examples, or emotional engagement necessary for adult learners to gain new knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new multimedia learning simulation-based training program called naturalistic injury simulation (NIS). Naturalistic injury simulation involves demonstrating the cause and effect of hand injuries using a hyperrealistic replica of a human hand within realistic scenarios. Out of 1,200 workers that participated, 489 workers were randomly selected for the quasi-field-based longitudinal experiment. Change in emotional states among the participants due to the simulations was analyzed across various demographical dimensions. Analysis showed that workers experienced a surge in negative emotions. Findings suggest that NIS will lead workers across the different demographical groups to perceive more risk by being more vigilant and detail oriented. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Johari, S; Jha, KN				Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj			Learning Curve Models for Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Best-fit curves; Competencies; Learning curve theory; Regression analysis	SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; JOB	Workplace training aims to enhance the performance of trainees by improving their specific skills. Unfortunately, the outcome of such trainings in terms of the percentage of increase in trainees' performance is not generally measured. On one hand, this lack of measurement results in contractors not recognizing the importance of training in enhancing workers' performance, and on the other hand, the training providers do not receive constructive feedback on the efficacy of their sessions. This study therefore attempts to bridge this gap by developing a regression model of the socioemotional, cognitive, and technical skills of workers and their performance. Data was collected on 137 workers from four training centers in India. Using the developed model, a learning curve was drawn between performance and training time. Additionally, skills versus training time curves were also plotted. The results indicate that workers' performance after training was far below the desired level of employers; the reason for this emerges from skills versus training time curves, where it is found that the training does not focus on enhancing socioemotional and cognitive skills. Therefore, the study recommends that training providers incorporate these skills in their training curriculum to achieve more desirable outputs from training.

It is thus prone to observer fatigue and bias and is of limited scalability and cost-effectiveness. Automating this procedure obviates these issues and can allow project teams to focus on performance improvement. This paper introduces a novel deep learning- and vision-based activity analysis framework that estimates and tracks two-dimensional (2D) worker pose and outputs per-frame worker activity labels given input red-green-blue (RGB) video footage of a construction worker operation. We used 317 annotated videos of bricklaying and plastering operations to train and validate the proposed method. This method obtained 82.6% mean average precision (mAP) for pose estimation and 72.6% multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), and 81.3% multiple-object tracking precision (MOTP) for pose tracking. Cross-validation activity analysis accuracy of 78.5% was also obtained. We show that worker pose contributes to activity analysis results. This highlights the potential for using vision-based ergonomics assessment methods that rely on pose in conjunction with the proposed method for assessing the ergonomic viability of individual activities.

Travis			Job Assignment Based on Brain Demands and Human Resource Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Job assignment; Construction crew; Brain resources; Human resource strategies; Labor and personnel issues	OPTIMIZATION MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT	Assignment of jobs to construction workers critically contributes to consistency of workload distribution. Inconsistent workload distribution may develop imbalanced fatigue rates within a crew, leading to inefficient and unsafe performance. In addition, improper assignment of tasks to workers may adversely affect human resource (HR) development within the organization through skill level stagnation, particularly for less-involved workers. To realize the potential HR development benefits of on-the-job training, a precise alignment between task planning and HR strategies is required. This paper proposes a systematic framework for job assignment to construction workers by considering workers' capabilities and workloads, as well as HR strategies. The framework uses the outputs of a mathematical model that accounts for visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor demands of the jobs. Maintaining safety, enhancing skill level, addressing aging problem, and/or multiskilling are integrated in the framework as potential strategies to be considered while minimizing workload imbalances. Application of the framework is examined on a concreting case project in a simulation environment. Partial assignment of tasks is found to play a key role in smooth and practical implementation of the framework, with tangible impacts on workload distribution and throughput.

Ergonomics-driven workplace design is thus essential to not only proactively reducing risks through design changes but also accommodating medical restrictions for workers returning to work after an injury or illness. However, efforts to realize this two-fold approach are confounded by the lack of a sound approach to identifying the root causes of ergonomic posture risks among various workplace design parameters or an optimal workplace design for multiple tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a parameterized workplace design optimization framework that consists of four core components: workplace design initiation, interactive worker-workplace simulation, development of predictive surrogate models, and workplace optimization. The framework is demonstrated through a case study designing a drywall preparation workplace in a real modular construction plant. The results show that the framework enables the design of the optimal workplace (i.e., the one with minimal ergonomic risk) and provides a guide for devising practical action plans for safety improvement.

However, accidents caused in ignorance of wearing hardhats still occur. In order to strengthen the supervision of construction workers to avoid accidents, automatic non-hardhat-use (NHU) detection technology can play an important role. Existing automatic methods of detecting hardhat avoidance are commonly limited to the detection of objects in near-field surveillance videos. This paper proposes the use of a high precision, high speed and widely applicable Faster R-CNN method to detect construction workers' NHU. To evaluate the performance of Faster R-CNN, more than 100,000 construction worker image frames were randomly selected from the far-field surveillance videos of 25 different construction sites over a period of more than a year. The research analyzed various visual conditions of the construction sites and classified image frames according to their visual conditions. The image frames were input into Faster R-CNN according to different visual categories.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between individual internal factors and unsafe behaviors in construction sites. This study aimed to develop and test a model to understand the mechanism of unsafe behaviors based on individual characteristics and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical regression analysis were utilized. A total of 191 workers were evaluated in five construction sites to explore the effects of each internal factor. The findings showed that the TPB constructs fully mediated the relationship between individual background characteristics and unsafe behaviors. Furthermore, the analysis of the moderating effects of the variable of habits showed that the inverse relationship between safety attitude and unsafe behaviors was stronger when there was a high level of safety habits. This study also found that safety attitude and safety habits were the best predictors for the behaviors of the workers. The findings of this study provide deeper insights for both researchers and practitioners by identifying how internal factors influence the behavior to prevent the workers' unsafe behaviors.

J	Yang, J				Yang, Jun			ENHANCING ACTION RECOGNITION OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS USING DATA-DRIVEN SCENE PARSING	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						worker; action recognition; scene parsing; computer vision; context	EQUIPMENT; LOCATION; TRACKING; OBJECTS; SYSTEM; SPACE; MODEL; TOOL	Vision-based action recognition of construction workers has attracted increasing attention for its diverse applications. Though state-of-the-art performances have been achieved using spatial-temporal features in previous studies, considerable challenges remain in the context of cluttered and dynamic construction sites. Considering that workers actions are closely related to various construction entities, this paper proposes a novel system on enhancing action recognition using semantic information. A data-driven scene parsing method, named label transfer, is adopted to recognize construction entities in the entire scene. A probabilistic model of actions with context is established. Worker actions are first classified using dense trajectories, and then improved by construction object recognition. The experimental results on a comprehensive dataset show that the proposed system outperforms the baseline algorithm by 10.5%. The paper provides a new solution to integrate semantic information globally, other than conventional object detection, which can only depict local context. The proposed system is especially suitable for construction sites, where semantic information is rich from local objects to global surroundings. As compared to other methods using object detection to integrate context information, it is easy to implement, requiring no tedious training or parameter tuning, and is scalable to the number of recognizable objects.

Safety professionals' perceptions of the effectiveness of training practices in safety training sessions were sought in a survey administered to the top 400 contractors in the U.S. The study shows that contractors are sensitive to organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues. Whenever they encounter language problems, they use visual aids, and provide translators and safety guidelines written in workers' own language. Very few statistically significant differences are observed when the findings are analyzed from the point of view of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The contribution of this study is that it conveys the views of safety personnel about how safety learning can be achieved, sustained and improved by addressing organizational, feedback, content, process, and worker issues in training sessions. It provides project managers with best practices in safety training sessions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

A qualitative field research comprising in-depth interviews was conducted with 32 construction workers in Diyarbakir to examine subcontracting in Turkey's construction sector. The findings show that by defining construction labour in terms of physical capacity, an outcome of the labour conditions shaped by the practice of subcontracting, construction work have become naturalised as a man's job. The findings also illustrate how construction produces different masculinities that intersect with the understanding of working class shaped by the role of men being the head of the family rather than a single notion of manhood shaped by physical working conditions. Nevertheless, the male worker culture that feeds off different masculinities still retains the power to dominate and exclude women as workers from the construction site, e.g. through means of sexual harassment.

One of the critical steps to make the robots work with human workers as teams is to provide a user-friendly interface to support their mutual interactions on construction sites. Compared with existing interfaces, hand gestures are easy to use, natural, and intuitive. This paper proposed a novel vision-based framework to capture and interpret the worker's hand gestures as a human-robot interface in construction. The framework consists of three components: worker detection and tracking, recognition queues formulation, and hand gesture recognition. Its effectiveness on the hand gesture recognition was tested with field experiments and achieved the overall precision and recall of 87.0% and 66.7%. Also, a laboratory study was conducted to illustrate the use of the framework to interact with a robotic dump truck. Future work will integrate the proposed framework into robotic construction machines.

However, in shared physical spaces, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can raise new safety concerns as workers' mental health can be adversely affected by poor communication between the two peers. To create a harmonized, safe HRC, this study proposes a worker-centered collaborative framework that enables robots to capture workers' brainwaves from wearable electroencephalograph, evaluate their task-related cognitive load, and adjust the robotic performance accordingly. The framework was examined by asking 14 subjects to execute a collaborative construction task with a terrestrial robot under various levels of cognitive loads. The results showed the robot could regulate its working pace with 81.91% accuracy. This level of communication can instill trust in HRC and facilitate future endeavors in safety design of collaborative robotics.

J	Angah, O; Chen, AY				Angah, Ohay; Chen, Albert Y.			Tracking multiple construction workers through deep learning and the gradient based method with re-matching based on multi-object tracking accuracy	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Human tracking; PoseTrack; Detect-And-Track; Mask R-CNN; Deep learning; MOTA	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SAFETY; EQUIPMENT; LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	Multiple construction worker tracking is an active research area critical to the planning of the job site. Challenges in multiple construction worker tracking include miss detection and mismatch due to occlusion and identity switches. To the best knowledge of the authors, the mismatch is not reported in the literature of con-struction for image based single camera multiple worker tracking. As a result, the mismatch should be taken into account through a representative performance index such as the Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA). This work aims to improve the performance of the current multiple worker tracking through an approach composed of three stages: detection, matching and re-matching. In the detection stage, the deep learning detector, Mask R CNN, is utilized. In the matching stage, we attempt to track workers between consecutive image frames through a gradient based method with feature based comparison. Several cost means and matching methods have been experimented for model selection. Trajectories of tracking objects are derived in this stage. The best cost measurements and matching methods are recommended. Trajectories of tracking objects could be interrupted because of miss detection or mismatch. We call those broken trajectories, without matched detections, orphans. In the re-matching stage, we attempt to recover unmatched detections in the current frame with previous orphans based on extracted features. A competitive MOTA of 56.7% was obtained from the proposed approach over MOTA of 55.9% from the state-of-the-art Detect-And-Track model on a human tracking benchmark dataset. On construction job sites, we have tested the approach with 4 testing videos, resulting in a total MOTA of 81.8%, average MOTA per video of 79.0% and standard deviation of 13.0%, while the maximum and minimum MOTAs are 96.0% and 69.0%, respectively. As a result, the proposed work could potentially provide better multiple worker tracking on the construction job site. Additionally, to have a better representation of the tracking errors, this work suggests to utilize the MOTA for multiple construction worker tracking.

A wristband equipped with an accelerometer (e.g.,activity tracker) allows to collect the data related to workers' hand activities without interfering with their ongoing work. Considering that many construction activities involve unique hand movements, the use of acceleration data from a wristband has great potential for action recognition of construction activities. In this context, the authors examine the feasibility of the wrist-worn accelerometer-embedded activity tracker for automated action recognition. Specifically, masonry work was conducted to collect acceleration data in a laboratory. The classification accuracy of four classifiersthe k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, decision tree, and multiclass support vector machinewas analyzed with different window sizes to investigate classification performance. It was found that the multiclass support vector machine with a 4-s window size showed the best accuracy (88.1%) to classify four different subtasks of masonry work. The present study makes noteworthy contributions to the current body of knowledge. First, the study allows for automatic construction action recognition using a single wrist-worn sensor without interfering with workers' ongoing work, which can be widely deployed to construction sites. The use of a single sensor also greatly reduces the burden to carry multiple sensors while also reducing computational cost and memory. Second, influences associated with the variability of movement between subject and experience group were examined; thus, a consideration of data acquisition that reflects the characteristics of workers' actions is suggested.

However, few studies have focused on the automated recognition of overexertion-related construction workers' activities as well as assessing ergonomic risk levels, which may help to minimize WMSDs. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of using acceleration and foot plantar pressure distribution data captured by a wearable insole pressure system for automated recognition of overexertion-related construction workers' activities and for assessing ergonomic risk levels. The proposed approach was tested by simulating overexertion-related construction activities in a laboratory setting. The classification accuracy of five types of supervised machine learning classifiers was evaluated with different window sizes to investigate classification performance and further estimate physical intensity, activity duration, and frequency information. Cross-validation results showed that the Random Forest classifier with a 2.56-s window size achieved the best classification accuracy of 98.3% and a sensitivity of more than 95.8% for each category of activities using the best features of combined data set. Furthermore, the estimation of corresponding ergonomic risk levels was within the same level of risk. The findings may help to develop a noninvasive wearable insole pressure system for the continuous monitoring and automated activity recognition, which could assist researchers and safety managers in identifying and assessing overexertion-related construction activities for minimizing the development of WMSDs' risks among construction workers.

However, safety management of OSM has become a concern due to the worker-related safety issues, which increase the safety incidents in off-site factories. However, research on the safety of OSM activities within a factory environment are still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to examine the interrelationships among worker-related safety factors and their influence on OSM safety performance. A probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs) to assess the influence of worker-related safety climate factors on OSM safety performance is utilized in this research study. A comprehensive review and evaluation of causal safety factors with the support of a questionnaire survey with OSM industry practitioners are the basis for this BN model. The proposed BN model is then verified by conducting a sensitivity analysis such as tornado diagrams and derivatives of sensitivity. The established model presents probabilities associated with different states of safety factors and identifies the interrelationships among worker-related safety climate factors and OSM safety performance. The research findings show that improvements in management safety response, coworkers' safety values and practices, and quality of training exert a greatest effect on the safety performance. Analysis further indicates that a balance between safety and production significantly affects workers' safety knowledge. This study contributes to the OSM safety domain by offering an effective tool to predict safety performance.	[Vithanage, Sadith Chinthaka; Sing, Michael C.

The adverse health effects of asphalt fumes have long been recognized; however, there is still a lack of consistent and systematic approaches to measurement, assessment, and mitigation of asphalt fume exposures. This study reviewed the current status of research and practice on this issue and conducted case studies in 12 pavement construction projects. Literature review suggests that much work needs to be done in (1)health effect identification, (2)development of standard methods for exposure measurement, (3)characterization of harmful components in asphalt fumes, (4)establishment of exposure limits, and (5)quantification of factors that affect exposures. Case studies indicate that short-term exposures to the respirable portions of asphalt fumes can be quite high on some projects, and the high exposures are related to construction factors. The detected chemicals in fume samples appear to be affected by construction materials and construction temperature. From the perspective of construction management, a simple guideline to help field managers and workers to estimate exposure risk and avert risky situations will be beneficial. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by providing renewed and first-hand information on asphalt fume exposures by workers.

Design/methodology/approach Face-to-face surveys were conducted with the workers. The survey included some perception-based questions about preventive measures at the construction site, as well as determining the level of awareness of employees on occupational health and safety (OHS) practices. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistical methods and bivariate correlation analysis. Findings The actual knowledge levels of workers on OHS measures in the workplace is significantly lower than their perceived knowledge levels. However, there is a positive, linear and strong relationship between the actual knowledge levels of the employees about some OHS rules applied in the workplace and the general level of knowledge they perceive about themselves. Some protective measures such as occupational safety expert, OHS board, employee representatives, training and information activities at construction sites positively affect the safety awareness of employees. However, low-frequency and documentation-intensive activities such as risk assessment, emergency activities and periodic controls have no or weak correlations. Originality/value Perception-based opinions of construction site workers on occupational safety issues are transformed into numerical data and analyzed with a quantitative method.

In light of the inaccuracy of the tracking system, buffer areas are defined as statistical zones, at some distance from potential workplace hazards. Statistical alerts are created according to predefined rules when the hazard exposure of workers in those zones crosses a certain threshold. The results of tests of the method demonstrate that the model is able to successfully process the location data in order to compensate for its inaccuracy. This is done without necessitating a significant increase in the areas that are defined as being of high risk, and therefore off-limits for most workers on site. The model can thus ensure the efficiency of the construction work by restricting the size of the areas on site that are off-limits for most workers, while at the same time ensuring the safety of workers. The method can also ensure that alerts will not be ignored by using statistical rules to avoid an excessive number of alerts, and by discerning who should be the client of an alert.

Furthermore, the ramifications of construction accidents are growing in terms of both economic loss and loss of life with trends toward larger-scale, more complex projects. For this reason, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of safety management in the construction industry, and the need for more effective safety management techniques. This paper introduces a real-time location-based construction labor safety management system that tracks and visualizes workers' locations in real-time and sends early warnings to endangered workers. The system is developed by integrating: a real-time locating system (RTLS) for tracking of workers' location; a location monitoring system for mapping the workers location on a computerized building model; and alarm technology for sending early warnings. The developed system has been applied to an apartment project and an RTLS technology test center in Korea, and proved to be effective in tracking and monitoring workers in real-time and preventing construction accidents. It is envisioned that the developed system will enable proactive construction safety management in South Korea and the methodologies developed in this study will be applicable to other contexts with minimal customization.

Relatively few studies have considered the processes through which safety climates develop within subcontracted workgroups. This study sought to examine the relationship between intragroup communication relating to WHS and the workgroup safety climate. Data were collected from 39 subcontracted workgroups in the Australian construction industry using social network analysis to examine worker-to-worker, supervisor-to-worker, and worker-to-supervisor patterns of WHS-related communication. The relationship between group social network metrics and group safety climate were examined. Network density was a predictor of the workgroup safety climate. Furthermore, a suppressor effect was found such that WHS-related communication between group members and the group supervisor increased the variance in group safety climate explained in a regression model. The results highlight the importance of intragroup communication in creating a shared understanding about the priority placed on WHS within subcontracted construction workgroups. In using subcontracted workgroups as the unit of analysis and linking within-group communication patterns to the workgroup safety climate, the research makes an original contribution to knowledge in empirically demonstrating the safety benefits associated with fostering a dense communication network and encouraging frequent supervisor-worker communication in subcontracted workgroups.

J	Son, H; Kim, C				Son, Hyojoo; Kim, Changwan			Integrated worker detection and tracking for the safe operation of construction machinery	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Active safety; CMOS image sensor; Construction machinery operation; Deep learning; Integrated object detection and tracking	VISION; EQUIPMENT; NETWORKS; POSES; FALLS	Safety is the most important issue in the operation of machinery on a construction site. Due to the poor visibility of the surrounding environment, the machinery operated at construction sites poses a serious threat to the safety of the construction workers, as well as to the operators. This study proposes an integrated construction worker detection and tracking scheme using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors for realtime monitoring of the workspace and the safe operation of construction machinery. Various procedures were developed to detect and track construction workers in image sequences obtained from the CMOS image sensors. The architecture of the proposed scheme consists of the latest and fourth version of you only look once (YOLO) and the Siamese network, which are based on convolutional neural networks. Field experiments were performed to test the performance, while earthmoving operations were executed at the construction sites. The integrated architecture had recall, precision, and accuracy rates and F1 and F2 scores of 98.47%, 97.50%, 96.04%, 97.98%, and 98.27%, respectively. In addition, the results of worker detection and tracking were updated at 22 frames per second (fps). It is expected that the proposed method can be applied to operator assistance systems in construction machinery to achieve active safety.

J	Isaac, S; Edrei, T				Isaac, Shabtai; Edrei, Tsah			A statistical model for dynamic safety risk control on construction sites	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety; Dynamic risk control; Statistical Process; Control	BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; HAZARDS; SYSTEM	Existing deterministic approaches to real-time tracking of construction workers for safety purposes provide alerts for specific incidents that are isolated in space and time, once they have occurred. In contrast, this paper presents a statistical model that can support a more dynamic form of safety control, by utilizing real-time tracking data to control the exposure of construction workers to safety risks that accumulate and change over time, The model addresses risks that are the result of concurrent activities on the construction site, and provides proactive alerts in case of an increasing risk exposure for a worker or crew. Statistical zones that are related to medium risk areas on the site are defined in the model. A number of statistical rules are then used to identify deviations from a predefined maximum allowable risk exposure for workers located in the statistical zones. The model can thus prevent potential accidents from occurring, without unnecessarily affecting the efficiency of the activities carried out on site. Laboratory tests of the model were carried out, using a Wi-Fi-based RTLS. The results of the tests demonstrate that the model can identify an excessive exposure to risk for workers, support an initial analysis of the causes for the excessive risk exposure, and compensate for errors in the RTLS measurements.

Empirical Investigation Using Eye-Tracking Technology	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard recognition; Hazard identification; Eye-tracking; Visual search; Safety training; Personalized training; Occupational safety; Human factors	TRAINING SYSTEM; SAFETY; IDENTIFICATION; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; MEDIATION; WORKERS; HEALTH	Poor hazard recognition is a widespread issue in the construction industry. When construction hazards remain unrecognized, workers are more likely to indulge in unsafe behavior, experience unanticipated hazard exposure, and suffer catastrophic injuries. To improve our understanding of why construction hazards remain unrecognized, the current study examined hazard recognition as an everyday visual search tasksimilar to an individual searching for a product in a supermarket, a radiologist examining a radiograph for tissue abnormalities, or a security personnel screening baggage at an airport terminal. More specifically, the research used eye-tracking technology to examine the relationship between visual search patterns adopted by workers while participating in a hazard recognition activity and the resulting performance levels (i.e.,hazard recognition performance). The research also focused on testing the effects of introducing a recently developed personalized training intervention on visual search patterns adopted by workersand the subsequent hazard recognition performance. Visual search patterns examined in the study included search duration, fixation count, fixation spatial density, and others identified from past research. The results reveal that several quantifiable visual search patterns are predictive of superior hazard recognition performance. For example, workers who spent more time examining the workplace for safety hazards (i.e.,search duration) recognized a larger proportion of hazards. Likewise, workers that devoted higher levels of attention through a larger number of fixations (i.e.,fixation count) and longer fixation durations (i.e.,fixation time), and those that distributed their visual attention more broadly across the work area (i.e.,fixation spatial density), demonstrated superior performance. The findings also suggest that the adoption of the personalized intervention can lead to improvements in visual search patterns and hazard recognition performance among workers. The present research will be useful to diagnose and remedy search weaknesses demonstrated by workers (i.e.,human factors) that are associated with poor hazard recognition levels.

J	Guo, SY; Xiong, CH; Gong, PS				Guo, Shengyu; Xiong, Chaohua; Gong, Peisong			A REAL-TIME CONTROL APPROACH BASED ON INTELLIGENT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOR VIOLATIONS BY CONSTRUCTION WORKERS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						unsafe behavior; violation; association rule; statistical process control; intelligent video surveillance	BEHAVIOR-BASED SAFETY; VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY; OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; ERROR MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; IMPROVEMENT; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; SITES	The unsafe behavior of workers is the main object of construction safety management, in which violations require increased attention due to their pernicious consequences. However, existing studies have merely discussed violations separately from unsafe behaviors. To respond quickly to workers' violations on site, this study proposes a real-time control approach based on intelligent video surveillance. First, scenes reflecting unsafe behaviors are automatically acquired through camera-based behavior analysis technology. Meanwhile, the time corresponding to the construction phase is recorded. Second, the temporal association rule model of worker's unsafe behavior is constructed, and the rule "construction phase -> unsafe behavior" is determined by the Apriori algorithm to identify target behaviors necessary for critical control in different construction phases. Finally, statistical process control is used to find the trends of violations with frequency and mass characteristics through the dynamic monitoring of target behavior. In addition, real-time alerts of these unsafe acts are produced simultaneously. A pilot study is conducted on the cross-river tunnel project in Wuhan city, Hubei, China, and the violations related to construction machineries is proven to be controllable. Thus, the proposed approach promotes behavioral safety management on construction since it effectively controls workers' violations by real-time monitoring and analysis.

J	Vitorio, PC; Kripka, M				Vitorio Junior, Paulo Cezar; Kripka, Moacir			Fair wage potential as a tool for social assessment in building projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Case study; Construction; Engineering	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA; CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INDUSTRY	Purpose The fair wage potential (FWP) is a social assessment method that can serve as an important measure to estimate the related social impacts along a product's life cycle; however, it does not admit a direct relation to the functional unit. This research presents the weighted fair wage potential (WFWP) method that relates the functional unit to the FWP. It is a simplified method to connect the material inventory to social data. This study aims to develop an approach to assess and choose the best construction typology for buildings based on the social sustainability of workers involved in the sectors. Design/methodology/approach The study is presented in phases. Phase 1 selected and identified two Brazilian house projects, which were considered for the following processes: extraction of raw materials, manufacture of building materials and housing construction. Phase 2 assembled the social life cycle inventories and executed them using the social life cycle assessment (SLCA). The inventory of materials followed the functional unit: "1.0 m(2) of the built housing", and the social inventory observed data extracted from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD). The study considered the stakeholder category "worker" and analysed the impact subcategory "fair salary". The study also divided the social data into categories: worker gender, worker race/colour, worker union and worker formality to analyse the impact of subcategories: "equal opportunities/discrimination", "freedom of association and collective bargaining" and "social benefits/social security". Phase 3 compared the projects according to the results from the SLCA. The FWP considers the wage paid at supply chain sectors, and the WFWP relates the functional unit to the social data. Findings The results proved that the wages paid by the construction supply chain are fair. However, there are differences between the FWP of male and female workers, white and non-white workers, unionised and non-unionised workers and formal and informal workers. The study of the actual Brazilian minimum wage indicated that the FWP is sensitive to the reference wage to which the analysed wages paid are related. Considering the WFWP, the constructive typology employed in Project B can generate increased positive social impacts than Project A. The proposed study provides excellent results, and it can be adapted to different data to assess the social conditions of other countries and sectors. Research limitations/implications There is not enough primary data available for the variables real wages and real working time; for this reason, these variables received secondary data. Another limitation is the data used for the year range, since Brazilian microdata do not include years before 2002 and years beyond 2015. Originality/value The WFWP differs from the existing social sustainability studies because it relates the material information to social data; also, it defines the best option among the analysed alternatives, taking into consideration social sustainability, which enables the project design to go beyond technical aspects. The constructive typology and materials take into account the social sustainability of the construction supply chain, generating more sustainable projects and improving the circumstances of affected stakeholders.

J	Zhang, RP; Lingard, H; Oswald, D				Zhang, Rita Peihua; Lingard, Helen; Oswald, David			Impact of Supervisory Safety Communication on Safety Climate and Behavior in Construction Workgroups	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Supervisor; Safety communication; Safety climate; Workgroup; Construction	TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONAL SAFETY; MODEL; INTERVENTION; PERFORMANCE; ACCIDENTS; SUPPORT; DIMENSIONS; RESPONSES; COWORKERS	In industries in which organizations work in decentralized and distributed structures such as construction, workers are more likely to be influenced by their workgroup supervisors than upper-level management. A study was conducted to quantitatively examine the relationships among supervisory safety communication, group safety climate, and safety behaviors, as well as to qualitatively explore effective ways for supervisors to communicate safety expectations and information to workers. A survey was conducted among workers engaged in rail construction work in Melbourne, Australia. Survey data were collected from 20 workgroups across 11 different worksites. Participant observation was also performed on these worksites to observe safety-related interactions and communication between supervisors and workers. The quantitative research results show that supervisory safety communication practices play a critical role in shaping safety climate within workgroups, which subsequently affects workers' self-reported safety compliance and safety participation behaviors. The on-site participant observations identified various characteristics of effective safety communication between supervisors and coworkers, including regular engagement, consistent messages and actions, active listening, approachability, personal messages, and respectful delivery. The research results provide important practical implications for construction organizations to dedicate resources to developing supervisors' leadership capabilities and personal skills, which could contribute to improved safety communication and safety performance in the workplace.

Behavior management thus plays a key role in enhancing safety, and particularly, behavior observation is the most critical element for modifying workers' behavior in a safe manner. However, there is a lack of practical methods to measure workers' behavior in construction. To analyze workers' actions, this paper uses an advanced and economical depth sensor to collect motion data and then investigates consequent motion-analysis techniques to detect the unsafe actions of workers, which is the main focus of this paper. First, motion data are transformed onto a three-dimensional (3D) space as a preprocess, motion classification is performed to identify a typical prior, and the selected prior is used to detect the same action in a testing data set. As a case study, motion data for unsafe actions in ladder climbing (i.e.,backward-facing climbing, climbing with an object, and reaching far to a side) are collected and used to detect the actions in a new testing data set in which the actions are randomly taken. The result shows that 90.91% of unsafe actions are correctly detected in the experiment. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Falls from heights: A computer vision-based approach for safety harness detection	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Convolution neural network; Falls from height; Harness; Unsafe behavior	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; ACTION RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WORKERS; BIM; PREVENTION; RISK; GENERATION; MODELS	Falls from heights (FFH) are major contributors of injuries and deaths in construction. Yet, despite workers being made aware of the dangers associated with not wearing a safety harness, many forget or purposefully do not wear them when working at heights. To address this problem, this paper develops an automated computer vision-based method that uses two convolutional neural network (CNN) models to determine if workers are wearing their harness when performing tasks while working at heights. The algorithms developed are: (1) a Faster-R-CNN to detect the presence of a worker; and (2) a deep CNN model to identify the harness. A database of photographs of people working at heights was created from activities undertaken on several construction projects in Wuhan, China. The database was then used to test and train the developed networks. The precision and recall rates for the Faster R-CNN were 99% and 95%, and the CNN models 80% and 98%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the developed method can accurately detect workers not wearing their harness. Thus, the computer vision-based approach developed can be used by construction and safety managers as a mechanism to proactively identify unsafe behavior and therefore take immediate action to mitigate the likelihood of a FFH occurring.

Examining the Relationship between Construction Workers' Visual Attention and Situation Awareness under Fall and Tripping Hazard Conditions: Using Mobile Eye Tracking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Situation awareness; Cognitive ability; Hazard identification; Attention; Construction safety; Eye tracking	MOVEMENTS; TRIPS; SLIPS; ACCIDENTS; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; INJURIES	The risk of major occupational accidents involving tripping hazards is commonly underestimated with a large number of studies having been conducted to better understand variables that affect situation awareness: the ability to detect, perceive, and comprehend constantly evolving surroundings. An important property that affects situation awareness is the limited capacity of the attentional system. To maintain situation awareness while exposed to tripping hazards, a worker needs to obtain feedforward information about hazards, detect immediate tripping hazards, and visually scan surroundings for any potential environmental hazards. Despite the importance of situation awareness, its relationship with attention remains unknown in the construction industry. To fill this theoretical knowledge gap, this study examines differences in attentional allocation between workers with low and high situation awareness levels while exposed to tripping hazards in a real construction site. Participants were exposed to tripping hazards on a real jobsite while walking along a path in the presence of other workers. Situation awareness was measured using the situation awareness rating technique, and subjects' eye movements were tracked as direct measures of attention via a wearable mobile eye tracker. Investigating the attentional distribution of subjects by examining fixation-count heat maps and scan paths revealed that as workers with higher situation awareness walked, they periodically looked down and scanned ahead to remain fully aware of the environment and its associated hazards. Furthermore, this study quantitatively compared the differences between the eye-tracking metrics of worker with different situation awareness levels (low versus high) using permutation simulation. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that subjects did not allocate their attention equally to all hazardous areas of interest, and these differences in attentional distribution were modulated by the workers' level of situation awareness. This study advances theory by presenting one of the first attempts to use mobile eye-tracking technology to examine the role of cognitive processes (i.e.,attention) in human error (i.e.,failure to identify a hazard) and occupational accidents.

J	Goh, YM; Sa'adon, NFB				Goh, Yang Miang; Sa'adon, Nur Faddilah Binte			Cognitive Factors Influencing Safety Behavior at Height: A Multimethod Exploratory Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cognitive analysis; Safety behavior; Theory of planned behavior; Construction safety; Neural network; Decision tree; Data mining; Migrant worker; Working at height; Labor and personnel issues	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; NEURAL-NETWORK; HEALTH; ACCIDENTS; INJURIES; WORKERS; FALLS; MODEL	Despite efforts in recent years, the construction industry remains one of the top contributors for workplace fatalities in many countries. One of the key concerns in the industry is the management of workers' safety behavior. This paper aims to explore the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of not anchoring a safety harness when working at height. In addition, multiple stepwise linear regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree techniques were applied in the study to assess their usefulness in evaluating survey data of safety cognitive factors. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was adopted to model the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of scaffolders. The TPB postulates that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms affect the intention of workers, which ultimately affects intentional behavior. The unsafe act of not anchoring harnesses while working on a scaffold was selected as the focal behavior based on observations and interviews with safety supervisors. Supervisors also provided their opinions on the underlying reasons for the unsafe act. A questionnaire was then developed based on the site observations, interviews, and literature review. Subsequently, 40 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, and China were surveyed. Stepwise multiple linear regression, neural network, and decision tree analyses were implemented. The analyses revealed that subjective norm was the key variable influencing a worker's decision to anchor the safety harness. The significance of subjective norm was probably affected by the national culture of the migrant workers. In addition, the analyses showed that the relationships between the variables were probably nonlinear, thus neural network and decision tree are suitable techniques. The exploratory study provides the basis for design of an in-depth study on the cognitive factors influencing safety behavior and it expands the choice of analyses techniques.

Video-Based Motion Trajectory Forecasting Method for Proactive Construction Safety Monitoring Systems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Falls, struck-bys, and caught-in/betweens are among the most common types of fatal accidents on construction sites. Despite their significance, the majority of today's accident prevention programs react passively to situations in which workers or equipment enter predefined unsafe zones. To support systems that proactively prevent these accidents, this paper presents a path prediction model for workers and equipment. The model leverages the extracted video frames to predict upcoming worker and equipment motion trajectories on construction sites. Specifically, the model takes two-dimensional (2D) tracks of workers and equipment from visual data-based on computer vision methods for detection and tracking-and uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder followed by a mixture density network (MDN) to predict their locations. A multihead prediction module is introduced to predict locations at different future times. The method is validated on an existing dataset, TrajNet, and a new dataset of 105 high-definition videos recorded over 30 days from a real-world construction site. On the TrajNet dataset, the proposed model significantly outperforms Social LSTM. On the new dataset, the presented model outperforms conventional time-series models and achieves average localization errors of 7.30, 12.71, and 24.22 pixels for 10, 20, and 40 future steps, respectively. The benefits and limitations of the method to worker and equipment path prediction are discussed.

An exploratory study of safety communication networks of ethnic minority crews in the Hong Kong construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety and health; Safety communication network; Ethnic minority workers; Social network analysis	MIGRANT WORKERS; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; CLIMATE; HEALTH; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; FATALITIES; CENTRALITY; OUTCOMES	Purpose Previous studies have highlighted that communication barrier was one of the major safety problems faced by ethnic minority (EM) workers. This study aims to model the predominant safety communication networks of EM crews and explore the relationships among safety communication networks, individual attributes, safety climate, near misses and injuries of EM crews. Design/methodology/approach Case studies were conducted with EM crews in the Hong Kong construction industry. Demographic attribute, network, safety climate and accidents data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed by a combination of social network analysis (SNA), cross-case comparison and nonparametric tests. Findings The results revealed that language proficiency, network density and level of reciprocity were contributing factors of distinguishing high and low safety performing EM crews. EM management received more safety information from EM workers than local management. The centrality of EM workers was significantly related to their age, the perceived priority of safety and language ability. Practical implications The research findings regarding the impact of safety communication network characteristics on the safety performance of EM crews provides insights to employers on how to cultivate effective safety communication patterns within EM crews that can lead to better safety performance. The connections between personal attributes and their positions in safety communication networks could help the employers identify the EM workers who are positioned on edges of networks and need more attention. Originality/value This study contributes to knowledge by enriching the limited research on analyzing safety communication of small construction crews using SNA and expanding the research object to EM construction crews in the literature, who are more vulnerable to construction accidents. This research also extends the existing body of knowledge from studies mainly carried out in Western culture to Eastern culture. Although safety communication has been regarded as important for EM workers, there is a lack of quantitative analysis on this at a crew level. The present study provides empirical research to reveal authentic safety communication networks and their connections with safety performance and personal attributes.

J	El Ammari, K; Hammad, A				El Ammari, Khaled; Hammad, Amin			Remote interactive collaboration in facilities management using BIM-based mixed reality	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Facilities management; Mixed reality; Feature-based tracking; Building information modeling; Remote interactive visual collaboration	AUGMENTED REALITY; BUILDING INFORMATION; NATURAL MARKERS; AWARENESS; GUIDANCE	Facilities Management (FM) day-to-day tasks require suitable methods to facilitate work orders and improve performance by better collaboration between the office and the field. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is developed and tested in a case study.

J	Hwang, S; Lee, S				Hwang, Sungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			Wristband-type wearable health devices to measure construction workers' physical demands	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Physical demands; Occupational health and safety; Wearable devices; Heart rate reserve; Activity analysis; Work physiology	HEART-RATE; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; SUBMAXIMAL EXERCISE; PRODUCTIVITY; WORKFORCE; WORKLOAD; STRAIN; HAWTHORNE; FATIGUE; RESERVE	Recent advancements in wearable health devices equipped with biosensor systems (e.g., heart rate (HR) sensor) have provided an ample opportunity to continuously measure and understand workers' physical demands from construction work. Specifically, a relative measurement of physical demands, which is a percentage of HR reserve (%HRR), is convenient and useful by normalizing individual differences of HR. Since affordable HR monitoring using wearable devices (particularly, a comfortable wristband-type device: wristband hereafter) becomes available, %HRR-based physical demand measurement, which can be continuously calculated without interfering with workers' ongoing work, provides an enormous potential to protect workers' safety and health and to sustain expected productivity. This research investigates the usefulness of affordable %HRR-based physical demand measurement using a wristband from a case study of 19 workers in construction sites. The aim of the analysis is to examine the potential of this continuous measurement in capturing any significant physical demand variations, by investigating in-depth information on factors affecting physical demands (e.g., work tasks, individual and environmental factors). The results show that workers' physical demands are highly variable according to their working patterns (i.e., direct work, and indirect work including tool/equipment/ material handling, traveling, and preparatory work), combined influences of work tasks, as well as individual and environmental factors (e.g., age and heat stress). These results demonstrate the need for continuous physical measurement during workers' ongoing work so that any significant high physical demands, which need to be avoided if possible, can be captured. The findings of this paper show that the continuous measurement of physical demands using a wristband provides rich information to understand, manage, and design physically demanding construction work (e.g., flexible work-rest cycle and managing demanding indirect work) by balancing workloads throughout a day and/or reducing unnecessary physical demands beyond direct work. By anticipating potential health and safety problems from excessive physical demands, as well as productivity loss before they occur, this research will have an ameliorative impact across the construction industry.

J	Choi, B; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			An Empirically Based Agent-Based Model of the Sociocognitive Process of Construction Workers' Safety Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Safety behavior; Sociocognitive process; Agent-based modeling; Labor and personnel issues	PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; PERCEIVED EXTERNAL PRESTIGE; ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION; SOCIAL IDENTITY; AFFECTIVE COMMITMENT; SELF-CATEGORIZATION; RISK PERCEPTION; HONG-KONG; CLIMATE; INDUSTRY	Workers' unsafe behaviors have a substantial impact on construction safety. To regulate workers' unsafe behavior, construction practitioners have mainly used formal controls (e.g.,penalties). However, the formal approaches may not be effective at eliciting desired behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. Therefore, recently, researchers have paid more attention to how unsafe behaviors are produced. In this regard, cognitive models of safety behavior and empirical evidence on social influence have been suggested. However, there is a noticeable paucity of research investigating the mechanism behind the link between cognitive process, social influence, site risk, and safety behavior. In this paper, an empirically based agent-based model that incorporates theoretical and empirical findings of the sociocognitive process of workers' safety behaviors is developed. The model is used to conduct experiments examining how the sociocognitive process interacts with safety management interventions (i.e.,strictness and frequency of management feedback, and project identification) and influences workers' safety behaviors across different site risk conditions (i.e.,low-, modest-, and high-risk conditions). The results demonstrated that all three interventions contribute to decreasing the incident rate. Also, the interaction effects of the interventions in different site risk conditions were found using the parameter sweeping. The results indicated that (1)promoting workers' project identification would be an effective strategy in the modest-risk site condition; (2)other interventions should be combined after achieving the medium strictness of management feedback in the high-risk site condition; and (3)other interventions would not be effective without very strict management feedback in the low-risk site condition. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on construction safety by extending the authors' understanding of the role of sociocognitive process and its interaction with the environment in shaping workers' safety behaviors. Additionally, the experiment results are expected to lay a strong foundation for developing effective safety management interventions in the construction projects.

However, work teams are complex systems with interdependence between workers and the social environment, and exhibit surprising, nonlinear behavior. This study utilizes Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to understand the complexity of project team member selection and to examine how the functional diversity of teams and worker interdependence affect team performance in different economic conditions. Data for model validation was collected from 116 construction projects for the period from 2009 to 2011. The results show that teams with higher functional diversity can enhance the overall firm performance when the economy is in a downturn. This study suggests managers using knowledge of worker interdependence to protect higher-performing workers by minimizing disruption of interdependence in team member selection for improving firm performance.

Previous research has indicated that these dimensions are significant in establishing such a relationship, which is essential to creating good work. These dimensions are also influential in their effect on the psychological state of workers and are translated specifically into actionable items in the workplace. A hypothetical system model is developed to relate these dimensions to one another, to workers, and to organizations. This set of dimensions also serves as a basis for further development of work design and evaluation tools.

J	Konstantinou, E; Brilakis, I				Konstantinou, Eirini; Brilakis, Ioannis			Matching Construction Workers across Views for Automated 3D Vision Tracking On-Site	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stereo vision; Three-dimensional (3D) tracking; Worker monitoring; Corresponding points	MULTIPLE; CAMERAS	Computer vision-based tracking methods are used to track construction resources for productivity and safety purposes. This type of tracking requires that targets be accurately matched across multiple camera views to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) trajectory out of two or more two-dimensional (2D) trajectories. This matching is straightforward when it involves easily distinguishable targets in uncluttered scenes. This can be challenging in industrial scenes such as construction sites due to congestion, occlusions, and workers in greatly similar high-visibility apparel. This paper proposes a novel vision-based method that addresses all these issues. It uses as input the output of a 2D vision-based tracking method and searches for potential matches in three sequential steps. It terminates only when a positive match is found. The first step returns the strongest candidate by correlating a segment of workers' past 2D trajectories. The second uses geometric restrictions, whereas the third correlates color intensity values. The proposed method features a promising performance of 97% precision, 98% recall, and 95% accuracy.

This paper presents findings about emerging radio frequency (RF) remote sensing and actuating technology that can improve construction safety by warning or alerting workers-on-foot and equipment operators in a pro-active real-time mode once equipment gets too close in proximity to unknown or other equipment. A review is provided on the background and importance of safety related to various pieces of construction equipment. Pro-active real-time proximity and alert technology for daily construction operations is introduced to solve this problem. Results of various field experiments that tested the proximity and alert technology are presented. A discussion follows on how such technology can improve objective construction site safety data collection and lead to more effective construction workforce safety training and education.

Exploiting the integrated sensors of ubiquitous mobile phones offers an unprecedented opportunity for an automated approach to workers' activity recognition. In addition, machine learning (ML) methodologies provide the complementary computational part of the process. In this paper, smartphones are used in an unobtrusive way to capture body movements by collecting data using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Construction activities of various types have been simulated and collected data are used to train five different types of ML algorithms. Activity recognition accuracy analysis has been performed for all the different categories of activities and ML classifiers in user-dependent and-independent ways. Results indicate that neural networks outperform other classifiers by offering an accuracy ranging from 87% to 97% for user-dependent and 62% to 96% for user-independent categories.

Detecting excessive load-carrying tasks using a deep learning network with a Gramian Angular Field	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety; Overexertion; Worker monitoring; Wearable computing; Load carrying	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; POSTURE RECOGNITION; GAIT; CARRIAGE; WALKING; SPINE; SYSTEM; PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY; ACCELEROMETERS	Manual load carrying without sufficient rest may cause work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) and needs to be monitored at construction sites. While previous studies have been able to predict load-carrying modes using multiple wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, wearing multiple sensors obtrudes on workers during various construction tasks. In this context, by using a single IMU sensor, this research proposes an automatic detecting technique for excessive carrying -load (DeTECLoad) to predict load-carrying weights and postures simultaneously. DeTECLoad converts the IMU data into image data using a Gramian Angular Field, and then uses a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory to classify load-carrying modes from the image data. DeTECLoad provides 92.46% and 96.33% accuracies for the load-carrying weight and posture classifications, respectively. By exploiting DeTECLoad, a construction worker's excessive load-carrying tasks could be managed in situ, helping to prevent construction site WMSDs.

Nevertheless, the measurement of workers' behavior has not been actively applied in practice, due to the difficulties in observing workers on jobsites. In an effort to provide a robust and automated means for worker observation, this paper proposes a framework of vision-based unsafe action detection for behavior monitoring. The framework consists of (1) the identification of critical unsafe behavior, (2) the collection of relevant motion templates and site videos, (3) the 3D skeleton extraction from the videos, and (4) the detection of unsafe actions using the motion templates and skeleton models. For a proof of concept, experimental studies are undertaken to detect unsafe actions during ladder climbing (i.e., reaching far to a side) in motion datasets extracted from videos. The result indicates that the proposed framework can potentially perform well at detecting predefined unsafe actions in videos. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These methods detect bounding boxes and use hand-made rules to enable personal protective equipment compliance checks. This paper presents a new method to improve the breadth and depth of vision-based safety compliance checking by explicitly classifying worker-tool interactions. A detection model is trained on a newly constructed image dataset for construction sites, achieving 52.9% average mean precision for 10 object categories and 89.4% average precision for detecting workers. Using this detector and new dataset, the proposed human-object interaction recognition model achieved 79.78% precision and 77.64% recall for hard hat checking; 79.11% precision and 75.29% recall for safety coloring checking. The new model also verifies hand protection for workers when tools are being used with 66.2% precision and 64.86% recall. The proposed model is superior in these checking tasks when compared with post-processing detected objects with hand-made rules, or applying detected objects only.

IT usage in Alberta's building construction projects: Current status and challenges	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						productivity; information technology; construction; Canada; labour; communication		The Construction Industry lags behind other industries in its acquisition and use of modern technology. As a result construction workers are dissatisfied with the level and availability of communication systems and channels. Construction managers are not confident to acquire modern technologies to the construction workplace, because of the unavailability of information on worker abilities, available technologies, possible outcomes, related costs and benefits and so on. Technology providers are also lagging in the understanding of the information related to construction industry specific needs. There were no direct studies noted in Canada that were focusing the construction stakeholder views - workers, managers, and technology providers related to the information technology (IT). This paper presents the views of three different construction industry stakeholders regarding the possibilities and opportunities in using Information Technology in construction project to improve communication and worker satisfaction. The paper ends with a set of recommendations for enhancing the usage of IT tools and systems on construction projects. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deep learning for site safety: Real-time detection of personal protective equipment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Personal protective equipment (PPE); Construction safety; Deep learning; Transfer learning; Image dataset; Real-time object detection	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONSTRUCTION; OBJECTS; MODEL	The leading causes of construction fatalities include traumatic brain injuries (resulted from fall and electrocution) and collisions (resulted from struck by objects). As a preventive step, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) of workers (e.g., hard hat and vest) at all times. This paper presents three deep learning (DL) models built on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture to verify PPE compliance of workers; i.e., if a worker is wearing hard hat, vest, or both, from image/video in real-time. In the first approach, the algorithm detects workers, hats, and vests and then, a machine learning model (e.g., neural network and decision tree) verifies if each detected worker is properly wearing hat or vest. In the second approach, the algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and verifies PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In the third approach, the algorithm first detects only the workers in the input image which are then cropped and classified by CNN-based classifiers (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception) according to the presence of PPE attire. All models are trained on an in-house image dataset that is created using crowd-sourcing and web-mining. The dataset, named Pictor-v3, contains similar to 1,500 annotated images and similar to 4,700 instances of workers wearing various combinations of PPE components. It is found that the second approach achieves the best performance, i.e., 72.3% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 11 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a good candidate for running on light-weight mobile devices. The closest alternative in terms of performance (67.93% mAP) is the third approach where VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception classifiers are assembled in a Bayesian framework. However, the first approach is the fastest among all and can process 13 FPS with 63.1% mAP. The crowed-sourced Pictor-v3 dataset and all trained models are publicly available to support the design and testing of other innovative applications for monitoring safety compliance, and advancing future research in automation in construction.

As part of a large study, the authors developed and implemented a 5-h training program to improve construction supervisors' safety-efficacy, in order to enhance the safety climate on construction worksites. The training program covered fall prevention, silica exposure, leadership, communication, and safety planning. This study evaluated pretraining and posttraining changes and safety-efficacy six months posttraining. A total of 118 supervisors, contractors, and workers from more than 50 construction firms in Massachusetts attended the training. Statistically significant improvements were observed in participants' safety knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Six-months postintervention, 58% of supervisors, contractors, or both, perceived that the training contributed "a lot" to their ability to communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking workers, to take on a safety leadership role (52%), and to conduct effective training (62%). This study determined that when supervisors perceive that they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make changes, they may better fulfill their role as a safety leader. Construction supervisor training courses might be revised to include leadership and effective communication topics.

Identifying correlates of breaks in occupational sitting: a cross-sectional study	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						active design; building design; health risks; office design; physical activity; sedentary behaviour; sitting; well-being; workplace design	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR; SPATIAL CONFIGURATION; HEALTH-RISKS; TIME; INTERVENTION; COMMUNICATION; WORKSTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; INNOVATION	Office workers are commonly targeted in interventions to modify their sitting behaviour, yet there is limited evidence of the correlates of breaks in sitting to inform intervention development. This study identifies the individual, workplace and spatial configuration correlates of the frequency of breaks in sitting (number/hour) in office workers (n=5531) stratified by office type (private-enclosed, shared, open plan). All behaviours and potential correlates were measured via self-report using an online cross-sectional survey. Regression analyses revealed age was the only socio-demographic characteristic associated with frequency of breaks in sitting in all office types. Greater job autonomy and local connectivity were positively associated with frequency of breaks in sitting in shared and open-plan offices. In open-plan offices co-worker proximity was negatively associated with frequency of breaks in sitting. Co-worker visibility was positively associated with frequency of breaks in sitting in all office types. This study demonstrates that individual, workplace and spatial configuration factors are all associated with the frequency of breaks in sitting and that these relationships differ by office type. These observations extend prior studies that have only examined correlates at a single level (e.g. the individual). This evidence could be useful to guide future interventions in the design of workplaces to increase breaks in sitting and workers' physical activity.

This study analyzes occupational risk and focuses specifically on the question of perception of risk based on a sample of construction workers from three countries (Spain, Peru, and Nicaragua) that, in spite of sharing the same language (Spanish), have different socioeconomic levels. The model used for this study is based on the psychometric paradigm. The results of the survey using a questionnaire indicate that the sample population can be separated into two different clusters, each characterized either by a high or a low perception of risk. The authors then attempted to establish a link between the level of perceived risk and different socio-demographic variables. The outcome is that only the training variable significantly altered the perception of risk. This finding, as well as various other aspects of risk perception from the different nations, are discussed. The conclusions of this study provide interesting guidelines for risk management for the construction industry, such as, for example, the increase of the number of hours of worker safety and health training or that the nationality the workers does not appear to affect worker risk perception.

Active leading indicators, for example capturing hazardous proximity situations between workers-on-foot and heavy construction equipment, provide an additional metric for construction site personnel safety performance without incurring accidents. This article presents a method for recording, identifying, and analyzing interactive hazardous near miss situations between workers-on-foot and heavy construction equipment. Spatiotemporal GPS data are analyzed to automatically measure a hazard index that is visualized in form of a heat map. The graphical representation of computationally identified individual values in up-to-date building information models allows automatically generated personalized safety performance reports. These are based on specific near miss locations, environmental conditions, and equipment types. The presented research is based on previous isolated research efforts in equipment blind spot measurement, real-time location tracking, and proximity alert technology. It contributes the definitions and experimental validation of new safety parameters such as entry of worker-on-foot in equipment blind spot to determine the root causes that lead to equipment- and visibility-related fatalities on construction sites. Analysis of these root causes is important in preventing accidents in the first place. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To prevent undesired results from adverse emotional and mental states, active interventions for workers are important. Taking scaffolders on site as specific objects, a multicomponent (with two intervention sessions) and neurophysiological intervention during working intervals is proposed in this research. A sample of 10 participants is randomly assigned to either an intervention group or control group. Emotional and mental inducement is conducted in advance to simulate the states of scaffolders in normal working conditions. Then a simple, rapid, and active intervention, consisting of a progressive muscle relaxation session and a trigeminal nerve stimulation session, is applied to the experimental group in a lounge environment for 13 min. For the control group, a normal resting mode (i.e. sitting still) is adopted instead. During the experiment, a wearable electroencephalogram sensor is used to collect electrical signals from related brain regions of a subject. Based on corresponding indices, the emotional and mental states of subjects are indicated by electroencephalogram signals. The combined effects of the progressive muscle relaxation and trigeminal nerve stimulation sessions in adjusting adverse emotional and mental states of high-altitude construction workers are determined by statistical analysis.

SWP can then transmit these personal data to the cloud for training the machine learning models and offer safety alerts or health insights. However, there are two urgently important challenges. Firstly, the machine learning model needs to aggregate the SWPs' image data from each construction worker, which may pose a risk to private data leakage without strict privacy and security agreement. In addition, the machine learning models trained on all SWPs' image data may compromise the personalization of image-based OHS status monitoring for each construction worker. To address the above issues, this study proposes a FedSWP framework, the federated transfer learning-enabled SWP for protecting the personal image information of construction workers in OHS management. FedSWP executes the gradient parameters aggregation through federated learning for the image data in each SWP and builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Crane operators' facial fatigue monitoring experiments are conducted and have evaluated that FedSWP can achieve accurate and personalized safety alerts and healthcare. This study paves the way for the generalization and extension of FedSWP in many construction OHS applications.

Construction work is tough and physically demanding, and the difficulty is exacerbated by the hot and humid weather of tropical and subtropical regions. Having established heat stress models through different environmental indicators, this study aims to ascertain which environmental indicator would be better able to predict the effects of heat stress on construction workers. Field studies were conducted during the summer in Hong Kong from July 2011 to August 2011. Physiological, work-related, environmental, and personal parameters were measured to validate the established heat stress models on the basis of 411 sets of synchronized meteorological and physiological data collected from construction workers on two different construction sites. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Theil's U inequality coefficient were used to assess these models in terms of predictive accuracy. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) was found to have the highest validity (MAPE=6.5%; Theil's U inequality coefficient=0.05) and practicality in predicting the effects of heat stress on construction workers. Specific heat stress guidelines can be formulated based on the WBGT, which can protect the health and safety of site personnel working in hot and humid weather conditions.	[Yi, Wen; Chan, Albert P.

Construction workers' intention to act safely can be instable under conflicting information from safety management, co-workers and habitual unsafe behaviour. Existing research explained the mechanism of unsafe behaviours as individual decisions but failed to include AA, as the co-existence of both positive and negative attitude. Design/methodology/approach This study applied system dynamics to explore factors of construction workers' AA and simulate the process of mitigating the ambivalence for less safety behaviour. Specifically, the group model building approach with eight experts was used to map the causal loop diagram and field questionnaire of 209 construction workers were used to collect empirical data for initiating parameters. Findings The group model building identified five direct factors of AA, namely the organisational safety support, important others' safety attitude, emotional arousal, safety production experience and work pressure, with seven feedback paths. The questionnaire survey obtained the initial values of the factors in the SD model, with the average ambivalence at 0.389. The ambivalence between cognitive and affective safety attitude was the highest. Model simulation results indicated that safety experience and work pressure had the most significant effects, and safety experience and positive attitude of co-workers could compensate the pressure from tight schedule and budget. Originality/value This study provided a new perspective of the dynamic safety attitude under the co-existence of positive and negative attitude, identified its driving factors and their influencing paths. The group model building approach and field questionnaire surveys were used to provide convincible suggestions for empirical safety management with least and most effective approaches and possible interventions to prevent unsafe behaviour with tight schedule and budget.

Evolution of the i-Booth (c) onsite information management kiosk	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Information technology; Tool time; Productivity; Virtual supervision; Worker satisfaction	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS; CONSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; PROJECT	Inadequate communication and non-availability of information have been widely observed in construction projects, causing low productivity and tool times of around 50% in high-rise building construction projects. The use of information technology to overcome communication barriers has been extremely limited at the construction site level, as construction companies typically hesitate to adopt new technologies. However, workers have expressed their willingness and ability to use new technologies at the construction site level. By considering the views of all the relevant construction stakeholders - workers, managers and technology developers - a novel information technology based communication concept called the Information Booth was developed and was pilot tested in an actual construction project environment, improving the tool time, productivity and worker satisfaction. The Information Booth then evolved into the i-Booth (c) with many additional features, including virtual supervision with a real-time information synchronizing system and camera system. This paper describes the possible applications of information technologies in the construction industry with the introduction of the i-Booth (c). Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Extensive research efforts have addressed the effects of HHCs. However, these efforts have been inconsistent in their approach for selecting factors influencing workers in such conditions. There are also increasing concerns about the drop-off in research interest to follow through intrusive and non-real-time measurements. This review aims to identify the major research gaps in measurements applied in previous research with careful attention paid to the factors that influence the intrusiveness and selection of the applied data collection methods. Design/methodology/approach This research integrates a manual subjective discussion with a thematic analysis of Leximancer software and an elaborating chronological, geographical and methodological review that yielded 701 articles and 76 peer-reviewed most related articles. Findings The literature included the physiological parameters as influencing factors and useful indicators for HHC effects and identified site activity intensity as the most influencing work-related factor. In total, three main gaps were identified: (1) the role of substantial individual and work-related factors; (2) managerial interventions and the application of the right time against the right symptoms, sample size and measurement intervals and (3) applied methods of data collection; particularly, the intrusiveness of the utilised sensors. Practical implications The focus of researchers and practitioners should be in applying nonintrusive, innovative and real-time methods that can provide crew-level measurements. In particular, methods that can represent the actual effects of allocated tasks are aligned with real-time weather measurements, so proactive HHC-related preventions can be enforced on time. Originality/value This review contributes to the field of construction workers' safety in HHCs and enables researchers and practitioners to identify the most influential individual and work-related factors in HHCs. This review also proposes a framework for future research with suggestions to cover the highlighted research gaps and contributes to a critical research area in the construction industry.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of MSD among construction workers and identify the psychosocial and physical risk factors associated with their occurrence using an on-site survey instrument. One hundred forty seven construction workers (representing three trades) participated in the study. The 1-year prevalence of MSD was high with 61.2% reporting severe symptoms and 39.7% having some functional impairment due to MSD. Physical task requirement was the most important factor associated with MSD reflecting the physical nature of construction work. Economic and performance factors were the most stressful psychosocial factors reported and significantly increased the risk of reporting MSD. The findings of this research underscore the independent role that psychosocial factors play in the health and safety of construction workers. Understanding this role is imperative for practitioners and academics alike in the quest to make construction a safer work environment for all workers.

However, most existing BBS methods fail to look into the impact of the interactions between workers and their supervisors. To overcome this limitation, the impact of supervisor behaviors on safety climate and workers' behavioral performance is examined in this study. A supervisor-focused BBS method is proposed accordingly, which takes group-level safety climate as a mediator to encourage the supervisor behaviors to improve the workers' behavioral performance of construction projects. A case study was carried out in a construction project in Hong Kong. The statistical analysis proved that the intervention with supervisor behaviors resulted in significant improvement in the safety climate, the workers' behavioral safety performance, and the sustainability of the BBS impacts. The results demonstrated that focusing on supervisor behaviors is a viable approach for ameliorating the effectiveness and sustainability of BBS in improving the safety performance in the construction industry.

J	Zhu, ZH; Ren, XN; Chen, Z				Zhu, Zhenhua; Ren, Xiaoning; Chen, Zhi			Visual Tracking of Construction Jobsite Workforce and Equipment with Particle Filtering	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automatic identification systems; Data collection; Imaging techniques; Automation	VISION	Tracking workforce and equipment at construction jobsites has attracted considerable interest, considering its importance for productivity analysis, safety monitoring, and dynamic site layout planning, for example. Several real-time locating systems (RTLSs) are commercially available, but their requirements for attaching sensors or tags to a workers or equipment raise privacy concerns. Recently, the idea of using video cameras statically placed at construction jobsites to track workers and equipment has been proposed and tested. One challenge of visual tracking stems from jobsite occlusions, which significantly affect tracking performance. This paper presents a vision tracking method using particle filters to address the issue of occlusions at construction jobsites. The method includes two main phases. First, the worker or mobile equipment of interest is manually initiated with a rectangular window, and hundreds of particles are generated. Then each particle is propagated and its weight is calculated by measuring its observation likelihood. The particles are resampled based on their weights.

Traditional training approaches provide limited support for performing work tasks and receiving real-time feedback. This paper describes a cyber-physical postural training environment where workers can practice to perform work with reduced ergonomic risks. The proposed system uses wearable sensors, Vive trackers, machine learning and virtual reality to track body kinematics, and engagement with physical construction resources, and provides feedback via an interactive user interface. The postural training system was developed for training workers engaged in wood frame construction. User study of the effectiveness of the feedback and user interface was conducted. Findings showed that the user interface was perceived as convenient with limited interference with the workspace. The feedback was understandable in learning risks associated with participant's postures. Further research will involve conducting formative workload evaluation of the user interface and developing a reinforcement learning model for adapting the feedback based on the state of learning.

J	Rwamamara, R; Simonsson, P				Rwamamara, Romuald; Simonsson, Peter			SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE USE FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABILITY	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainability; construction industry; concrete casting; concrete workers; ergonomic risk assessment; design and constructability	RISK-FACTORS; ASSESSING EXPOSURE; BACK DISORDERS; ERGONOMICS	Many of those working on construction sites are exposed to demanding work loads; construction workers lift and carry heavy materials and work in awkward postures. Occupational injuries and accidents due to poor ergonomics are more common in the construction industry and many times lead to human tragedies, disrupt construction processes and adversely affect the cost, productivity, and the reputation of the construction industry. In Sweden, it is reported that concrete workers have the highest relative work-related musculoskeletal injury frequency. Therefore, the use of ergonomic production methods to prevent this can have a significant human, social and financial impact. Research introduced here presents a case study of comparative analyses of ergonomic situations for concrete workers performing concrete casting processes. Three different ergonomic risk assessment methods were used to assess the physical strain, hand-arm vibration and noise affects risks involved in concrete casting work tasks. The combination of technical and managerial factors results in a system where workers are as efficient and safe as possible during their work tasks, and thus, makes the construction work environment sustainable. The aim of our research is to find practical methods to evaluate and compare two different concrete casting methods from an ergonomic perspective. The focus is on the production of cast-in-place concrete bridge constructions where the traditional concrete casting method is compared with the SCC (Self-Compacting concrete) casting method. To be able to identify work-related musculoskeletal injury risks due to concrete casting work tasks, QEC (Quick Exposure Check for musculoskeletal risks), PLIBEL (Checklist for identification for Ergonomics Hazards) and ErgoSAM (Ergonomic production technology method) methods were used. Ergonomic risks analysis methods QEC, PLIBEL and ErgoSAM have all shown capabilities to evaluate construction work activities and thus determine whether a construction work activity constitutes a musculoskeletal risk to the worker or not before any ergonomic intervention is introduced. As a result the present ergonomic risks emanating from work methods used in the traditional concrete placing can be significantly reduced with the use of self-compacting concrete (SCC) that eliminates awkward work postures, noise and hand arm vibration, thereby reducing if not eliminating musculoskeletal injuries among concrete workers during their concrete casting work tasks.

As a significant risk factor of WMSDs, time spent in insecure operational postures should be proactively prevented. This study developed a real-time motion warning personal protective equipment (PPE) that enables workers' self-awareness and self-management of ergonomically hazardous operational pattern for the prevention of WMSDs based on wearable Inertial Measurement Units (WIMUs). Data processing and real-time warning algorithms are proposed for automatically risk postures assessment and warning through a connected smartphone application as soon as dangerous operational patterns are detected. The system was tested and validated with robust dinical motion data output and effective alarm ringing in both laboratory and field experiments on a construction site in Hong Kong. The proposed PPE provides an alternative to help construction workers prevent WMSDs without disturbance and distraction in operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This situation highlights a need for enhancing hazard-identification capabilities in, dynamic and unpredictable construction environments. Given the fact that hazards cause disruptions in workers' behaviors and responses, capturing such disruptions offers opportunities for identifying hazards. This study proposes a collective sensing approach that senses and assesses workers' gait abnormalities in order to identify physical fall hazards in a construction jobsite. Laboratory experiments simulating an ironworkers' working, environment were designed and conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed approach. A wearable inertial measurement unit (WIMU) attached to a subject's ankle collected kinematic gait data. The results indicated that the aggregated gait abnormality score from multiple subjects have a strong correlation with the existence of installed fall hazards such as obstacles and slippery surfaces. This outcome highlights the opportunity for future devices to use workers' abnormal gait responses to reveal safety hazards in construction environments.

Jordan			Knowledge Sharing and Productivity Improvement: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LEARNING-CURVE MODELS; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNITIES; MOTIVATION; DIVERSITY; EMPLOYEES	Labor productivity is a major determinant of project performance in construction. Models of labor productivity in construction tend to focus on learning curve theories that assume learning is an individual process with no transfer of knowledge among crew members. This paper seeks to extend theories of individual learning to capture the crew dynamics present on construction sites. Accordingly, this paper presents an agent-based model aimed at deriving the impacts of crew composition and project schedule on knowledge sharing and, thus, on task duration. The proposed model was calibrated using field observations of 201 interactions among 12 construction workers at a construction project in Beirut, Lebanon. The results indicate that more diverse crews witness higher levels of knowledge sharing and greater productivity gains. The results also suggest that schedules keeping all the workers busy eliminate the potential for knowledge sharing and thus only benefit from the baseline gains seen in individual learning. This work contributes to the literature by developing an agent-based model that simulates knowledge sharing in the construction industry at the worker level. The study is limited by its exclusion of multiskilled workers.	[Kiomjian, Daoud; Srour, Issam] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, POB 1107-2020, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Srour, F.

This study systematically integrates human factors in the form of worker competence into production scheduling. More specifically, the factors of worker learning rate, professional skills, experience in each type of operation, and operation specifications are all formulated to determine the duration of each process in precast production. A two-hierarchy scheduling optimization model (WCSO_PP) considering worker competence is proposed to synchronize the production scheduling with workforce development and to optimize the scheduling from both the short-term (time-oriented) and long-term (competence-oriented) views. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is validated using a real case study. The WCSO_PP model can achieve 74.09% and 73.01% cost savings in short-term and long-term scenarios, respectively. The developed model addresses the research gap in modeling the impact of human factors on the production, contributing to more reliable scheduling and enhancing the long-term human resource development.

Investigating Employee Turnover in the Construction Industry: A Psychological Contract Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Age; Construction workers; Emotional exhaustion; Employee turnover; Psychological contracts; Psychological contract breach; Labor and personnel issues	WORK-FAMILY CONFLICT; BREACH; CONSERVATION; RESOURCES; MODEL; SATISFACTION; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; SAFETY	Employee turnover has long been, and will continue to be, a significant concern in the construction industry. Organizations that can retain skilled employees have a stronger competitive advantage. In two independent studies in China and the Philippines, the authors investigated the role of psychological contract breach in predicting employee turnover in the construction industry. The results reveal that psychological contract breach results in emotional exhaustion, which in turn predicts employees' turnover intentions (Study 1) and actual turnover (Study 2). The results further suggest that younger as opposed to older construction workers who experience psychological contract breach are more likely to experience greater levels of emotional exhaustion and exit their organizations. Accordingly, to retain skilled workers, construction organizations should understand and continuously manage employees' psychological contract expectations and provide more support to younger workers. This paper offers significant theoretical contributions because it is one of the few in the construction literature that examine both employee turnover intentions and actual turnover from a psychological contract perspective.

Individual reactions and technology use behavior were studied over a six-month period among 342 workers being introduced to a new software technology application. While previous studies in the literature have reported gender or age differences separately, the pattern of results from the study reported here indicated that gender effects in individual adoption and use of technology differed based on age. Specifically, gender differences in technology perceptions became more pronounced among older workers, but a unisex pattern of results emerged among younger workers. The theory and empirical results are also discussed in relation to the widely employed technology acceptance model. The results from this study suggest that old stereotypes that portray "technology" as a male-oriented domain may be disappearing-particularly among younger workers. In light of these findings, theoretical implications for researchers and practical suggestions for managers are discussed.

Significant work has been done on improving and assessing productivity and activity at task, project, or industry levels. Task level productivity and activity analysis are used extensively within the construction industry for various purposes, including cost estimating, claim evaluation, and day-to-day project management. The assessment is mostly performed through visual observations and after-the-fact analyses even though previous studies show automatic translation of operations data into productivity information and provide spatial information of resources for specific construction operations. An original approach is presented that automatically assesses labor activity. Using data fusion of spatio-temporal and workers' thoracic posture data, a framework was developed for identifying and understanding the worker's activity type over time. This information is used to perform automatic work sampling that is expected to facilitate real-time productivity assessment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The dataset comprising 47,938 construction accidents recorded in Turkey was subjected to a detailed multi-step feature engineering approach, including data encoding, data scaling, dimension reduction, and data resampling. Predictions were performed through four tree-based ensemble machine learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Extra Trees, as well as a state-of-the-art optimization method for hyperparameter tuning, Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA-XGBoost presented the highest prediction rate with 0.8292 in terms of accuracy and 0.8120 with respect to AUROC. The findings may aid in predicting construction workers' post-accident disability status, resulting in a safer working environment and productivity planning in construction projects.

Data were collected from 128 construction professionals and workers over five consecutive working days using the experience-sampling method. The hierarchical linear modeling results indicated that in construction professionals and workers, the daily experience of self-efficacy was positively associated with daily work engagement, which in turn negatively influenced daily deviance behavior at work. The results also revealed the cross-level moderating effect; job control strengthened the within-person suppressing impact of work engagement on deviance behavior. This study provides episodic evidence for the impact of self-efficacy on work engagement and deviance behavior in the workplace. These findings contribute to the positive psychology knowledge in construction projects by unveiling the psychosocial mechanism of construction professionals and workers through the daily diary survey method to capture the daily fluctuation of beliefs, engagement, and deviance behavior and by revealing the resource accumulation corollary of the COR theory and the motivation process of the JD-R model to highlight the facilitating function of personal and job resources.

J	Yu, YT; Guo, HL; Ding, QH; Li, H; Skitmore, M				Yu, Yantao; Guo, Hongling; Ding, Qinghua; Li, Heng; Skitmore, Martin			An experimental study of real-time identification of construction workers' unsafe behaviors	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety; Construction workers; Unsafe behavior; Motion capture; Behavior identification and recognition	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Construction workers' unsafe behavior is one of the main reasons leading to construction accidents. However, the existing management approach to unsafe behaviors, e.g. Behavior-Based Safety (BBS), relies primarily on manual observation and recording, which not only consumes lots of time and cost but impossibly cover a whole construction site or all workers. To solve this problem and improve safety performance, an image-skeleton-based parameterized method has been proposed in a previous research to real-time identifying construction workers' unsafe behaviors. A theoretical framework has been developed with a preliminary test, but still lacking a comprehensive experiment to verify its validity, particularly in the recognition of the types of unsafe behaviors. This will have a serious impact on the extensive application of the method in real construction sites. Based on the method, this research designs and carries out a series of experiments involving three types of unsafe behaviors to examine its feasibility and accuracy, and determines the value ranges of relevant key parameters. The results of the experiment demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the method, being able to identify and distinguish unsafe behaviors in real time, as well as its limitations. This research not only benefits the extensive application of the method in construction safety management, but improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the method by identifying relevant future research focuses. Therefore this paper contributes to the practice as well as the body of knowledge of construction safety management.

Women in construction - Tapping the untapped resource to meet future demands	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A lack of skilled workers has become a global problem that is impacting the construction industry. To address the issue, the industry-working in partnership with government agencies-has developed programs to attract new workers for high-skill positions in construction. These workers include women and minorities. However, attracting women into a career field that is dominated by conflict and aggression is problematic. Consequently, the industry is making a significant effort to change their image and culture, and these efforts are being supported by professional associations, labor unions, and universities. This paper highlights the current status of women in construction trades, management, education, and research positions. The paper also identifies many of the challenges women face in the construction industry and the many opportunities and support networks that are available to help them succeed.

This study aims to explain critical antecedents and cognitive mechanisms of construction workers' SCBs based on an integrated theoretical framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and norm activation model (NAM). This study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire survey to 719 construction workers in China. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that personal norms (PNs), attitudes toward SCB (ATT), subjective norms (SNs), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) have significant positive impacts on the intention of SCB, and the size of direct effects decreases in turn. The study also confirmed the significant indirect effects of SN on behavioral intention by way of ATT, PBC, and PN; ATT, PN, and PBC predicted SCB through the mediating processes of SCB intention. The study demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the integrative model in predicting workers' intentions to adopt SCBs and provides targeted suggestions and strategies for the sustainable development of safety management. These findings have meaningful implications for academic research on SCBs and the industrial practice of safety management.

Training of Low-Literacy and Low-English-Proficiency Hispanic Workers on Construction Fall Fatality	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Occupational health and safety; Training; Visualization; Fall protection; Case study	OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; UNITED-STATES; SAFETY; INDUSTRY; HEALTH; EDUCATION; ISSUES	The construction industry has made extensive efforts to improve the safety of its labor force through various approaches, including training. However, many construction workers in the United States are recent immigrants who lack English proficiency and do not possess sufficient literacy levels in their own language for training comprehension. This reduces the effectiveness of traditional text-dominated translated training materials, which depend on both literacy and proficiency in a language. Thus, in this study, the authors used three-dimensional (3D) visualization to overcome the communication barriers that hinder effective safety training for low-literacy (LL) and low-English-proficiency (LEP) construction workers. This article summarizes the contributions of a study sponsored by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Susan Harwood Training Grant Program; it describes the methodology to develop scenario-based 3D training materials on fall safety for LL and LEP workers and to validate the effectiveness of the materials. The results show that 3D training materials improve interaction between trainer and trainee during safety training, facilitate learning processes, and can overcome some of the communication barriers that hinder effective safety training.

J	Chi, S; Han, S; Kim, DY				Chi, Seokho; Han, Sangwon; Kim, Dae Young			Relationship between Unsafe Working Conditions and Workers' Behavior and Impact of Working Conditions on Injury Severity in US Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Degree of injury; Unsafe working conditions; Unsafe worker behavior	SAFETY MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; FALLS; VARIABLES; SITES; ROOFS; MODEL	Unsafe acts of workers (e.g.,misjudgment or inappropriate operation) become the major root causes of construction accidents when they are combined with unsafe working conditions (e.g.,work surface conditions or weather) on a construction site. The overarching goal of the research presented in this paper is to explore ways to prevent unsafe acts of workers and reduce the likelihood of construction accidents occurring. The study specifically aims to (1)understand the relationships between human behavior related and working condition related risk factors, (2)identify the significant behavior and condition factors and their impacts on accident types (e.g.,struck by/against, caught in/between, falling, shock, inhalation/ingestion/absorption, or respiratory failure) and injury severity (e.g.,fatality, hospitalized, or nonhospitalized), and (3)analyze the fundamental accident-injury relationship on how each accident type contributes to the injury severity. The study reviewed 9,358 accidents that occurred in the U.S. construction industry between 2002 and 2011. The large number of accident samples supported reliable statistical analyses. The analysis identified a total of 17 significant correlations between behavior and condition factors and distinguished key risk factors that highly impacted on the determination of accident types and injury severity. The research outcomes will assist safety managers to control specific unsafe acts of workers by eliminating the associated unsafe working conditions and vice versa. They also can prioritize risk factors and pay more attention to controlling them to achieve a safer working environment. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Development of a tool to monitor static balance of construction workers for proactive fall safety management	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Fall prevention; Proactive safety; Wearable Inertial Measurement Unit; Construction industry	SINGLE-LEG BALANCE; POSTURAL STABILITY; RISK; INDUSTRY; FATIGUE; PREVENTION; SYSTEM; MUSCLE; MOTION	The construction industry around the globe is afflicted with an exorbitant rate of fatal and non-fatal falls. To lower the propensity of the falls, researchers and safety experts have recommended to supplement the traditional passive fall safety measures with some active measures (such as early identification of task/environmental hazards and personal risk factors). Unfortunately, at present, there is no readily available onsite tool which could identify workers with poor postural controls. This study aimed to develop a static balance monitoring tool for proactive tracking of construction workers on-site using a wearable inertial measurement unit (WIMU) and a smartphone. To this end, a three-phase project was conducted. Firstly, a validation study was conducted to examine the validity of using WIMUs to detect task/fatigue-induced changes in static balance during a 20-second static balance test. The results of the study revealed that WIMUs could detect the post-task subtle changes in static balance with reference to the findings of a force-plate (considered as industrial standard). Secondly, since there were no existing static balance classification methods, five experts were engaged to establish balance classification thresholds using the fuzzy set theory. Thirdly, a mobile phone application was developed for the managers/foremen for onsite balance monitoring of the construction workers using the 20-second test at different times of the day and establishing their corresponding balance performance profiles. This would assist early identification of fall prone workers, plan mitigation schemes before a fall accident happens and ultimately help reduce falls in the construction industry.

The writers focus the analysis on four indicators of contractors' safety performance, i.e., the Experience Modification Rate (EMR), the Recordable Incident Rate (RIR), the Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR), and the Workers' Compensation Claims Frequency Indicator (WCCFI). Written and/or phone surveys were conducted of 43 contractors [including both Construction Industry Institute (CTI) and non-CII members], nine owners, fourteen insurance professionals, and over 1,600 construction workers, representing 36 states and 21 trades.

Although the existing observational assessment methods are easy to use, when it comes to a more in-depth statistical analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the worker's operation, the sample data to be processed turn out to be large, the labor cost high, and the analysis easily affected by the prejudice of the evaluator. This study examines a novel WMSD prediction method based on the dynamic characteristics of the working posture, which comprises three artificial intelligence algorithms in series. In this method, the posture detector identifies the limb angles and state in the working video, the posture risk evaluator evaluates the risk level of the working posture frame by frame, and the task risk predictor predicts the risk level of the current work process. The collected video data of common tasks of construction workers and the MPII Human Pose dataset were used for training and evaluation of the algorithms. The method achieved 87.0% accuracy of the joint point recognition. The micro-averaged accuracy, recall, and F1-score (harmonic average of accuracy and recall) reached 96.7%, 96.0%, and 96.6%, respectively. The results showed that the proposed method has great potential for real-time risk assessment. It can output all of the changes of the limb angles of workers in the work process frame by frame and predict the risk level of the whole work process.

The manual process is labor intensive and time-consuming. A proactive workers' safety risk evaluation framework is needed to handle this issue. In this paper, the position and posture have been identified as the two key quantitative features, and a position and posture fusion principle is proposed for the evaluation of construction workers' behaviors safety risks. Three participants are invited to involve in the indoor construction activities with working at height three times, and the participants' locations, postures, and video are recorded using sensing devices. The participants' risk levels are evaluated based on posture, location, and posture-location fusion respectively. A comparison of the risk level evaluated based on those three approaches and the ground truth provided by the experts. The results show that the accuracy of automatic safety risk level evaluation based on location and posture fusion is 83%, compared with 81% and 57% achieved by the single-feature based risk level evaluation using location and posture respectively. Thus, the position and posture fusion-based evaluation is more reliable in real situations.

Compared to other people in society, workers in construction industry are exposed to more work-related diseases. According to the literature review, this topic has been developed in specific geographic and the special statistical society; and the lack of complete research in the field of occupational diseases in Iran. The aim of this study is to assess occupational health status of workers in Iranian building sites by surveying among sample population. In order to achieve this goal, first some important diseases were discovered from literature review and according to the obtained results a questionnaire was developed and distributed among 245 people that are working at building sites with 14 different professions. Results showed that articular joint disease is approximately 44% higher than non-articular disease. In addition, the results showed that the frequency of disease among workers was more than people who worked professionally in this industry. According to the results, several recommendations were offered for example, providing training courses for physical activities. Future study needs to identify the factors that lead to articular joint and non-articular joint diseases in Iranian building industry.

A large amount of accidents is the results of construction workers unsafe behaviors, which associated with inappropriate risk detection and perception. Recently, researchers proposed to implement electroencephalograph (EEG) to measure construction workers' perceived risks based on their vigilance status. However, the EEG signals are often contaminated by the artifacts that caused by muscle movements and traditional stationary measurement metrics are not suitable for wearable implementation in the construction industry. To fill in this research gap, this study proposed a new hybrid kinematic-EEG data type and adopted wavelet packet decomposition to compute the vigilance measurement indices with redefined the EEG sub-bands. A validation experiment was conducted to examine thirty candidate vigilance indicators and two mature measurement metrics were compared to select the most proper and consistent indicators. The experiment results suggested three indices with highest correlation coefficients can be applied in vigilance detection. These quantitative vigilance indicators can provide a new perspective to understand the construction workers' risk perception process and improve the safety management on construction sites.

To mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, construction managers need to deepen their understanding of the physical and biomechanical demands of various construction tasks so that appropriate policies and preventive measures can be implemented. Among various construction trades, rebar workers are highly susceptible to lower-back disorders (LBDs) given the physically demanding nature of their work tasks. In particular, rebar tying is considered to be closely related to LBDs because it exposes workers to multiple ergonomic risk factors (repetitive works in prolonged static and awkward postures). The objective of the current study was to compare the differences in lumbar biomechanics during three typical rebar tying postures: stooping, one-legged kneeling, and squatting. Biomechanical variables including trunk muscle activity and trunk kinematics were measured by surface electromyography and motion sensors, respectively. Ten healthy male participants performed a simulated rebar tying task in each of the three postures in a laboratory setting. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that while each posture has its unique trunk kinematic characteristics, all these postures involved excessive trunk inclination that exceeded the internationally recommended trunk inclination angle of 600 for static working postures. Of the three postures, stooping posture demonstrated a significant reduction in electromyographic activity of lumbar muscles (a reduction in 60-80% of muscle activity as compared to the other two postures). The reduced muscle activity may shift the loading to passive spinal structures (e.g., spinal ligaments and joint capsules), which is known to be a risk factor for LBD development. Collectively, the results from this study may help explain the high prevalence of LBDs in rebar workers. Future studies are warranted to confirm the findings at construction sites and to develop appropriate ergonomic approaches for rebar workers. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Shi, YM; Du, J; Ahn, CR; Ragan, E				Shi, Yangming; Du, Jing; Ahn, Changbum R.; Ragan, Eric			Impact assessment of reinforced learning methods on construction workers' fall risk behavior using virtual reality	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Social learning; Fall accident; Construction safety; Virtual reality; Motion tracking	SAFETY CLIMATE; EXPOSURE THERAPY; GRADED EXPOSURE; PERFORMANCE; STRESS; PATTERNS; HEAD; RECOGNITION; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT	Given the nature of construction activities, construction workers usually work in a collaborative way. Thus, interpersonal influences among workers play a crucial role in forming and affecting construction workers' safety behaviors. The social learning literature indicates that interpersonal learning occurs in two opposing ways - positive reinforcement by demonstrating preferred behaviors, and negative reinforcement by demonstrating negative consequences of inappropriate behaviors. Amid theoretical disagreements in the social learning literature, it remains unclear in the construction safety literature how the two reinforced learning methods affect construction workers in safety training. To fill the gap, a human-subject experiment (n = 126) was conducted to investigate people's social learning behaviors in a hazardous construction situation - walking between two highrise buildings. The experiment utilizes a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) system with a motion tracking feature. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (no instruction was given), not-falling group (participants observed an avatar demonstrating appropriate walking behaviors), and falling group (participants watched an avatar quickly walking across a plank and falling off). Indicators, including walking time on the plank, walking speed, and gaze movement, were recorded and analyzed to quantify the effects of the two reinforced learning methods. The results indicate that demonstrating information with positive consequences (not-falling group) encourages people to follow the demonstration and maintain normal walking in a hazardous situation. Showing information with negative consequences (falling group) induced participants to walk faster and more irregularly, which further led to more mistakes and unsafe behaviors, This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VR in safety studies and provides recommendations for better safety training programs.

Hazards that remain unidentified can potentially result in catastrophic injuries and illnesses. As such, thorough hazard recognition is fundamentally essential to protect the health and well-being of the construction workforce. Despite its importance, recent research indicates that a large proportion of hazards remain unrecognized, exposing workers to unmitigated risks. Surprisingly, safety research has not adequately focused on developing specialized strategies to develop construction worker competency in hazard recognition. This paper reports a two-year research effort with the following objectives: (1) develop a high-fidelity augmented virtual environment [System for Augmented Virtuality Environment Safety (SAVES)] that helps develop workers' hazard recognition skill through risk-free learning and immediate feedback; (2) embed cognitive retrieval mnemonics to improve long-term retention of cues for construction hazards; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy as an intervention on active construction crew by using the multiple baseline testing approach. The first two objectives were accomplished through a combined effort from a panel of 14 subject matter experts and five academic researchers. This was followed by field experiments to test the hypothesis that the experience with SAVES improves the proportion of hazards identified by participants during subsequent field operations. The findings revealed that crews, on average, were able to only identify 46% of hazards prior to the introduction of the intervention, but were able to recognize 77% of hazards in the postintervention phase. This study represents the first endeavor to measure the effectiveness of augmented virtuality and serious gaming in developing hazard signal detection skills in construction field settings.

It is useful to better understand how WDB occurs among workers for its preventive management. By invoking social exchange theory, this paper clarifies how WDB among construction workers can be predicted by leader-member exchange (LMX) and leader-member guanxi (LMG). Data were gathered from 153 workers and 17 supervisors in 17 construction projects. The results show that LMX and LMG are negatively related to WDB. LMG moderates the relationship between LMX and WDB: The negative relationship between LMX and WDB is stronger when LMG has higher quality. The findings contribute to research on WDB, especially from the aspect of leader-member relationship in the construction industry, and shed light on the theory of social exchange by capturing the role of its nonwork part, LMG, in predicting WDB. Managers of construction projects can benefit from the novel explanation offered here of the occurrence of WDB among workers and suggestions on controlling it in advance.

Consequently, several studies from across the globe have examined different aspects of gender inequality and gender segregation in the context of the construction industry. This study conducted an in-depth inquiry into research on women in construction using a scientometric review approach covering 128 relevant journal articles published over the last 20 years (2000-2019). The review found four major research clusters: (1) gender roles and work culture; (2) glass walls and glass ceiling; (3) job satisfaction: and (4) gender diversity initiatives. Research on women in construction is scarce in the context of many developing countries, despite the fact that the majority of women workers and professionals live in these countries. Similarly, research on mentoring and training of women, migrant women workers, women entrepreneurs, women worker's health and safety, and human resource practices concerning women have received less attention.

Increasingly the activity-based office is seen as the optimal solution, as it provides people with choice between different types of workspaces to perform specific activities. This study addresses the trade-offs knowledge workers make when choosing a workspace for performing three different categories of activities (individual concentration work, informal interactions, and formal interactions). A stated choice experiment was performed through a questionnaire among 251 Dutch knowledge workers in 14 organizations, measuring preferences for hypothetical workspaces described by their six most relevant aspects. Multinomial logit models were estimated to identify the workspace preferences during each activity. Additionally, Latent class models were estimated to find possible segments of workers with specific preferences that need to be supported differently by workplace managers. Findings showed that preferences for psychosocial design aspects (noise, workspace enclosure and control) were more important for workspace selection than indoor environmental quality aspects. They also show more differences between specific activities. Also, not everybody finds full enclosure important for individual concentrated work, and relatively older employees appear to be more critical about workspace suitability to support both formal and informal interaction.

Proactive Safety Measures: Quantifying the Upright Standing Stability after Sustained Rebar Tying Postures	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Rebar tying; Occupational safety and health; Fall accidents; Loss of balance; Stool-sitting; Construction ergonomics	BALANCE CONTROL; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; WORKING POSTURES; RISK-FACTORS; FALLS; SWAY; FATIGUE; TIME	Fall accidents (FAs) constitute a substantial proportion of construction accidents. While the predominant prevention strategy relies on passive approaches (e.g.,guardrails), research on proactive measures is lacking, which may reduce the incidence of FAs in high-risk construction trades. Literature suggests that rebar work is one of the foremost FA-prone construction trades. Since rebar workers spend hours in rebar tying postures with periodic postural transitions, they hypothetically are at risk of posttask loss of balance. While recent research showed that a sitting stool could significantly alleviate physical discomfort during rebar tying, the current study aimed to investigate temporal changes in standing balance (using a force plate) after simulated rebar tying in squatting, stooping, and stool-sitting while the respective postural load during rebar tying was quantified by electromyography and oximeters. Results demonstrated that stool-sitting resulted significantly better posttask standing balance than squatting or stooping, which might be attributed to differential postural loadings. Overall, the findings reported herein underpin the importance of using safety informatics to proactively analyze task-specific fall hazards, to monitor workers' balance, and to implement proper prevention strategies for workers at risk of falls.

Recent statistics indicate that over 40% of all U.S. construction laborers cannot speak English proficiently. To ensure strong safety performance, it is vital to include every individual in a construction crew in safety-related communications, regardless of language proficiency. Considering that most safety communication is delivered in English, it is not surprising that Spanish-speaking construction workers are fatally injured at a disproportionate rate. To conduct the first exploration of the characteristics of strong, multilingual safety networks in the Denver Metropolitan region of the United States, a multilingual research team conducted interviews with the members of 14 construction crews. Demographic attribute data for each individual (e.g.,language proficiency, years of experience, position in the company) and network data were collected to analyze the safety communication network for each crew. The units of analysis included the individual actors in the network and the networks as a whole. The exploratory results contribute to the body of knowledge by revealing that unilingual work crews have safety performance that is 51% better than multilingual work crews (), bilingual workers play a more central role than unilingual workers when more than one language is spoken (), workers less than 35years of age have a higher degree of centrality than do workers who are older than 35years old (), and managers play an important role in the exchange and diffusion of safety knowledge regardless of language proficiency (). Most importantly, social-network analysis metrics show that these language-boundary spanners often form the core of a network that connects disparate groups of individuals. By contrast, crews with relatively weak safety performance tend to have clear and disparate subnetworks distinguished by language and high turnover rates. Such characteristics are of concern because individual actors are not able to effectively warn one another of uncontrolled hazardous exposures or work in transition.

An automatic and non-invasive physical fatigue assessment method for construction workers	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Occupational safety and health; Construction worker; Ergonomic; Deep learning; Machine learning; Computer vision	MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS; POSTURE ANALYSIS; WARNING SYSTEM; MUSCLE; MODEL; CONTRACTION; RISK	The construction industry around the globe has unsatisfactory occupational health and safety records. One of the major reasons is attributed to high physical demands and hostile working environments. Construction work always requires workers to work for a long duration without sufficient breaks to recover from overexertion and to work under harsh climatic conditions and/or in confined workspaces. Such circumstances can increase the risk of physical fatigue. Traditionally, fatigue monitoring in the construction domain relies on self-reporting or subjective questionnaires. These methods require the manual collection of responses and are impractical for continuous fatigue monitoring. Some researchers have used on-body sensors for fatigue monitoring (such as heart rate monitors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors). Although these devices appear to be promising, they are intrusive, requiring sensors to be attached to the worker's body. Such on-body sensors are uncomfortable to wear and could easily cause irritation. Considering the limitations of these methodologies, the current research proposes a novel non-intrusive method to monitor the whole-body physical fatigue with computer vision for construction workers. A computer vision-based 3D motion capture algorithm was developed to model the motion of various body parts using an RGB camera. A fatigue assessment model was developed using the 3D model data from the developed motion capture algorithm and biomechanical analysis. The experiment showed that the proposed physical fatigue assessment method could provide joint-level physical fatigue assessments automatically. Then, a series of experiments demonstrated the potential of the method in assessing the physical fatigue level of different construction task conditions such as site layout and the work-rest schedules.

However, attempts at ensuring safety in the workplace run the risk of focussing on formalities and compliance rather than on joint engagement in safety. Drawing on an understanding of safety as practice, this study attempts to empirically unpack the difference between cooperation as engaging with local knowledges and the disciplining of unsafe behaviour. The research involved an ethnographic study at two large construction sites in Denmark and follows empirical examples of how safety breaches are identified, catalogued, and revealed later on at safety meetings. Managers saw this as an attempt to engage the workers. However, the workers saw this as a punitive way of criticizing their work at a distance. They felt that this practice of moving safety from the construction site and in to meeting rooms ran counter to aims of establishing engaging and effective safety practices close to the work. Efforts to engage workers in safer ways of working should therefore acknowledge the integrated nature of safety practice and the value placed on independence, discretion and negotiation when developing cooperation about workplace safety.

Many rely on using conventional teacher-student classroom settings, but there are few effective interactive methods applied which can objectively engage trainer and trainees and assess their performance during and after training sessions. Presented is a novel approach towards integrating real-time location tracking and three-dimensional immersive data visualization technologies in existing construction worker education and training environments. The scope is limited to steel-erection tasks performed by union ironworkers in an indoor training center. Results to analysis and visualization of the gathered data from training session are shown. The potential for assessing and improving the trainers' and apprentices' safety and productivity performance is explained. Since such technologies have hardly been used as part of existing construction education and training techniques, the opportunities including return on investment and user feedback were studied. The results show that unsafe practices in worker training environments can be detected and visualized and furthermore their training effectiveness can be indirectly measured.

J	Choi, B; Lee, S				Choi, Byungjoo; Lee, SangHyun			Role of Social Norms and Social Identifications in Safety Behavior of Construction Workers. II: Group Analyses for the Effects of Cultural Backgrounds and Organizational Structures on Social Influence Process	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Safety behavior; Social influence; Cultural difference; Organizational structure; Labor and personnel issues	GROUP SELF-ESTEEM; NATIONAL CULTURE; INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM; DISTINCT ASPECTS; CLIMATE; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; CATEGORIZATION; CONSEQUENCES	The roles of perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and project identity in construction workers' safety behavior were described in the companion paper. That paper found that workers who strongly identify with their project demonstrate a stronger association between strict perceived management norms and safety behavior and a diminished association between lenient perceived workgroup norms and safety behavior. However, it is still unclear whether the findings are stable across different cultural backgrounds and organizational structures. To address this issue, this study aims to compare the roles of perceived management norm, perceived workgroup norm, and project identity in workers' safety behavior in different cultural backgrounds and organizational structures. The surveys were conducted in the United States, Korea, and Saudi Arabia for the group analyses because the three countries are both different from and similar to each other in terms of cultural backgrounds and organizational structure. The result demonstrated a significant relationship between social norms (e.g.,perceived management norms and perceived workgroup norms) and safety behavior, but cultural and organizational contexts can make a difference in the social influence processes. It was found that workers' social identification with their projects functions as an important mechanism that moderates the relationship between social norms and safety behavior in the United States and Korea. Just as the individualistic culture in the United States leads to significant direct effects of attitudes on safety behavior, the collectivistic culture in Korea brings about the significant effects of the perceived management norm and perceived workgroup norm on safety behavior. On the other hand, in Saudi Arabia, although workers already have a salient project identity due to its system of direct hiring, interactions between project identity and social norms do not have significant associations with safety behavior because perceived management norms may not be strict enough to elicit behavioral changes in improving safety behavior. The findings from this study lay a theoretical foundation for a new approach to safety management in international construction projects. Beyond the sociopsychological aspect of safety behavior, considerations of cultural and organization context would be essential to strengthen positive social influence on workers' safety behavior in international construction projects.

In recent years, construction health management (CHM) has gained much attention to ensure a healthier and safer workplace. However, there is still lack of a systematic review to bring together the disaggregated studies and determine the development status of this research field. As essential for addressing health issues in construction industry, a bibliometric and content-based review on of previous CHM studies would be presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach In total, 753 journal articles published in Web of Science core collection from 1990 to 2020 were examined using a systematic review. Bibliometric analysis concentrated on the analysis of publication and citation pattern of CHM research while content analysis was employed to identify main health hazards, levels of analysis and topical focuses. Findings The results indicated that the USA was the leading country in this research domain. Five health hazards together with 17 research topics at different levels of analysis were classified to allow researchers to track the structure and temporal evolution of the research field. Finally, three emerging trends and a set of research agenda were proposed to guide future research directions. Originality/value It is the first to highlight the issues of occupational health management from the perspective of construction workers. It contributes to the field of construction health management by clarifying the knowledge structure, emerging trends and future research directions. It offers valuable guidance and in-depth understanding to researchers, practitioners and policymakers to further promote construction workers' health performance.

This research attempts to comprehensively summarize psychosocial factors related to safety performance of construction workers. In the context of coronavirus disease 2019, some typical psychosocial factors are selected to further analyze their influence mechanism of safety performance. Design/methodology/approach First, a literature review process was conducted to identify and summarize relevant psychosocial factors. Then, considering the impact of the epidemic, hypotheses on the relationship between six selected psychosocial factors (i.e. work stress, role ambiguity, work-family conflict, autonomy, social support and interpersonal conflict) and safety performance were proposed, and a hypothetical model was developed based on job demands-resources theory. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to examine these hypotheses and the model. Findings The results showed these psychosocial factors indirectly influenced workers' safety performance by impacting on their occupational psychology condition (i.e. burnout and engagement). Work stress, role ambiguity, work-family conflict and interpersonal conflict were negatively related to safety performance by promoting burnout and affecting engagement. Autonomy and social support were positively related to safety performance by improving work engagement and reducing burnout. Originality/value This research is the pioneer systematically describing the overall picture of psychosocial factors related to the safety performance of construction workers. Through deeply discussed the mechanism of psychosocial factors and safety performance, it could provide a reference for the theory and application of psychosocial factors in the field of construction safety management.

After experiencing 824 fatal injuries in 2013, the construction industry ranks as one of the most dangerous work environments when compared with other private industrial sectors in the United States. Conditions of construction sites often produce hazardous proximity situations by requiring pedestrian workers and heavy equipment to operate at close proximity. Injury and fatality statistics indicate that current safety practices of construction workers have proven inadequate. The research aims to design hazard zone around pieces of heavy construction equipment in which site personnel should not enter during construction operations. The scope is limited to construction sites and equipment at a horizontal grade and hazards between heavy construction excavation equipment and workers-on-foot. A framework for creating the hazard zone around a piece of construction equipment is presented including detailed methodology discussions for each step. A user interface is also presented that automatically creates a hazard zone around select pieces of construction equipment based on user-defined parameters. The hazard zone for a dump truck, excavator, and backhoe are shown using the created framework. Results indicate that hazard zones for pedestrian workers can be created around construction equipment to increase hazard awareness for workers. Contributions for this research include a user-friendly hazard zone creation tool and database for safety managers and scientific evaluation data of the created hazard zone framework. Safety standards can be formulated based on the design and implement hazard zones on equipment. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This research regards the management of construction safety as a system, and seeks to use system dynamics to demonstrate how the system influences construction workers in terms of unsafe behaviors. First, individual and environmental conditions that can lead to an unsafe behavior are identified through a holistic cognitive analysis and management conditions that affect such conditions are identified. Second, a system dynamics model for the causation of unsafe behaviors (SD-CUB) is developed to characterize the causal structure of the system. The SD-CUB model involves relationships among management, individuals, and environmental conditions that can eventually lead to workers' unsafe behaviors. Third, a variety of model tests are conducted to build the confidence of the SD-CUB model. A five-week survey and observation on a building construction project is conducted to demonstrate that the SD-CUB model generates correct patterns of behavior. The model tests also imply that safety and production can actually support each other, management conditions on supervisory level are effective on the improvement of workers' safety awareness, and preventive actions are more effective than reactive actions on the enhancement of safety performance. The SD-CUB model can also be used as a basis for simulation of various site scenarios to explore the best solution to prevent and correct unsafe behaviors, and by redesigning the causal structure, the leverage points and critical management strategies can be determined.

Chirp-spread-spectrum-based real time location system safety management: A case study for construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Case study; Chirp spread spectrum; Real time location; Safety management	VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY; BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; TRACKING; IDENTIFICATION	Observing the working procedure of construction workers is an effective means of maintaining the safety performance of a construction project. It is also difficult to achieve due to a high worker-to-safety-officer ratio. There is an imminent need for the development of a tool to assist in the real-time monitoring of workers, in order to reduce the number of construction accidents. The development and application of a-real time locating system (RTLS) based on the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technique is described in this paper for tracking the real-time position of workers on construction sites. Experiments and tests were carried out both on- and off-site to verify the accuracy of static and dynamic targets by the system, indicating an average error of within 1 m. Experiments were also carried out to verify the ability of the system to identify workers' unsafe behaviours. Wireless data transfer was used to simplify the deployment of the system. The system was deployed in a public residential construction project and proved to be quick and simple to use. The cost of the developed system is also reported to be reasonable (around 1800USD) in this study and is much cheaper than the cost of other RTLS. In addition, the CCS technique is shown to provide an economical solution with reasonable accuracy compared with other positioning systems, such as ultra wideband. The study verifies the potential of the CCS technique to provide an effective and economical aid in the improvement of safety management in the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ahn, S; Crouch, L; Kim, TW; Rameezdeen, R				Ahn, Seungjun; Crouch, Luke; Kim, Tae Wan; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen			Comparison of Worker Safety Risks between Onsite and Offsite Construction Methods: A Site Management Perspective	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Offsite construction; Offsite manufacturing; Safety risk; Multicase study; Safe Work Method Statement	DESIGN; OPPORTUNITIES; PREFABRICATION; SIMULATION; IMPACT; MODEL	Many researchers, as well as industry practitioners, believe that offsite construction methods are associated with a lower level of worker safety risks than traditional onsite construction methods. This study aims to test such belief by comparing the list of worker safety risks identified by site supervisors for both onsite and offsite construction scenarios for the same building components. Specifically, Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)-prejob hazard assessments required by law in Australia-were collected from two projects where offsite manufacturing has been used, and they were used as a basis for the investigation. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the site supervisors who developed the Statements for a more in-depth investigation of the worker safety risks involved with onsite and offsite construction methods, respectively. The analysis reveals that the total risk score (the higher the score, the more numerous the safety risks) would decrease in the offsite construction scenarios in each case, mainly due to significantly fewer work-at-height tasks included in the offsite construction scenarios. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing an empirical, evidence-based explanation for why offsite construction can help reduce safety risks on construction sites.

The current practice of fall risk assessment for construction workers, which mainly relies on manual observation by safety experts, is a static risk assessment that is time-consuming and laborious. A proactive, dynamic risk assessment framework is urgently needed to address this issue. In this work, computer vision has been combined with dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to propose a dynamic risk assessment framework. The aim of the proposed framework is to improve the efficiency of risk assessment and reduce fall risk by automatically detecting onsite risk factor information. The proposed framework was tested using the activity of climbing ladders as a case study. The results show that the proposed dynamic fall risk assessment framework is feasible. It can be used to dynamically assess the fall risk of workers by automatically detecting the states of fall risk factors and capturing dynamic changes among the risk factors. The framework also includes a method of sending targeted early warnings to workers while assessing their risk levels, reducing the possibility of falls.

As a means of prevention, a number of active technologies have been developed to provide proximity sensing and alerts for workers and equipment operators. However, most of these systems are based on the distance/proximity level between workers and equipment and neglect the variations caused by different settings and environmental conditions, such as equipment types and approaching speeds, which can result in inconsistency and delay of the systems. As of yet, previous research has insufficiently investigated these issues. This research addresses the issues by utilizing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based proximity sensing and alert system developed by the authors. This paper discusses the development and assessment of parameter adjustment and adaptive signal processing (ASP) methods. The research conducted field trials in various dynamic conditions and settings to assess the performance of the system. The test results showed that the parameter adjustment function reduced the inconsistency of the alert distances resulting from different types of equipment, and that the ASP method reduced the time delay resulting from high approaching speeds. The developed proximity safety alerts system provides stakeholders with better understanding of dynamic spatial relationships among equipment, operator, workers, and a surrounding work environment; thus, improving construction work zone safety.

The safety climate serves as an outline of the basic safety culture's features and forewarns on safety-related problems. This study aims to investigate safety climate information in international construction projects, and find out specific factors affecting perceptions of safety climate in an international context. A questionnaire survey was administered on five construction sites contracted by Chinese international contractors. A total of 571 valid questionnaires were collected from this survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis reveals that nationality, religious beliefs, and employment mode can significantly affect perceptions of safety climate from different facets. In the present case, Chinese workers tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than their Vietnamese coworkers. Workers with religious beliefs tend to have more positive perceptions of safety climate than those without such beliefs. Finally, workers employed by subcontractors tend to have more positive perceptions of the safety climate than those employed directly by the main contractor. The findings identify the crucial factors affecting safety climate, which in turn enable practitioners to create a positive safety culture to enhance safety performance in international construction projects.

Culture development is also dependent in part on communication between all the parties within an organization. In the construction organization, critical communication occurs between top management and the workers mediated by the supervisors. Consequently, initiatives to develop the right H&S culture may fail if the construction supervisor competencies are overlooked. One of the construction supervisor competencies is the ability to conduct H&S induction training to workers. Induction training communicates the organization's expectations on H&S. This paper reports on a study of supervisor's H&S competency and ability to effectively conduct site H&S induction training to workers. Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires with site supervisors in building and civil engineering construction companies from the South-South Geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Findings revealed inadequate training, lack of management commitment and a limited level of awareness or use of audio/visual communication aids by contracting firms in Nigeria. The use of modern technologies and multilingual skills among supervisors aid effective site H&S induction training and would lead to a positive H&S culture. It is the view of the researchers that supervisor competency is critical to site H&S record and culture improvement.	[Okorie, V.

Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to improving the safety conditions within the construction industry. Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to evaluate hazards through neural time-frequency analysis. The experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for a wearable electro-encephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the collection of the neural information required as input for the measurement approach.

Work-Family Conflict and Safety Behavior of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety behavior; Work-family conflict; Work engagement; Family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB); Construction worker	SUPPORTIVE SUPERVISOR BEHAVIORS; CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR; WORKPLACE SAFETY; MULTIDIMENSIONAL MEASURE; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; JOB-SATISFACTION; MODERATING ROLE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MEDIATING ROLE; MODEL	Despite the extensive literature on workplace safety, the effect of work-family conflict on safety behavior has received little attention. This study aims to examine why and how bidirectional work-family conflict-work-to-family conflict (WFC) and family-to-work conflict (FWC)-influences the safety behavior of construction workers. We propose hypotheses on the relationship between work-family conflict and safety behavior, the mediating effect of work engagement, and the moderating effect of family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB). Data collected from 172 Chinese construction workers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. It was found that WFC had negative effects on safety compliance and safety participation, while FWC was only negatively related to safety participation. Meanwhile, work engagement was found to mediate the relationships between WFC and safety participation and between FWC and safety behavior. Finally, FSSB buffered the negative relationship between WFC and safety participation via work engagement. This study extends understandings of the influence mechanism and governance path of work-family conflict on safety behavior in the construction context and provides implications for improving safety behavior from the perspective of work-family balance.

J	Bowen, P; Govender, R; Edwards, P				Bowen, Paul; Govender, Rajen; Edwards, Peter			Condom use by South African construction workers	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						HIV; AIDS; construction workers; condom use	ALCOHOL-USE; CAPE-TOWN; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; HEALTH-CARE; DRUG-USE; RISK BEHAVIORS; HIV INCIDENCE; HIV/AIDS; PREVALENCE; WOMEN	Consistent and proper condom use is pivotal in preventing HIV infection. HIV prevalence in South Africa is among the highest in the world, with the construction industry especially affected, yet little is known about condom use by construction workers and the determinants thereof. Data were gathered from 512 site-based workers in the Western Cape. A theoretical model explaining condom use as a function of demographic factors, HIV knowledge, substance usage and risky sexual behaviour (excluding condom use) was proposed and tested using regression and structural equations modelling. The findings indicated that age, gender and level of education were indirect determinants of condom use, with higher levels of education predicting better AIDS-related knowledge. Higher levels of risky sexual behaviour were associated with more frequent use of condoms, suggesting greater awareness of risk. Condom use was adversely affected by greater alcohol and drug use, probably as a result of diminished capacity to assess risk. Finally, lower and not higher levels of AIDS-related knowledge were associated with better condom use, suggesting that improved knowledge of HIV transmission may work contrary to safe sex practice if it lulls the person into a false sense of confidence. Recommendations for targeted workplace interventions are proposed.

J	Pellegrino, R; Costantino, N				Pellegrino, Roberta; Costantino, Nicola			An empirical investigation of the learning effect in concrete operations	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Productivity; Construction planning	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; CONSTRUCTION; MODELS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on productivity as it unfolds during the execution of a particular task, i.e., reinforced concrete operations. The main aim is understanding whether the learning effect explaining the improvement of productivity in subsequent cycles of a given repetitive construction process is mainly attributable to a pure worker learning (independent on the specific site) or to the experience developed by the crew on the site conditions. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a research that empirically investigates and compares the change in productivity data of a single worker during his/her working life and that of a crew involved in specific repetitive work, such as the concreting activities of a multi-storey building. Findings The findings suggest differentiating between productivity gain as a result of the learning effect of the individual worker throughout his/her working life (which is independent of the specific project and site) and that of a crew composed by more workers which repeat reinforced concrete operations in a given specific project. Research limitations/implications Despite the great attention reserved to learning in construction, few researchers discuss on the real applicability of the learning curve (LC) theory in the construction industry. The authors contribute to this literature by empirically investigating the contributions that the learning effect of the individual worker and that of a crew repeating a given task (i.e. reinforced concrete operations) in a given project have on the productivity improvement for subsequent cycles of the repetitive construction process. Practical implications The findings of this study have important managerial implications. The shape of the LC of the individual worker implies that learning increases relatively slowly in his/her working life (particularly after one to two years), while the effects of the crew experience are immediately significant in a time range of few weeks. This means that a single one-off multi-storey building project will show in the first storey the historical, individual productivity of the individual workers (i.e. not going to vary significantly in the next few weeks). The productivity improvement in the further storeys will only depend on the project-specific (and collective, for the crew) learning due, for example, to better coordination or to other issues that are progressively solved moving from the first storey to the following ones. So, the project-specific LC increases in a faster way than the individual one, and the overall productivity can be improved by accelerating the project-specific learning rate with more accurate project-specific design and management. Originality/value This paper enhances the understanding of the contributions that the learning effect of the individual worker and that of a crew repeating a given task (i.e. reinforced concrete operations) in a given project have on the productivity improvement for subsequent cycles of the repetitive construction process. This will contribute to improve the planning and control of site work activities, avoiding time and money wastefulness.

Social identity, safety climate and self-reported accidents among construction workers	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Safety; management; accidents; work group identity; safety culture; safety leadership	INTERGROUP BEHAVIOR; SITE SAFETY; INDUSTRY; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; ATTITUDES; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; ORGANIZATIONS	The construction industry has one of the highest frequencies of work-related accidents. We examined whether construction workers predominantly identify themselves in terms of their workgroup or in terms of the construction site. In addition, we examined the associations between social identity and safety climate, and how these constructs are associated with work-related accidents. The analyses were based on questionnaire responses from 478 construction workers from two large construction sites, and the methods involved structural equation modeling. Results showed that the workers identified themselves primarily with their workgroup, and to a lesser degree with the construction site. Social identity and safety climate were related both at the workgroup and construction site levels, meaning that social identity may be an antecedent for safety climate. The association between social identity and safety climate was stronger at the workgroup level than at the construction site level. Finally, safety climate at both levels was inversely associated with self-reported accidents, with the strongest association at the workgroup level. A focus on improving safety climate, particularly by integrating initiatives at both the workgroup and management level, may have the potential to improve safety performance and thus decrease the risk of accidents and injuries on construction sites.

High rates of construction workplace injuries, including fatalities, occur worldwide in both developed and developing nations. Our study examines the effects of safety behavior and physiological perceived control (PPC) on the relationship between safety knowledge and outcomes. We examined this relationship by focusing on the mediating role of safety behavior and the moderating role of PPC. We employed a time-lagged design to collect data. Field survey results from 385 site workers from construction sites in the Yangtze region of China show that safety behavior mediated the positive relationship between safety knowledge and outcomes. Furthermore, PPC strengthens the relationship between safety knowledge and safety behavior. The results indicate that workers' safety knowledge may not transform into expected safety behavior and performance if they experience low levels of PPC. These findings provide new insights into levels of PPC as a boundary condition for understanding the relationships among safety knowledge, safety behavior, and safety outcomes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

To address there safety and health issues, conventional observational methods on the external causes are tedious and subjective, while the direct measurement on the internal causes is intrusive leading to productivity reduction. Therefore, it is essential to construct an effective approach that maps the external and internal causes to realize the non-intrusive identification of safety and health risks. This research proposes a theoretical method to analyze the postures tracked by videos with biomechanical models. Through the biomechanical skeleton representation of human body, the workload and joint torques are rapidly and accurately evaluated based on the rotation angles of joints. The method is then demonstrated by two case studies about (1) plastering and (2) carrying. The experiment results illustrate the changing intramuscular torques across the construction activities in essence, validating the proposed approach to be effective in theory.

Information delivered by these systems is playing an important role in the evaluation of postures as well as in the reduction of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). In this article, we present a novel system and data processing framework to deliver intuitive and understandable motion-related information about workers. The system uniquely integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) devices in a wireless body area network, and the data processing uses a robust state machine-based approach that assesses inadequate working postures based on standard positions defined by, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The system and data processing framework are collectively validated through experiments carried out with college trainees conducting typical bricklaying tasks. The results illustrate the robustness of the system under demanding circumstances, and suggest its applicability in actual working environments outside the college.

However, it leads to multiple issues for project workers, such as intense pressure and work overload. This paper explores how project workers experience work overload in a multi-project context, especially regarding practices that contribute to maintaining or preventing it. It builds on a case study of a financial institution in which employees are assigned to many projects at the same time. Findings uncover four practices related to working time (extending working hours and managing boundaries) and prioritization (prioritizing emergencies and negotiating work and deadlines). This paper exposes how issues such as work overload are both, framed by a larger context driving work intensification and sustained through practices. It also displays the power and agency of individuals, who are not passive toward work overload. As such, it contributes to extending perspectives and advancing understanding of project work.

Power assist devices for installing plaster panels in construction	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						robotized masonry; construction robot; material-handling manipulator; service robot; guided robot	SYSTEM	Building construction is a very interesting field for automation, but the incorporation of fully automated systems is a very slow matter because of the inherent difficulties of its unstructured and changing environment. However, this industry produces a large number of accidents and injuries in workers and government agencies are demanding protection for them. An intermediate solution is to provide the workers with new tools capable of supplying power to carry the heavy loads while the workers are still providing their sensor system and intelligence. This is just the concept of a power assist device. This paper presents two versions of a manipulator to assist operators in handling and installing pre-manufactured plaster panels for indoor-wall construction. This manipulator is guided directly by the operator, so it can be considered yet another tool to assist operators in handling heavy loads. The system's main features and its functions are presented.

Behavior-based safety (BBS) is an effective method to modify workers' unsafe behavior. This paper introduces the study on big data-based metro construction behavior modification, aiming to solve the problem of current research without consideration of workers' personal characters. First, the behavior modification pushing mechanism based on content-based personalized recommendation is studied. Secondly, the development of behavior modification system of metro construction (BMSMC) is introduced. Thirdly, BMSMC practical applications using the unsafe behavior rate, S as a measuring indicator is implemented. Observations at one metro construction site in Wuhan indicate that the unsafe behavior rate of modified scaffolders at this work place decreased by 69.3%. At the same time, as of unmodified scaffolders at another work place for comparison, the unsafe behavior rate decreased by 56.9%, which validates the effectiveness of this system.

BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach to mitigating noise impact on maintenance workers on offshore oil and gas platforms	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						4D noise mapping; Building information modeling; Maintenance schedule optimization; Noise impact mitigation; Safety management	MODEL; INDUSTRY	Maintenance workers on offshore platforms are usually exposed to a high level of noise from the working environment as most of the daily operations of oil and gas process machines generate noise over 85 dBA, causing substantial health and safety issues. Avoiding exposure of workers to the modules that generate high sound power during maintenance activities can significantly mitigate the noise impact on human health and safety. Noise simulation and noise mapping methodologies can be used to evaluate and quantify the noise impact on offshore platforms. However, limited digital information of offshore platforms makes noise simulation setup challenging as modules on topsides have a high level of details. In addition, current noise mapping studies are usually conducted in a 3D static manner, which only reflects noise impact at a certain time. Building information modeling (BIM) provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of a facility that can be applied to support the noise simulation on offshore platforms. In this study, attempts have been made to develop a BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach to mitigating the noise impact on maintenance workers of offshore platforms. BIM is utilized to automatically provide required information to facilitate noise simulation setup. 4D acoustics simulation approach is used to obtain the spatio-temporary sound pressure level (SPL) distribution of the noise generated by the functional modules on offshore platforms. Acoustic diffusion equation (ADE) is selected as noise SPL prediction model. To evaluate noise impact on maintenance workers, an equation based on daily noise dose is then newly derived to quantify the noise impact. Optimization algorithm is used to determine the maintenance schedule with the minimum daily noise dose. Finally, optimized maintenance schedule that has considered noise impact is used to update the daily maintenance plan on offshore platforms. An example of a fixed offshore platform with maintenance daily activity information is used to illustrate the proposed BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach. The results show that the developed approach can well mitigate noise impact on maintenance workers on offshore platforms, resulting in health and safety management improvement.

One of the most effective approaches to preventing WMSDs is to evaluate ergonomics considerations early in the design and construction planning stage before the worker encounters the unsafe conditions. However, a lack of tools for identifying potential ergonomic risks in a proposed workplace design has led to difficulties in integrating safety and health into workplace design practice. In an effort to address this issue, this study explores a motion data-driven framework for ergonomic analysis that automates and visualizes the evaluation process in a virtual workplace. This is accomplished by coupling the ergonomic analysis with three-dimensional (3D) virtual visualization of the work environment. The proposed approach uses motion data from the 3D model of the jobsite to evaluate the risk factors that can produce excessive physical loads on the human body through a biomechanical analysis. A global risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders is performed on worker motions first, and a biomechanical simulation is then used to further analyze unsafe motions by estimating internal loads on each selected body joint of the worker and redesigning the motion and workplace accordingly. As a case study, several tasks taking place in a construction prefabrication shop are modeled and analyzed to modify the workplace and ensure improved ergonomic safety. The results indicate that the proposed approach enables identification and minimization of awkward worker postures in the virtual model to mitigate ergonomic risk during workplace design.

To improve safety management on sites, valid fatigue management measures for workers are urgently required. Specifically, there are construction activities requiring both physical and cognitive effort. As a critical premise for putting forward feasible fatigue management measures, correlations between physical and mental fatigue on work performance should be identified. This research explored the effects of physical fatigue on the induction of mental fatigue of construction workers, by adopting a pilot experimental method. Manual handling tasks of different intensities were firstly designed for stimulating certain expected physical fatigue statuses. A cognition-required risk identification task was then arranged for inducing mental fatigue, during which a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor was utilized for fatigue detection and measurement. Through a comprehensive data analysis method based on EEG rhythms, it was found that the high physical fatigue can significantly accelerate the induction of mental fatigue. Considering the resource allotment, more vigilant and attentional resources were required during the intensive manual handling tasks for the highly controlled limbs and the mind to steps. Thus, additional resources were invested to maintain the same level of cognitive performance in the risk identification tasks, which led to the increased mental fatigue. In practice, the heavy physical task can be regarded as one of the factors affecting the development of mental fatigue status, and therefore impairing cognitive functioning and other mental performances of the brain. The pilot study results provided a reference for fatigue management of construction workers to promote comprehensive safety management on construction sites.

J	Park, J; Kim, K; Cho, YK				Park, JeeWoong; Kim, Kyungki; Cho, Yong K.			Framework of Automated Construction-Safety Monitoring Using Cloud-Enabled BIM and BLE Mobile Tracking Sensors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Building information model (BIM); Construction safety; Cloud computing; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Safety monitoring; Information technologies	HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Construction sites need to be monitored continuously to detect unsafe conditions and protect workers from potential injuries and fatal accidents. In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and errorprone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) realtime detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards. The results indicate that the proposed approach can assist in the construction site monitoring process and potentially improve site safety. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Dhal, M				Dhal, Manoranjan			Labor Stand: Face of Precarious Migrant Construction Workers in India	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor stand; Migrant labor; Construction; Precarious work; Trade union; Government	TO-URBAN MIGRATION; WOMEN; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES	The construction sector of India is the best representation of the informal workforce, which employs 36.12 million workers. These laborers flock together in a particular place on early morning every day in order to find a wage provider for them. It is a sale of labor for the day, where workers stand and make themselves available for a day to be hired by contractors or individual house owners. These places are known as labor stands, a stop for finding daily laborers for construction work, which is the distinctive addition of this research to the scant literature. This paper tries to explore the labor process among these unique informal construction workers' labor assemblies consisting of 15,000 laborers per day and explore their employment conditions and labor relations. The paper also aims to examine the role of various actors of industrial relations such as trade unions and the government in regulating this employment relationship. The paper is based on a field study encompassing the transcribed records of observation, field interaction with 84 migrant construction workers, and 118 still photographs. The data were analyzed by using qualitative analysis software and adopting open thematic coding and later by developing categories and hierarchy and doing comparative analysis. The findings reveal that these laborers experience precariousness and are challenged by nonavailability of regular work, shortages of food, burden of large family size, and social evils of living in a slum, and also face being harassed by goons as well as contractors with minimal support from trade unions and government. Employers are apathetic toward their legal obligations. With labor stands being a primary source of labor supply to the construction sector, the findings of this paper will help in enriching labor relations and policy measures for its regulation.

Understanding the nature of this kind of uncertainty can reduce the level of inconsistency that reinforces the safety management system in CI. The purpose of this paper is to present an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy-improved score function and weighted divergence based approximation (IVIF-ISF-WDBA) approach for ranking main stakeholders with clear duties that can influence workers' unsafe behaviours as well as risk reduction in final decisions. In this method, a score matrix is compiled based on improved score performance and IVIF decision matrix, and then a linear programming model is developed to determine the weight of unknown criteria. In addition, a divergence measure has been developed to find out the degree of performance of the alternatives. Next, we perform comparative and sensitivity analyses with different proposed methods and different weight criteria sets to determine the stability of the developed approach. The results indicated that the most effective safety factors (ESFs) are safety climate factor(3) (SCF3) (safety management rules and regulations) at 45%, and safety perceptual factor(2) (SPF2) (workers' preferences and behaviours related to safety category) at 25%. The LP-model ranked client, designer, construction manager, and contractor as the authoritative bodies that should carry out extensive inspections of ESFs, namely, SCFs, SPFs, and workplace condition factors (WCFs) in the preconstruction phase. However, these priorities can change during the construction phase among the contractor, construction manager, supervisor, client, and designer. This study concluded that workers' unsafe behaviours could be linked to stakeholder duties in complex and dynamic conditions of the CI.

To minimize subjectivity and the time required for conducting detailed assessments, and allowing managers to spend their time on the more important task of assessing and implementing improvements, we propose a new inexpensive vision-based method using RGB-D sensors that is applicable to interior construction operations. This is a particularly challenging task as construction activities have a large range of intra-class variability including varying sequences of body posture and time-spent on each individual activity. The skeleton extraction algorithms from RGB-D sequences produce noisy outputs when workers interact with tools or when there is a significant body occlusion within the camera's field-of-view. Existing vision-based methods are also limited as they can primarily classify "atomic" activities from RGB-D sequences involving one worker conducting a single activity. To address these limitations, our method includes three components: 1) an algorithm for detecting, tracking, and extracting body skeleton features from depth images; 2) a discriminative bag-of-poses activity classifier for classifying single visual activities from a given body skeleton sequence; and 3) a Hidden Markov Model to represent emission probabilities in the form of a statistical distribution of single activity classifiers. For training and testing purposes, we introduce a new dataset of eleven RGB-D sequences for interior drywall construction operations involving three actual construction workers conducting eight different activities in various interior locations. Our results with an average accuracy of 76% on the testing dataset show the promise of vision-based methods using RGB-D sequences for facilitating the activity analysis workface assessment.

Recently, an off-the-shelf wearable EEG device, which is wireless, lightweight, and affordable, has become available so that field construction workers' psychosocial status can be explored without interfering with their ongoing work. However, capturing high-quality EEG signals from such a device can be very challenging at real construction sites because of the signal artifacts generated by body movement caused by physically demanding work. To address this issue, the authors propose an EEG signal-processing framework that can acquire high-quality EEG signals at real construction sites using a wearable EEG device. Specifically, the signal-processing framework reduces noises and is thus able to extract quality EEG signals. This framework is validated by examining whether brain activation (particularly by body movements) can be identified using the processed EEG signal applied to eight field construction workers under working (i.e., active) and not working (i.e., inactive) conditions. Specifically, mean power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG beta frequency range is calculated from electrodes near the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls voluntary movements. A significant difference in mean PSD in the beta frequency range between active and inactive conditions demonstrates that the processed EEG signal, based on the proposed framework, captures brain activation. The results show the potential of the proposed signal-processing framework to monitor workers' brain wave patterns in the field with a wearable EEG device, opening up an opportunity to assess workers' psychosocial status in construction so that any psychosocial problems of workers can be investigated.

J	Montaser, A; Moselhi, O				Montaser, Ali; Moselhi, Osama			RFID indoor location identification for construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						RFID; Indoor location identification; RSSI; Triangulation; Proximity; Material tracking	RADIO-FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION; TRACKING; MAINTENANCE; COMPONENTS	This paper presents a low cost indoor location identification and material tracking methodology for construction projects using Ultra High Frequency (UHF) passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Onsite location aware information is an emerging area that focuses on automating delivery of spatial information pertinent to location of materials, workforce, and equipment. This spatial information can be used to derive knowledge about construction project status. A two-step algorithm is presented to automate the process of location estimation and material tracking in near-real-time. In this methodology, a number of passive RFID tags are distributed onsite where work is progressing, and a mobile RFID reader is carried by a worker onsite. Each passive RFID tag is deployed as a reference point with a known location (landmark) within a predefined zone. Reference tags of known locations are used to determine the location of the worker and eventually locate and track surrounding materials. The methodology uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for signal measurements. Two localization methods (triangulation and proximity) were used to identify the location of the worker. Testing this methodology was carried out on an actual construction jobsite, where five test beds were setup at different locations and within different construction time spans. In addition, one test bed was set up in a lab environment. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential for a low-cost method for location estimation and material tracking of indoor construction. The results show a mean error of 1.0 m and 1.9 m for user location identification and material tracking using the triangulation method, respectively. The results also show a mean error of 1.9 m and 2.6 m for location identification of the worker and for material tracking using the proximity method, respectively. The proposed methodology detects the zones of worker and material location with 100% accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extracting knowledge from data on near hits (aka. close calls) might warrant better understanding on the root causes that lead to such incidents and eliminate them early in the risk mitigation process. While a close call is a subtle event where workers are in close proximity to a hazard, its frequency depends-among other factors-on poor site layout, a worker's willingness to take risks, limited safety education, and pure coincidence. For these reasons, pioneering organizations have recognized the potential of gathering and analyzing leading indicator data on close calls. However, mostly manual approaches are infrequently performed, subjective due to situational assessment, imprecise in level of detail, and importantly, reactive or inconsistent in effective or timely follow-ups by management. While existing predictive analytics research targets change at strategic levels in the hierarchy of organizations, personalized feedback to strengthen an individual worker's hazard recognition and avoidance skill set is yet missing. This study tackles the bottom of Heinrich's safety pyramid by providing an in-depth quantitative analysis of close calls. Modern positioning technology records trajectory data, whereas computational algorithms automatically generate previously unavailable details to close call events. The derived information is embedded in simplified geometric information models that users on a construction site can retrieve, easily understand, and adapt in existing preventative hazard recognition and control processes. Results from scientific and field experiments demonstrate that the developed system works successfully under the constraints of currently available positioning technology.

J	EBRAHIMPOUR, ML; WITHERS, BE				EBRAHIMPOUR, ML; WITHERS, BE			EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT - A COMPARISON OF AMERICAN AND JAPANESE MANUFACTURING FIRMS OPERATING IN THE UNITED-STATES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS; TOTAL QUALITY CONTROL (TQC); STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL (SQC) TECHNIQUES; PRODUCTION WORKERS INVOLVEMENT; AND MANAGEMENT OF QUALITY	ATTITUDES	Considerable attention has been given in recent years to identifying and describing the elements which account for Japan's successful infiltration and dominance of the world market place. Eventually came the diagnosis that attention to quality would be critical to American firms to regain their world market position. Inherent in such a philosophical change in quality management must be a redistribution of responsibility for quality from a single QC department to workers throughout the production operation. Coupled with this change in responsibility must also be an increased use of appropriate tools [statistical quality control (SQC) tools] to enable workers to monitor and measure quality. The above two factors will help firms to achieve atarimae hinshitsu, (given quality, i.e., producing defect-free products). This research sought to determine whether firms classified as incorporating a Japanese quality management approach had significantly higher levels of worker involvement in the quality effort as well as higher utilization of SQC tools. The three types of firms represented in this study were traditional American firms, Japanese firms operating in the U.S., and nontraditional American firms (firms emulating the Japanese approach to quality management). Results suggest that Japanese and nontraditional American firms 1) have a significantly higher level of worker involvement and 2) use simple SQC tools to a significantly higher than traditional American firms. In addition, Japanese firms operating in the U.S. showed results comparable to these American firms practicing Japanese quality management techniques. Finally, it was concluded that many Japanese firms and nontraditional American firms are gearing up for the second phase of quality, referred to as miryokuteki hinshitsu, (the charm of quality, i.e, the personality of products).

However, few of the existing approaches to reviewing control measures take into account or effectively tackle these conditions. This paper introduces a three-level (i.e., individual hazards, hazard types, and generic hazards) hierarchical Bayesian model based on workers' responses to proximity warnings of safety hazards to address the problem. The proposed model distinguishes between two uses of proximity warnings (i.e., as the primary control measure and as the secondary measure), uses observational response rates as input, takes into account prior knowledge of workers' responses to similar hazards, and produces estimated response rates (ERRs). These ERRs are the primary indicator of the effectiveness of a given control measure as well as of the validity of a previously identified safety hazard. A 17-day field experiment was conducted to test the proposed approach, preliminarily using a location-based proximity warning system to warn workers of safety hazards and record their responses to warnings. The experimental results demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach. The limitations of the present analysis and the directions for future research are also discussed.

A comparative study on adopting human resource practices for safety management on construction projects in the United States and Singapore	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; HR practices; Safety outcomes	ORGANIZATIONAL SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; INJURY; RISK; ACCIDENTS; CULTURE; WORKERS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; OIL	Good project management outcomes include completing projects to an acceptable level of quality, within budget and on time. As construction accidents may cause project delays, safety management plays an important role in a project's timely completion. This study aims to undertake a comparative study of HR practices adopted for safety management on construction projects in the United States (US) and Singapore and to investigate the relationship between HR practices and construction safety management outcomes (severity and frequency of accidents). The research method included exploratory interviews and industry surveys of contractors in the US and Singapore by email and post. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. Compared to Singapore contractors, the results show that US contractors' project management practices place significantly more emphasis on highlighting organizational safety values to new workers and taking working experience into account during the selection process. On the other hand, Singapore contractors place more emphasis on providing appropriate rest areas for workers. Many HR practices are significantly correlated with safety management outcomes. These include: taking age into consideration during selection process and giving feedback to workers about their unsafe behaviour. It is recommended that project managers adopt relevant HR practices that lead to more effective safety management on construction projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Properly wearing earplugs is very important onsite for worker hearing protection. However, the training provided in the current practice is minimal. Therefore, there is a need to develop an efficient and effective self-training method that can provide both accurate step-by-step earplug-wearing instructions and timely feedback through monitoring. With the development of artificial intelligence and wearable sensor technologies, the possibility of developing an advanced intelligent training method becomes plausible. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a gesture recognition-based smart training assistant system that can automatically evaluate workers' performance during their earplug-wearing self-training and provide timely feedback to rectify any mistakes. Through the system feasibility test and performance evaluation, the results show that the proposed system can achieve around 90% training accuracy and around 80% testing accuracy recognizing the classified forearm gestures of wearing earplugs for noise protection training using the developed artificial neural network (ANN) models for both hands. The proposed gesture recognition-based smart training assistant system will eventually help industries to improve the performance and safety of employees with low implementation costs.

This percentage, however, is not due to a lack of interest or capacity, but to discrimination against women, sexual harassment and work safety. The purpose of this paper is to identify the main issues and current difficulties of women workers at construction sites, as well as good practices that might provide a better environment for them. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were carried out with workers and engineers who work/have worked at construction sites, to gather material for a discussion about the gender gap in this environment. The interviews were structured and analyzed around the following topics: acceptance, well-being, installations, gender perception and good practices. Findings The hiring of women usually occurs at the end of the construction period, which brings up the issue of sexual division of labor. Effects of the glass ceiling and the leaky pipeline phenomena were evident, as well as harassment, discrimination and sexism. Originality/value Studies about women in engineering have been become relative common, but studies about female workers on construction sites are still scarce. The women interviewed see themselves as warriors, symbolizing the gain of space within the construction sector and in society. It is hoped that the results can contribute to raising awareness about the benefits of gender mainstreaming at construction sites and to promote the health and well-being of women in these environments.

Terence			Estimation of Optimal Productivity in Labor-Intensive Construction Operations: Advanced Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; Construction management; Simulation; Methodology	SIMULATION; PERCEPTIONS	The traditional practice of comparing actual productivity versus historical productivity only provides relative efficiency data rather than absolute efficiency data. Innovatively, a two-prong strategy for estimating optimal labor productivity by quantifying systematic and operational inefficiencies allows project managers to estimate the absolute efficiency of their labor-intensive operations and compare actual productivity against an objective benchmark. Although this two-prong strategy was previously validated for a simple task with a single worker performing sequential actions, no study has confirmed the feasibility of applying this approach to complex operations involving multiple workers or sequential and/or parallel tasks and actions. Because adding more workers increases not only the complexity of the construction operation but also the complexity of calculating optimal productivity, this study expands the current body of knowledge by augmenting the two-prong strategy's methodology to apply the approach to a complex, multiworker operation necessitating both sequential and parallel tasks and actions. The feasibility of the expanded methodology is tested using a case study involving the fabrication of sheet metal ducts that includes 8 workers performing 8 tasks and 45 actions. This paper reviews relevant literature; tests the feasibility of the two-prong strategy on a complex, labor-intensive operation; analyzes the data; evaluates the strategy; and confirms the framework as a tool for accurately estimating optimal productivity in complex construction activities. The success of this framework better enables project managers to measure and manage the productivity of their labor-intensive construction operations.

It is therefore important to explore new ways to improve housing conditions for MCWs. Based on the concept of sustainable design, the authors propose a semicustomized design framework of container accommodation through improvements to the job process of a classical value engineering process in three aspects. First, a method of design scheme innovation based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs is developed; second, two types of decision makers are integrated in different stages of the design process to satisfy the diversified housing needs of MCWs from social and psychological perspectives; and third, to better measure the housing satisfaction of MCWs, the authors developed an evaluation method of quantifying worker housing satisfaction with different design schemes using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, including an evaluation indicator system with MCW psychological factors. This framework can be used to determine the supply of container accommodation and prices that best fit the needs of MCWs by optimizing the function and cost of design schemes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the framework, a case study is conducted. In addition, the limitations of the framework are discussed. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In the construction sector, the risk associated with vibration exposure is high as driving vehicles in areas with unpaved-roads or uneven surfaces is a very common activity. Drivers may be exposed to high levels of WBV, which may lead to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Accordingly, this study developed a GIS-based methodological framework to reduce and manage WBV exposure in the process of routes design. The framework, providing the optimal route using a least-cost path analysis using the optimising criteria of travelled time and WBV exposure, was established. The methods set out in EU-Directive 2002/44/EC and ISO2631-5:2018 are applied. A case study was conducted in order to illustrate the proposed methodological framework. The information provided by the framework can be used by the construction companies and safety management to protect construction workers from excessive WBV exposure.

Remote proximity proximity monitoring between mobile construction resources using camera-mounted UAVs	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Struck-by accident; Proximity monitoring; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Deep neural network; Computer vision	AUGMENTED REALITY; HAZARD AVOIDANCE; IDENTIFICATION; EQUIPMENT; NETWORKS; TRACKING; WORKERS; SYSTEM	Struck-by accidents have resulted in a significant number of fatal and nonfatal injuries in the construction industry. As a proactive safety measure against struck-by hazards, the authors present an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted visual monitoring method that can automatically measure proximities among construction entities. To attain this end, this research conducts two research thrusts: (i) object localization using a deep neural network, YOLO-V3; and (ii) development of an image rectification method that allows for the measurement of actual distance from a 2D image collected from a UAV. Tests on real-site aerial videos show the promising accuracy of the proposed method; the mean absolute distance errors for estimated proximity were less than 0.9 m and the mean absolute percentage errors were around 4%. The proposed method enables the advanced detection of struck-by hazards around workers, which in turn can make timely intervention possible. This proactive intervention can ultimately promote a safer working environment for construction workers.

Such incorporation into these human-dominated environments can raise safety concerns as most robots are not fully automated and require some sort of control mechanism. Conventional control systems may fall short under specific situations in which workers require robotic assistance but cannot use their hands to control the robot. Brain-computer interface (BCI) can offer such hands-free controllability, a non-muscular communicative channel that can establish an interpretive pathway between humans and robots. This paper proposes a BCI-based system to remotely control a robot by continuously capturing workers' brainwaves acquired from a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) device and interpreting them into robotic commands with 90% accuracy. The findings revealed the proposed system holds promise for enhancing robot control in hazardous operations where the ability of the worker to physically direct the robot is limited, such as underwater and space construction.

Evaluation of a prototypical mechanical wood truss ladder	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Trusses; Wood framing; Metal plate connected; Lifting; Hoisting; Truss erection; Stability; Residential construction; Safety		Wood trusses are used on a large number of residential and commercial projects throughout the United States. Trusses are typically hoisted from the ground to the level on which they are to be erected using a crane, extended boom forklift, or hand lifting. These current methods of hoisting do not uniformly address market demands of low costs, worker safety, erection speed, and reduced risks for the parties to the construction contract. This research examines a wood truss ladder developed at Auburn University that moves trusses from the ground to the level at which they will be erected. A prototype version of the truss ladder was constructed and tested at two residential housing projects. Speed, ease of use, safety, and worker fatigue were investigated for these two projects using qualitative measures. The truss lifter offers potential increases in safety and reduced worker fatigue. Additional trial versions, along with key improvements in specific areas, are needed for the ladder. (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Al-Bayati, AJ				Al-Bayati, Ahmed Jalil			Satisfying the Need for Diversity Training for Hispanic Construction Workers and Their Supervisors at US Construction Workplaces: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SAFETY	The representation of the Hispanic construction workforce has substantially increased over the last 15 years, and it continues to increase. Because of this, the Hispanic construction workforce represents a crucial segment of the US construction workforce. Unfortunately, the safety performance of Hispanic workers has been documented as an area requiring special attention due to the higher rates of fatalities and nonfatal injuries among Hispanic workers. Active cultural differences (ACDs) have been identified as one of the causes that negatively influence the performance of diverse construction crews. Therefore, the construction industry strives to adopt novel management techniques to better manage diverse crews. Accordingly, this study illustrates a training module that provides the knowledge to help construction firms overcome the undesirable influences of ACDs and strengthen their desirable effects. The findings strongly suggest that the proposed training is accepted by construction personnel. The proposed training would not only improve the overall safety performance of diverse construction crews but also positively influence other project success factors such as quality, productivity, and crew performance.

Analysis of hand-arm vibration risk to highway utilities maintenance and repair operatives	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Health and safety; Hand-arm vibration; Mechanical equipment; Utilities workers	EXPOSURE	Hand-arm vibration (HAV) is an occupational hazard to workers using hand-held mechanical equipment. Highway utilities maintenance and repair operatives (HUMRo) use an array of such equipment; their risk is assessed as a basis to inform health and safety management, in particular, as a first step in helping establish a semi-automated risk assessment system within a collaborating national (GB) utility contractor organisation. A work study regime is implemented with the collaborating contractor to record HUMRo's use of mechanical hand-held equipment during typical working days. Analyses on these data determine average daily HAV exposure levels and these are evaluated against UK legislative benchmarks. The majority of HUMRo are exposed below the legislative "action" level; while 15% were above this, of which 1.5% of these exceeded the defined legal maximum exposure. Workers performing "opening up/services" work type on "gas supply" equipment might be at most exposure risk; as are "alpha-males" who tend to use mechanical equipment more than their work colleagues.

Little work has been done in this area due to its complexity and the absence of adequate research tools. The authors used the approach of indirect parameters to automate the performance measurement. In this approach, the location of the worker is measured as a function of time and special algorithms convert these data into labor inputs, or productivity. Research in this area requires a reliable method, or tool, for workers location measurement - such a tool does not exist. Three methods of location measurement are examined in this paper as research tools for automated labor control: (1) manual simulation of location measurement, (2) GPS, and (3) video photography. The first two methods were found to be subjective, inaccurate and unreliable. The third was found to be suitable for the purpose of the present research. This method uses a classical time-lapse technique, together with a video-based method developed in the present research.

J	Behm, M				Behm, Michael			Safe Design Suggestions for Vegetated Roofs	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Vegetated roof; Safe design	GREEN-ROOF; PREVENTION; MITIGATION; RUNOFF	Rooftop vegetation is becoming increasingly popular because of its environmental benefits and its ability to earn green-building certification credits. With the exception of one international guideline, there is little mention of worker safety and health in vegetated-roof codes and literature. Observations and field investigations of 19 vegetated roofs in the United States revealed unsafe access for workers and equipment, a lack of fall-protection measures, and other site-specific hazards. Design for safety strategies and the integration of life-cycle safety thinking with green-building credits systems are the preferred methods to reduce risk to workers on vegetated roofs. Design suggestions have been developed to add to the body of knowledge. The findings complement several National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) construction and prevention through design (PtD) goals and are congruent with NIOSH's Safe Green Jobs initiative. Organizations that install and maintain vegetated roofs can utilize the findings to understand hazards, take precautions, and incorporate safety into their bids.

However, most of the previous studies were limited to reflect the site safety management process, which normally consists of planning-education-inspection phases. This study proposes a framework for a novel safety management and visualization system (SMVS) that integrates building information modeling (BIM), location tracking, augmented reality (AR), and game technologies. A prototype system has been developed and tested based on an illustrative accident scenario. The potentials and technical limitations of the prototype SMVS have been evaluated by site safety experts. A case study was also implemented, whose results show that the SMVS has a great potential to improve the identification of field safety risks, increase the risk recognition capacity of workers, and enhance the real-time communication between construction manager and workers.

However, it remains a challenge to use existing risk assessment methods for detecting and classifying awkward working postures because these methods are either intrusive or rely on subjective judgment. Therefore, this study developed a novel and non-invasive method to automatically detect and classify awkward working postures based on foot plantar pressure distribution data measured by a wearable insole pressure system. Ten asymptomatic participants performed five different types of awkward working postures (i.e., overhead working, squatting, stooping, semi-squatting, and one-legged kneeling) in a laboratory setting. Four supervised machine learning classifiers (i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)) were used for classification performance using a 0.32 s window size. Cross-validation results showed that the SVM classifier (i.e., the best classifier) obtained a classification performance with an accuracy of 99.70% and a sensitivity of each awkward working posture was above 99.00% at 0.32 s window size. The findings substantiated that it is feasible to use a wearable insole pressure system to identify risk factors for developing WMSDs, and could help safety managers to minimize workers' exposure to awkward working postures.

The current approach to training workers relies primarily on instilling practice and experience in conventional teacher-apprentice settings on and off site. Both have their limitations however, on-site training is very inefficient and interferes with progress on site, while off-site training provides little opportunity to develop the practical skills and awareness needed through hands-on experience. A more effective way is to train workers in safety awareness and efficient working by current novel information technologies. This paper describes a new and innovative prototype system the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS) to train precast installation workers to be highly productive while being fully aware of the hazards involved. PCMS uses Chirp-Spread-Spectrum-based (CSS) real-time location technology and Unity3D-based data visualisation technology to track construction resources (people, equipment, materials, etc.) and provide real-time feedback and post-event visualisation analysis in a training environment. A trial of a precast facade installation on a real site demonstrates the benefits gained by PCMS in comparison with equivalent training using conventional methods. It is concluded that, although the study is based on specific industrial conditions found in Hong Kong construction projects, PCMS may well attract wider interest and use in future.

To remain safe, workers must be able to effectively identify, value, and respond to dangers in their work environment. The sense of comfort or discomfort associated with a hazard (i.e., risk tolerance) can play a significant role in the propensity to engage in an unsafe behavior. However, it remains unclear if, and to what extent, risk tolerance in personal life is associated with risk tolerance at work or with the propensity to break safety rules at work. To address this knowledge gap, this research tested the hypotheses that personal risk tolerance influences both work-related risk tolerance and the propensity to break safety rules. These hypotheses were tested using linear mixed-effects models with data from a survey administered to 11,811 workers from 19 countries. Results indicated that personal risk-tolerance is positively associated with both work-related risk tolerance and risk-taking behavior. However, when controlling for demographic dimensions, the relationship between personal risk tolerance and risk-taking behavior was no longer significant. Practically, these results suggest that holistic training programs for reducing or calibrating safety risk tolerance should focus on personal life in addition to work, and the demographics and social interactions of the workers also should be considered when studying safety behavior.

J	Langdon, RR; Sawang, S				Langdon, Rebecca R.; Sawang, Sukanlaya			Construction Workers' Well-Being: What Leads to Depression, Anxiety, and Stress?	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction workers; Coping; Mental health; Stressors; Work-life demands; Labor and personnel issues	ALCOHOL-USE; LIFE; PERFORMANCE; SUICIDE; INJURY; METAANALYSIS; SYMPTOMS; DISTRESS; OPTIMISM; SCALES	Work-related stress is an important issue in any industry, particularly in construction, in which stressful environments are frequently encountered. What are the primary stressors in the construction workplace? and What are the relationships between the strain effect of psychological distress and the countermeasures and coping mechanisms used by construction workers? are, therefore, critical questions. The first question was addressed by using Q-methodology survey with 18 participants. The results showed that time, personal finance and the nature of tasks are important stressors. For the second question, a questionnaire survey administered to 91 participants on two construction sites of a single contractor was used to collect data about the stressors, psychological strain effects, and coping strategies they used. Mediated regression analysis of the data showed that lack of personal and family time, increases in the cost of living, and fears about job security all act as powerful stressors. Coping strategies including acceptance, self-blame, and disengagement are associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Increased substance use, although associated with lower levels of anxiety, may only be a short-term coping mechanism. An anomaly was found with humor as a coping strategy, in which the relationship was found to be counterintuitive and contrary to the findings of previous research. Future research should examine this more closely. Employers should better inform workers about the negative effects of maladaptive coping strategies and offer opportunities for adopting more positive alternatives.

Until the last few decades, there is very limited research on construction WP in HHWCs. Nevertheless, these studies have sparked interests on seeking for the most appropriate methods to assess the impact of HHWCs on construction workers. Design/methodology/approach This paper begins by reviewing the current measuring methods on WP in HHWCs, follows by presenting the potential impact of HHWCs on WP. The paper highlights the methodological deficiencies, which consequently provides a platform for scholars and practitioners to direct future research to resolve the significant productivity loss due to global warming. This paper highlights the need to identify the limitations and advantages of the current methods to formulate a framework of new approaches to measure the WP in HHWCs. Findings Results show that the methods used in providing real-time response on the effects of HHWCs on WP in construction at project, task and crew levels are limited. An integration of nonintrusive real-time monitoring system and local weather measurement with real-time data synchronisation and analysis is required to produce suitable information to determine worker health- and safety-related decisions in HHWCs. Originality/value The comprehensive literature review makes an original contribution to WP measurements filed in HHWCs in the construction industry. Results of this review provide researchers and practitioners with an insight into challenges associated with the measurements methods and solving practical site measurements issues. The findings will also enable the researchers and practitioners to bridge the identified research gaps in this research field and enhance the ability to provide accurate measures in HHWCs. The proposed research framework may promote potential improvements in the productivity measurements methods, which support researchers and practitioners in developing new innovative methods in HHWCs with the integration of the most recent monitoring technologies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of leadership style and communication practices of Australian construction supervisors on workgroup health and safety (H&S) climate and behaviour. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was administered to members of 20 workgroups engaged in rail construction work on the Level Crossing Removal Project and the Melbourne Metro Tunnel Project in Victoria, Australia. The survey measured components of supervisors' transformational and transactional leadership, communication practices, the group H&S climate and workers' self-reported H&S compliance and participation. Findings Supervisors' transformational and transactional leadership, as well as communication practices, were all positively and significantly correlated with group H&S climate and workers' self-reported H&S behaviours. The transformational leadership component of providing an appropriate model was the strongest predictor of H&S participation, while H&S compliance was predicted by the transactional leadership component of providing contingent reward, as well as supervisors' communication practices. H&S climate fully mediated the relationship between supervisory leadership and workers' self-reported H&S behaviour. Originality/value The research demonstrates that both transformational and transactional supervisory leadership are important in the construction context. Effective communication between supervisors and workers is also important for H&S. The findings suggest that supervisory leadership development programmes may be an effective way to improve H&S performance in predominantly subcontracted construction workgroups.

To encourage the proactive safety management these opportunities present, extensive research efforts have explored using various wearable sensing technologies-including motion sensors (e.g., inertial measurement units) and physiological sensors (e.g., heart-rate sensors, electrodermal-activity sensors, skin-temperature sensors, eye trackers, and brainwave monitors)-to detect potential safety hazards and to continuously monitor a worker's health on a construction jobsite. However, these efforts tend to be piecemeal or fragmented, which presents a challenge for both the practitioners and the researchers who wish to fully understand the current developments in this area. In this context, this paper provides a critical review of the state of the art of wearable applications in construction safety and health. The review first identifies five general applications within the literature: preventing musculoskeletal disorders, preventing falls, assessing physical workload and fatigue, evaluating hazard-recognition abilities, and monitoring workers' mental status. Second, this study identifies the challenges impeding further development and deployment of wearable applications, specifically, signal artifacts and noise in wearable-sensors' field measurements, variable standards for personal safety and health risks in construction, users' resistance to technology adoption, and uncertainty regarding the return on investment. Lastly, this paper recommends future research opportunities for advancing the field, especially in terms of conducting sensor fusion for wearable applications, developing a business case, and engaging wearables in risk assessment and post-injury compensability assessment.

J	Zuluaga, CM; Albert, A; Arroyo, P				Zuluaga, Carlos M.; Albert, Alex; Arroyo, Paz			Protecting Bridge Maintenance Workers from Falls: Evaluation and Selection of Compatible Fall Protection Supplementary Devices	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Fall protection; Virtual prototyping; Highway worker safety; Injury prevention; Choosing by advantages	CONSTRUCTION	Falls from bridge decks are a common issue among highway and bridge maintenance workers. These workers generally rely on existing bridge guardrails for their protection against falls when working on bridge decks. Unfortunately, a large number of bridge guardrails do not provide the required barrier height of 107 +/- 8cm (42 +/- 3in.) for sufficient protection. To overcome this issue, a few departments of transportation (DOTs) have recently begun installing Fall Protection Supplementary Devices (FPSDs) on bridge guardrailsto temporarily increase the overall barrier height during work. However, many manufactured and marketed FPSDs are not compatibleor do not firmly attach onto every bridge guardrail. Therefore, workers are often tasked with assessing the compatibility of FPSDs with particular bridge guardrails before initiating work. Traditionally, this has been performed using an inefficient trial-and-error based approachwhere potential FPSDs are procured, transported, and iteratively tested with a number of bridge guardrails. Apart from this inefficient testing procedure, current literature does not offer any guidance on the selection of efficient FPSDs based on the advantages they offer. Therefore, compatible FPSD systems that are not optimal for work efficiency, productivity, and safety are commonly adopted in practice. To resolve these challenges, the current research focused on identifying compatible FPSDsthat offer the most advantagesfor 12 bridge guardrails that appear across 11,000 bridges in North Carolina. The study objectives were accomplished by (1)building virtual prototypes of existing bridge guardrails and FPSD systems and assessing compatibility in a virtual setting; (2)identifying desirable FPSD characteristics that can lead to improvements in work-efficiency, productivity, and safety (i.e.,advantages); and (3)evaluating potential FPSD systems for each guardrail using the structured Choosing by Advantages (CBA) methodto identify FPSD systems that offer the most important set of advantages. The study addresses a nationwide safety issue experienced by all transportation agencies in the United States and beyond. It is expected that the findings will encourage more DOTs to adopt efficient fall protection measures and systems to protect their workforce.

J	Pirzadeh, P; Lingard, H				Pirzadeh, Payam; Lingard, Helen			Working from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Health and Well-Being of Project-Based Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; Mental well-being; Construction; Work from home; Work&#8211; life satisfaction; Pandemic	PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; FAMILY CONFLICT; PARADOX; DEMANDS; CONSEQUENCES; QUARANTINE; TELEWORK; PROFESSIONALS; RESOURCES; STRESS	In the ongoing attempt to prevent the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and flatten the curve, governments and employers have encouraged (and in some cases required) workers to work at home. This sudden widespread shift to home-based teleworking was not anticipated. Consequently, the ability to make provisions to ensure the health and safety of workers was limited. Further, in many cases, the shift to working at home has been involuntary and likely to continue for an extended period. The study presented in this paper aimed to examine the health and well-being experiences in a sample of professional/managerial workers who were engaged in teleworking as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation developed. Data were collected from workers in the Australian construction industry who were required to work from home on alternate weeks to reduce the number of people in project offices. A multiwave survey was conducted at three construction projects. Longitudinal analysis of the data indicated a consistent gradual decline in the mental well-being of participants. The analysis identified a positive and significant relationship between work-life satisfaction and mental well-being and indicated that the effects of work hours, work pressure, work engagement, and work-life interference on mental well-being were mediated by the extent to which participants were satisfied with their work-life balance. Combining these results with qualitative comments made by participants helped to understand their varying experiences during the pandemic and the impact on their mental well-being. The results highlight the importance of considering work-life satisfaction and creating opportunities for improved work-family balance when designing teleworking arrangements. The paper contributes to knowledge and practice by providing the evidence that helps organizations to maximize the health benefits and reduce the risks associated with home-based working during (and potentially beyond) the pandemic.

J	Yi, W; Chan, APC				Yi, Wen; Chan, Albert P. C.			Optimal Work Pattern for Construction Workers in Hot Weather: A Case Study in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction industry; Direct-work rates; Hot and humid climate; Monte Carlo simulation; Work patterns; Work-rest schedule	HEAT-STRESS; REST BREAKS; HUMID ENVIRONMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACCIDENT RISK; REBAR WORKERS; JOB ROTATION; PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE; SITES	Having established a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm to optimize work-rest schedule in a hot and humid environment, this paper attempts to develop the algorithm and identify an optimal work pattern, which may maximize the direct-work rates and minimize the health hazard due to heat stress to the workers concerned. Traditionally, construction workers in Hong Kong start work at 8: 00 a.m. and finish work at 6: 00 p.m., having one hour lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and an additional break of 30 min at 3: 15 p.m. Construction workers can beat the heat by starting earlier to avoid some extreme conditions, which may occur at certain times of a day. By maintaining the current practice of 9-h working duration for a day, 21 additional work patterns with different start and finish times were proposed and evaluated by the developed optimization algorithm. An optimized schedule (direct-work rate of 87.8%) of working from 7: 30 a.m. to 12: 00 p.m. with a 20 min break at 9: 40 a.m., having lunch break between 12: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 p.m., and working from 1: 00 p.m. to 5: 30 p.m. with a 30 min break at 3: 00 p.m. is proposed. The proposed work pattern not only maximizes direct-work rates but also minimizes the occurrence of heat stress on construction site. This will enable policy makers to derive solid guidelines for working in hot weather.

J	Agarwal, P; Everett, JG				Agarwal, P; Everett, JG			Strategies for construction contractors to reduce workers' compensation costs	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Workers' compensation insurance (WCI) premiums for construction companies are higher than those for most other industries. WCI is increasingly affecting contractors' ability to conduct business and has already made the costs of performing certain types of work in certain states prohibitively expensive. However, there are a number of strategies construction companies can employ to lower their WCI costs. These include the formation of industry groups, safety programs and lobbying for legislative reform. Groups of like-minded employers pool risk and provide better credit worthiness to potential insurers. Insurers in return are able to reduce marketing costs as well as claims processing and safety costs. An effective safety program can also greatly reduce workplace injuries. Multidepartmental and multilevel teams with the support of top management can help establish, implement, and continuously improve safety programs. Along with voluntary measures that an employer can take, it is essential that employers encourage their legislators to cure the workers' compensation system. In states where legislative reform has taken place, losses and premiums have declined significantly. The writers hope that this paper will encourage construction companies to better understand the control they have over their own WCI costs and the benefits of improving their own safety performance.

Such activities can contribute to an early retirement for masons, resulting in a shortage of skilled craft workers. Previous ergonomic studies have observed that workers develop safer and more productive work techniques as they gain experience. This study aims to analyze relationships between body loads, experience, and work methods. Specifically, we expanded a previous pilot study by increasing the number of participants from 21 masons to 66 masons. Participants completed a prebuilt standard concrete masonry unit (CMU) lead wall using 45 CMUs. Motion capture suits were used to capture masons' motions, and a combined biomechanical-productivity analysis was carried out to determine the loads experienced by major body joints. Exploiting the larger dataset, this study assessed how different experience groups load their joints and adjust their work techniques as the work height changes. The results suggested that experienced journeymen adopt similar work techniques distinct from those of less experienced workers. Further, training apprentices to adopt these work methods can help reduce occupational injuries and improve productivity. The results show that the journeymen with more than 20 years of experience adopt safer and more productive work techniques distinct from those of less experienced workers. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge on masons' safety and productivity by providing an in-depth understanding of the linkage between body loads, work experience, techniques, and productivity. Additionally, the findings in this study are expected to have a greater impact when they are adopted to apprentice-training methods and applied to other high musculoskeletal-disorders-risk trades.

Communicating Health and Safety on a Multinational Construction Project: Challenges and Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Communication; Ethnography; Multinational; Migrant workers; Safety	UK CONSTRUCTION; MIGRANT WORKERS; INDUSTRY; SUCCESS; LABOR	The health and safety (H&S) of workers is a critical project management goal in construction. As globalization and migrant movement increases, construction projects are becoming more nationally diverse. Among multinational workforces, language barriers present an obvious but largely unresolved H&S communication challenge, with current strategies in use yet to be assessed. On a large construction project in the United Kingdom, H&S communication strategies were explored through an ethnographic approach. This paper contributes by revealing the impracticalities of using employees as interpreters in workgroups of six or more and the limitations of technologies in a dynamic construction site environment. It also highlights the unresolved challenge of translating safety videos in multiple languages. Challenges arose including translators refusing to translate because they were not receiving extra financial benefits or recognition in their workload. Translators were also given favorable treatment during disciplinary processes because they were crucial to the continued operation of the site team. This reveals the complexities involved in implementing effective H&S communication strategies on international and multinational projects, which have previously remained largely ignored.

J	Nembhard, DA; Uzumeri, MV				Nembhard, DA; Uzumeri, MV			An individual-based description of learning within an organization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						comparative study; learning; performance measurement; productivity	CURVE MODELS	We examine the problem of selecting a model for an individual-based representation of leaning within a population of learners. Individual-based representations can be used to create distributions of learning patterns in the workplace. This is an alternate theoretical view of learning in organizations whereby performance is a unique attribute of each individual within the organization. Several published learning curve models are fitted to 3874 episodes of individual performance improvement. We conclude that a three-parameter hyperbolic function outperforms the other models for this application. This approach provides managers with: 1) distributions of between-worker variability with respect to rate of learning, prior learning, and steady-state production rates; 2) A quantitative measure of workforce learning that can provide information useful for workforce task-assignments; and 3) a methodological framework for selecting a most preferred individual model such that workforce distributions may be constructed and provide such information. Results indicate that workers perform in a region between the two extremes of fast improvement to a low level of productivity and slow improvement to a high level of productivity. Also, workers with more prior experience tend to have a higher steady-state productivity level.

As construction projects become bigger and more complex, this dynamism can lead to more frequent incidents on jobsites. Safety training, personal protective equipment, and regulations have been applied to improve the safety of construction sites. However, because of the dynamic and congested nature of construction sites, these practices still cannot guarantee safety. This paper proposes a vision-based hazard avoidance system that proactively informs workers of potentially dangerous situations. The system enables workers to recognize and consequently avoid dangers before accidents occur by displaying augmented hazard information on a wearable device. The system comprises of three modules; a vision-based site monitoring module that utilizes image capture device and wearable devices to identify site hazards, a safety assessment module that uses captured image data and fuzzy-based reasoning to evaluate the safety level of each object, and a visualization module that provides actionable information such as hazard orientation, distance, and safety level. The safety information provided by the proposed system can mitigate hazards and improve construction site safety.

Although research has established that PCS is critical to safety management in construction sites, there is limited evidence on how PCS affects construction workers' safety behavior, including compliance and participation. Building upon the psychological contract theory and social exchange theory, this study investigates the mediating mechanisms that link PCS to safety compliance and safety participation, that is, felt safety responsibility and safety-specific trust in supervisors. Overall, 389 valid data points from multiple sources comprising construction workers and their supervisors from 15 construction projects were collected. The results reveal that felt safety responsibility and safety-specific trust in supervisors partially mediate the relationships between PCS and both safety compliance and safety participation. The findings extend the safety behavior literature by clarifying the two distinct PCS processes toward safety behavior. Interventions should target improving employees' perception of PCS to support their engagement in safety behavior.

The rate of fatalities, however, has recently increased. Human factors, like fatigue, strongly relate to fatalities. The prediction of fatigue would allow for an early intervention, thus mitigating safety risk. The literature suggests several potential predictors of fatigue onset; however, each of these was mainly studied in isolation, in laboratory settings, and their predictive validity in the construction industry remains unknown. The authors hypothesized that a set of measurable factors can predict construction worker fatigue. A field study of 252 US construction workers was conducted in which potential predictors and fatigue levels were assessed, and the first fatigue predictive models for construction workers were created. The models presented low to medium predictivity, demonstrating that laboratory research and results obtained from other occupations do not directly apply to the construction industry. Furthermore, fatigue predictive models showed to differ among trades. These models will serve the industry to better manage fatigue; however, further research in this area is needed.

Research has proposed detecting visibility-related close calls in order to alarm the involved personnel and prevent negative consequences at the earliest possible time. This work has three objectives: First, a comprehensive synthesis on close call reporting processes and individual technologies. Second, a system focusing on (a) autonomous close call data generation from real-time proactive proximity detection and alerting technology and (b) cloud-based data processing and visualization in building information models at run time. Test results demonstrate that the developed system reaches purposes for decision making in safety management beyond the scope of existing detection and alarming devices. Third, guiding future research by outlining the role of proximity detection and alarming technology in developing autonomous safety systems for construction.

J	Allison, L; Kaminsky, J				Allison, Leigh; Kaminsky, Jessica			Safety Communication Networks: Females in Small Work Crews	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Construction; Communication; Gender; Female; Social networks; Labor and personnel issues	CONSTRUCTION	Construction workers experience one of the highest workplace injury and fatality rates in the United States. Recent research has shown that worker demographics such as language affect safety communication in small work crews. Noting the lack of gender diversity among construction workers, this research extends this past work by exploring how gender impacts work crew safety communication using social network analysis (SNA). The data, collected in transportation construction work zones in Washington State, show females have significantly (p <= 0.05) lower amounts of in-degree (incoming ties) and in-closeness (distance for information to travel) than males in mixed-gender crews. Furthermore, mixed-gender crews have lower formal density and higher informal density than all-male crews. Practically speaking, this research shows that mixed-gender crews have different safety communication patterns than the more homogenous all-male crews. In order to understand the specific connections between the communication patterns and crew safety performance, safety professionals should track incidents, near misses, and hazards at the crew level. Furthermore, to create more cohesive safety communication, project managers, superintendents, and supervisors should foster communication cultures that are inclusive of all members.

There are plans, while there have been few methods for examining these plans. We argue that capturing and visualizing actual dynamic workspaces is fundamental to plan examination. This paper describes an initial effort on integrating the latest computer vision methods to implement automatic detection and visualization of dynamic workspaces of workers on foot. To this end, object detection, multiple object tracking, and action recognition are adopted to collect two types of action data: action classes and action locations. A density-based spatial clustering algorithm is used to reason dynamic workspaces based on the action data.

Delegation or Collaboration: Understanding Different Construction Stakeholders' Perceptions of Robotization	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION; USER ACCEPTANCE; AUTOMATION; TRUST	Recent advances in robotic technologies have stimulated interest in bringing robots onto construction sites, which will in turn bring robots and humans into closer working proximity. Introducing robots requires significant redesign of construction processes, crew compositions, and task allocations, and understanding potential end users' perceptions and expectations of these robots is the critical first step in designing and implementing effective collaborative work between humans and robots. To this end, this study examines trade workers' and managers' perceptions and expectations of construction robots. This study undertook a qualitative content analysis of interviews with 36 construction professionals to examine how different stakeholders present their perceptions and expectations of robots, depending on their organizational position and specialized trade work. The analysis results indicate that job complexity and the perceived safety risk associated with the trade most significantly influence workers' desired capabilities for robots as well as their perceptions of robots' usefulness. Based on these findings, this study establishes workers' fundamental conceptions of construction robots with respect to job characteristics, establishing the groundwork and direction for future construction robot development.

Decision-Making Chains in Electrical Safety for Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Workplace safety; Electrocution; Feature of work; Risk management; Classification tree; Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID); IDEF0	NARRATIVE TEXT; OCCUPATIONAL FATALITIES; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; INJURY; INFORMATION; SIMULATION; DEATHS; DESIGN; MODELS	Electrocution is one of the four leading causes of worker deaths in the construction sector, and thus it is paramount to identify its mechanisms. This work interprets the mechanisms of an electrical accident as a chain of decision mistakes throughout the entire task process. The objective of this paper is to visualize the decision-making chains in workplace electrical safety for construction workers. Because of construction's "one-off" nature, the researchers narrow the decision-making chain for specific "features of work" (FOW), a group of distinct activities possessing higher occupational safety and health (OSH) risks and requiring particular attention. By analyzing National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) electrocution reports, the authors identify five features of work and illustrate their decision-making chains. This work promotes electrical safety and injury prevention through the decision-making lens and contributes to the scholarly body of knowledge by introducing a comprehensive approach to the decision-making chain that is applicable to other safety research.

The approach uses a self-supported steel joint that changes the shape of existing steel members, an automated wire control machine that supports the assembly process, and control by a worker on the work floor. Development procedures consisted of the following steps: (1)setting up the development direction, (2)designing and producing the prototypes, (3)assessing the proposed approach through mock-up tests and modifying the prototypes, and (4)verifying the proposed approach through field application at a pilot project site. Overall, the time and cost to assemble beams in the pilot project site were reduced by 3days and $1365.32, respectively. In particular, safety was improved by 82.35% compared with the conventional process. The proposed approach is expected to be a practical alternative providing improved safety of the steel beam assembly process. Furthermore, development procedures involved in this study may be useful to researchers interested in developing advanced construction methods.

Construction workers are prone to getting into musculoskeletal disorders-related injuries while performing such activities. The paper proposes a novel approach to identify the theoretical maximum attainable level of safety, safety frontier, for a given construction task that can be achieved in perfect conditions under good management. The paper outlines the method and the framework components and demonstrates them through an actual construction-lab-based case study. The case study includes computation of safety frontier for lifting and setting down tasks. For this, the paper proposes to use a depth sensor camera (Kinect) for workers' postural data collection while performing the task. With the postural data as an input feature, all the unique actions are identified using a random forest classifier model for each movement frame. Also, the paper proposes to develop a moment prediction model to predict the lower back moment exerted in each movement frame. The lower back moment is computed using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamic in OpenSim for the training data set. Then, the paper implements a random forest regression algorithm to create a moment prediction model with postural data and velocity as input features. Finally, the safe work posture, safety frontier is computed, combining the unique actions exerting minimum lower back moment. The computed safety frontier can potentially help the safety managers to improve their safety strategies by providing a higher safety benchmark for monitoring their construction site.

JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Hazard recognition; Hazard identification; Safety management; Safety interventions; Safety training; Labor and personnel issues	RISK PERCEPTION; SAFETY; HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION	Proper hazard recognition is an essential prerequisite to effective safety management. However, recent research has demonstrated that a large proportion of safety hazards remain unrecognized and unmanaged in complex and dynamic construction environments. Despite the importance of hazard recognition, there is a dearth of research examining why construction hazards remain unrecognized. Although few studies have examined upstream factors such as management support and experience that can indirectly influence hazard recognition levels, studies have not focused on downstream workplace factors that directly impact performance. The objective of this exploratory research was to address this knowledge gap by identifying potential impediments to hazard recognition while workers examine the work environment. In the first phase of the study, eight construction workers were engaged in a hazard recognition activity using construction case images captured from real projects within the United States. Brainstorming sessions were then conducted with the workers to identify why certain hazards remained unrecognized. In the following second phase, additional factors that impact hazard recognition and relevant industry examples were gathered by engaging an expert panel of industry professionals and academic researchers. The research process yielded 13 factors that can potentially impede thorough hazard recognition. A follow-up validation study with construction workers revealed that the most common reasons that lead to unrecognized hazards included: (1)selective attention or inattention to certain hazard types, (2)unknown potential hazard set, and (3)the perception that certain hazards impose low levels of safety risk. The findings of this research will be useful in developing effective hazard recognition methods and safety training programs that are cognizant of field-level challenges.

J	Loudoun, R; Townsend, K				Loudoun, Rebecca; Townsend, Keith			Implementing health promotion programs in the Australian construction industry Levers and agents for change	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; Change management; Retention; Organizational effectiveness; Construction management; Health and safety	PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASES; WORKPLACE HEALTH; OUTDOOR WORKERS; INTERVENTIONS; RISK; DETERMINANTS; METAANALYSIS; PROTECTION; EMPLOYERS; OBESITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify possible agents and levers to trigger the development and implementation of work place health promotion programs (WHPPs) in the Australian construction industry. Unlike most large workplaces and most high-risk workplaces, these programs are rarely found in the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative interviews with 80 trades workers and site- based and off-site construction managers are used to reveal perceptions of the impact of WHPPs and ill-health and poor health behaviors on site activities with a view to identifying leverage points to introduce WHPPs in construction. Findings - Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are seen as impacting on sites in three main ways: productivity (broadly defined), safety and interpersonal relations. Results also reveal specific roles and levers for different actors in the supply chain and a clear desire for a collective, industry-based response to identified health problems. Practical implications - High levels of chronic diseases in the construction industry means firms within the sector must make a concerted attempt to change patterns of behavior or face significant long-term health implications for their workforce. Reducing levels of health and longevity of the workforce, mean work performance, productivity and participation is likely to decline. Originality/value - Although construction workers are recognized as one of the workforces at most risk for life limiting diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, relatively little work has investigated health and well-being considerations for construction workers. This study contributes by investigating possible levers and agents to create healthier workplaces in construction.

Selection of wearable sensor measurements for monitoring and managing entry-level construction worker fatigue: a logistic regression approach	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Technology; Management; Construction safety; Information and communication technology (ICT) applications	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS; SLEEP; HEALTH; WORKFORCE; THERAPY; DEMANDS; SCALES; MODEL	Purpose The identification of fatigue status and early intervention to mitigate fatigue can reduce the risk of workplace injuries. Off-the-shelf wearable sensors capable of assessing multiple parameters are available. However, using numerous variables in the fatigue prediction model can elicit data issues. This study aimed at identifying the most relevant variables for measuring occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers by using common wearable sensor technologies, such as electrocardiogram and actigraphy sensors. Design/methodology/approach Twenty-two individuals were assigned different task workloads in repeated sessions. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the most parsimonious fatigue prediction model. Heart rate variability measurements, standard deviation of NN intervals and power in the low-frequency range (LF) were considered for fatigue prediction. Fast Fourier transform and autoregressive (AR) analysis were employed as frequency domain analysis methods. Findings The log-transformed LF obtained using AR analysis is preferred for daily fatigue management, whereas the standard deviation of normal-to-normal NN is useful in weekly fatigue management. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted with entry-level construction workers who are involved in manual material handling activities. The findings of this study are applicable to this group. Originality/value This is the first study to investigate all major measures obtainable through electrocardiogram and actigraphy among current mainstream wearables for monitoring occupational fatigue in the construction industry. It contributes knowledge on the use of wearable technology for managing occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers engaged in material handling activities.

However, in these techniques, data collection and analysis still remain manual. Remotely locating workers on site has been suggested as a potential technology to collect crucial data required for production control. The purpose of this study is to test the applicability of a real-time tracking system for collecting data for production control in different types of construction projects. We applied Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in real-time tracking of workers in three case projects, including residential, office building, and plumbing renovation. We compared various tracking device placement strategies and analyzed the share of uninterrupted presence of workers in work locations based on the collected data. The findings show that both location-based and time-based information of workers can be obtained in real time from the proposed system, but issues of accuracy and coverage need to be considered when defining the data collection plan for each project. Accuracy and coverage issues can be resolved to a significant degree by applying heuristics in data analysis rather than investing in a more sophisticated tracking technology. The conclusion is that real-time tracking technologies are ready for implementation when certain heuristics and guidelines for installation are followed. It is possible to calculate a real-time presence index on a construction site. These data could be used to evaluate the impact of construction management interventions on waste on-site.

Risk Behavior-Based Trajectory Prediction for Construction Site Safety Monitoring	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Trajectory prediction; Real-time tracking; Global positioning system (GPS); Markov model; Risk attitude; Quantitative methods	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; TRACKING; LOCATION; MOTION; OLDER	Construction sites are often described as some of the most hazardous work environments due to the unscripted nature of tasks which puts workers and equipment in close proximity, potentially resulting in near-miss situations or life-threatening contact collisions. Previous research has investigated location-aware methods to improve construction safety but has mostly fallen short in exploring the extent to which prediction techniques can be used to model and formulate the role and attributes of individual workers in addition to the physical characteristics of the jobsite that may lead to safety incidents. This paper studies the feasibility of a preemptive proximity-based safety framework by investigating two trajectory prediction models, namely polynomial regression (PR) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM prediction is further calibrated by factoring in a worker's risk profile, which is a measure of his or her affinity for or aversion to risky behavior near hazards. The method is tested in a series of field experiments involving trajectories of different shapes and complexity. Results demonstrate that the developed methodology can reliably detect unsafe movements and impending collision events.

Low-Cost Ergonomic Intervention for Mitigating Physical and Subjective Discomfort during Manual Rebar Tying	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction ergonomics; Rebar tying; Occupational safety and health; Biomechanical evaluation; Labor and personnel issues	MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; MUSCLE FATIGUE; FOLLOW-UP; BACK; WORK; FLEXION; QUANTIFICATION; BIOMECHANICS; PREVALENCE	The construction industry around the globe is facing a massive predicament of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), largely attributed to the excessive physical exertion at worksites. Whereas ergonomic interventions are suggested to be an effective approach to mitigate such routine exertion, these ergonomic interventions should be task specific because of the unique characteristics of each trade (such as rebar work; a construction trade with a high prevalence rate of MSDs). Despite numerous potential interventions available for rebar workers, none of them has been widely adopted, especially in the Asian market. After considering various reasons impeding their broad usage, the authors coined a simple ergonomic solution by attaching a low height domestic stool to the pants of rebar workers. This would allow them to sit and work instead of squatting, which is the most preferred posture in Asian cultures for working at ground level. The novel intervention was tested against squatting for various physical outcomes (i.e., muscle activity, neuromuscular fatigue, trunk kinematics and lower extremity blood circulation) and self-perceived discomfort, using a simulated rebar tying task in a laboratory. These findings demonstrate that the intervention has beneficial effects on both physical and subjective outcomes, and has a great potential in reducing workrelated MSDs among Asian rebar workers. Additionally, the current study highlights that ergonomic interventions in the construction industry should be derived based on both the characteristics of specific construction trades and culture of workers.

J	Alruwaythi, O; Goodrum, P				Alruwaythi, Omar; Goodrum, Paul			A Difference in Perspective: Impact of Different Formats of Engineering Information and Spatial Cognition on Craft-Worker Eye-Gaze Patterns	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Engineering information delivery; Spatial cognition; Labor productivity; Eye tracking		Individuals vary widely in their ability to translate complex spatial information into performing physical tasks. Much of the variability can be explained by their experience in using different information formats and differences in individual spatial cognition. Traditional delivery of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) designs rely on two-dimensional isometric drawings. Advancements in three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD), augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D printing have provided new format options for delivering engineering information; however, providing them to crafts for use at the construction workface remains relatively rare. The objective of this research is to understand how eye-gaze patterns of construction craft workers is influenced by information formats and spatial cognition when building a complex spatial task. A series of field trials with MEP workers was conducted to examine the influence of information format and spatial cognition on their eye-gaze patterns in building a scale-model pipe assembly. Participants were provided eye-tracking glasses along with one of three information formats: two-dimensional (2D) isometric drawings, 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 3D image of the assembly, and 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 3D physical model of the assembly. Card rotation and cube comparison tests were administered to measure spatial cognition. The results of this paper reveal that the information format and spatial cognition significantly influenced workers' eye-gaze patterns; there are different gaze patterns for different information formats, and these differences in gaze patterns were associated with differences in spatial cognition abilities. Additionally, the improvement in performance when using different engineering information formats is associated with different eye-gaze patterns.

Existing computer vision-based NHU inspection methods lack capabilities in identifying workers and helping take real-time action. Previous sensor-based NHU inspection methods require direct skin contact, which would be uncomfortable for workers. In addition, previous sensor-based methods could be deceived by objects other than human heads and could not achieve real-time alarms. This study aims to address these problems by implementing real-time alarming, monitoring, and locating for NHU in construction based on sensor, mobile, web, and cloud techniques. A smart hard-hat system is developed using an Internet of Things (IoT)-based architecture including (1) a hard hat with an infrared beam detector and thermal infrared sensor for nonintrusive NHU detection; (2) radio-frequency identification (RFID) triggers for locating NHU with an average detection error of less than 10 cm; (3) a smartphone application for personalized warnings; (4) a web application for data visualization and alarms for managers; and (5) a cloud sever for data storage and retrieval. The proposed system enables both workers and managers to take timely actions against NHU. The system performance is evaluated in a laboratory test and validated in a field application. It is indicated that the proposed system is accurate and reliable, showing potential to promote safety inspection and supervision in construction.

J	Teizer, J; Cheng, T				Teizer, Jochen; Cheng, Tao			Proximity hazard indicator for workers-on-foot near miss interactions with construction equipment and geo-referenced hazard areas	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction workers-on-foot and equipment blind spots; Behavior-based safety; Automated data fusion and mining; Occupational safety and health design and planning auditing, education, and training; Lagging and leading safety indicators; Near miss and proximity hazard events; Real-time resource location tracking	TIME SAFETY MANAGEMENT; DATA FUSION; TRACKING; BEHAVIOR; VISION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; AVOIDANCE	Despite the many existing best practices in safety, the construction industry lacks automated safety monitoring and analysis of task-level construction operations. Data to workforce, equipment, and the overall site safety performance are currently observed, measured, and evaluated almost always manually. Such resulting performance information is likely assessed infrequently and due to subjective human interpretation or error. Research in lagging and leading safety indicators shows further that safety knowledge is hardly ever shared among relevant project stakeholders in time to prevent accidents. Since a large number of all construction fatalities are related to struck-by events - for example, workers-on-foot being too close to construction equipment and to other restricted or geo-referenced hazard areas - a novel framework around real-time location tracking technology was designed and tested to collect and study near miss data. The objectives of this article are to automatically identify the areas of static and dynamic hazards on a construction site and to automatically gather and analyze the spatial-temporal conflicts between workers-on-foot and the identified hazards. Automated conversion of raw sensor location data collected to the operation of workers, equipment, and geo-referenced hazard areas into meaningful proximity-related safety information is introduced. Field experiments validate the research based on an a priori created safe site layout information model. Results are in particular useful for practitioners or researchers who would like to enhance their quantitative and visual understanding of operational construction resource activity monitoring and analysis, and in the specific domain of detecting and mapping spatial-temporal proximity relationships of near miss events. Applications of the resulting knowledge are explained in the context of empowering construction safety engineers, managers, and the workforce by enhancing decision making in safe site layout design and planning and providing additional interactive tools in safety education and training.

This research adopts a systems perspective to investigate and analyse various factors affecting labour productivity in Australian multi-storey building construction projects. The factors affecting labour productivity are identified based on the opinions of experts. The complicated interrelated links between influencing factors are drawn using cause and effect feedback loops. These factors are then modelled and analysed taking into account their interactions using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, and the most significant factors affecting labour productivity are determined. These factors include level of skill and experience, fatigue, inadequate supervision, award rates and communication problem with foreign workers. The influencing factors are then divided into cause and effect groups and project size, level of skill and expereince and communication problem with foreign workers are identified as the most impressive factors that affect labour productivity. The proposed method offers a more precise and accurate analysis of various factors affecting labour productivity since the complex inter-related structure of influencing factors is taken into account. The output of this research will give project managers a roadmap for improving labour productivity through the selection and adaptation of most efficient strategies.

The aim of the study presented in this paper was to contribute to understanding a healthy construction site brought about by the best practices implemented by large construction sites to prevent WMSDs. A triangulation method made of interviews, site observations and studies on company's documents was used to identify the best practices in 13 several construction projects. A range of the best practices both in the pre-construction and construction phases of the projects were identified in six different areas of the balance of the construction workplace system; however, there seems to be a significant need for good practices in the management of a systematic work environment. It is now established that Swedish construction industry has several best practices to protect work-related musculoskeletal health. However, inadequate worker participation and the neglect of health and safety issues by designers in the planning process as well as the implications of some remuneration methods on the production schedule were perceived as detrimental to the musculoskeletal health of construction workers.

J	Xia, NN; Tang, YC; Li, DZ; Pan, A				Xia, Nini; Tang, Yuchun; Li, Dezhi; Pan, Ao			Safety Behavior among Construction Workers: Influences of Personality and Leadership	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Personality traits; Safety transformational leadership; Safety compliance; Safety participation; Construction industry	WORKPLACE SAFETY; 5-FACTOR MODEL; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; CONTEXTUAL PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; CLIMATE; ACCIDENTS; SELF; METAANALYSIS; CITIZENSHIP	This study investigated whether the relationships of personality with safety compliance and safety participation remains significant when safety-specific transformational leadership is supplied by supervisors. It also tested the moderating role of this leadership in the personality-safety behavior relationship. One hundred twenty workers completed the Big Five personality test and graded their supervisors' leadership, and the workers' safety behavior was assessed by the supervisors. The results showed that conscientiousness was related positively with safety compliance. Contrary to our theorizing, agreeableness was related negatively with safety compliance. Leadership always positively related to safety compliance and participation, and it also attenuated the relationships of conscientiousness and agreeableness with safety compliance. This enhances the importance of considering safety leadership as an antecedent and intervention of employee safety behavior. However, conscientiousness and agreeableness remained related with safety compliance when safety leadership was considered simultaneously. These findings expand the limited research on the personality-safety behavior relationship in the construction field. Evaluating conscientiousness and agreeableness prior to recruitment can enable employers proactively to curtail unacceptable safety transgressions. Enhancing supervisors' safety leadership helps to prevent employees from performing safety-related actions that are subject to individual dispositions.

J	Chen, S; Demachi, K				Chen, Shi; Demachi, Kazuyuki			Towards on-site hazards identification of improper use of personal protective equipment using deep learning-based geometric relationships and hierarchical scene graph	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction Safety; Personal protective equipment (PPE); Deep learning; Hierarchical scene graph; Hazards identification	INJURIES; SYSTEM; PPE	Construction sites are one of the most perilous environments where many potential hazards may occur. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is an important safety measure used to protect construction workers from accidents. However, PPE usage is not strictly enforced among workers due to all kinds of reasons. This paper proposes a unified model, which enjoys both perceptual and reasoning capabilities, to help to facilitate the safety monitoring work of construction workers to ensure PPE is appropriately used. In contrast to commonly used object detection-based identification approaches, this paper provides a novel solution to identify improper use of PPE by the combination of deep learning-based object detection and individual detection using geometric relationships analysis. Moreover, this paper presents a hierarchical scene graph structure that enables the conditional reasoning for automated hazards identification to address different requirements in each zone of construction sites. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach was capable of identifying the hazards of improper use of PPE with high precision (94.47%) and recall rate (83.20%) while ensuring real-time performance (15.62 FPS on average).

The developed system can monitor workers' heat strain level when they have to work under such hostile conditions continuously. Health alert messages with corresponding intervention measures will be prompted to workers to safeguard their wellbeing. Heat strain is evaluated by a subjective index perception rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and an objective heat strain indicator heart rate. A database containing 550 sets of synchronized work-related, environmental, and personal data were used to construct the prediction model. Artificial neural networks were applied to forecast the RPE of construction workers. Statistical measures including MAPE, RMSE and R-2 confirm that the established model is good fitting with high accuracy. The proposed system could be automated by integrating smart sensor technology, location tracking technology, and information communication technology, which could be in the form of GSM based environmental sensor, smart bracelet, and smart phone application, to protect the wellbeing for those who have to work in hot and humid conditions.

Proximity Prediction of Mobile Objects to Prevent Contact-Driven Accidents in Co-Robotic Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Autonomous robot; Contact-driven accident; Proximity prediction; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Deep neural network	HAZARD AVOIDANCE; MODEL; SYSTEM; RADAR	Robotic solutions have garnered increased attention from the construction industry as an effective means of improving construction safety and productivity. However, in deploying such robots to real fields many safety concerns have remained untackled, particularly contact-driven accidents that can be potentially escalated by mobile robots. To address this issue, the authors developed a fully automated framework that enables predicting the proximity between mobile objects, leveraging a camera-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), computer vision, and deep neural networks, and then conducted a field test to evaluate its validity. In the test, the framework showed a promising result: It achieved an average proximity error of 0.95 m in predicting 5.28 s future proximity between a worker and a truck. The major contribution of this study is in predicting the risk of impending collision in advance, thereby making proactive interventions possible. Computationally, the predictive functionality based on computer vision and deep neural network including convolutional neural network and generative adversarial network would allow robots to examine alternative multiple paths beforehand and enable providing advance alerts to workers. These proactive interventions would effectively reduce the chances of impending collisions between mobile robots and construction workers.

However, from a worker's perspective, system form is still very harsh to handle because of its heavy weight, noise generation, and use of releasing agent, and it also attenuates the productivity of system formwork. Therefore, this study proposes the use of an advanced composite material-based concrete form for workers using a Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) process to improve constructability of system formwork. User requirements are systematically reflected in the technical characteristics of concrete form, and innovative principles are scientifically organized through the DFSS process that mainly consists of quality function deployment and theory of creative problem-solving methods. The proposed composite form showed improved performance in deriving high-quality formwork and worker-friendly working conditions compared with previous system forms. Additionally, this study demonstrated how the DFSS will be a valuable tool for technology development and systematic decision-making in building construction.

Person posture recognition (PPR) is essential in postural ergonomic hazard assessment. This paper proposed an ergonomic posture recognition method using 3D view-invariant features from a single 2D camera that is non-intrusive and widely installed on construction sites. Based on the detected 2D skeletons, view-invariant relative 3D joint position (R3DJP) and joint angle are extracted as classification features by employing a multi-stage convolutional nerual network (CNN) architecture, so that the learned classifier is not sensitive to camera viewpoints. Three posture classifiers regarding arms, back, and legs are trained, so that they can be simultaneously classified in one video frame. The posture recognition accuracies of three body parts are 98.6%, 99.5%, 99.8%, respectively. For generalization ability, the relevant accuracies are 94.9%, 93.9%, 94.6%, respectively. Both the classification accuracy and generalization ability of the method outperform previous vision-based methods in construction. The proposed method enables reliable and accurate postural ergonomic assessment for improving construction workers' safety and healthy.

Overall, the consequence of this approach is suboptimal performance. To address this problem, this paper presents an innovative multiobjective model that enables managers to optimize the relationship between these interdependent corporate priorities. The proposed model was implemented and solved using mixed-integer nonlinear programming on a case study involving the allocation of tasks to employees with different skill levels in a multidisciplinary engineering consulting company. While leading to a small loss of productivity, the results show a significant improvement in the career development of workers compared to conventional productivity-oriented workforce planning models, with on average 8.6% improvement in employees' closeness to their ideal skill set. Furthermore, the model produced Pareto-optimal points and a Pareto curve that enabled client-model users to select optimum job allocation based on their preferences. This research represents a paradigm shift toward a new class of socially responsible workforce planning models in which the objectives of both employees and employers are optimized.

During HMA construction, a massive amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is emitted from the hot asphalt mixtures, creating a potential health risk to on-site workers. Few studies have quantitatively investigated the constituents and potential health effects of the VOCs generated in HMA pavement construction. This paper presents the results of a study in which air samples were collected at multiple locations and time points of several projects during HMA pavement construction and were subsequently characterized for their chemical compositions and concentrations by using gas chromatography/mass selective detector (GC/MSD). The analysis results are compared with occupational exposure limits mandated or recommended by various agencies. Although the individual concentrations of the identified chemicals were found to be below various exposure limits, their collective effect on human health remains unknown and may not be ignored. This paper contributes to the knowledge of the types and concentrations of VOCs generated in asphalt pavement construction, their potential health risks to workers, and possible mitigation measures.

Direction for Generating Interest for Design for Construction Worker Safety-A Delphi Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accident prevention; Construction industry; Delphi method; Design; Occupational safety; Owners; Prevention through design; Safety; Project planning and design	PREVENTION; TOOL; PTD	Decisions made prior to construction impact the safety of construction workers. Past research has shown that there is a link between design decisions and fatalities. Prevention through Design (PtD) is a concept that attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process with the goal of eliminating the risks of injury to workers and/or damage to facilities during construction. PtD is a required practice in some countries, primarily because of legislation. In the United States, however, PtD is not well known by design professionals and there is opposition to its practice. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a Delphi study, in which the Delphi panel was tasked to identify: (1)the construction industry group with the most influence to generate interest in PtD in the United States, (2)the method with which that interest can be achieved, and (3)the industry group that should be targeted with that method. The Delphi panel came to a consensus that owners have the greatest influence to generate interest, and they should be the group to be targeted using the business case method.

A conceptual framework for minimizing construction site accidents using Task-Personnel Nexus Matrix	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction; safety; Kohonen network; artificial neural network	IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM	Majority of the construction site accidents are due to the influence of human factors such as negligence, lack of awareness and lack of training. This work proposes a conceptual framework for minimizing construction site accidents using Task-Personnel Nexus Matrix (TPM) which selects the right worker for a particular task. Each construction site task is evaluated for its risk and the probability of human error associated with the task using Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) techniques respectively from which a combined metric of Risk cum Human Error (RHE) is proposed to be evaluated. Kohonen algorithm is proposed to classify the workers database into two or more clusters, each of which is trained using the Back Propagation Neural Network (BNN) to predict the performance of the worker knowing his basic characteristic. The high performer is proposed to be assigned to higher risk tasks which correspond to a higher value of RHE. It is seen that the proposed method is highly promising in reducing the construction site accidents and is easy to implement by predicting, evaluating and assigning the right person for a right job in the construction site.

It was trained to identify the slip and trip events that occur while a worker walks in a workplace. It encourages preventive and collective actions to reduce construction accidents by identifying the type of near miss, i.e.,slip or trip, and the exact time that it occurs. The variation in the energy released by a worker is measured using a triaxial accelerometer embedded in a smart phone. This study is of value to researchers because the method measures a near miss quantitatively using acceleration. It is also of relevance to practitioners because it provides a computerized tool that records each and every moment of a near-miss event. A test was performed by collecting the three-axis acceleration streams generated by workers wearing a smart phone running the classifier as they walked around a simulated construction jobsite. It identified the type of near miss and the exact time of its occurrence. The test case verified the usability and validity of the computational methods. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Kanan, R; Elhassan, O; Bensalem, R				Kanan, Raid; Elhassan, Obaidallah; Bensalem, Rofaida			An IoT-based autonomous system for workers' safety in construction sites with real-time alarming, monitoring, and positioning strategies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Directional antenna; Internet of Things (IoT); Low power; RF wake-up sensor; Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); Photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting; Zone differentiation	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; EQUIPMENT	Civil construction sites are considered as one of the riskiest environments where many potential hazards may occur. To protect construction workers and prevent accidents in such sites, this paper proposes a novel design for an autonomous system that monitors, localizes, and warns site laborers who avail within danger zones. The proposed system is user-friendly, and its architecture is based on Internet of Things (IoT). The heterogeneous components of this architecture are seamlessly integrated into a middleware backend online server. To accurately detect and identify construction workers, the proposed system employs three combined techniques. They are 1) the 868 MHz radio frequency, 2) directional antennas, and 3) the 40 kHz ultrasound waves. Vehicle's rear is secured by a sensing unit that ensures good coverage along with a wearable device for workers. The design of the wearable device includes a set of components which are a radio transceiver (transmitter/receiver), a wake-up sensor, an alarm actuator, and a GPRS module. The wearable device has a power saving scheme with a current consumption as low as 0.5 mu A at 3 V supply; thanks to our RF wake-up sensor. Via proximity, this wearable device becomes hybrid (active/passive) in which it remains in deep sleep mode until the presence of a radio frequency (RF) field. Consequently, the rechargeable battery's life gets increased by up to 2 days of autonomy before recharging. Furthermore, the paper presents an implementation of wireless nodes that are powered by light energy using photovoltaic cells. These nodes adopt energy management and storage schemes for continuous operation for indoor and outdoor environments.

Using structural holes and strength-of-tie theory, we develop a theoretical framework and a valid and reliable survey instrument. Second, we apply network and structural holes measures for understanding its association with performance. Empirical results suggest that degree centrality in a knowledge workers' professional network positively influences performance use, whereas a highly constrained professional network is detrimental to performance. The findings show that social network structure and position are important factors to consider for individual performance.

Two different risk perception groups were singled out. There was an attempt to identify, after analyzing each cluster, their relation with different sociodemographic variables. Only the worker training variable showed a statistically significant relation with the two cluster analysis groups. As a result, the perception of risk of the best-trained group was higher than that of the less-trained group.

Stock-Flow Model for Forecasting Labor Supply	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forecasting; Labor supply; Stock-flow model; Hong Kong	MANPOWER-PLANNING MODELS; DEMAND	Forecasting the supply of labor in the construction industry is pivotal to long-term economic growth. A labor supply model using a stock-flow approach was developed in this research for use in the construction industry. The model was tested using Hong Kong census statistics and data derived from interviews with 3,000 randomly selected construction workers. The findings were determined using a stock-flow model, which enabled the determination of future aging distribution trends and workforce supply for specific trade types. The developed stock-flow model can be effectively used in countries in which registration schemes for construction workers are in use. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000485.

Impact of Green Building Design and Construction on Worker Safety and Health	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Sustainable, or "green," rating systems, such as the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), are leading to changes in the way owners, designers, and contractors approach the design, construction, and operation of buildings. The processes and features included in green design and construction may have positive and/or negative impacts on construction worker safety and health. This paper presents the findings of a research study of the impact of green building design and construction practices on construction worker safety and health. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable and lost time injury and illness data from green projects (as identified by LEED) and from nongreen projects was collected through a structured questionnaire survey. The data collected was analyzed to test for the presence of a difference in OSHA recordable incident rates (RIRs) and lost time case rates (LTCRs) between green and nongreen projects. It was found that there was suggestive, but inconclusive evidence of a statistically significant difference in the RIRs of the green and nongreen building projects included in the study. No statistically significant difference was found between the LTCRs for the green and nongreen projects included in the study. The study findings provide valuable information to the construction industry for the purposes of project safety planning and the assessment of safety and health on projects.

As loss of balance has a fundamental effect on falling, it is important to understand postural regulation behavior during construction tasks at heights, especially those that require precise focus in an upright standing position (therefore, a dual-task demand on focus). Previous studies examined body sway during a quiet stance and dual tasks to understand latent factors affecting postural balance. Despite the success of these studies in discovering underlying factors, they lack a comprehensive analysis of a task's simultaneous cognitive load, postural sway, and visual depth. To address this limitation, this paper aims to examine construction workers' postural stability and task performance during the execution of visual construction tasks while standing upright on elevated platforms. To that end, two non-intrusive neurophysiological tests, a hand-steadiness task (HST) and a pursuit task (PT), were developed for construction tasks in a virtual environment (VE) as performance-based means to assess the cognitive function of workers at height. Workers' postural stability was measured by recording the mapped position of the Center of Pressure (COP) of the body on a posturography force plate, and the postural sway metrics subsequently calculated. A laboratory experiment was designed to collect postural and task performance data from 18 subjects performing the two batteries of tests in the virtual environment. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in the Root-Mean Square (RMS) of COP along the anterior-posterior axis during the Randomized Pursuit Task (RPT) and maximum body sway of the center of pressure (COP) in the mediolateral direction during both tests. Also, subjects exposed to high elevation predominately exhibit higher accuracy for RPT (P-value = 0.02) and lower accuracy for HST (P-value = 0.05). The results show that the combination of elevation-related visual depth and low-complexity dual tasks impairs task performance due to the elevation-induced visual perturbations and anxiety-driven motor responses. On the other hand, in the absence of visual depth at height, high task complexity surprisingly improves the pursuit tracking performance. As expected, during both tasks, alterations in postural control were manifested in the form of a body sway decrement as a compensatory postural strategy for accomplishing tasks at high elevation.

However, it has not been well recognized that variations in safety performance could exist in the same contractor's regional offices. There is also a lack of understanding of the differences between regions and what causes these variations. This paper analyzes the safety performance of a general contractor's six major regional branches across four states after implementation of a new safety management program. The research finds apparent differences in regional incident rates (IRs) and safety violation rates (SVRs), although the shared perceptions from workers and site management personnel about how the safety program is implemented (i.e., safety climate and culture) are generally consistent companywide. This research also discloses that regional IRs, SVRs, safety climate, and culture are uncorrelated in the long term (during the 17-month study period), but have some linear relationships over a short duration (during the 4-month survey period). The correlation analysis in this study does not find a significant influence of workers' demographic characteristics and a few other potential influencing factors on regional safety performance. These findings will provide useful insights to industry practitioners who aim to achieve good, consistent safety management and performance across regions.

Training, motivation, and performance: The case of human resource management in construction projects in Mashhad, Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human resource management; Construction; Performance; Earthquake; Mashhad; Iran		An enterprise's productivity is closely correlated with its people and strategies; therefore, a forceful human resource management system is the most valuable asset of the current century construction companies. Purpose/design/methodology/approach: Based on a combination of literature review and questionnaire surveys, this paper explores the execution of construction workers training and motivation methods in HRM practices by the survey respondents' companies and the effects on the companies' performances. The research was conducted by sending 120 sets of questionnaires to the nominated companies and firms in Mashhad, Iran. A quantitative research approach was adopted requiring the development and dissemination of a questionnaire survey. The analysis method in this research is mainly descriptive and the type of investigation is co-relational study. Findings: The research exposes some barriers in the training and motivation of the construction workers and provides solutions for the government and companies in Iran. Also, it reveals the effects of unskilled labour on the quality of construction projects in Mashhad. Research limitations/implications: Future research should be under taken to address how companies and governments adapt to and shape the environmental and organizational settings in such a way that the context optimally stimulates workers motivation and participation in training courses and effects on increasing the quality of construction.

J	Lee, W; Migliaccio, GC				Lee, Wonil; Migliaccio, Giovanni C.			Temporal Effect of Construction Workforce Physical Strain on Diminishing Marginal Productivity at the Task Level	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction productivity; Labor and personal issue; Diminishing marginal productivity; Work physiology; Physical strain	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT; SHIFT WORK; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; TAYLORISM; BURNOUT; DESIGN; IMPACT; SAFETY	Physiological status and environmental stressors are known to influence workforce performance at the individual worker level. A previous study, which conducted a cross-sectional comparison in repetitive material-handling construction activities, suggested that a U-shaped relationship existed between physical strain and productivity at the group level. This research revisits those findings to further investigate the U-curve relationship between physical strain and productivity at the group level and validate the concept of diminishing marginal productivity. Heart rates were measured as an indicator of subjects' physical strain, whereas task productivity was estimated by work sampling. Eighty person-hour data were converted into panel data sets by dividing each subject's 4-h experimental data into 5-min intervals. These data sets were subsequently used to evaluate the effects of time on physical strain and productivity with 5-min lags. The study found a U-curve relationship between physical strain and task-level productivity at the group level while controlling for individual characteristics. The U-shape relationship was constant in the low-performance and high-performance groups, although the degrees of the polynomials differed. Productive workers will remain more productive than low-productive workers with increased physical strain.

However, in a typical labor-intensive industry such as construction, the workers themselves can provide a wealth of information for hazard identification. Historical accident-free working locations on site provide a valuable means of recognizing safe workplaces. This paper presents an approach to the automated classification of construction site zones derived from the location tracks of workers collected from a real-time location system (RTLS). Through data mining, filtering and analysis, the location tracks are transformed into grid density maps and continuous density maps. These illustrate the characteristics of spatial-temporal activities onsite as well as providing a visual representation of the distribution of safe and hazardous individual workplaces. A personnel hazard map is generated automatically based on historical accident-free location tracks from a field project using the proposed approach. Compared with the actual workplaces in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity, the evaluation result reveals that the hazardous areas on a construction site can be automatically classified to improve the workplace management of individual workers. The contributions of this research include an automated zone classification algorithm and an evaluation framework consisting of four indicators for hazard awareness onsite.

Weekly data capturing the number of hours worked, satisfaction with work-life balance and capacity to complete required tasks at work and at home were collected for 25 consecutive weeks. Data was subjected to time series modeling procedures and weekly work hours were found to significantly predict participants' overall satisfaction with work-life balance, and capacity to complete tasks at work and at home. The occurrence of 'long weekends', i.e., a period of three days away from work arising as a result of a public holiday coinciding with a 'rostered day off', was also found to predict workers' capacity to complete tasks at home. An evaluation workshop explored workers' experiences of a work-life intervention. Participants' were generally positive about the organization's support of their work life balance, however areas for improvement were identified, such as the need for better communication of work-life strategies and to address the 'long hours' culture within the organization. The research presents a participatory framework for improving the work-life balance of project-based construction workers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Productivity-Safety Model: Debunking the Myth of the Productivity-Safety Divide through a Mixed-Reality Residential Roofing Task	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; RISK BEHAVIOR; CONSTRUCTION; STRESS; FALLS; METAANALYSIS; BALANCE	Distractions theory and general practice have suggested that providing safe physical conditions will reduce task demands and thereby increase workers' ability to develop highly productive and safe production systems. However, the construction industry has not achieved greater productivity and safety gains despite extensive safety efforts. This study aimed to examine whether the reduced task-demands as a result of safer conditions actually causes fall risks to be underestimated, encourages increased productivity, and changes risk-taking behaviors. To do so, the changes in study participants' productivity, risk perception (through physiological and subjective measures), risk-taking behavior (through tracking subject's motion, and localizing their positions and postures), and safety performance (through frequency of near misses) were examined when they were provided with various levels of safety interventions. The findings indicated that the reduced perceived risk and the desire for increased productivity may skew risk analysis and strongly bias workers toward presuming invulnerability when safety interventions are in place. Known as risk compensation cognitive bias, this change in human behavior counteracts the traditional outcomes explained by Hinze's distractions theory. The empirical evidence from a simulated roofing task helped substantiate the proposed productivity-safety model, which illustrates how safety interventions might become counterproductive because of the risk-compensation bias experienced by workers.

J	Zhao, D; Mccoy, A; Kleiner, B; Feng, YB				Zhao, Dong; Mccoy, Andrew; Kleiner, Brian; Feng, Yingbin			INTEGRATING SAFETY CULTURE INTO OSH RISK MITIGATION: A PILOT STUDY ON THE ELECTRICAL SAFETY	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						occupational safety and health; electrical safety; construction; virtual reality; risk management	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; HUMAN ERROR; INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT	Efforts have been taken for years to minimize the occupational safety and health (OSH) risk, but the injury records remain a constant reason for worldwide concerns. Many firms often implement technology as an administrative hierarchy of control (HOC). However, technologies may also actively influence safe practices at the managerial level for administrative HOC. This research examines electrical safety hazards in the U.S. construction industry as a basis for, studying the feasibility of using technology to integrate safety culture into the administrative level of OSH risk mitigation. The researchers introduce the concept of "habitus", which suggests one possibility for establishing a safety culture that increases workers' safety performance and integrates into workers' safety practices through cutting-edge information technology. A prototype application for OSH training based on mobile virtual reality (MVR) technology is demonstrated to help establish habitus in workers' daily practices, and ultimately to mitigate OSH risks at the administrative level of construction projects. Results from a preliminary validation test strongly support human behavior influence and safe work knowledge comprehension by the prototyped application. Although this prototype is demonstrated as a pilot study of electrical safety, the application is not limited to this area and is scalable to other OSH risks.

The barriers to the development of green buildings, such as the high cost and project delay, further indicate that the productivity of green building construction needs to be tackled. This study aims to identify the critical factors affecting the productivity of green building construction projects by assessing the likelihood, impact, and criticality of the factors with comparisons against traditional projects. To achieve the objective, 26 factors were identified from a comprehensive literature review and interviews with industry experts. A questionnaire survey was then performed with 32 professionals experienced in green building projects, and three postsurvey interviews were also conducted. The results indicated that workers' experience, technology, design changes, workers' skill level, and planning and sequencing of work were the top five most critical factors affecting the productivity of green building construction projects. Furthermore, the differences in the criticality of the technical factors between green and traditional projects were remarkable, which should draw the practitioners' attention. The findings from this study not only fill a gap in the project management body of knowledge for green buildings but also help practitioners identify specific adjustments to traditional project management processes and practices achieving a more productive delivery of green buildings.

However, workers still seek work environments that stimulate networking and collaboration possibilities. This has led to the growing popularity of co-working spaces. However, little is known about the specific preferences of co-working space users. The aim of this research is to analyse user preferences for co-working space characteristics. Stated choice data were collected by means of a questionnaire which was completed by 219 respondents of 25 co-working spaces in the Netherlands. A mixed-multinomial logit model was used to analyse the user preferences. Results show that the main motivations for co-workers to work in a co-working space were that they were looking for a workplace outside their home that allows them to work in an inspiring work environment where the accommodation is affordable. Accessibility and atmosphere/interior are the most important characteristics when choosing a specific co-working space. These results provide owners or managers of co-working spaces with clear insights about how to cope with co-worker preferences by offering co-working spaces with good accessibility by car and public transport, a semi-open layout and a homelike interior.

In the construction sector, however-a sector that accounts for 6% of the employment and 20% of the occupational fatalities in the United States-current theories and practices of accident prevention ignore the important role of team processes. This study investigates the team processes that influence construction workers' safety, and discusses the challenges in developing effective teamwork in construction crews. The paper first summarizes the literature on team performance with a focus on construction work groups. The review identifies the key cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of teamwork affecting workers, safety. These teamwork components provide the criteria for evaluating the attributes of construction operations and context that create challenges to effective teamwork at the production level. This discussion also reviews practices that construction supervisors use to improve teamwork. Research directions are identified for systematic evaluation and improvement of teamwork processes in construction crews. The identification of key teamwork constructs provides practitioners with a framework that can guide efforts to improve teamwork at the crew level. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000527.

This paper demonstrates how a quasi-longitudinal study can provide insight into safety performance. A comparison is made between two cross-sectional studies: 911 questionnaires collected from construction workers between 2004 and 2006, and 802 collected between 2014 and 2015 in Ontario, Canada. The data comprised demographic factors, 13 safety climate factors, and three safety outcome categories. Rates of injury, stress, and safety events reduced overall since 2004, although the change was significant only for events. Findings show improved consistency in safety awareness among participants independent of employers, suggesting that regionwide safety programs have been effective. Safety climate factors accounted for 15-20% of the variance in safety outcomes, down from 2004. Interpersonal conflict at work is strongly related to all safety outcome types. Participants with 11-15years of experience reported the highest safety incident rates in all categories, a trend that was not observed 10years earlier. Safety managers may consider broadening their safety programs, which often target new workers, to ensure that all workers are reminded of safe work practices.

A characterization has been carried out on the perception of Guatemalan construction company managers regarding, the risk of accidents exist for the different activities they perform. The characterization has been carried out on a representative sample of the business population via a questionnaire. A preliminary data analysis was performed followed by a Descriptive and a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Companies are characterized as "medium-size" companies, with an average of 81.1 construction workers per year and average annual turnover of 1.29 million euros. 4 clusters of construction activities occur with similar accident weightings. Companies in Cluster 1 are associated to the variables grouped with a Low risk weighting, with a medium to high number of on-site workers and with a turnover of more than 100,000 euros. In contrast, those in Cluster 2 are associated with the variables grouped as having a Medium risk weighting, with a low number of on-site workers and a turnover of less than 100,000 euros. The companies in Cluster 3 are only associated with High risk weighted. And those of Cluster 4 with Not applicable risk-weighting variables.

High-rise building constructions are characterized by a small number of hoisting equipment and a large amount of construction resources to be hoisted. Accordingly, a sky lobby system has been applied in high-rise building construction sites to increase the performance of lift systems. However, the performance of sky lobby systems can be significantly changed according to the configuration factors, such as the number of shuttle and local lift cars and the sky lobby floor location. Nevertheless, previous studies did not yet focus on the relationship between these factors and the performance of sky lobby systems. Therefore, we examined herein that relationship by using a discrete event simulation method. Through the simulation experiment, we found that the configuration parameters could have a significant influence on the system performance. The configuration parameters showed non-linear and complex patterns in the lifting performance, thereby making it difficult to find an effective configuration method to increase the performance of lift systems and even deteriorating the performance of lift systems in the commonly used range of configuration parameters. Therefore, the configuration parameters of the sky lobby system should be more carefully planned with quantitative methods before being applied to high-rise building constructions.

Development and Testing of a Personalized Hazard-Recognition Training Intervention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety training; Safety management; Hazard identification; Hazard recognition; Training methods; Personalized training; Safety intervention; Labor and personnel issues	EYE-TRACKING; SAFETY; HEALTH; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; PERCEPTIONS; VALIDATION; STRATEGIES; WORKERS; DESIGN	Unrecognized or unmanaged hazards can expose workers to unanticipated safety risk and can potentially result in catastrophic safety incidents. Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that a large proportion of safety hazards remain unrecognized in construction workplaces. To improve hazard-recognition levels, employers adopt a variety of safety and hazard-recognition training programs. However, desirable levels of hazard recognition have not been achieved, and the expected benefits from training have not been attained. Such failure in training efforts have generally been attributed to the adoption of poor and ineffective training practices. While efforts are being undertaken to address these issues, construction research has not focused on developing or evaluating personalized training solutions that are customized to the learning needs of individual workers. To advance theory and practice, the objective of this study was to develop the first personalized training strategy targeted at improving hazard-recognition levels. The objective was accomplished by a collaborative effort involving two industry experts and three academic researchers, along with guidance from training literature. The training strategy incorporates important elements known to improve stimuli or threat detection in domains including medicine, the military, and aviation. The elements include (1)visual cues to aid systematic hazard search, (2)personalized hazard-recognition performance feedback, (3)personalized eye-tracking visual attention feedback, and (4)metacognitive prompts that trigger the adoption of remedial measures. After development, the effectiveness of the training strategy in improving hazard recognition was empirically evaluated using the nonconcurrent multiple-baseline testing approach. The findings of the study showed that the participating workers on average were able to identify only 42% of hazards prior to the introduction of the intervention; but were able to recognize 77% of hazards in the intervention phase. The findings of this study will be of interest to practicing professionals seeking to improve hazard-recognition levels within construction. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To eliminate these deficiencies, an automated system using radio frequency identification technology combined with GPS technology, requiring minimal worker input, is proposed. The requirements and approaches needed to utilize the system for locating precast concrete components with minimal worker input in the storage yard of a manufacturing plant were developed. Based on the requirements identified and approaches formalized, a prototype system was developed, assembled and tested in the field at a precast storage yard. The prototype system succeeded in automatically identifying pieces that were relocated, demonstrating feasibility of the approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Immigration and Construction: The Makeup of the Workforce in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION	There are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States. Of this population, research shows that approximately 19% work in the construction industry, comprising around 14% of all construction workforces. The Washington, D.C. metropolitan region has a unique makeup of workforces within the construction industry. Between September 2006 and February 2007, 896 construction workers from several projects in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area participated in a survey. The study targeted the low-skilled, immigrant-saturated trades in construction. The most compelling finding in this study was that illegal immigrants make up a far greater proportion of the construction workers in low-skilled trades than indicated by national averages, 55% as compared to between 20 and 36% nationally. This will increase the impact of immigration and immigration reform substantially for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan.

Whereas many factors may contribute to this statistic, one likely cause is due to designers who often lack design for construction safety knowledge, which results in many safety hazards being built into project designs. Therefore, there is a compelling need for tools that can put the safety-in-design concept into practice. To improve the current situation, a prevention through design (PTD) tool based on computer software was developed. Construction safety best practices were compiled into computable rules so that the PTD tool can automatically conduct compliance checking. Particular emphasis was placed on fall accidents since falls are the most frequently occurring cause of fatalities on construction sites. This tool efficiently makes PTD suggestions available to designers and constructors. With this PTD tool, it is possible for project participants to work together to optimize building designs for construction worker safety, which provides valuable downstream benefits. By using the results of the safety check by this PTD tool, constructors have the opportunity to plan for preliminary safety measures to address construction site hazards from the beginning of the project. Preplanning facilitates reduction of potential hazards on construction sites by allowing for consideration of construction worker safety during the design and preconstruction phases of a project.

Therefore, an understanding of factors that influence the development of hazard recognition skill among workers is fundamental to effective safety management. Based on social learning theory which suggests that individuals learn efficiently by observing, interacting, and emulating others in workplaces, the current article reports findings from a larger study that examined the effect of safety climate and social-network safety communication patterns on the hazard recognition skill demonstrated by workers. More specifically, building upon previously reported findings presented in Pandit et al. which suggests that maintaining a more positive safety climate can lead to superior hazard recognition levels, the current article presents additional results examining the effect of safety climate and social-network safety communication patterns-maintained by workers-on the demonstrated hazard recognition skill. The study involved recruiting construction crews from 57 projects in the United States where safety climate and social-network safety communication data were gathered using questionnaire surveys-which was then followed by a hazard recognition activity. The results suggest that, apart from the safety climate, social-network safety communication patterns are positively related to the demonstrated hazard recognition skill. In addition, evidence of an interaction effect was found-suggesting that establishing a positive safety climate and maintaining higher levels of safety communication can yield synergistic benefits.

The results showed that, although many facility managers recognized the advantages of applying universal design, most organizations currently provided accessible workplaces merely within the scope of legal requirements, while few organizations achieved consistency between corporate mission and strategies, knowledge of facility managers, and the degree of workplace accessibility practices. US organizations and Japanese organizations showed different perceptions of the issue in terms of advantages of universal design based on differences in management style. The findings also suggest that an understanding of the issues by top management is key to promoting universal design practice. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research seeks to enhance the usual manual workspace planning process by simulating a construction activity using both immersive Virtual Reality and Building Information Modeling technologies. Workspace planning is improved by eliciting experienced workers' knowledge and integrating it with construction managers' knowledge. The workers' knowledge is elicited both directly, by asking them for feedback during the activity simulation, and indirectly, by collecting and analysing position tracking data. The application of this approach in a real case study demonstrates its beneficial impact in terms of the sharing of planning and safety-related information between project partners and its formal representation in a Health and Safety Plan.

This continuing injury trend requires further understanding of the causes of safety issues as well as what magnifies safety risk. This study aims to investigate the extent of the impact of different factors on worker safety risk. The factors, namely human, site conditions, psychological, environmental, social, economic, regulatory, ergonomic, and organizational, were developed as part of recently formulated degrees of connectivity (DoC) model scenarios utilizing the risk perception of different specialists. The risk perceptions associated with the factors as provided by construction safety university professors and practicing safety engineers are explored for comparison. The Delphi method was adopted to collect the required data from both mentioned groups. The results show that the participants perceive that site condition factors create the highest impact whereas the worker economic factor adds the lowest impact. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of risk perception, nor was there a clear impact of participant experience on the risk perception process and the factors under investigation. Safety planners can benefit from the study results by considering the level of impact that the factors have on worker safety. Moreover, when addressing safety on a project, both professors and engineers can contribute equally. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Analysis of Observed Skill Affinity Patterns and Motivation for Multiskilling among Craft Workers in the US Industrial Construction Sector	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Previous research has shown that multiskilling strategies can increase productivity, quality, and continuity of work and can also help mitigate craft shortages through better utilization of the existing workforce. Using extensive craft certification and skills data, the writers apply correlation and cluster analyses to identify actual patterns of multiskilling among craft workers using two separate data sources. The results of the cluster analysis indicate that current craft skills aggregate into four groups: civil, mechanical, electrical, and general support. It is also observed that acquiring mutually supporting skill set pairs significantly drives multiskilling strategies in practice, thus diminishing the relative impact that duration on project has on driving multiskilling practice, despite its importance in previous literature. Still, comparing the observed multiskilling patterns obtained from the skill affinity analyses with multiskilling strategies proposed by previous studies generally reinforces the potential efficacy of those strategies.

Such approaches have been reliant on the computation of artificially complex image features that utilize a cumbersome parameter re-adjustment process. The creation of image features that can recognize unsafe actions, however, poses a significant research challenge on construction sites. This due to the prevailing complexity of spatio-temporal features, lighting, and the array of viewpoints that are required to identify an unsafe action. Considering these challenges, a new hybrid deep learning model that integrates a convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) that automatically recognizes workers' unsafe actions is developed. The proposed hybrid deep learning model is used to: (1) identify unsafe actions; (2) collect motion data and site videos; (3) extract the visual features from videos using a CNN model; and (4) sequence the learning features that are enabled by the use of LSTM models. An experiment is used to test the model's ability to detect unsafe actions. The results reveal that the developed hybrid model (CNN + LSTM) is able to accurately detect safe/unsafe actions conducted by workers on-site. The model's accuracy exceeds the current state-of-the-art descriptor-based methods for detecting points of interest on images.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to examine the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of one such knowledge worker group-the Engineering Design Teams (EDT) at Bell Canada, the largest telecommunications carrier in Canada. Two functional models of the EDT's were developed and analyzed using input oriented constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) DEA models. First left free, the multipliers were then constrained using DEA Assurance Region models based on economic prices and managerial preferences. This study offers an excellent example where inefficient decision making units (DXW)-i.e., EDTs could be made more efficient by improving their scale efficiency simply by reassigning work amongst the units. Bell divides its EDTs along provincial boundaries into Ontario and Quebec teams and each EDT is responsible for a specific geographic area in the province assigned to it. The results of the DEA analysis indicated that redrawing the geographical boundaries of the market area served by the EDTs could move both increasing and decreasing returns to scale EDTs toward CRS behavior. Substantial performance improvements are possible over the entire system, resulting in significant savings in costs without people dislocation or branch closings.

J	Cai, JN; Cai, HB				Cai, Jiannan; Cai, Hubo			Robust Hybrid Approach of Vision-Based Tracking and Radio-Based Identification and Localization for 3D Tracking of Multiple Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ONSITE WORKERS; EQUIPMENT; TIME; RESOURCES; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Information of construction entity identity and real-time location reveals where specific construction resources are at any given time and thus is a critical prerequisite to the context-aware jobsite safety management. Most existing studies use either a vision-based or radio-based approach to automatically track construction entities, which, however, are bounded by the limitations of the applied technology. Vision-based tracking can achieve high localization accuracy but suffers from identity (ID) switch and fragmentation errors when multiple workers are in close proximity or occluded. In contrast, radio-based tracking is reliable in object detection and identification but less accurate in localization. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses results obtained from vision-based tracking and radio-based identification and localization for the 3D tracking of multiple construction workers. Compared to traditional fusion approaches that directly fuse locations extracted from these two approaches, the proposed method treats vision-based tracking as the main source to extract the object trajectory. Radio-based identification and localization results are used as a supplementary source to augment anonymous visual tracks with identity information and correct errors (e.g., false positives) in vision-based object detection, resulting in ID-linked 3D trajectories. In addition, a searching algorithm is introduced to recover possible missed detections in one camera view from the corresponding observations in the other view by applying a sliding window to search for regions with the most similar appearance along epipolar line. The newly created method has been validated using two indoor experiments. The results show that the new approach for fusing vision- and radio-based results increases the overall accuracy from 88% and 87% to 95% and 90%, compared to using a vision-based approach alone. The integration of radio-based identification is much more robust than using a vision system alone, as it allows the recovery of the same entity ID after the trajectory is fragmented and results in fewer fragmentations that last longer than 0.2 s.

J	Zuluaga, CM; Albert, A; Winkel, MA				Zuluaga, Carlos M.; Albert, Alex; Winkel, Munir A.			Improving Safety, Efficiency, and Productivity: Evaluation of Fall Protection Systems for Bridge Work Using Wearable Technology and Utility Analysis	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fall protection; Construction safety; Wearable technology; Productivity; Efficiency	CONSTRUCTION; FATIGUE; CONSEQUENCES; DEVICES	The construction industry is experiencing a number of challenges. For example, construction workplaces report poor safety performance, widespread inefficiencies, and stagnant productivity rates. These challenges often translate into higher-order issues including cost overruns, schedule growths, and project failure. Accordingly, much of construction research has focused on identifying best practices to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity. However, the majority of these efforts focus on resolving one of these challenges (e.g., safety) rather than holistically addressing safety, efficiency, and productivity in unison. Unfortunately, such an approach can yield unintended consequences in certain circumstances. For example, a narrow focus on productivity may adversely affect safety performance, and vice versa. One nationwide safety issue that has received much recent attention is the protection of highway and bridge workers from falls to lower levels when working on bridge decks. In these circumstances, highway and bridge workers largely rely on existing bridge guardrails for their protection against falls. However, most bridge guardrails do not offer a barrier height of 107 +/- 8 cm (42 +/- 3 in.) for sufficient protection as per regulatory requirements. To protect these workers, a few transportation agencies are beginning to adopt passive fall protection systems that can be attached to the guardrails to temporarily increase the barrier height. The purpose of the current research was to support these efforts by evaluating four fall protection systems that are actively being considered for adoption based on the expected safety, efficiency, and productivity benefits they offer. The study objectives were accomplished through 96 field trials where physiological responses, postural demands, activity rates, and the associated utility were gathered from participating workers using wearable technology and a questionnaire survey. The research effort identified fall protection systems that offer the most advantages in terms of safety, efficiency, and productivity.

Although fresh concrete can be consolidated properly via vibration, the consolidation quality heavily relies on construction workers' experience. Inexperienced workers tend to under-consolidate or over-consolidate concrete, resulting in indiscoverable and irreparable defects. It is necessary to establish a system that can track the real-time vibration activity and feedback vibration defects to the inspector and worker. In this paper, a real-time visual monitoring system of the vibration effects is developed and validated to solve the under-vibration issues of fresh concrete. The vibration trajectory is accurately tracked by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The vibration duration is calculated based on the alternation time of vibration status. The data is transmitted and stored in a cloud server by General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The radius of action and effective vibration zone are determined by experiments and geometric models. The vibration effects are visualized in three dimensional at the control site. A mobile App is also developed to visualize defects to the inspector such that revibration can be timely conducted. Field experiments demonstrate that the tracking accuracy of the system satisfies the demand of construction applications. Through comparing the defect report of the system to the results of the nondestructive impact-echo method in a construction case study, the reliability of the system is verified.

The objective of the current study was to develop a novel method to detect and classify loss of balance events that could lead to falls on the same level by using foot plantar pressure distributions data captured from wearable insole pressure sensors. Ten healthy volunteers participated in experimental trials, simulating four major loss of balance events (e.g., slip, trip, unexpected step-down, and twisted ankle) to collect foot plantar pressure distributions data. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to learn the unique foot plantar pressure patterns, and then to automatically detect loss of balance events. We compared classification performance by varying window sizes, feature groups and types of classifiers, and the best classification accuracy (97.1%) was achieved when using the Random Forest classifier with all feature groups and a window size of 0.32 s. This study is important to researchers and site managers because it uses foot plantar pressure distribution data to objectively distinguish various potential loss of balance events associated with specific unsafe surface conditions. The proposed approach can allow practitioners to proactively conduct automated fall risk monitoring to minimize the risk of falls on the same level on sites.

Key barriers to increase construction productivity: the Singapore case	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction productivity; barriers; contractors; migrant workers	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY	This study investigated the barriers to achieving high construction productivity in Singapore with the view to providing further input into policy formulation and action to enhance the industry's productivity performance. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which was sent to all the 3032 members of the Singapore Contractors Association and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Statistical t-tests and factor analysis were conducted on the 109 valid responses using the SPSS software. The findings were validated via in-depth interviews with subject matter experts. The top three barriers are "delays in providing information to contractors", "poor skills of workers" and "inadequate pre-project planning and pre-work planning". The sources of these barriers are consultants and contractors, suggesting that these stakeholders should cooperate to improve productivity. The research findings for Singapore construction industry is unique in that most of the labourers on site are migrant workers from overseas. Nonetheless, the findings may be useful to countries that employ labourers mainly from overseas such as those in the Middle East and certain parts of Europe. This study adds to knowledge by identifying the most significant barriers to productivity improvement and providing suggestions to address them. To improve productivity, all participants should change their mind-set, attitudes and behaviours. Clients should support productivity initiatives and be more proactive concerning productivity through tender evaluation criteria, setting productivity targets and paying for productivity premium. Contractors should develop corporate productivity policies, monitor productivity closely and purposefully adopt measures to increase productivity of their projects.

Specifically, the effect of perceived COVID-19 safety risk (PCSR) on SB, the interacting (moderating) effect of firm size (FS) on the relationship between PCSR and SB, and the mechanism through which PCSR leads to SB through the firm's safety climate (SC) were examined for a sample of 312 construction site workers in Nigeria. The partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that PCSR has no significant effect on SB. SC fully mediated the effect of PCSR on SB, while FS moderated the relationship between PCSR and SB, with a stronger effect observed for small firms. It is recommended that a deliberate effort should be made to inculcate a change in the behavior of workers in small firms because of the inverse relationship between PCSR and SB in such firms. This study's findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge by equipping construction project managers and engineers with much-required information to create a good SC aimed at fostering an acceptable level of SB among construction workers in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on construction sites. The study also advances the academic literature on health and safety performance in the construction sector, particularly during pandemics such as COVID-19.

J	Leung, MY; Liang, Q; Olomolaiye, P				Leung, Mei-Yung; Liang, Qi; Olomolaiye, Paul			Impact of Job Stressors and Stress on the Safety Behavior and Accidents of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS; OCCUPATIONAL INJURY; BLUE-COLLAR; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; SUPPORT; STRAIN; MODEL; INSECURITY; MANAGEMENT	Construction workers (CWs) are usually exposed to various job-related hazards while working on construction sites, especially when there is a lack of appropriate equipment, working without support, or being forced to work quickly. All these can induce serious stress and lead to dangerous situations at work. Hence, to prevent CWs from injury, this study sets out to investigate the relationships between job stressors, stress, safety behavior, and accidents. A survey of CWs was carried out using statistical tools to analyze the data. Five job stressors, two different types of stress, and safety behavior among CWs were identified using factor analysis. The results of the correlation and regression analyses showed that (1) physical stress is predicted by job certainty, co-worker support, and safety equipment, while psychological stress is predicted by both supervisor support and job certainty; (2) supervisor support and physical stress predict safety behavior; and (3) the risk of accidents can be reduced by safety behavior, whereas a high level of job control increases it. Finally, several recommendations are made, including on-the-job training, stress-reduction programs, and appropriate employment policies, to enhance safety behavior and decrease the number of accidents on construction sites. This paper provides empirical support to and extends some accident-causation theories, and sets a base for further study regarding stress management for Hong Kong's construction participants working in Mainland China.

A good number of these individuals are also alleged to involve themselves in substance and alcohol abuse due to the physically demanding nature of their work. These could promote the prevalence of violence on construction sites which could in turn affect safety on construction sites. However, there is a lack of empirical insight into the effect of violent behaviour and unsafe behaviour on construction sites. This study therefore pioneers an empirical inquiry into the relationship between violent behaviour and unsafe behaviour on construction sites. Design/methodology/approach Seventeen violent behaviours and 15 unsafe behaviours were measured on 12 construction sites among 305 respondents using a structured questionnaire. A total of 207 valid questionnaire responses were collected from site workers. Partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was used to examine the relationship between violent behaviour and unsafe behaviour. Findings The results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between violent behaviour and unsafe behaviour on construction sites. Originality/value The findings from this study provide valuable insight into a less investigated dimension of the problem of construction site safety management. A focus on attitudinal issues such as how workers relate toward others and toward self should be an important consideration in safety improvement interventions on construction sites.

It has been one of the leading sources of injuries and accidents in many countries. The objectives of this paper are to (1) investigate the causes of fall from roof; (2) identify control measures to roof safety that are being used in the Singapore construction industry; (3) evaluate these controls based on specific working on roof scenarios; and (4) investigate factors that influence the adoption of these solutions. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with experienced practitioners in the Singapore construction industry. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted to discuss fall protection solutions for six critical and common working on roof scenarios identified during the interviews. Results suggested that FFR accidents and injuries were caused by a combination of individual and organizational factors. Cost-effectiveness, workers competency, and site constraints are the most critical factors that differentiate solutions to specific roofing scenarios. Despite the existing solutions, it was found that some contractors are reluctant to implement appropriate solutions in their roof work due to (1) cost; (2) time pressure; (3) power imbalance; and (4) on-site constraints. Based on these findings, it was suggested that establishing a roof association would help reduce FFR accidents and injuries by addressing the following issues: (1) design working-on-roof best practices; (2) improve tendering process; and (3) develop and manage a licensing roofing worker program.

The framework is named Construction Visual Requirements, "CONVISUAL," and is designed to consider and quantify the varying lighting needs for different visual and construction tasks. The framework is developed using an original and interdisciplinary approach that integrates concepts and models from construction engineering and vision science to ensure the provision of adequate lighting conditions on site that enable workers to properly see and perform their tasks safely and with satisfactory quality. CONVISUAL determines the required illuminance level for each construction activity based on its required visual tasks and the visual capacity of construction workers. A prototype of CONVISUAL framework is implemented to illustrate its unique capabilities of (1) providing a deeper understanding of the visual requirements of nighttime construction activities; (2) specifying the required illuminance levels in a scientific and systematic approach; and (3) delivering a rational justification for the specified illuminance levels.

To address this difficulty, direct-vision remote control of a construction machine can be an effective solution by which a worker can play not only the role of an operator but also play the role of a manual laborer.This study examines a new direct-vision remote control system for an excavator using a tablet device. To realize an intuitive interface, we propose the following graphical user interfaces (GUI) of two kinds: input bucket velocity using virtual joysticks, and input bucket position by dragging a bucket. We conducted a usability evaluation experiment simulating a horizontal digging operation.

Rotation-controllable tower-crane hook-blocks (RTH) remotely rotate beams horizontally to the target position, thus helping to prevent accidents related to steel beam installation. In this study, the expected safety improvements and economic effects of the RTH were analyzed. the real discount rate, and operation and maintenance costs in accordance with the general cash flow analysis practice as well as the CO2 offset price. The results of the analysis showed that when the effects of the RTH were at their maximum and average levels, the break-even points occurred in the first year and the second year, respectively. Although the RTH might not be profitable in the minimum case, this study demonstrated that using it would generally contribute to economic efficiency, and more importantly to worker safety.

Methods have been developed to better identify construction hazards on a jobsite by analyzing workers' physical and physiological responses collected from the wearable devices. Among them, electroencephalogram (EEG) holds unique potential since it shows immediate abnormal responses when a hazard is perceived. However, there remain limitations in the current knowledge base to attain the ultimate goal of ubiquitous hazard identification. In this context, this study investigates the feasibility of identifying construction hazards by developing an EEG classifier based on the experiments conducted in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment. Results show that the CatBoost classifier achieved the highest performance with 95.1% accuracy. In addition, three important channel locations (AF3, F3, and F4) and two frequency bands (beta and gamma) were found to be closely associated with hazard perception.

Nevertheless, it is very difficult to derive a proper method of adopting a quantitative indicator, for the purpose of providing a qualitative indicator of operation ratio that depends on the experience of skillful workers. Therefore, decision-making concerning lift planning and operation of the current super high-rise building construction project relies on the experience and intuition of skillful workers, based on a different standard for each construction company. In this study, a lifting planning time calculating algorithm that has been developed is used, in consideration of the acceleration/deceleration capacity of the construction lift. The suggested algorithm is verified through simulation technique, and finally quantitative and systematic methods of lifting operation are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inventory of Nanomaterials in Construction Products for Safety and Health	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Construction workers face the possibility of exposure to nanomaterials, which are particles smaller than asbestos. Nanomaterials exposure is expected to increase in coming years because of the advantages and desirable characteristics of nanoconstruction products. The lack of knowledge and preparedness in the construction industry for this technology is apparent. There are few research studies in the United States that have evaluated the potential safety and health risks of construction nanomaterials on the construction workforce. The Center for Construction Research and Training (CPWR) has built a database containing more than 400 construction products in the United States that may contain nanomaterials. This paper investigates the nature of the nanoparticles in these construction products. Additionally, a sample of the possible safety and health hazards affecting construction workers is provided. The findings confirm the industry's lack of preparedness regarding the potential risks of construction nanomaterials, which may create or exacerbate unsafe conditions. Finally, the paper points out the necessity of communicating the potential hazards of nanoparticles to the construction workforce in contact with these products.

This paper describes a practical field study to find the factors that influence non-helmet use on construction sites using a real-time tracking system (the Eye on Project or EOP), which is developed by our research team to provide an objective record of helmet use; and which overcomes the deficiencies of traditional recording methods (Le. self-reporting). The application of association rules then combines designated risk factors and finds the causality patterns of non-helmet use.

To do so, however, designers require knowledge about safety hazards on site and the opportunity to examine their designs early in projects. Through a set of studies virtual reality tools were used to examine the potential for collaborative dialogue between designers and builders to provide a forum for learning and proactive change of a design to make a project safer to build. In the tests, participants viewed proposed designs using virtual reality to examine various alternative design and construction scenarios. The study shows that consultation and dialogue with an experienced construction professional are highly beneficial for designers to appreciate the implications of designs on safety, and that designers are more willing to adapt design details than to change aesthetic aspects of their designs.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews construction vocational education and training (VET) of major political economies to develop a theoretical framework that guides an in-depth case study of Guangdong. Document analysis, field trip observations, meetings and semi-structured interviews were combined to explore the political-economic environment, political stakeholders and quality assurance mechanisms of industrial training in Guangdong's construction sector. The findings were compared with construction VET of other economies reported in the literature. Findings Construction training in Guangdong is deeply rooted in the local history and culture, under strong dominance of the state, while continually evolves to respond to the fluid market and therefore can be conceptualised as "market-in-state". The political stakeholders are embedded within the state to ensure that skills policies are implemented in-line with industry policies. The differences between the training of Guangdong and its foreign counterparts are attributed to their divergent political-economic models. Research limitations/implications As the case study was undertaken only with Guangdong, the generalisability of its findings can be improved through future research within a broader context of multiple provinces of China through both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Practical implications Plausible foreign VET approaches are likely adaptable to the Chinese context only when conducive political-economic environment could be enabled. The findings are useful for developing countries to learn from the VET experience of industrialised economies. Construction workers' training in Guangdong can be improved by strengthening labour regulation at lower subcontracting levels and ensuring the presence of industrial associations and unions for collective training supervision. Originality/value The paper contributes to the field of construction engineering and management with a theoretical framework that guides empirical studies on the influence of the political-economic environment upon the ways political stakeholders develop and participate in construction VET. The exploration based on this framework revealed the position of the vocational training of construction workers in Guangdong in the global political-economic spectrum of skill formation.

One of the main risks in operating a tower crane is the limited visibility of the crane operator. An approach is presented that aims at increasing the situational awareness of a tower crane operator by aligning enhanced understanding of construction site layout with increased operator visibility of ground level operations. The developed method uses sensors to collect two data types, as follows: (1) a laser scanner measures the as-built conditions and geometry of a construction site, and (2) real-time location-tracking technology gathers the mostly dynamic location of workers on the ground. Several algorithms are presented to (1) identify blind spaces from the collected point cloud data that limit the visibility of a crane operator, (2) process real-time location-tracking data of workers on the ground, and (3) fuse the resulting data to create information that allows a quantitative assessment of the situational awareness of a tower crane operator. Results to a field trial are presented and show that a tower crane operator using the developed approach can increase understanding of where and when occluded spaces and ground-level operations occur. The developed methods for creating safety information from range point cloud and trajectory data is a promising approach in significantly improving the currently unsafe operation of tower cranes, one of the most utilized pieces of equipment in construction.

Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate and understand the effects of working at height on mental fatigue development for fall hazard prevention. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative framework using two well-known methods, i.e. Wavelet Packet Decomposition and Sample entropy, is developed to analyze the captured brain signals from Electroencephalography (EEG) to quantitatively assess mental fatigue levels, and seven mental fatigue indices were obtained. Between-subjects lab experiment was designed and conducted to assess mental fatigue in Virtual Reality (VR) environment. Findings Both of the quantitative methods confirmed that height exposure can adversely affect subjects' vigilance levels and indicated higher levels of mental fatigue. Significant differences were found between the two tested groups (i.e. working at height or on the ground) for six out of seven indices. The results suggested that working-at-height group had higher mental fatigue levels. Research limitations/implications One limitation of this study is the limited number of subjects recruited for the experiment. Overall, this study is a preliminary and exploratory work towards mental fatigue monitoring and assessment in subjects exposed to fall risk. Originality/value This is the first study to explore and focus on mental fatigue assessment, particularly for construction falling-from-height hazard prevention by continuously monitoring mental fatigue levels of workers. The research provides insight into construction safety enhancement using smart technologies.

Workers' lower backs are often affected by heavy or repetitive lifting and prolonged awkward postures. Exoskeletal interventions are effective for tasks involving manual lifting and repetitive movements. This study aims to examine the potential of a postural-assist exoskeleton (a passive exoskeleton) for manual material handling tasks.Design/methodology/approachFrom an experimental observation of participants, the effects of postural-assist exoskeleton on tasks and workers were measured. Associated benefits of the exoskeleton were assessed through task performance, range of motion and discomfort.FindingsFindings suggest that the exoskeleton influenced discomfort significantly, however range of motion decreased with lifting tasks. The reduced back flexion and increased hip flexion were also indicatives of the participants' responsiveness to the feedback from the exoskeleton. In addition, task completion time increased by 20%, and participants' back pain did not reduce.Research limitations/implicationsThe work tasks were performed in a controlled laboratory environment and only wearable inertia measurement units (IMUs) were used to assess the risk exposures of the body parts.Practical implicationsThis study opens a practical pathway to human-exoskeleton integration, artificial regeneration or enablement of impaired workforce and a window toward a new order of productivity scaling. Results from this study provide preliminary insights to designers and innovators on the influence of postural assist exoskeleton on construction work. Project stakeholders can be informed of the suitability of the postural assist exoskeletons for manual material handling tasks.Originality/valueLittle has been reported on the benefits and impact of exoskeletons on tasks' physical demands and construction workers' performance. This study adds value to the existing literature, in particular by providing insights into the effectiveness and consequences of the postural-assist exoskeleton for manual material handling tasks.

Identification, Quantification, and Classification of Potential Safety Risk for Sustainable Construction in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk; Safety; Prevention through Design (PtD); Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Sustainable construction; Social equity	WORKER SAFETY; HEALTH; DESIGN	Sustainability is a balanced approach that puts equal focus on the environment, economy, and society. Research suggests that worker health and safety is an integral dimension of social sustainability. The present research contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing, quantifying, and classifying occupational health and safety (OHS) risk associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance of sustainable projects across the United States construction industry and compares it with OHS risk encountered on nonsustainable counterpart projects. The researchers conducted a credit-by-credit review of the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating system to evaluate the potential positive or negative impact of green design elements and construction practices associated with the implementation of LEED credits on the OHS of construction and maintenance workers. The researchers also quantified OHS risk associated with LEED credits on 41 green projects distributed across the United States. The results show that even though a large number of LEED credits are neutral toward OHS, sustainable construction represented by LEED projects is associated with an increase in base-level safety risk. Finally, a risk model was integrated into a risk plane analysis to classify safety risk associated with each of the LEED credits. The risk classification analyses indicate that two credits are associated with unacceptable risk to OHS across the United States construction industry. It is expected that the findings from this research will benefit safety professionals, academics, designers, and all construction stakeholders by providing evidence of how their chosen sustainable designs may impact OHS on building projects.

One main reason that limits higher quality in project site management decision making especially in resource intensive and complex operations is access to real-time information and subsequent technology that enables effortless data collection, processing, and visualization. Although recent developments in remote data sensing and intelligent data processing supplement manual data recording and analyze practices, few data on visualization tools in construction exist that gather data from dynamic resources and stream it to a field-realistic virtual reality environment in real-time. State-of-the-art technology in the field of real-time data collection and visualization is reviewed. A novel framework is presented that explains the method of streaming data from real-time positioning sensors to a real-time data visualization platform. Three case studies are presented which highlight its methods for recording data and visualizing information of construction activities in a (1) simulated virtual construction site, (2) outdoor construction setting, and (3) worker training environment. The results demonstrate that important construction information related to both safety and activity in field operations can be automatically monitored and visualized in real-time, thus offering benefits such as increased situational awareness to workers, equipment operators, or decision makers anywhere on a construction project or from a remote location.

J	Noghabaei, M; Han, K; Albert, A				Noghabaei, Mojtaba; Han, Kevin; Albert, Alex			Feasibility Study to Identify Brain Activity and Eye-Tracking Features for Assessing Hazard Recognition Using Consumer-Grade Wearables in an Immersive Virtual Environment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Virtual reality; Electroencephalograph (EEG); Eye tracking; Safety training; Brain sensing	OPTIMAL FEATURE-SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; TRAINING SYSTEM; EEG; REALITY; PERCEPTION; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; VIGILANCE; STIMULI	Hazard recognition is vital to achieving effective safety management. Unmanaged or unrecognized hazards on construction sites can lead to unexpected accidents. Recent research has identified cognitive failures among workers as being a principal factor associated with poor hazard recognition levels. Therefore, understanding cognitive correlates of when individuals recognize hazards versus when they fail to recognize hazards will be useful in combating poor hazard recognition. Such efforts are now possible with recent advances in electroencephalograph (EEG) and eye-tracking technologies. This paper presents a feasibility study that combines EEG and eye tracking in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) to predict when safety hazards will be successfully recognized during hazard recognition efforts using machine learning techniques. Workers wear a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted device (HMD) that is equipped with an eye-tracking sensor. Together with an EEG sensor, brain activities and eye movements are recorded as the workers navigate a simulated virtual construction site and recognize safety hazards. Through an experiment and a feature extraction and selection process, 13 best features out of 306 features from EEG and eye tracking were selected to train a machine learning model. The results show that EEG and eye tracking together can be leveraged to predict when individuals will recognize safety hazards. The developed IVE can be potentially used to first identify hazard types that are correlated with higher arousal and valence. Also, the developed IVE can be potentially used to evaluate the correlation among arousal, valence, and hazard recognition.

Wearable sensing systems (e.g. wearable inertial measurement units (WIMUs), wearable insole pressure system (WIPS)) have been used to collect workers' gait patterns for distinguishing safety hazards. However, the performance of measuring WIPS-based gait parameters for identifying safety hazards as compared to a reference system (i.e. WIMUs) has not been studied. Therefore, this study examined the validity and reliability of measuring WIPS-based gait parameters as compared to WIMU-based gait parameters for distinguishing safety hazards in construction. Design/methodology/approach Five fall-risk events were conducted in a laboratory setting, and the performance of the proposed approach was assessed by calculating the mean difference (MD), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of five gait parameters. Findings Comparable results of MD, MAE, MAPE and RMSE were found between WIPS-based gait parameters and the reference system. Furthermore, all measured gait parameters had validity (ICC = 0.751) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.910) closer to 1, indicating a good performance of measuring WIPS-based gait parameters for distinguishing safety hazards. Research limitations/implications Overall, this study supports the relevance of developing a WIPS as a noninvasive wearable sensing system for identifying safety hazards on construction sites, thus highlighting the usefulness of its applications for construction safety research. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the performance of a wearable insole pressure system for identifying safety hazards in construction.

Additionally, carrying a load during walking may disturb their walking balance and lead to fall injuries among construction workers. Different load carrying techniques may also cause different extents of physical exertion. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of different load-carrying techniques on gait parameters, dynamic balance, and physiological parameters in asymptomatic individuals on both stable and unstable surfaces. Design/methodology/approach Fifteen asymptomatic male participants (mean age: 31.5 +/- 2.6 years) walked along an 8-m walkway on flat and foam surfaces with and without a load thrice using three different techniques (e.g. load carriage on the head, on the dominant shoulder, and in both hands). Temporal gait parameters (e.g. gait speed, cadence, and double support time), gait symmetry (e.g. step time, stance time, and swing time symmetry), and dynamic balance parameters [e.g. anteroposterior and mediolateral center of pressure (CoP) displacement, and CoP velocity] were evaluated. Additionally, the heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) was assessed to estimate physiological parameters. Findings The gait speed was significantly higher when the load was carried in both hands compared to other techniques (Hand load, 1.02 ms vs Head load, 0.82 ms vs Shoulder load, 0.78 ms). Stride frequency was significantly decreased during load carrying on the head than the load in both hands (46.5 vs 51.7 strides/m). Step, stance, and swing time symmetry were significantly poorer during load carrying on the shoulder than the load in both hands (Step time symmetry ration, 1.10 vs 1.04; Stance time symmetry ratio, 1.11 vs 1.05; Swing time symmetry ratio, 1.11 vs 1.04). The anteroposterior (Shoulder load, 17.47 mm vs Head load, 21.10 mm vs Hand load, -5.10 mm) and mediolateral CoP displacements (Shoulder load, -0.57 mm vs Head load, -1.53 mm vs Hand load, -3.37 ms) significantly increased during load carrying on the shoulder or head compared to a load in both hands. The HR (Head load, 85.2 beats/m vs Shoulder load, 77.5 beats/m vs No load, 69.5 beats/m) and EDA (Hand load, 14.0 mu S vs Head load, 14.3 mu S vs Shoulder load, 14.1 mu S vs No load, 9.0 mu S) were significantly larger during load carrying than no load. Research limitations/implications The findings suggest that carrying loads in both hands yields better gait symmetry and dynamic balance than carrying loads on the dominant shoulder or head. Construction managers/instructors should recommend construction workers to carry loads in both hands to improve their gait symmetry and dynamic balance and to lower their risk of falls. Practical implications The potential changes in gait and balance parameters during various load carrying methods will aid the assessment of fall risk in construction workers during loaded walking. Wearable insole sensors that monitor gait and balance in real-time would enable safety managers to identify workers who are at risk of falling during load carriage due to various reasons (e.g. physical exertion, improper carrying techniques, fatigue). Such technology can also empower them to take the necessary steps to prevent falls. Originality/value This is the first study to use wearable insole sensors and a photoplethysmography device to assess the impacts of various load carrying approaches on gait parameters, dynamic balance, and physiological measures (i.e. HR and EDA) while walking on stable and unstable terrains.

To prevent ergonomic injuries and disorders, posture-based ergonomic evaluation methods, which require inputs describing the worker's posture (e.g.,body joint angles), have been developed and are used widely in practice. However, the reliability of these ergonomic methods has not been investigated fully from the input measurement perspective, as when collected by a human observer or motion capture sensors, and which may inevitably contain measurement errors (e.g.,human perception errors and sensing errors in estimating human postures). Thus, this study examines the imprecision associated with acquiring the required inputs for ergonomic assessment and investigates its impact on the final result of the analysis. The two primary methods of obtaining the inputs of posture-based evaluation tools, i.e.,human observation and recordings of motion sensing devices, were examined, and a stochastic approach was proposed to evaluate the impact of the input errors on the final result of the ergonomic assessment. The findings indicate that the imprecision associated with inputs from both visual observers and sensors have significant impact on the results of ergonomic analysis and should be incorporated into the analysis accordingly. The contribution of this paper allows practitioners and researchers to understand possible ranges of outputs that can be caused by observation and measurement errors, and to determine allowable tolerance of sensing errors required for ergonomic evaluation through stochastic analysis.

It is possible to prevent CWs experiencing unmanageable stress and the associated negative consequences if the critical factors for managing their stress were known. Yet, very few studies have been conducted to explore these critical stress management factors for them. With consideration of their unique work characteristics and environment, the current study set out to fill this research gap through exploration of CWs' coping behaviors, stress symptoms, and performance. Focus group studies were conducted to collect qualitative data from skilled CWs, general CWs, and supervisors of CWs. The study explored 15 coping behaviors (categorized as either problem based or emotion based), 5 emotional and 11 physical stress symptoms, and 5 indicators of CWs' performance and safety. The principal findings include the following: CWs often not only experience physical stress symptoms, but also suffer from emotional stress symptoms; and unlike the managerial staffs, CWs usually adopt more emotion-based than problem-based coping behaviors (10 types and 5 types, respectively). A propositional model was proposed and validated by a short questionnaire survey study. Practical recommendations are made for promoting effective stress management and improving project management on CWs. The research limitations are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. This paper is the first attempt to explore CWs' coping behaviors, specific stress symptoms, and performance, which forms a basis for a future large-scale study.

Biophilic Construction Site Model: Enhancing the Motivational and Humanistic Value of the Green Construction Site	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biophilia; Construction; Ergonomics; Performance; Sustainability; Wellbeing; Labor and personnel issues		85% of a construction worker's work-day is spent on the construction site. This means that a large part of a worker's health and wellbeing could depend on the construction site and its environs. Construction work, which is inherently stressful due to the ever present threat of fatalities and injuries, compromises the ergonomic reality and human sustenance on construction sites. This necessitates the need to create a beneficial and comfortable environment that is motivational, inspirational, and healing. The biophilic construction site model (BCSM) which involves methodology of 'greening construction sites', is proposed as a healthy means of tapping into the natural resources of the construction site environment. It is intended to create a comfort zone on the construction site that would generate a symbiotic benefit to enhance its humanistic value and engender the health and wellbeing and creative performance of workers. The paper reports on a case study in the form of a focus group study and a comparative analysis of two similar construction sites in the Northern Cape region of South Africa. The findings present the healthy inter-nurture existing between a living construction site and its human occupants as a cost effective psychotherapeutic intervention in sustainable sites initiative and ergonomics, which according to research findings is as of yet missing in the construction management body of knowledge (CMBOK). The paper conclusively recommends the 'greening of construction sites'; specifically the inclusion of plants within site offices, welfare facilities and worksite premises; as a relevant means of harnessing nature's healing and rejuvenating essence towards a more productive goal in construction.

J	Ke, JJ; Zhang, M; Luo, XW; Chen, JY				Ke, Jinjing; Zhang, Ming; Luo, Xiaowei; Chen, Jiayu			Monitoring distraction of construction workers caused by noise using a wearable Electroencephalography (EEG) device	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						EEG; Sustained attention; Noise-induced distraction; Hazards identification	ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; MENTAL WORKLOAD; MIND; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ARTIFACTS; VIGILANCE; SELECTION; FATIGUE	In the construction environment with high attention requirements, distraction is the main cause of unsafe behavior and safety performance degradation. However, few studies have focused on distraction?s cognitive features and how to monitor it objectively in the construction workplace. To fill the research gap, the present study examined the correlation between distraction and brain activity using an Electroencephalography (EEG) device, intending to provide an approach for objectively monitoring worker distraction. In the simulated hazards identification activity, sustained attention to response task and dual-task paradigms have been employed to induce distraction combined with noise interference. Twenty-seven subjects participated in the experiment to identify whether a hazardous opening exists or not in the workplace in the shown images. The EEG waves were recorded and divided into two groups according to task performance: focused and distracted. Through feature calculation and extraction, it was found that beta and gamma powers in the left temporal and right pre-frontal cortex can distinguish these two statuses, particularly in channels T7 and AF4. The indicators can be considered as an objective evaluation of an individual?s sustained attention and attention failures. The developed indicators located in specified brain zones can also be used as a reference for attention training. By providing safety managers with attention status about the workers in high-risk workplaces, distraction detection contributes to control and regulate work error and improper operation, which can extend to apply in other attentive jobs like drivers, pilots, surgeons, and lifeguards.

J	Mitropoulos, P; Abdelhamid, TS; Howell, GA				Mitropoulos, P; Abdelhamid, TS; Howell, GA			Systems model of construction accident causation	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SAFETY; MANAGEMENT	The current approach to safety focuses on prescribing and enforcing "defenses;" that is, physical and procedural barriers that reduce the workers' exposure to hazards. Under this perspective, accidents occur because the prescribed defenses are violated due to lack of safety knowledge and/or commitment. This perspective has a limited view of accident causality, as it ignores the work system factors and their interactions that generate the hazardous situations and shape the work behaviors. Understanding and addressing these causal factors that lead to accidents is necessary to develop effective accident prevention strategies. This paper presents a new accident causation model of the factors affecting the likelihood of accidents during a construction activity. The model takes a systems view of accidents-it focuses on how the characteristics of the production system generate hazardous situations and shape the work behaviors, and analyzes the conditions that trigger the release of the hazards. The model is based on descriptive rather than prescriptive models of work behaviors-it takes into account the actual production behaviors, as opposed to the normative behaviors and procedures that workers "should" follow. The model identifies the critical role of task unpredictability in generating unexpected hazardous situations, and acknowledges the inevitability of exposures and errors. The model identifies the need for two accident prevention strategies: (1) reliable production planning to reduce task unpredictability, and (2) error management to increase the workers' ability to avoid, trap, and mitigate errors. The new causation model contributes to safety research by increasing understanding of the production system factors that affect the frequency of accident. The practical benefit of the model is that it provides practitioners with strategies to reduce the likelihood of accidents.

J	Liu, KJ; Golparvar-Fard, M				Liu, Kaijian; Golparvar-Fard, Mani			Crowdsourcing Construction Activity Analysis from Jobsite Video Streams	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Activity analysis; Construction productivity; Video-based monitoring; Workface assessment; Crowdsourcing; Information technologies	ORIENTED GRADIENTS; EQUIPMENT; HISTOGRAMS; WORKERS	The advent of affordable jobsite cameras is reshaping the way on-site construction activities are monitored. To facilitate the analysis of large collections of videos, research has focused on addressing the problem of manual workface assessment by recognizing worker and equipment activities using computer-vision algorithms. Despite the explosion of these methods, the ability to automatically recognize and understand worker and equipment activities from videos is still rather limited. The current algorithms require large-scale annotated workface assessment video data to learn models that can deal with the high degree of intraclass variability among activity categories. To address current limitations, this study proposes crowdsourcing the task of workface assessment from jobsite video streams. By introducing an intuitive web-based platform for massive marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and several automated methods, the intelligence of the crowd is engaged for interpreting jobsite videos. The goal is to overcome the limitations of the current practices of workface assessment and also provide significantly large empirical data sets together with their ground truth that can serve as the basis for developing video-based activity recognition methods. Six extensive experiments have shown that engaging nonexperts on AMT to annotate construction activities in jobsite videos can provide complete and detailed workface assessment results with 85% accuracy. It has been demonstrated that crowdsourcing has the potential to minimize time needed for workface assessment, provides ground truth for algorithmic developments, and most importantly allows on-site professionals to focus their time on the more important task of root-cause analysis and performance improvements.

Young Talent Motivations to Pursue Craft Careers in Construction: The Theory of Planned Behavior	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STUDENTS; IMPACT; AVAILABILITY; SELECTION; CHOICE	Past studies indicate that the US construction industry is facing challenges to attract young talent to pursue craft careers. The main goal of this research is to understand the underlying factors that influence career selection of the next generation of craft workers in order to help the industry overcome those challenges. The authors designed a survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. The survey was distributed across the US among individuals between the ages of 15-24 who were exposed to Career Technical Education (CTE) or participated in construction training programs. A total of 778 completed questionnaires was received. The statistical analysis shows that having work experience in construction-related jobs can significantly improve intention to choose a career in the industry. There is also a strong correlation between self-confidence and intention. A multivariate regression model is created to understand the relative importance of components of attitude towards working in construction. The results of this study helped the researchers make several recommendations on how to attract the next generation of craft workers to the industry.

Semi-supervised near-miss fall detection for ironworkers with a wearable inertial measurement unit	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ironworker; Near-miss fall; Fall accident; Machine learning; Anomaly detection	ACCIDENT; GAIT; ACCELEROMETERS; PARAMETERS; SUPPORT	Accidental falls (slips, trips, and falls from height) are the leading cause of occupational death and injury in construction. As a proactive accident prevention measure, near miss can provide valuable data about the causes of accidents, but collecting near-miss information is challenging because current data collection systems can largely be affected by retrospective and qualitative decisions of individual workers. In this context, this study aims to develop a method that can automatically detect and document near-miss falls based upon a worker's kinematic data captured from wearable inertial measurement units (WIMUs). A semi-supervised learning algorithm (i.e., one-class support vector machine) was implemented for detecting the near-miss falls in this study. Two experiments were conducted for collecting the near-miss falls of ironworkers, and these data were used to test developed near-miss fall detection approach. This WIMU-based approach will help identify ironworker near-miss falls without disrupting jobsite work and can help prevent fall accidents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Possible solutions for occupational safety depend on the number of criteria such as hazardous factors from which workers must be protected; the number of danger zones; architectural-design and structural solutions of a building; types of technical protection measures, etc. A large set of solutions for occupational safety predetermines the number of respective typical (or repeated) solutions, which are based on specific technical safety measures and are applicable depending on a hazardous factor; besides, it determines systematisation of the solutions on these grounds. It is suggested to use the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique for assessment and selection of appropriate solutions for occupational safety. The authors propose formulating assessed alternatives from the typical solutions to ensure their quality and then apply the entropy method for determining relative significances of evaluation criteria and, finally, use Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method for ranking of alternatives.

J	Tsai, MK; Yang, JB; Lin, CY				Tsai, Ming-Kuan; Yang, Jyh-Bin; Lin, Chang-Yu			Integrating wireless and speech technologies for synchronous on-site data collection	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						synchronous on-site data collection; wireless technology; WLAN; Bluetooth; speech application; information management	SYSTEM	Efficient on-site data collection is important for ensuring timely information flow and successful project management. Although applying information technologies and electronic devices to reduce time-consuming manual paperwork has been valued, one previous study has indicated that asynchronous operations with unnecessary subprocesses still affect information production and transmission. Implementing synchronization-based processes is a solution to enhancing on-site data collection performance. However, these synchronized processes based on worker cooperation still have room to improve their efficiency. Continuous improvement is essential to satisfying this objective. This study thus develops a synchronous system integrated with wireless and speech technologies to enhance the cooperation between construction workers and application devices. System tests and efficiency evaluation in a material management case study demonstrate that this system increased productivity, reduced operation time and simplified subprocesses for activity completion. The synchronous system not only represents a novel application for on-site material management, but also provides a framework for applying wireless and speech technologies for similar on-site information management.

J	Mullens, MA; Arif, M				Mullens, Michael A.; Arif, Mohammed			Structural insulated panels: Impact on the residential construction process	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Uncertainty and risk have contributed to the reluctance of U.S. homebuilders to embrace new construction technologies. This paper explores one innovative, but underutilized building technology, structural insulated panels (SIPs), and its impact on the residential construction process. The paper presents findings from a side-by-side case study of the construction of two Habitat for Humanity homes, one SIP and one conventional wood-framing. Although the study focuses on labor productivity and cycle time during framing, other key construction performance metrics are assessed including worker safety, quality/workmanship, material waste, worker skill levels, and equipment requirements. Findings indicate that SIPs saved about two-thirds of the site framing labor for walls and roofs, with cycle time savings of similar magnitude. No significant impacts on other construction performance metrics were observed, however, size of the panels did require a lift truck and construction crane. While conclusions are limited by the scope of the case study, the writers believe that building with SIPs can be very efficient. The paper identifies key actions required of builders and SIP manufacturers to maximize potential benefits.

This paper presents a multisensor-driven real-time crane monitoring system consisting of load tracking, obstacle detection, worker detection, collision warning, and 3D visualization modules. A combination of encoders, vision, and laser scanning systems is used to reconstruct a 3D workspace model of the crane environment and provide real-time spatial feedback to the operator. Field experimentation was carried out at an outdoor crane manufacturing facility under different blind lift scenarios. Results showed that the encoder-based load positioning system has a mean height estimation error within 0.33 m, the vision based load positioning system has a mean centroid error of 0.454 m, and the worker detection system has a mean centroid error of 0.023 m. This study also provided important findings in terms of challenges and limitations in implementing a real-world crane monitoring system.

J	Seo, JO; Lee, SH				Seo, JoonOh; Lee, SangHyun			Automated postural ergonomic risk assessment using vision-based posture classification	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Work-related musculoskeletal disorders; Vision-based posture classification; Ergonomic risk assessment	BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SITES; WORKING POSTURES; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; RECOGNITION; INDUSTRY; TASK; EXPOSURE; VALIDITY; FEATURES; HAZARDS	Construction workers are at high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) due to physically demanding manual-handling tasks in awkward postures. Although existing observational methods to identify ergonomic risks are inexpensive and easy to use, they are seldom used in construction sites because they are timeconsuming, subject to observer bias, and require well-trained analysts. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a vision-based method to automatically classify workers' postures for ergonomic assessment. Specifically, it proposes a vision-based method that eliminates the need to collect extensive training-image datasets by employing classification algorithms to learn diverse postures from virtual images, and then identifies those postures in real-world images. The experimental tests showed about 89% classification accuracy in automatically classifying diverse postures on images, confirming the usefulness of virtual training images for posture classification. The proposed method has potential for automated ergonomic risk analysis, and could help to prevent WMSDs during diverse occupational tasks.

However, current development activities face significant uncertainties, particularly in terms of the definition and management of system requirements, which are primarily based on vague assumptions about the future. Thus, a new tool is required to grasp how construction robots-and their surrounding ecosystems-will be used. This research adopts an unprecedented scenario-based approach to develop and analyze future alternatives for construction robotics in a systematic manner. Hong Kong "toward 2035" is used as an initial test case, and four scenarios of the robot ecosystem, i.e., "Bottleneck," "Age of Iron Worker," "Dynamic Co-evolution of Robotization and Modularization," and "Rise of the Robots," are developed from evidence-based analysis. Scenarios highlight the crucial role of workers for construction robot utilization. Driving forces, opportunities, and challenges are identified for elaborating strategies under each scenario. The integrated scenario approach and findings lay an important foundation for systems engineering processes in construction robotics to develop a new tool for structuring system context and specifying system requirements.

Workers are heavily involved in manual procedures, which constantly expose them to a great risk of injury. Recently, exoskeletons and their potential to protect workers from injury have received wide attention. Significant advances have been made in both of their industrial developments and scholarly assessment. This paper reviewed existing exoskeleton technologies and analyzed their potential for manual handling tasks in construction. It first retrieved 85 relevant research articles and categorized them based on exoskeleton types, functions, and assessment procedures. Then, the potential of the exoskeleton use in construction at trade level was analyzed. A map was generated to suggest the potential exoskeleton type for each trade with evaluation of benefits and challenges. The map is expected to provide construction professionals with insights and guidelines when integrating exoskeletons into their current routine construction practices.

Augmenting past work addressing the direct risks of UAV flights, namely, crashes and collisions, this paper assesses the indirect UAV flight risks triggered by the proximity of UAVs with humans. Risk assessment is simple in theory: any risk may be quantified by knowing the probability of a risky event, the probability of impact, and/or the severity of the event. This paper (1) discusses the nature of the probability of a risky event, the probability of impact, and the probability of severity of UAV flight indirect risks and (2) presents a model for measuring the indirect risks of UAV flights when associated with the proximity of construction workers and UAVs. The proposed model is applied to a case study using Monte Carlo Simulation, and the results show the applicability of the model to a construction jobsite environment.

Front-line healthcare workers are among the most at risk of contracting and spreading the virus due to close contact with infected patients and settings of high viral loads. To provide these workers with an extra layer of protection, the authors propose a low-cost, prefabricated, and portable sanitising chamber that sprays individuals with sanitising fluid to disinfect clothing and external surfaces on their person. The study discusses computer-aided design of the chamber to improve uniformity of sanitiser deposition and reduce discomfort due to excessive moisture. Advanced computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the dispersion and deposition of spray particle, and the resulting wetting pattern on the treated person is used to optimise the chamber design.

We identify motivation factors that are influenced by the cultural differences of the laborers, and their effects on productivity. Based on the results of a preliminary survey of field technicians with at least 15 years of work experience, a final set of 27 factors was included in a questionnaire: 5 economic factors, 11 social factors, and 11 psychological factors. Taking cultural differences into account, motivation factors that can have an impact on productivity were determined and broken down by nationality, based on the analysis results. The findings of this research can be used to stimulate social awareness and build an appropriate systemic police. The results can also be used to help develop a management plan based on cultural differences between foreign workers in the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

This paper presents the development of an automated post-3D visualization ErgoSystem, a system that automates ergonomic risk assessment based on 3D modelling with the support of user-friendly platform for rapid workplace design. Rapid Entire Body Assessment and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment have also been integrated and adjusted into the proposed system. The system is implemented into the process of comparing various methods of placing insulation onto a modularized panel to demonstrate how the change of movements correlates to the change of workplace design. The objective is to proactively mitigate ergonomic risk at the workplace and to reduce injuries and workers' compensation costs.

The authors present an extensible pose-guided anchoring framework aimed at multi-class PPE compliance detection. The overall approach harnesses a pose estimator to detect worker body parts as spatial anchors and guide the localization of part attention regions using body-knowledge-based rules considering workers' orientations and object scales. Specifically, "part attention regions" are local image patches expecting PPEs based on their inherent relationships with body parts, e.g., (head, hardhat) and (upper-body, vest). Finally, the shallow CNN-based classifiers can reliably recognize both PPE and non-PPE classes within their corresponding part attention regions. Quantitative evaluations tested on the developed construction personal protective equipment dataset (CPPE) show an overall 0.97 and 0.95 F1-score for hardhat and safety vest detection, respectively. Comparative studies with existing methods also demonstrate the higher detection accuracy and advantageous extensibility of the proposed strategy.

J	Abdelhamid, TS; Everett, JG				Abdelhamid, TS; Everett, JG			Physiological demands during construction work	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction management; research; occupational health		Notwithstanding the use of earthmoving equipment, cranes, and other machinery, physically strenuous and demanding tasks remain endemic to the construction industry. This research was motivated by the need to investigate the physical demands of construction work and to evaluate whether these physical demands are excessive. Physiological measures of energy expenditure, including oxygen consumption and heart rate data, were collected for 100 construction workers performing typical construction work. The average oxygen uptake for the measured construction activities was 0.82 L.min(-1) (+/-0.22 L.min(-1)), and the average heart rate for the measured construction activities was 108 beats .min(-1) (+/-17 beats .min(-1)). The measured data were evaluated against published guidelines for acceptable levels of physical performance in industrial settings indicating that a significant number of craft workers (20 to 40%) routinely exceed these physiological thresholds. The results clearly point to the need to promote and apply concepts of work physiology at the workplace to better the occupational health and safety of the construction workforce. This paper developed the foundation for further applied research regarding the physical demands of construction work.

J	Chen, JY; Qiu, J; Ahn, CB				Chen, Jiayu; Qiu, Jun; Ahn, Changbum			Construction worker's awkward posture recognition through supervised motion tensor decomposition	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction activities; Awkward posture; Posture recognition; Inertia measurement units; Tensor decomposition	MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; VISION; SYSTEM; TRACKING; SAFETY; WORKPLACE; INDUSTRY; CAPTURE; FUSION	Awkward postures in construction activities pose substantial hazards in both instantaneous injuries and long-term work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Posture recognition using motion capturing systems shows promising potential in avoiding and minimizing workers' exposure to awkward postures. However, current motion capturing systems require huge computational resources and complicated processes to recognize postures in construction tasks. To address this issue, we proposed an abstract and efficient motion tensor decomposition approach to compress and reorganize the motion data. Together with a multi-classification algorithm, the proposed approach is able to efficiently and accurately differentiate various postures. To validate the approach, we employed a system based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) to examine two sample activities composed of sequencing postures. The results indicate the proposed approach is able to provide sufficient recognition accuracy with less computation power and memory. Also, the idea of tensorization and tensor decomposition in this paper is extendable to other studies in the construction industry.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reducing Fatality Rates of the Hispanic Workforce in the US Construction Industry: Challenges and Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hispanic workforce; Cultural differences; Active cultural difference; Labor and personnel issues	LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE; ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; SAFETY COMMUNICATION; NATIONAL CULTURE; UNITED-STATES; WORKERS; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; DIMENSIONS; INJURY	Recent government statistics have revealed a high rate of fatalities among Hispanic workers in the U. S. construction industry. This study investigates the root causes of this issue as well as the existing attempts to manage these causes effectively. Cultural barriers are one of the root causes that have not been fully explored. This detailed investigation expands into an exploration of cultural barriers and differences, variables that are directly attributable to construction site safety. A survey instrument was designed to evaluate the existence and influence of these differences at U. S. construction sites, and data were collected from construction supervisors across the United States. The results of the survey strongly suggest the existence of two differences: high power distance and collectivism cultural dimensions. Based on the survey results and feedback from construction supervisors, recommendations for best practices in workforce development that guides construction professionals and researchers are suggested.

As buildings are becoming larger, the materials used are also increasing in size to reduce the time required for construction. To manipulate a heavy duty panel glass intuitively, we proposed an installation methodology based on human-robot cooperation for a glazing robot. Here, we classified all types of glass installation robots, and then analyzed the installation methods compared to construction workers. We propose a human-robot cooperation method that is similar to installation method of construction worker and detail the requirements. In addition, a control system for using intuitive manipulation device is implemented. We confirmed that the glass installation work using intuitive manipulation device is more efficient than existing methods through a simple experimental setup. This method combines operator's control ability and robot's power. It is expected that glass installation work will not only be more efficient but also safer.

JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						automation; bench marks; data collection; labor; project management; performance evaluation		Real-time control of on-site construction is a growing field still in its infancy. Labor inputs is an important project performance indicator to be controlled because it is a leading input in construction projects. A model for automated control was developed and verified in the field, to demonstrate that labor inputs can be automatically measured and controlled. The concept behind this development is that indirect data-workers' locations measured automatically at regular time intervals-can be collected automatically and converted into labor inputs using computerized algorithms. The model was implemented in a concept-proving prototype, which was applied in three construction projects to verify the concept and test the feasibility of developing a full-scale prototype. The encouraging results of the field experiments showed that it is possible to convert worker's locations automatically measured at regular time intervals into labor inputs, and thus automatically control them. The expected accuracy of such a system is +/-10-20%. Additional work is currently underway to develop a location measurement system and other components of the full-scale prototype.

When construction workers report activity information, project managers understand activity progresses. This procedure forms information exchange and flow. However, the lack of up-to-date information still causes project problems (such as increasing unnecessary costs, making erroneous decisions and improper activity scheduling), and highlights the importance of on-site data collection. For improving this condition, this study integrates two managerial philosophies ("theory of constraints (TOC)" and lean construction) to propose a synchronization-based model. When this model was applied for a material management case study, asynchronous operations accompanied with unnecessary subprocesses were recognized as an influence on on-site information production and transmission. This study then applied synchronous operations based on worker cooperation to resolve these problems, and evaluated the efficiency obtained by the identified measurements. The proposed model offers not only a prototype of synchronous on-site data collection, but also a mechanism for activity performance improvement. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many deadly accidents still occur even though the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has increased its training for safe trenching. The work presented in this paper originated with the belief that the best approach to remedy this problem is technology. Its premise is the need to remove the workers from this deadly trap and replace them with a mechanical device capable of doing the work necessary to lay pipes accurately. Presented is the result of a comparative field evaluation designed to prove that such a technology is not only technically feasible, but also cost-effective. For this purpose, a tele-operated pipe manipulator was built, capable of being easily attached to an excavator bucket and controllable from the safety of an operator cabin. The new technology was subsequently evaluated during field tests using both qualitative and quantitative performance criteria. Data from the study clearly demonstrate that this technological intervention not only works as intended, but also promises to reduce the cost of installing pipes, especially with increasing trench depths.

Ergonomic assessment is essential to identify, mitigate, and prevent these postures for safety and productivity improvement. Advanced computer vision technologies have made vision-based ergonomic assessment cost-effective in real workplaces. However, their accuracy and robustness still need to be improved. This paper proposes a monocular vision-based framework for conducting a biomechanical analysis or ergonomic posture assessment. The framework consists of four components: worker visual tracking, two-dimensional (2D) joint and body part detection, 2D joints refinement, and three-dimensional (3D) body model generation and joint angle calculation. The framework has been tested with videos recorded in real construction workshops. The results show that the framework could use the videos from a single camera to estimate a total of 14 joint angles with the average error of 11 degrees and identify workers' awkward postures and motions.

Nonvisible areas (blind spots) for equipment operators are contributing factors to many of these fatalities because equipment operators are unable to see ground personnel at certain locations around their equipment. Presented are the design and validation of a unique technique for measuring blind spots by using laser scanning data. The work demonstrates how the design of construction equipment impacts the visibility of its operator. The contribution of the developed technique to the body of knowledge is that it can precisely evaluate and compare different equipment models and design characteristics. The blind spot measurement data for several similar pieces of equipment provides design suggestions that increase operator visibility. By increasing operator visibility through advanced equipment design, safety can be promoted on construction sites and in any other work environment, particularly with nearby ground workforce equipment.

To address the limitation, this study proposed the novel concept of a safety monitoring system by leveraging unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), game engine-based ITCP, and deep learning. In this study, workers and equipment were automatically recognized through object detection from aerial images. Through the case study, this proposed concept was validated to monitor the unsafe activities of workers by four rules established. While the limitations of this study were documented, such as the low number of aerial images to train deep learning model, the low performance of object detection, and the errors that occurred when augmenting the detection results in the game engine, this study also emphasized the potential of the proposed digital ITCP-based safety monitoring system.

Development and Initial Validation of Sustainable Construction Safety and Health Rating System	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; FATALITIES; DESIGN	This paper presents a study to develop and validate a sustainable construction safety and health (SCSH) rating system. The rating system provides an opportunity to rate projects based on the importance given to construction worker safety and health and the degree of implementation of safety and health elements. A Delphi survey using an expert panel of 12 experienced safety and health professionals representing different sectors of the construction industry was employed to develop the SCSH rating system. The study resulted in a rating system consisting of a total of 50 safety and health elements organized into 13 categories. Each category contains safety and health elements which carry credits based on their effectiveness in preventing construction worker injuries and illnesses. The rating system was initially validated based on data from 25 construction projects and found to accurately represent the safety performance of large projects. The SCSH rating system can be used as an effective tool to develop and plan construction safety and health programs and evaluate the potential safety performance of construction projects.

J	Gambatese, JA; Behm, M; Hinze, JW				Gambatese, JA; Behm, M; Hinze, JW			Viability of designing for construction worker safety	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Designing for construction safety entails. consideration of the safety of construction workers in the design of a project. Research studies have identified the design aspect of projects as being a significant contributing factor to construction site accidents. Designing to eliminate or avoid hazards prior to exposure on the jobsite is also listed as the too priority in the hierarchy of controls common to the safety and health professions. Widespread implementation of the concept in the United States by engineering and architecture firms, however, is lacking due to perceived industry and project barriers. Given its absence from standard design practice, a question arises as to the viability of designing for safety as an intervention in the construction industry. This paper presents a pilot study that was conducted to investigate the practice of addressing construction worker safety when designing a project and, to determine the feasibility and practicality of such an intervention. Through interviews of architects and engineers, the study found that a large percentage of design professionals are interested and willing to implement the concept in practice. Among the perceived impacts of implementation, project cost and schedule were mentioned-most often along with limitations being placed on design creativity. The results of the pilot study indicate that designing for safety is a viable intervention in construction. The factors that impact the consideration of safety in-the design of a project do not entirely prohibit its implementation or make its implementation extremely impractical and therefore not feasible. Additionally, the outcomes of implementation provide sufficient motivation to implement the concept in practice. The paper describes the key changes needed for implementation of the concept in practice which include: a change in designer mindset toward safety; establishment of a motivational force to promote designing for safety; increase designer knowledge of the concept; incorporate construction safety knowledge in the design phase; utilize designers knowledgeable about design-for-safety modification's; make design for safety tools and guidelines available for use and reference; and mitigate designer liability exposure.

J	Pereira, E; Ahn, S; Han, S; Abourizk, S				Pereira, Estacio; Ahn, Seungjun; Han, SangUk; Abourizk, Simaan			Identification and Association of High-Priority Safety Management System Factors and Accident Precursors for Proactive Safety Assessment and Control	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction safety; Risk-rating method; Safety management system; Accident precursor; Proactive safety management	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; HONG-KONG; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; CAUSATION; INDUSTRY; HEALTH; IMPACT; LATENT	The performance of a safety management system (SMS) is influenced by a large number of internal and external factors. Loss of control of these factors can create unsafe conditions, which can eventually lead to worksite accidents. Identification and prioritization of these factors is crucial for optimal SMS performance. However, because of the complex and dynamic nature of accident occurrence, identification and control of critical SMS factors and accident precursors remains difficult in practice. This paper proposes the use of a risk-rating approach for understanding the complexity between SMS factors and accident precursors from a holistic perspective. This approach allows for not only the identification of high-priority SMS factors and accident precursors, but also the evaluation of associations between these groups. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, risk ratings for a comprehensive set of SMS factors and accident precursors were collected from 96 construction professionals in Alberta, Canada. The results demonstrated that contract schedule, skilled worker availability, and change orders were the highest-priority SMS factors in the region. Results also found the highest-priority accident precursors to be workers' failure to identify hazards, congestion, and workers' neglect of hazards. Associations between factors and precursors were also examined and were found to be present between several SMS factors and accident precursors. Overall, this method allows practitioners to identify high-priority accident precursors and to determine which SMS factors are associated with these precursors. These findings can assist practitioners in determining which SMS factors should be controlled if certain accident precursors are observed and, conversely, which accident precursors are most likely to occur if critical SMS factors are present on site.

A psychological contract of safety (PCS) describes an individual's conceptualized belief that relates to mutual safety obligations, drawn from explicit or implicit promises of associated workers or its supervisor. This study investigates safety practices on construction sites through the lens of the widely applied and researched psychological contract theory emanating from a business paradigm. Design/methodology/approach The process of validating a PCS scale within the construction industry required the collection of data from a mega-construction project in Sydney, Australia. A quantitative methodology was used to collect data from 352 construction workers through a survey instrument designed to reveal their perception of procedures, policies and practices. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to ensure data reliability and data validity of the survey findings together with goodness of fit of PCS model. Findings The findings showed the presence of a PCS in a construction safety setting examined. A two-factor model underlying aspects, namely employer and employee obligations was recommended since the four-factor model, including relational and transactional components of both parties' safety obligations, could not be validated due to the discriminant validity associated with the particular constructs. Originality/value Conceptualizing the extant PC theory as a framework from which to leverage safety management initiatives brings a new approach to construction safety studies, revealing the influential role of supervisors in interpreting safety practices. The research aimed to identify safety obligations, which are influential in the development of PSC scale, further the research provides an explanation as to how a PCS may be contextualized in the construction industry.

J	Lee, YC; Shariatfar, M; Rashidi, A; Lee, HW				Lee, Yong-Cheol; Shariatfar, Moeid; Rashidi, Abbas; Lee, Hyun Woo			Evidence-driven sound detection for prenotification and identification of construction safety hazards and accidents	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Audio-based accident recognition; Construction safety; Autonomous safety surveillance; Evidence-driven sound event detection	ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	As the construction industry experiences a high rate of casualties and significant economic loss associated with accidents, safety has always been a primary concern. In response, several studies have attempted to develop new approaches and state-of-the-art technology for conducting autonomous safety surveillance of construction work zones such as vision-based monitoring. The current and proposed methods including human inspection, however, are limited to consistent and real-time monitoring and rapid event recognition of construction safety issues. In addition, the health and safety risks inherent in construction projects make it challenging for construction workers to be aware of possible safety risks and hazards according to daily planned work activities. To address the urgent demand of the industry to improve worker safety, this study involves the development of an audio-based event detection system to provide daily safety issues to laborers and through the rapid identification of construction accidents. As an evidence-driven approach, the proposed framework incorporates the occupational injury and illness manual data, consisting of historical construction accident data classified by types of sources and events, into an audio-based safety event detection framework. This evidence-driven framework integrated with a daily project schedule can automatically provide construction workers with prenotifications regarding safety hazards at a pertinent work zone as well as consistently contribute to enhanced construction safety monitoring by audio-based event detection. By using a machine learning algorithm, the framework can clearly categorize the narrowed-down sound training data according to a daily project schedule and dynamically restrict sound classification types in advance. The proposed framework is expected to contribute to an emerging knowledge base for integrating an automated safety surveillance system into occupational accident data, significantly improving the accuracy of audio-based event detection.

Biomechanical analysis of risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders during repetitive lifting task in construction workers	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Work-related musculoskeletal disorders; Lifting posture; Lifting weight; Muscle activity; Repetitive task	LOW-BACK-PAIN; LUMBAR SPINE; PHYSICAL EXPOSURE; MODEL; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; POSTURE; INJURY; LOADS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) represent major health issues for construction workers yet risk factors associated with repetitive lifting tasks remain unexplored. This study evaluates the effects of lifting weights and postures on spinal biomechanics (i.e. muscle activity and muscle fatigue) during a simulated repetitive lifting task undertaken within a strictly controlled laboratory experimental environment. Twenty healthy male participants performed simulated repetitive lifting tasks with three different lifting weights using either a stoop (n = 10) or a squat (n = 10) lifting posture until subjective fatigue (a point in time at which the participant cannot continue lifting further). Spinal biomechanics during repetitive lifting tasks were measured by surface electromyography (sEMG). Results revealed that (1) increased lifting weights significantly increased sEMG activity and muscle fatigue of the biceps brachii (BB), brachioradialis (BR), lumbar erector spinae (LES), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles but not the rectus femoris (RF) muscle; (2) sEMG activity and muscle fatigue rate of the LES muscle were higher than all other muscles; (3) a significant difference of sEMG activity of the RF and MG muscles was observed between lifting postures, however no significant difference of muscle fatigue was apparent (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that risk factors such as lifting weights, repetitions and lifting postures may alleviate the risk of developing WMSDs. However, future research is required to investigate the effectiveness of using ergonomic interventions (such as using team lifting and adjustable lift equipment) in reducing WMSDs risks in construction workers. This work represents the first laboratory-based simulated testing conducted to investigate work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) primarily caused by repetitive lifting tasks and manual handling. Cumulatively, the results and ensuing discussion offer insight into how these risks can be measured and mitigated.	[Antwi-Afari, M.

J	Bowen, P; Govender, R; Edwards, P; Cattell, K				Bowen, Paul; Govender, Rajen; Edwards, Peter; Cattell, Keith			An explanatory model of attitudinal fear of HIV/AIDS testing in the construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; Construction management; Construction workers; Fear of testing; Intervention management; Predictive modelling	RISK SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; AIDS-RELATED STIGMA; SOUTH-AFRICA; HIV TRANSMISSION; CAPE-TOWN; MEN; POPULATION; PREDICTORS; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - Prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection in the South African construction industry exceeds that of most other economic sectors. Voluntary counselling and testing is pivotal in combatting the spread of the disease. Little is known about the attitudinal fear of testing among construction workers, and the determinants thereof. The purpose of this paper is to address these shortcomings. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual integrated model of fear of testing is proposed. Demographic characteristics and behavioural and cognitive factors are posited to explain attitudinal fear of testing. Regression analysis and structural equation modelling are used to test the model, using data gathered from 512 site-based participants in a questionnaire survey. Findings - Prejudice and lifestyle risk are the terminal predictors of fear of testing. Prejudice is determined by education level and HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. Knowledge is predicted by education level and ethnicity. Lifestyle risk is determined by age, gender, harmful substance use, and knowledge. Harmful substance use is determined by age, gender, ethnicity, and employment type. The inter-relationship between knowledge about HIV/AIDS, prejudice towards HIV+ persons, and fear of testing is complex and nuanced. Practical implications - Intervention strategies by firms should positively address attitudinal fear of testing. Employers should ensure that effective communication is established with workers. Interventions relating to harmful substance use by employees need particular attention. Awareness campaigns should be sensitive to ethnic and cultural values, and to inter-generational differences. Originality/value - Harmful substance use and knowledge about HIV/AIDS transmission are indirect predictors of fear of testing. Education and ethnicity are critical dimensions of knowledge. The complex inter-relationship between knowledge, prejudice, lifestyle risk, and fear of testing is highlighted, providing guidelines for intervention management.

These improvements alone however, will not significantly reduce costs unless they are accompanied by revisions in the entire claims processing system. This study explores the reliability and utility of probabilistic inductive learning (PrIL), a statistically enhanced decision tree algorithm, for improving the decision-making process at the New York State Workers' Compensation Board (WCB), The WCB sees a high volume of claims every year, and its administrative costs are considerably higher than other states of similar size. In response, legislation had been enacted which would differently route cases with a short expected duration of benefits for nontraditional processing. It is expected that such regulation will shorten the claim life cycle and reduce a backlog of cases at a reduced cost. Using several different models, PrIL was used to generate rules that could be used to assign cases to different processing routes within the WCB system. For purposes of comparison, models using logistic regression analysis and conventional decision tree methodology were also produced. Results indicated that the PrIL algorithm is favorably comparable to both the purely statistical and the classical decision tree methodologies, with the added advantages of easy to understand rules and user-defined reliability measures for each of those rules. Given the appropriate information regarding the relative value of correct and incorrect classification of cases in the WCB system, PrIL can be used to accurately assist in the decision making process in terms of reducing cost, predicting and enhancing quality and case outcomes in managed care practices.

This fact suggests the possibility of a latent side effect of safety interventions, known as risk compensation. Since no study has empirically examined the risk-taking behaviors of workers as a function of the number and type of safety interventions in place for their protection, this research examined whether the concept of risk compensation could offset some safety benefits of protection equipment. An immersive mixed-reality environment (i.e., virtual reality and passive haptics) was developed to simulate a roofing activity. Then, combining real-time head- and ankle-tracking sensors with qualitative sources of data, the authors monitored the reactionary behavioral responses of participants while they completed roofing tasks under three, randomly ordered levels of safety protection in the mixed-reality roofing simulation. The results indicated that providing more safety interventions (i.e., higher levels of fall protection) produced a sense of invulnerability among participants. This false sense of security ultimately increased their risk-taking behavior by up to 55%: participants stepped closer to the roof edge, leaned over the edge, and spent more time exposing themselves to fall risk. Although this study used students as unskilled roofing workers, it provides an initial empirical understanding of how more safety protections might implicitly signal workers to take additional risks-an effect of risk compensation. These findings could significantly influence how the construction industry approaches the development and implementation of safety interventions to offset the influence of risk compensation.

Interactive and Immersive Process-Level Digital Twin for Collaborative Human-Robot Construction Work	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Digital twin; Construction robots; Immersive virtual reality; Human-robot collaboration	TELEOPERATION SYSTEM; FRAMEWORK; SIMULATION; INTERFACE; REALITY; LATENCY; SAFETY; BIM	Human cognition plays a critical role in construction work, particularly in the context of high-level task planning and in-field improvisation. On the other hand, robots are adept at performing numerical computation and repetitive physical tasks with precise motion control. The unstructured and complex nature of construction environments and the inability to maintain tight tolerances in assembled workpieces pose several unique challenges to the wide application of robots in construction work. Thus, the robotization of field construction processes is best conceived as a collaborative human-robot endeavor that takes advantage of both human and robot intelligence as well as robots' physical operation capabilities to overcome uncertainties and successfully perform useful construction work onsite. This paper proposes an interactive and immersive process-level digital twin (I2PL-DT) system in virtual reality (VR) that integrates visualization and supervision, task planning and execution, and bidirectional communication to enable collaborative human-robot construction work. In this work paradigm, the human worker is responsible for high-level task planning and work process supervision. The robot undertakes workspace sensing and monitoring, detailed motion planning, and physical execution of the work. A drywall installation case study involving imperfect rough carpentry (wall framing) is presented using a KUKA mobile industrial robotic arm emulator. A human-in-the-loop study involving 20 subjects was conducted for system verification and to collect feedback for future improvements. The experimental results show that users can use the system to specify work sequences, select optimal task plans, and perform robot trajectory guidance after simple training and felt positive about the system functions and user experience. The system demonstrates the potential of transitioning the role of construction workers from physical task performers to robot supervisors. In addition, the system establishes a promising framework for construction workers to remotely collaborate with onsite construction robots.

However, in the conventional pneumatic caisson, workers are at risks of suffering from decompression sickness because of long-duration exposure to the hyperbaric environment. Furthermore, the construction cost of the conventional pneumatic caisson is fairly high owing to the inefficiency and labor redundancy. To address these issues, an automatic construction system for the pneumatic caisson, which enables unmanned excavations based on a remote-control technology, has been developed. This system mainly comprises a remotely operated excavator, a vertical screw conveyor for continuous soil discharge, and an integrated real-time monitoring system. Additionally, a program named "NPC (new pneumatic caisson) Manager" is adopted for the comprehensive analysis of real-time monitoring data.

People also take part in construction on a voluntary basis; most volunteers have limited training and no technical qualification, whilst safety regulation frameworks range from being comparable to professional sectors to zero regulation in some international contexts. Unstructured interviews were undertaken with volunteer construction workers from two areas: those returning from international development projects and those regularly volunteering on UK heritage railways. Taking a social constructionist perspective, data was explored using discourse analysis to illuminate 'safety' within this unique construction 'industry'. Those with engineering or technical backgrounds developed more tangible constructions of safety, around risks and hazards, within their activities, yet volunteers without this experience also acknowledged a wider context of danger. Volunteers on overseas projects developed discourses of 'difference' between safety at home and safety outside the UK, associated with negative practices overseas yet with acceptance of their inevitability as part of the voluntary experience. Further work is proposed to determine whether these insights can contribute to improved safety management within the voluntary construction context.

J	Ray, SJ; Teizer, J				Ray, Soumitry J.; Teizer, Jochen			Computing 3D blind spots of construction equipment: Implementation and evaluation of an automated measurement and visualization method utilizing range point cloud data	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Backing accidents; Blind spots; Equipment and machinery; Forklifts; Injury and fatality; Laser scanning and photogrammetry; Operator and construction worker; Safety; Industrial powered vehicles standards; Visibility		Limited visibility due to blind spots of construction equipment was responsible for 55% of the visibility-related fatalities in the construction industry. Knowledge of blind spot aids in improving safety on construction sites and the design of equipment cabin itself. Existing approaches for blind spot measurement that follow international standards typically require a time-consuming set-up and are limited by the number of different visibility analyses that can be performed. A new approach to compute blind spot in a fast and efficient way using point cloud data of equipment is presented. The developed approach allows performing different analyses such as: volumetric blind spots, blind spot map, 12 m circumference visibility, rectangular 1 m boundary visibility, and worker visibility. In addition, the above set of analyses can be performed from different viewpoints located virtually anywhere inside the equipment cabin. Validating against synthetic "noisy" point clouds, robustness and accuracy of the approach is established. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The high rates of workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities cause irreversible harm to workers and are often the source of delays and additional project costs. Improvements in sensor technologies, wireless communication, the processing power of computers, and advancements in machine learning and computer vision are now enabling the development of sensor-based safety management systems. The rapid growth of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has also created opportunities for improving safety management. While considerable progress has been made to improve construction safety, few studies have focused on the integration of sensor-based systems and BIM. This research, which is motivated by the development of such integrated methods, carries out a systematic review of the relevant literature, summarising recent developments of sensor-based safety management systems and advancements in safety management through BIM. The research gaps are identified and an outline for potential future research is provided. The results of the review reveal the potential of combining sensor-driven systems with BIM for improving safety management in construction.

A focus of this paper is to establish a hazard energy monitoring system and use IoT to generate early warnings and alarms as dynamical safety barriers for hazard energy on underground construction sites. To ensure the performance of the proposed system, the hazard energies and their coupling mechanisms was analyzed to provide safety barrier strategies and scenarios for avoiding unsafe behaviors and unsafe status of construction equipment and workers' environment. The IoT technologies, such as meter-level of RFID-based location and tracking technology, centimeter-level of ultrasonic detection technology, and infrared access technology and so on, were developed in three-tier network architecture to help workers change their risky behaviors and avoid accidents on the changing construction site. The implementation in Yangtze River crossing Metro Tunnel Construction site has shown the safety performance was improved and the occurrence of accident caused by hazard energy on site could be prevented.

J	FLEISCHER, M; LIKER, JK				FLEISCHER, M; LIKER, JK			THE HIDDEN PROFESSIONALS - PRODUCT DESIGNERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON DESIGN QUALITY	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							COMPUTER-AIDED-DESIGN; CAD CAM	The management of designers and the design process controls a crucial element in the efficiency and effectiveness of product realization. U.S. companies typically distinguish the role of "design engineer," treated as a professional, from that of "designer," treated as a worker who creates the detailed design. This paper discusses the roles of designers in the development engineering phase of product development, and examines the effects of designer communication, job design, organization climate, and CAD system quality on design quality. A survey of designers and design engineers at ten manufacturing sites was conducted. Communication with downstream processes, task significance, and job commitment were associated with greater achievement of manufacturability objectives. Communication with downstream processes and within the design core team were associated with achievement of strength objectives. Job commitment was a significant predictor of achievement of cost objectives. CAD system quality was not associated with any of the outcome measures. These results suggest that managers of development engineering organizations should treat designers more as professionals and less as workers. They should also redesign the jobs of both designers and design engineers to insure that the designers have greater responsibility and authority for linking with external groups.

J	Zhang, LH; Zou, X; Kan, ZN				Zhang, Lihui; Zou, Xin; Kan, Zhinan			Improved Strategy for Resource Allocation in Repetitive Projects Considering the Learning Effect	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Learning effect; Repetitive project; Resource allocation; Line-of-balance; Project Planning and Design	CURVE; MODEL	Considering the learning effect while planning and scheduling repetitive construction projects can help provide a realistic forecast of their duration and resource requirements. This paper has developed an improved learning curve (LC) to replace the log-linear LC for monitoring improvement in workers' performance. The improved LC assumes that the manual work time of the specific unit converges to a nonzero constant rather than zero under a large number of repetitions. It also takes into account the influence of workers' prior experience and machinery in the learning process. An improved line-of-balance (LOB) model is then presented by integrating the proposed LC and a mechanism of resource allocation. The proposed LOB model can make use of the learning effect to minimize the total resource usage of a project, while meeting the requirements for work continuity and the target deadline of each activity. An illustrative example has been cited to demonstrate the capability of the model. The technique can help planners use the learning effect to get a more realistic and optimal schedule about resource utilization. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Hallowell, MR; Calhoun, ME				Hallowell, Matthew R.; Calhoun, Matthew E.			Interrelationships among Highly Effective Construction Injury Prevention Strategies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Risk management	IMPACT; SAFETY; DELPHI	Preventing injuries to workers is essential to effective organizational management in the construction industry. It is generally accepted that achieving a high level of safety performance requires the implementation of an effective safety program. In an effort to provide guidance for the development of an effective safety program, previous studies have focused on identifying highly effective injury prevention strategies and quantifying their individual impacts on safety performance. Despite these advancements in knowledge, the synergistic interrelationships among highly effective injury prevention strategies remain unknown. The objective of this paper is to describe the results of a Delphi study that quantified the interrelationships (i.e., pairwise cross impacts) of highly effective and commonly implemented injury prevention strategies. Analysis of the data indicates that the site safety manager, worker participation and involvement, a site-specific safety plan, and upper management support and commitment are the most central elements in an effective program. It is expected that the results of this study can be used by practicing professionals when designing a new safety program, enhancing an existing program, or conducting economic analyses of safety-related investments.

We apply a coordination theory perspective to analyze the structure of project activities by utilizing a tandem queueing model to study the length of activity structures in relation to the time and the cost of task processing. We identify structures that balance the tradeoffs between productivity, handoffs, and waiting time. In particular, we seek to better understand the conditions where a task assigned to a single worker should be split into two or more serial activities. A heuristic is developed that considers the tradeoffs and determines the number of workers and subactivities into which an assigned task in a project should be subdivided. We suggest practical applications of the model and provide guidance as to the length of the activity structures within real world settings. Our findings suggest that in many cases tasks should be treated as a single activity node but that there are conditions under which it is beneficial to utilize a tandem structure of two or even more subactivity nodes.

Hence, the bolting cabin helps construction workers to assemble bolts safely. In order to automatically assemble bolts to steel frame, the bolting cabin must estimate bolt-hole location. To do this, precise bolt-hole detection algorithms are important Generally, a 2D camera is used for visual servoing in industrial fields. However, a construction site is an outdoor environment that does not have constant illumination. Recently, a 3D camera that provides depth images has been used in industrial fields. However, this 3D camera provides a low resolution image with strong noise around the edges. To overcome these problems, an edge detection filter that is robust to strong noise is needed for precise bolt-hole detection. Therefore, we propose a Modified Discrete Gaussian-Hermite Moments (MDGHM) filter based on moment information to detect edges precisely. Using the MDGHM filter, the results show that the proposed method can be effectively applied to bolt-hole detection better than wavelet filter and mixed matching method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bowen, P; Govender, R; Edwards, P; Cattell, K; Street, A				Bowen, Paul; Govender, Rajen; Edwards, Peter; Cattell, Keith; Street, Abigail			Factors Determining South African Construction Workers' Prejudice towards and Discrimination against HIV plus Persons	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS); Construction workers; Stigma; Prejudice; Discrimination; Fear of testing; Predictive modeling; Labor and personnel issues	AIDS-RELATED STIGMA; RISK SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; CAPE-TOWN; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; HIV/AIDS; KNOWLEDGE; MEN; PREVALENCE; DEPRESSION; INFECTION	Stigma and fear of discrimination are powerful deterrents against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing. Prejudice and discrimination against people living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are deterrents to their willingness to disclose their status and thereby avail themselves of treatment. Stigma impairs employees' general well-being, affecting their work capacity, and thus directly impacting upon project management success. Little is known about construction workers' prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons, and the determinants thereof. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Following bivariate and regression analyses of the survey response data, a structural equations model comprising demographic factors, lifestyle risk, substance use (alcohol consumption and drug use), knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and attitudinal fear of testing is posited to explain prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. The results indicate the following: (1) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudinal fear of testing, and prejudice towards HIV+ persons are determinants of discrimination against HIV+ persons; (2) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and attitudinal fear of testing are determinants of prejudice towards HIV+ persons; (3) AIDS knowledge is predicted by level of education and ethnicity; and (4) attitudinal fear of testing is predicted by level of education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and extent of risky lifestyle. The research confirms current knowledge about the multivariate determination of prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. It advances this understanding by identifying and emphasizing the central role played by education and subject-specific information in such determination. Specifically, it offers a clearer picture of the direct influence of educational background and AIDS knowledge in determining both the cognitive dimension of prejudice and the behavioral manifestation of this through discrimination. This has clear implications for construction firms in their efforts at HIV/AIDS intervention management. As much of this AIDS knowledge is determined by cultural beliefs and values, there exists the need to design programs that directly and sensitively address these cultural beliefs and their likely impact on prejudice and discrimination. Likewise, prior education is also critical, both in terms of amplifying or mitigating the impact of cultural beliefs and in terms of the potential comprehension by workers of such structured media and awareness campaigns. Failure to account for these two factors and their influence on cognition and behavior would result in interventions of diminished impact and success. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Badawy, M; Hussein, A; Elseufy, SM; Alnaas, K				Badawy, Mohamed; Hussein, Ayman; Elseufy, Sara M.; Alnaas, Khaled			How to predict the rebar labours' production rate by using ANN model?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural network (ANN); influencing factors; production rate; rebar workers; regression; relative importance index		Production rates are considered as an essential aspect of construction industry because they are the indicators of the productivity efficiency of construction sector. However, there is a gap in identifying factors affecting rebar workers and their production rate. This study tries to bridge this gap by developing a neural network model for estimating rebar labour's production rates. A questionnaire has been distributed and statistical software program was used to analyze the collected data. Two methods were used for analysis. The first depends on relative importance index, whereas the second depends on the probability and the impact. The results indicate that 'project type' is the most important factor affecting the productivity. A model was estimated to predict rebar labours' productivity. Reliable values have been successfully predicted by artificial neural network. This article presents a software program, which is used to measure the production rate (Output) based on the data provided in the form of factors affecting the rebar labour (Input). This helps to measure productivity growth in a low-cost residential building. In addition, it supports fundamentals building by predicting the production rate of rebar labour, to establish a database for executed projects in the future to develop productivity estimation process.

J	Li, H; Luo, XC; Skitmore, M				Li, Heng; Luo, Xiaochun; Skitmore, Martin			Intelligent Hoisting with Car-Like Mobile Robots	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Intelligent hoisting; Car-like mobile robots; Visual object detection; Deep learning	CONSTRUCTION SITES; VISION; SYSTEM; PREFABRICATION; DESIGN; HOOK; RECOGNITION; SIMULATION; AUTOMATION; BUILDINGS	The construction industry's traditional hoisting system always needs workers to complete the tasks involved, with concomitant extra labor costs and attention to the workers' safety. This paper describes the development of an intelligent hoisting system to optimize the hoisting process, involving the application of robotic cars and vision-based recognition. In the design of the hoisting system, electric hooks were used and maneuvered by a robotic car while the vision-based recognition system-based on capturing images by the camera-arranges the robotic motion. The Yolo v2 recognition algorithm was used, which provides fast and efficient vision-based recognition. More than 30 trials in an experimental prefabrication factory indicated that the system had a significant success rate of approximately 92.5% (3.7/4)-the proportion of hooks successfully grappling the hoist points-verifying the feasibility of the system. The primary contribution of this paper is in the development and demonstration of an intelligent hoisting system to optimize the hoisting process, involving the application of robotic cars and vision-based recognition, thus furthering the application of computer vision techniques and robotics to construction work.

The study is aimed at examining the effects of the IoT on construction project performance with the view of increasing productivity and efficiency. Quantitative research method was adopted and questionnaires were structured on a five-point Likert scale to elicit the opinion of respondents. Descriptive and Inferential analysis were used in analyzing the retrieved data. The most important effects of IoT are security and privacy, collecting previous data, safety comfort and efficiency. Factor analysis was used to group the various impacts of IoT into six. The results showed that there were nine variables with a significant difference while the others ten are not. It was concluded that the IoT adoption has a high influence on the security, privacy, safety, productivity and performance of construction workers. It is recommended that variables with least influenced areas can be developed by improving the skills of professionals. Government is also encouraged to adopt the principles of IoT not only in construction but other sectors to improve the economy of the nation.

Factors affecting construction labour productivity: a case study of Jordan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction industry; Jordan; labour productivity; factor analysis; construction labour	CRAFT WORKERS; PERCEPTIONS; PROJECTS	Improving productivity in construction is a way of increasing profit with little or no increase in cost. Labour productivity in construction in developing countries, including Jordan, is relatively low and needs to be improved significantly. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyse the factors that affect construction labour productivity. To achieve this goal, a questionnaire survey containing 27 questions (variables) was conducted. It was sent to 200 engineers and foremen who work for contractors. The 90 returned responses were statistically analysed by calculating the average, standard deviation, and RII of each variable. The results of a Spearman correlationrankcoefficient test showed that no significant differences existed between the responses of the engineers and foremen. It was concluded that the top three ranked dimensions were Productivity increases as experience increases', Financial incentives increase productivity', and Trust and communications between management and workers increase productivity'. Furthermore, the data was analysed using the principal components method of factor analysis. Of the 11 extracted factors, only five were considered, while the others were dropped since the observed variables had low loadings on these factors. Contractors and officials can benefit from this study in understanding factors affecting productivity, and act upon that understanding.

J	Wongwai, N; Malaikrisanachalee, S				Wongwai, Narongrit; Malaikrisanachalee, Suphawut			Augmented heuristic algorithm for multi-skilled resource scheduling	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Project scheduling; Multi-skilled resource; Resource management; Resource allocation; Project management	OPTIMIZATION	Conventional project scheduling is restricted to single-skilled resource assumption where each worker is assumed to have only one skill. This, in effect, contradicts real-world practice where workers may possess multiple skills and, on several occasions, are assigned to perform tasks for which they are not specialized. Past research has shown a simple process of heuristic approach for multi-skilled resource scheduling where a project is planned under the assumption that each resource can have more than one skill and resource substitution is allowed. Nevertheless, the approach has presented resource substitution step where an activity with higher priority can claim any resource regardless of its concurrent activities' resource requirements. Furthermore, the approach is subjected to all-or-nothing resource assignment concept where an activity cannot start and resources are not needed for that activity at all unless the required resources of that activity can be completely fulfilled. This research presents an alternative heuristic approach for multi-skilled resource scheduling in an attempt to improve the resource substitution approach. Augmented resource substitution rule and resource-driven task duration are presented to increase starting opportunity of activities on earlier time. Case studies are presented to illustrate the improved result of shorter project duration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, Q; Jin, RY				Chen, Qian; Jin, Ruoyu			Multilevel Safety Culture and Climate Survey for Assessing New Safety Program	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety culture; Safety climate; Safety program; Focus 4 Hazards	MANAGEMENT; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	Construction safety culture is becoming a typical proactive safety performance measurement and strategy for safety improvement. However, there is no accepted industry wide definition for safety culture. There is also no clear distinction between safety culture and safety climate. So far, little research has investigated how safety programs can be developed to improve safety culture and climate, which in turn can be used to assess the effectiveness of these programs. This paper presents a study that examined the multilevel safety culture and climate to assess a newly launched safety program. Specifically, three different questionnaires were used to survey 71 top executives, 229 site management personnel, and 350 field workers, respectively. This study found wide acceptance of the program across all three groups, strong management accountability in enforcing safety, and a positive general safety climate among workers. The results demonstrated the program's overall effectiveness in building positive safety culture and climate despite a few identified weaknesses. Based on these findings and insightful employee feedback, this paper offers generalized recommendations to help industry practitioners develop high-quality safety programs. The presented survey instruments and analysis methods can also be used to holistically assess safety programs and related safety culture and climate. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Low performance of labour has been a major impediment to productivity improvement in many developing countries. This study aims to develop a guide model to train labourers through systematic approaches at construction sites. Both qualitative and quantitative research approaches were adopted to identify the significant knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of labourers affecting the productivity of construction activities. Meetings, discussions, workshops and surveys were conducted among construction experts to develop the training guide model based on the identified critical KSAs, and the industry's current practices and future needs. The guide model includes a set of labour training exercises with relative weights, delivery methods, assessment guidelines, performance score systems, worker grading scheme and training reinforcement practices. The developed model will be very useful to the skill development authorities and training providers for their training and curriculum development process. The study outcomes can be significant to the industry to upgrade its practices related to technology education, literacy, work-integrated learning and skills sets development. Although the scope of the study has been limited to the Sri Lankan context, the findings may also be tested in other developing countries.

The growing challenges faced by the construction industry related to skill shortage, aging problem, and workforce attraction, retention, and buy-in have added to technical complexities of workforce planning. Nevertheless, the available workforce planning techniques are either qualitative or lack a strategic perspective that accounts for the above challenges in hiring workforce, leading to suboptimal decisions with regards to hiring and unplanned firing. This paper proposes a novel framework for optimization of hiring and firing decisions by accounting simultaneously for organizational human resource (HR) strategies, labor rights, and technical and managerial constraints of a construction project. The framework starts by setting the model parameters and the decision-making criteria using the information made available by building information modeling (BIM), project performance database, and contractual and legislative documents. It then identifies the optimal mode and duration of the employment for the workers with different skills, skill levels, and multiskilling capabilities using a dynamic programming algorithm. The application and advantages of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a case study.

J	Feng, YB; Wu, P; Ye, G; Zhao, D				Feng, Yingbin; Wu, Peng; Ye, Gui; Zhao, Dong			Risk-Compensation Behaviors on Construction Sites: Demographic and Psychological Determinants	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Workplace safety; Risk compensation; Risk perception; Safety behavior	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; SAFETY PERFORMANCE; PAST BEHAVIOR; WORK BEHAVIOR; FOOD-SAFETY; INVESTMENTS; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; FUTURE; HABIT	Risk-compensation behavior refers to the riskier behavior resulting from the perception that the environment has become safer. This study aims to investigate the role of demographics and psychological constructs in predicting construction workers' tendencies to engage in risk-compensation behaviors. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The participants include 88 roof tilers in New South Wales, Australia. By using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique with partial least-squares estimation (PLS), the authors found that workers' tendencies to engage in risk-compensation behaviors are influenced by both demographics (e.g., work experience, education level, and negative safety experience) and psychological constructs (e.g., optimism, internal locus of control, trait worry, and habit), and that the effects of demographics were mediated by the psychological constructs. The findings imply that overconfidence about own capability and perceived power of control over safety issues may encourage risk-compensation behaviors on construction sites. The structural model developed in this study may help people to understand the important mental processes that may influence potential behavioral changes when people perceive that they are more protected.

A review of international safety regulations suggest that lack of oxygen and temperature extremes contribute to make these work environments hazardous. Building Information Modeling (BIM) platform has the potential to provide improved visualization for effective monitoring of confined spaces on construction sites. In an attempt to reduce Health and Safety (H&S) hazards, this work reports upon an integrated solution based on BIM and wireless sensor technology. A literature review has led to conceptualize a model for a BIM based technology application. This was later shaped into a scenario through industry feedback followed by a prototype development as a proof of concept. The prototype system uses BIM to present data received from wireless sensors placed at confined spaces on a construction site. Industry feedback on the prototype indicates that the proposed solution will facilitate intelligent monitoring of confined spaces through real-time sensor data to avoid time sensitive emergency situations typically encountered by workers operating in such work environments.

J	Yang, K; Ahn, CR; Kim, H				Yang, Kanghyeok; Ahn, Changbum R.; Kim, Hyunsoo			Validating ambulatory gait assessment technique for hazard sensing in construction environments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article							LOCAL DYNAMIC STABILITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL PARAMETERS; TREE ANALYSIS; FALLS; INJURIES; FATALITIES; CLEARANCE; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; TRIPS	Wearable sensing technology offers the opportunity to collect an individual's physical response data in occupational settings; recent studies highlight the usefulness of such data for safety management on a construction site. The authors previously studied a worker's gait movements (measured by Wearable Inertial Measurement Units, WIMUs), providing evidence for the pertinence of collecting workers' gait information to identify fall hazards in a steelwork environment. However, gait parameter measurement accuracy has not been examined in settings with different walk-path conditions and hazards, like those in construction environments. To address this knowledge gap, this study evaluates the accuracy of a WIMU-based gait parameter measurement and examines each gait parameter's ability to distinguish hazardous conditions. Data collection was performed in a laboratory environment with both a WIMU-based system and a marker-based motion tracking system (i.e., the reference system). The presented WIMU-based approach resulted in a 6.48 mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in a non-hazard condition and manifested comparable performance for distinguishing hazardous environments compared to the reference motion tracking system. The results of this study indicate the validity of an ambulatory gait parameter measurement and demonstrate an opportunity to measure changes in gait parameter values caused by hazards.

J	Andersen, LPS; Grytnes, R				Andersen, Lars Peter Sonderbo; Grytnes, Regine			Different ways of perceiving risk and safety on construction sites and implications for safety cooperation	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction sites; perceptions of safety and risk; safety management; qualitative study; safety rules		Construction is a dangerous industry when it comes to workplace injuries, and workers' unsafe behaviour accounts for 80-90% of the injuries. How risk is perceived by individuals and groups affects safety behaviour, and this study examined how different occupational groups on construction sites perceived safety and risk and how these perceptions influenced behaviours and practices related to safety cooperation. Over a period of 4 months, 36 semi-structured interviews and 36 days of observations were carried out with different occupational groups at two construction sites. The results showed that a rational way of perceiving safety and risks was most prominent among project managers, whereas an intuitive way of perceiving safety and risks was prominent among workers. Furthermore, foremen at the two sites voiced a perception of safety and risk that was 'in between' these two approaches. The results also showed that the differences in perceptions of risk and safety had implications for safety cooperation at the sites which arguably lead to unsafe safety behaviour/practice. Acknowledging and integrating different perceptions of risk and safety could be a valuable starting point for construction safety management and could improve cooperation about safety.

J	Maalek, R; Sadeghpour, F				Maalek, Reza; Sadeghpour, Farnaz			Accuracy assessment of ultra-wide band technology in locating dynamic resources in indoor scenarios	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology; Accuracy/reliability assessment of dynamic resources; Safety management, automated construction site safety monitoring; Real-Time Location Estimation Systems (RTLS)	TIME SAFETY MANAGEMENT; WORKSPACE GENERATION; SYSTEM	The use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in reporting the real-time location of resources (workers and equipment) is shown to be effective in improving the current safety monitoring practices. Since many site accidents occur when workers are struck by moving equipment or enter hazard-prone areas, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the UWB RTLS in estimating the location of dynamic resources on construction sites. In this paper, the effects of variables, such as "speed" and "heading", on the accuracy of the estimated location of dynamic tags are investigated. It is shown that the accuracy is inversely proportionate to the speed of the tag, the number of tags being tracked and the complexity of the path on which the tag is moving. A novel approach to defining "danger zones" on construction sites is also proposed through which the feasibility of using static tags to define the boundaries of forbidden areas on site is validated. The findings of this study indicate the applicability of UWB in locating dynamic resources on construction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mental Ill-Health Risk Factors in the Construction Industry: Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Mental ill health; Risk factor; Systematic review; Construction workers	MALE-DOMINATED INDUSTRIES; ANXIETY STRESS SCALES; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; SUICIDE-PREVENTION; WHOOLEY QUESTIONS; DEPRESSION SCALE; FAMILY CONFLICT; EVENT SCALE; ALCOHOL-USE; WORK	Mental ill health is a significant cause of suicide and disability worldwide. It has particularly affected the construction industry. The construction labor sectors in Australia and the United Kingdom have suicide rates 2 and 3.7 times higher, respectively, than their overall national averages, which has attracted the attention of researchers and the industry. However, few studies have examined the state of construction workers' mental health. This paper systematically reviews the existing body of knowledge on mental health in the construction industry. In total, 16 journal articles met inclusion criteria, and 32 risk factors (RFs) were deduced. The foremost RFs were related to job demand and job control. A conceptual framework and checklist to aid in better understanding these RFs were developed. In assessing mental health, the primary tool used was the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The findings of this study help to deepen the understanding of professional mental health assessment scales and relevant RFs and protective factors as used in the construction industry. The study concludes that stronger methodologies are needed for studies into RFs and protective factors in the construction industry.	[Chan, Albert P.

At present, it is unclear if and to what extent construction safety risk tolerance vary across broad geographic regions. To better understand patterns in these sociocultural constructs, a survey of building trade contractors and subcontractors was administered. Using principal component analysis and K-means clustering, the determinants of risk tolerance were analyzed for 11,997 construction workers from 17 countries via controlled sampling for equal representation. The analysis showed that risk tolerance is influenced and linked by individual and sociocultural determinants, i.e., affective associations, control beliefs, safety culture, and risk-taking attitudes. Differences and distinct groupings were observed when the derived global risk tolerance scores were compared to country-specific risk-tolerance scores. This study contributes to the literature by empirically identifying determinants of risk tolerance and quantifying cross-cultural disparities in risk tolerance. It was found that the natural grouping of countries, based on their risk-tolerance determinants, coincides with their ancestral heritage and socioeconomic systems. The results can be used to inform policymakers, stakeholders, safety professionals, and industry leaders to improve safety decisions in the workplace, promote strong situational awareness, design structural policies, and implement safety programs.

The skills and competency of human resources contribute considerably to the competitive advantage of the firm. Yet the skill shortage problem encourages utilizing strategies that bring more flexibility to workforce management. Multiskilling has been suggested as a potential strategy that assists workforce assignment across multiple projects. However, it brings new challenges for company workforce managers. This study contributes to the construction project management body of knowledge by proposing a simulation framework for assigning multiskilled, mainly managerial, workforces across multiple projects of one company. Meanwhile, it is a combination of a staffng and scheduling decision model, incorporating workers' competency status. A cohesive mathematical model using the cost objective function optimizes the entire allocation process toward minimizing resource usage and fluctuations, minimizing costs, and maximizing social sustainability. Ultimately, a validation example incorporating diverse workers' competency data is provided to exemplify how the optimization model performs in an academic setting compared with three commonly used methods in workforce assignment. This approach provides insight into simulating workforce assignments across multiple projects regarding competency. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The Forecasting and Impact of the Loss of Critical Human Skills Necessary for Supporting Legacy Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS); legacy systems; life-cycle cost; obsolescence; organizational forgetting; workforce management; workforce planning	OBSOLESCENCE; MAINTENANCE	The loss of critical human skills that are either non-replenishable or take very long periods of time to reconstitute impacts the support of legacy systems ranging from infrastructure, military, and aerospace to information technology. Many legacy systems must be supported for long periods of time because they are prohibitively expensive to replace. Loss of critical human skills is a problem for legacy system support organizations as they try to understand and mitigate the effects of an aging workforce with highly specialized low-demand skill sets. Existing literature focuses on workers that have skills that are obsolete and therefore need to be retrained to remain employable; alternatively, this paper addresses the system support impacts due to the lack of workers with the required skill set. This paper develops a model for forecasting the loss of critical human skills and the impact of that loss on the future cost of system support. The model can be used to support business cases for system replacement. A detailed case study of a legacy control system from the chemical manufacturing industry is provided and managerial insights associated with the support of the system drawn.

The comprehensive risk assessment model is capable of assessing nine safety indicators, which can be categorised into workers' behaviour, environment and machine-related safety indicators, and the model is embedded in the safety prewarning system. The safety prewarning system can automatically extract safety information from surveillance cameras based on computer vision, assess risks based on the embedded comprehensive risk assessment model, categorise risks into five levels and provide timely suggestions. Design/methodology/approach Firstly, the comprehensive risk assessment model is constructed by adopting grey multihierarchical analysis method. The method combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the grey clustering evaluation in the grey theory. Expert knowledge, obtained through the questionnaire approach, contributes to set weights of risk indicators and evaluate risks. Secondly, a safety prewarning system is developed, including data acquisition layer, data processing layer and prewarning layer. Computer vision is applied in the system to automatically extract real-time safety information from the surveillance cameras. The safety information is then processed through the comprehensive risk assessment model and categorized into five risk levels. A case study is presented to verify the proposed mechanism. Findings Through a case study, the result shows that the proposed mechanism is capable of analyzing integrated human-machine-environment risk, timely categorising risks into five risk levels and providing potential suggestions. Originality/value The comprehensive risk assessment model is capable of assessing nine risk indicators, identifying three types of entities, workers, environment and machine on the construction site, presenting the integrated risk based on nine indicators. The proposed mechanism, which adopts expert knowledge through Building Information Modeling (BIM) safety simulation and extracts safety information based on computer vision, can perform a dynamic real-time risk analysis, categorize risks into five risk levels and provide potential suggestions to corresponding risk owners. The proposed mechanism can allow the project manager to take timely actions.

Advancing Women in Construction: Gender Differences in Attraction and Retention Factors with Managers in the Electrical Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Women; Construction management; Electrical construction; Recruiting	FEMALE	Representing half of the workforce, women have been consistently underrepresented in the construction industry. Unlike other fields that have improved upon the lack of diversity, construction remains one of the most male-dominated fields in the United States. The ever increasing demand for workers is breaking down the unique barriers that women have faced. Though these barriers still exist, efforts to attract and retain women in the construction industry are improving. This study aims to investigate the factors that are most influential in attracting women to and retaining them in management careers in the construction industry. A funded research study with ELECTRI International provided support to identify the attraction and retention factors for women working in management positions in the electrical construction industry. A web-based survey was distributed throughout the nation and collected the perceptions and experiences of managerial-level workers in the electrical industry. In total, 686 managers responded to the survey, 71 of whom were women. Upon testing of the data, significant differences emerged in the influence of factors in attracting and retaining women versus men. These findings contribute to the industry's understanding of advancing women in the construction industry. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Park, MW; Elsafty, N; Zhu, ZH				Park, Man-Woo; Elsafty, Nehad; Zhu, Zhenhua			Hardhat-Wearing Detection for Enhancing On-Site Safety of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Occupational safety; Imaging techniques; Automatic identification systems; Information technologies	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Construction is one of the most dangerous job sectors, which annually reports tens of thousands of time-loss injuries and deaths. These injuries and deaths do not only bring suffering to the workers and their families, but also incur delays and costs to the projects. Therefore, safety is an important issue that a general contractor must monitor and control. One of the fundamental safety regulations is wearing a hardhat, which should not be violated anytime on the sites. In this paper, a novel vision-based method is proposed to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhats on the construction sites. Under the method, human bodies and hardhats are first detected in the video frames captured by on-site construction cameras. Then, the matching between the detected human bodies and hardhats is performed using their geometric and spatial relationship. This way, the people who are not wearing hardhats could be automatically identified and safety alerts could be issued correspondingly. The method has been tested with real site videos. The high safety alert precision and recall of the method demonstrate its potential to facilitate the site safety monitoring work. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Sopite syndrome in wind-excited buildings: productivity and wellbeing impacts	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building motion; indoor environmental quality; market failure; serviceability criteria; sopite syndrome; tall buildings; wellbeing; wind; work performance	SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; LOW-FREQUENCY NOISE; MOTION SICKNESS; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; ACCELERATION; ENVIRONMENT; MODULATION; VIBRATION	Tall buildings vibrate in response to strong winds at frequencies below 1Hz, which can cause motion sickness and sopite syndrome in humans. Sopite syndrome is characterized by sleepiness, low motivation and low mood that can reduce productivity in office workers. This paper uses recent multidisciplinary research to estimate the cost of building motion on organizations in tall buildings, and provides a framework for future research. The potential costs of wind-induced building motion to organizations are highly variable, depending on the local weather climate, but are likely to be significant in the long-term. It is argued that wind-induced building motion is a negative externality, a cost of inadequate design passed to building users. A three-factor approach towards reducing adverse impacts of wind-induced building motion is discussed: (1) further research investigating the characteristics of motion that provoke sopite syndrome, (2) create a new generation of serviceability criteria, and (3) regulations setting the maximum acceptable motion dose for office workers. This three-factor approach will likely produce comprehensive, yet usable, guidelines to develop strategies that reduce the adverse effects of motion on occupants in both new and existing buildings.

So the major consideration is ensuring workers safety during construction in Bangladesh. As current practice of Bangladesh checks the construction safety manually, this checking process always leads to error-prone, inconsistency in assessments and delays the construction process as a whole. The aim of this study is to develop an automated fall safety checking system using BIM to solve this problem in the Bangladeshi context. A framework is developed and safety rule checking approach is illustrated during conceptual and legal stage and how these process works in two situations is proposed to identify fall hazard at planning phase. A case study is performed to illustrate its practical implementation on a building project in Bangladesh. Results show that the developed system demonstrates the feasibility of integrating safety into BIM for detecting and eliminating fall-related hazards. This study will contribute the construction professionals by introducing and informing automated safety checking platform to find the reports, why, where, when, and what safety measures are needed for preventing fall-related accidents at pre-construction phase. The significance of this study is to lead to safer designs early in a project.

J	Williams, CC; Kayaoglu, A				Williams, Colin C.; Kayaoglu, Aysegul			Explaining the supply of home repair and renovation services in the undeclared economy: lessons from Europe	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Informal economy; tax compliance; tax evasion; construction sector; Europe		Three competing theories have been used to explain participation in the undeclared economy. A structuralist perspective asserts that workers are pushed into undeclared work because of their "exclusion" from the declared economy. Two alternative theoretical perspectives assert that undeclared operators voluntarily "exit" the declared economy. Neo-liberals depict undeclared workers as rational economic actors and institutional theorists represent them more as social actors who disagree with the formal rules. To evaluate these competing theories in relation to the supply of undeclared home repair and renovation services, data are reported from a 2019 Eurobarometer survey involving 27,565 face-to-face interviews in 28 European countries. The finding is that 9.4% did so solely due to their exclusion from declared work. 19.8% participated purely for reasons associated with the rational economic actor perspective and 28.6% only for motives associated with the social actor perspective. 42.2% did so for a mixture of motives. Using probit regression analysis, the characteristics of those supplying undeclared home repair and renovation services and doing so for each rationale are revealed. The theoretical outcome is a call to view these perspectives not as competing but complementary. The policy outcome is to reveal the different policy initiatives required to tackle each of the rationales for supplying undeclared home repair and renovation services.

J	Moon, S; Bernold, LE				Moon, S; Bernold, LE			Vision-based interactive path planning for robotic bridge paint removal	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MANIPULATORS	Since the 1970s, the toxic lead content in old paints has become a significant health concern. The common approach used in removing corroded paint for bridge paint maintenance relies on manual operation of blast nozzles by workers within a large containment enclosure installed around the blast area. The robotic bridge paint removal (RBPR) system was developed as a safe alternative method in the Construction Automation and Robotics Laboratory (CARL) at North Carolina State University. The goal of this project was to build and field test a prototype system that can increase the safety of workers and the public as well as protect the natural environment against toxic pollution. This paper presents a vision-based interactive control technology that was developed to support the telerobotic operation of bridge paint removal. The control method allows the operator to visually inspect the steel beam surface via a video camera and to interactively define the corroded area using a cursor. Subsequently, a motion path is automatically generated for a robot arm holding a blast nozzle to spot-clean the paint. The robot arm in turn moves the nozzle to the required position within the blast area and executes abrasive blasting. Field experiments demonstrated that the vision-based graphic interface provides an effective human-machine interface with sufficient flexibility for the robotic bridge paint removal in construction.

Against this background, this research, firstly, aims to investigate the effectiveness of safety training for construction personnel in Hong Kong. A questionnaire is designed to explore the efficacy and weaknesses of mandatory basic safety training. The results indicate the inadequate knowledge of the concept of personal protective equipment as the main weakness of the workers. Secondly, to overcome the training weakness, an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based innovative safety model is designed to provide real-time monitoring of construction site personnel and environment. The proposed model not only identifies real-time personnel safety problems, i.e., near misses, to reduce the accident rates but also stores the digital data to improve future training and system itself. The proposed model in this research provides a cost-effective solution for optimal construction safety to the stakeholders. A cost comparison analysis suggests that the IoT system can provide 1) 78% cost-savings with respect to the traditional manual system and 2) 65% cost-savings with respect to the traditional sensor system.

As a mature economy in Asia, Hong Kong is experiencing the same grim situation. This paper identifies different generations' perceptions of freedom-related work values in the construction sector in Hong Kong. Opinion surveys were conducted to identify how construction workers, trainees, and high school students would view a "No-Saturday-Site-Work" policy. This initiative was proposed to address the acute labor shortage and aging problems. Logistic regression was used. It was found that the younger generation places more emphasis on having Saturday off than on money. Although older construction workers tend to have more concerns over income, younger construction trainees would want to see the initiative implemented. For high school students, age has an indirect but strong effect on their perception of the initiative through the variable of whether they plan to join the industry. The case of Hong Kong illustrates the need to know what the younger generations want before effective recruitment strategies and policies can be devised. The authors' results would provide the industry worldwide with some insights into addressing the aging labor problem. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Especially, in an environment where multiple, often geographically dispersed, teams of workers are involved, it becomes imperative that the information be generated in optimally balanced distributions of project resources, so that it can be disseminated and reused efficiently. We introduce in this study a model to address this problem. The model is validated by formulating its structure on the essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain. To simulate development situations where creative human endeavor is more emphasized than automated applications of routine procedures, we use a set of human-centered input decision variables and examine the optimal output production relative to their dynamics and control. Our model is not tied to the characteristics of any individual project per se but can be easily modified and generalized to address other allied types of production situations. Simulations are performed for a variety of practical decision-making scenarios. Our results suggest that workers' contextual work experience, interactions, and background learning all govern production optimality, although nonuniformly in distinct temporal domains of development.

A review of this literature reveals that even though the approaches are used for the same goal of predicting future safety outcomes, they are modeled independently and exclusively from one another. To organize thinking in safety prediction, the literature is organized into four operationally-defined predictive families: (1) safety risk assessment, which considers the characteristics and dangers of the work; (2) precursor analysis, which considers the conditions of the workers; (3) leading indicators, which consider the quantity of safety management activities; and (4) safety climate assessments, which considers worker perceptions of safety. Additionally, a unified model is proposed where the four families are considered together and opportunities for synergy and cross-validation are exploited. Researchers may benefit from this model as they create points of departure, propose and test novel approaches, and attempt to contextualize their findings within the existing body of literature. Furthermore, practitioners may use the model to make more accurate and robust safety predictions that account for the interconnectedness of the work attributes, human resources, and management strategies that affect safety.

Structural Equation Modeling for Relationship-Based Determinants of Safety Performance in Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety performance; Safety climate; Safety budget; Safety rules and regulations; Work behavior; Structural equation modeling (SEM); India	CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE; FRAMEWORK; VALIDITY; BEHAVIOR	Safety performance in construction projects is attributed to many determinants (factors) in a safety system. This study identifies various directly or indirectly related determinants and their effects on safety performance of construction projects. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), this study empirically examines the effect of safety climate (SC), hazard management (HM), safety budget (SB), safety rules and regulations (SR), and safe work behavior (WB) of employees and workers on safety performance (SP) of projects. The unit of analysis of this study is a construction project. A questionnaire survey was conducted, and 230 responses were collected from different types of construction projects across India. The results provide evidence that safety climate, safety budget, and hazard management positively influence safe work behavior of employees and the safety performance of the project. Conversely, the SEM findings demonstrate that implementation of safety rules and regulations are positively but weakly related to safe work behavior of employees, although they positively and more strongly influence the safety performance of the project. On the basis of these empirical results, the study advocates allocating a sufficient safety budget to Indian construction projects. It also recommends considering the effects of the safety rules and regulations on safe work behavior of employees and workers while framing and revising them.	[Patel, D.

It was found that the temperature dropped by 0.2-2.5K, with local humidity increasing by 5%. Ventilation air-exchange calculations indicate that in hot summer conditions, an 8-h shift could be continuously cooled without creating high humidity, recovering to initial values after 16 h of ventilation at 0.3 ach. The cooling effect of the mist and fan was measured and compared with that of the fan. The mist and fan-cooling effect exceeded 100W/m(2) in all cases, while the mist and fan cooling exceeded the fan alone by 18W/m(2) on average, 24W/m(2) at the peak values and 11W/m(2) average during oscillation. The ASHRAE 55-2013 model is modified to include this additional cooling. Standard effective temperatures (SETs) are calculated with and without the mist fan-cooling effect. Linear approximations for reduction in SET were developed as a function of air temperature and mist-cooling effect. The deployment of this technology would improve thermal comfort for factory workers on hot summer days.

Zoning divides the lifting demand into several vertical clusters of floors and assigns a group of lifts for each cluster. Although zoning has great potential in minimizing the vertical transportation time, it is challenging to derive an optimal zoning configuration for the construction of high-rise buildings because lifting demand can vary significantly with construction progress. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a simulation model that can assist in determining the optimal zoning configuration under varying lifting demand. Application of the model to a high-rise residential building project shows that lifting demand-based zoning can reduce the vertical transportation time by about 40%. Based on this, it is concluded that the model has a great potential to minimize workers' idle time and increase labor productivity. This paper is of relevance to researchers with respect to the development of a mathematical model that can identify the optimal zoning configuration. This paper is also of value to practitioners in terms of providing an effective tool to optimize the vertical transportation plan in the construction of a high-rise building. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, J; Razavi, S				Wang, Jun; Razavi, Saiedeh			Two 4D Models Effective in Reducing False Alarms for Struck-by-Equipment Hazard Prevention	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction safety; Struck-by hazard; False alarm; Spatial interference; Four-dimensional (4D) models; Warning distance; Alert zone; Unsafe-proximity query rules	COLLISION DETECTION; CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY; GENERATION; AVOIDANCE; TRACKING; SAFETY	Over the past decade, several smart and automated systems have been developed to address the issue of struck-by hazards in constructionthat is, workers on foot struck by equipment or equipment struck by equipment. False alarms (false positives and false negatives) are common in such systems, but methods for limiting struck-by hazards have not yet been thoroughly studied or tested for real-world implementations. This study presents two novel four-dimensional (4D) [time and three-dimensional (3D) space] models, a time-sphere model and a time-cuboid model, that are effective in reducing the rate of false alarms. In each developed 4D model, (1)entities' state information, including 3D position, orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw), and velocity, is acquired and analyzed over time; and (2)the hazardous area around equipment or workers is represented by a sphere or a cuboid with the warning distance adjusted and updated according to the entities' collected state information; and (3)unsafe-proximity query rules identify and predict contact collisions using relative position, moving direction, speed, and a pairwise 3D unsafe-proximity query. The effectiveness of the developed 4D models was evaluated through simulation and field experiments; however, the data were not wirelessly communicated because the focus of the study was on development, analysis, and comparison of two models for safety hazard identification. The obtained false positive and false negative rates indicate that the two developed 4D models have a strong capability for reducing false alarms. The obtained reduced alarm percentages imply that on average 65% of the alarms triggered by the most prevalent method can be averted by using the time-sphere model and 81% can be reduced by using the time-cuboid model. Furthermore, three major categories of findings are summarized: model comparison, model analysis, and the relationship between alert zone dimensions and model performance. The developed rigorous 4D models can also be employed for several types of contact collision that involve temporal and permanent site facilities, materials transported in air, and equipment and workers on foot. Reduced false alarms will improve construction safety, productivity, and mobility.

Perceptions about Design for Construction Worker Safety: Viewpoints from Contractors, Designers, and University Facility Owners	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Accident prevention; Accidents; Construction industry; Design; Occupational safety; Owners; Safety; Project planning and design		Decisions made before construction can affect safety on the construction site, either positively or negatively. This was observed from past research that identified the link between design decisions and fatalities. The concept of implementing design decisions that positively affect safety falls under the general concept of prevention through design (PtD), which attempts to identify and mitigate hazards early in the design process to eliminate the risks of injury or damage during construction. Prevention through design is practiced in other countries, primarily through legislation. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a survey that was conducted to identify construction industry stakeholders' views on the concept of PtD and gauge the possibility for implementing PtD in the U.S. construction industry through either legislation or other means. Four distinct groups were surveyed: engineers, architects, contractors, and owners. Within this study, PtD was described and introduced to survey participants as design for construction worker safety (DCWS) to differentiate PtD efforts in construction from efforts in other industries. The survey consisted of questions that asked about the industry's knowledge of PtD and the extent of PtD practice in the United States, participants' opinions on designer and owner safety knowledge and perceptions, and obstacles and enablers for designer participation in construction safety. The responses from the various groups were compared to identify the groups that are more receptive to the idea of designer participation in construction worker safety. The results showed that architects were the least receptive to the idea, whereas the other groups were more likely to be supportive, with some hesitations. Architects and engineers identified the existence of economic, legal, and contractual obstacles for designers to practice DCWS, whereas contractors only identified economic obstacles. No enablers were identified by any group. The research contributes additional information that can be used by construction industry practitioners and organizations desiring to expand and optimize PtD implementation in the United States. The research results can be used by project teams to plan for PtD education and training efforts on projects and by construction industry organizations to develop PtD diffusion strategies.

Low False Alarm Rate Model for Unsafe-Proximity Detection in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Unsafe-proximity detection; State tracking; Safety rules; Distance quantifications; Construction	PREVENTION; TRACKING; SYSTEM; GPS	The research reported in this paper proposes and develops an unsafe-proximity detection model focused on decreasing false alarms. By considering three types of entity attributes [i.e.,(1)position, (2)heading/moving direction, and (3)speed], more accurate unsafe-proximity identifications with reduced false alarms can be achieved. The proposed and developed model works via two modules, as follows: (1)state tracking module, and (2)safety rules module. The state tracking module collects construction entities' states (position, heading, and speed) in real time. The collected states information is analyzed in the safety rules module for unsafe-proximity identifications. Five common situations on construction jobsites are extracted and studied for the development of the safety rules, as follows: (1)static equipment and moving worker, (2)moving equipment and moving worker, (3)moving equipment and static worker, (4)two pieces of moving equipment, and (5)moving equipment and static equipment. The unsafe area around equipment is divided into alert and warning areas which are quantified using forklift as sample equipment. The localization accuracy of the state tracking module and the functional effectiveness of the safety rules module are evaluated, through simulation and a field experiment. Twelve scenarios and 13 subscenarios were designed and incorporated, in the simulation and the field experiment, respectively. The extended Kalman filter combined with the nearest-neighbor method was used in the simulation and a global positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial navigation system sensor was used in the field experiment as the state tracking module. The results suggest that the magnitude of localization accuracy of the extended Kalman filter combined with the nearest-neighbor method and the adopted sensor both are less than 0.7m. Such an accuracy level is acceptable for construction applications. Moreover, the developed safety rules have a strong capability in avoiding false alarms. In some scenarios the developed model can avoid one false alarm for each scan. The research reported in this paper also demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of implementing the model for real applications. The developed model has great promise to enhance construction safety and mobility by timely avoiding collisions, while reducing false alarms and interruptions to work.

Monitoring construction productivity is crucial for the construction project's success. Current practices for construction productivity monitoring are time-consuming, manned and error prone. Although previous studies have been implemented toward reducing these limitations, a gap still exists in the automated monitoring of construction productivity. Design/methodology/approach This study aims to investigate and assess the different techniques used for monitoring productivity in building construction projects. Therefore, a mixed review methodology (bibliometric analysis and systematic review) was adopted. All the related publications were collected from different databases, which were further screened to get the most relevant based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Findings A detailed review was performed, and it was found that traditional methods, computer vision-based and photogrammetry are the most adopted data acquisition for productivity monitoring of building projects, respectively. Machine learning algorithms (ANN, SVM) and BIM were integrated with monitoring tools and technologies to enhance the automated monitoring performance in construction productivity. Also, it was observed that current studies did not cover all the complex construction job sites and they were applied based on a small sample of construction workers and machines separately. Originality/value This review paper contributes to the literature on construction management by providing insight into different productivity monitoring techniques.

J	Hallowell, MR				Hallowell, Matthew R.			Safety-Knowledge Management in American Construction Organizations	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction; Safety; Knowledge; Management; Organizational learning	STRATEGIES; DESIGN	Despite improvements in safety performance over the past 30 years, the construction industry still accounts for an injury-and-illness rate that is approximately five times greater than the all-industry average. This disproportionate injury-and-illness rate has been attributed, in part, to the complex, dynamic, and transient nature of construction projects. To address these challenges, construction organizations must be able to adapt to change by effectively identifying, capturing, storing, and transferring safety knowledge. To investigate how safety-knowledge management strategies are employed in the construction industry, 11 case studies were conducted with a geographically dispersed sample of American general contractors. The sample was stratified by experience modification rate (EMR), a relative measure of safety performance. The results of the case studies indicate that construction organizations tend to acquire safety knowledge from a variety of internal and external sources, but have ineffective knowledge storage and transfer systems, which impede the ability of the workforce to obtain critical knowledge to solve urgent safety-related problems. High-performing organizations were distinguished by their ability to manage tacit safety knowledge with formal processes such as data-entry systems that capture reactions to safety situations from experienced workers and safety mentoring. Other innovative strategies include acquiring tacit safety knowledge during safety stand-downs through interviews with workers and storing safety knowledge in proprietary training videos.

Waste reduction through incentives: a case study	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction; construction waste; environment; green buildings; incentives; landfill; Hong Kong		To motivate construction workers to adopt a waste construction strategy, a reward scheme was implemented. A Stepwise Incentive System (SIS) was used to measure the cost save on purchasing material and controlling waste generation. The key difference of this method is that it harnesses employees' awareness on waste reduction by contributing incentive funding to staff involved in projects producing lower waste levels. The lower the waste, the higher the incentive. The effectiveness of the SIS is shown by using a local case study in which waste can be reduced by up to 23%.	[Tam, C.

Automation and robotics is regarded as a promising approach for enhancing the development of the industry, and the automatic operation of cranes, as an important aspect of construction, is attracting increasing attention. However, due to the complexity and dynamics of construction sites, it is difficult for cranes to automatically recognize and locate lifting objects (e.g., precast facades and partitions) on site. To solve this problem, an image based automated onsite object recognition approach for the automatic operation of cranes is developed in this study. This is a fusion of Faster-R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), Canny, Hough Transformation, Endpoint clustering analysis and Vertex-based Determining Model, to uniquely locate a lifting object with exact pose and extract its features (e.g., centroid coordinates, size, and color). Based on the extracted features, the lifting object can be retrieved in the database with the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format of BIM (Building Information Modeling) to obtain more features for the automatic operation of a crane. It is shown from a field experiment that the developed approach is workable and has the potential to support the automatic operation of cranes. This contributes a basic approach to the automatic operation of cranes and promotes the rapid development of construction automation and robotics.

Interviews were conducted with 59 construction workers based in Melbourne, Australia to explore how demands and resources were experienced. Using a systems framework, data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results identified two demand typologies associated with demand-to-demand interaction. Demands operating as influencers' have a major impact on the conditions of the interdependent demand, while demands operating as creators' generate a new demand and shape the conditions of that demand. One resource typology related to resource-demand interaction was identified. Enabling resources' enable an individual to manage multiple demands across multiple domains, and may also enable an individual to manage multiple demands within a single domain. A new conceptual contribution is made to an area in which theory is under-developed, by adopting a systems approach to understanding the dynamic interactions between demands and resources. A lack of fit is damaging for the individual; therefore, it is useful to know that demands and resources are interdependent and these interdependencies will vary according to individuals. Using a systems approach to understanding demands and resources will be helpful to organizations seeking to support workers to achieve optimal work-life fit.

Although it is well accepted that stressful work environments negatively impact on organisational and individual health indices and project construction produces some of the most severe work environments in the modern industrial landscape, the role of line managers in creating these environments is largely unknown. Healthy work environments are explored in this article because they contribute to the development of many behavioral' diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, both of which are known problems amongst construction workers. Qualitative data were collected from eighty project-based construction workers and mangers on six large civil engineering construction projects in Brisbane, Australia. Unanimous views were expressed by all interviewees that managers should not and do not influence food choices on-site. However, results also revealed clear examples of managers making decisions about food environments, work and time pressures and permitted and discouraged behaviours on-site that impact on food choices. These findings indicate limited awareness of healthy work environments in construction with the impact of management actions being largely unrecognised and unintended. It suggests with more informed management decision-making, eating habits in construction are likely to improve.

Design/methodology/approach - Structured interviews were conducted with nine construction project managers working in the commercial sector, and data were subject to thematic analysis. Findings - Role conditions were found to impact on participants' work-family interface, identified as working hours, accountability, and the stress arising from accountability. Participants identified four key strategies used to manage their work-family interface: managing work-based stress, having a supportive partner, prioritising non-work time for family, and trading off activities. Despite having to limit time with family and trade off social and leisure activities, participants did not report negative work-to-family spillover. All participants shared a passion for their work. Findings can be explained using the heavy worker investment model, which proposes that job devotion is linked to psychological well-being, decreases in work-family conflict (WFC), and work satisfaction. Originality/value - Contrary to previous research, findings suggest that construction project managers did not experience inter-role conflict between their work and family domains. It is recommended that further research explore these findings using the heavy work investment (HWI) framework which considers how internal and external predictors shape workers' behaviour, and whether HWI typologies moderate the experience of WFC.

J	Wang, D; Dai, F; Ning, XP				Wang, Di; Dai, Fei; Ning, Xiaopeng			Risk Assessment of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Construction: State-of-the-Art Review	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction safety; Construction ergonomics; Work-related musculoskeletal disorders; Literature review; Wearable sensors; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Labor and personnel issues	LOW-BACK-PAIN; FLEXION-RELAXATION RESPONSE; MOTION CAPTURE; SELF-REPORT; EXPOSURE; MODEL; POSTURES; SENSOR; SPINE; VALIDATION	Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) have long been a primary cause of non-fatal injuries in construction. They involve sudden or continuous stresses on a worker's musculoskeletal system (e.g.,muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones) and may impair the ability of the worker to perform his or her job, or even cause permanent disability. Although assessing exposure to risk factors of WMSDs has proven to be feasible to alleviate the incidence rate of this injury, the field remains underdeveloped because of a lack of knowledge among construction professionals regarding the enabling techniques and their performance and limits. This paper reviews the available techniques for WMSD risk assessments, summarizes their benefits and limitations, and identifies areas in which further studies are still needed. Current techniques are categorized into self-report, observation, direct measurement, and remote sensing assessment. Particular interests are revealed in the wearable-sensor and vision-based techniques within the construction community. This review helps the industry to better understand the severity of WMSDs and the related risks in construction. This review also provides the construction research community with a holistic view on available techniques, their limitations, and the need for research in achieving automatic assessments on construction sites.

So far, bridge inspections have been performed manually by workers who either climb and rappel or use so-called mobile negative cherry pickers or specific mobile assemblies. This is a dangerous and tedious task which must be carried out during night time or when the traffic on the bridge is stopped, for safety reasons. The installation of mobile assemblies is costly, time consuming and they become not compliant with recent structures. Moreover, manual inspections require counting, measuring, locating and taking pictures of small cracks. The quality of these manual operations depends not only on the experience but also on the level of fatigue of the workers. The robotic inspection system proposed in this paper consists of three main components: a customized truck, a mobile robotic mechanism which takes pictures of the entire area of interest, and a software which automatically associates these pictures with the CAD model of the bridge. Afterwards at office, users browse the pictures of the surfaces of the bridge with the help of the CAD software and a dedicated plugin to detect, measure and comment the bridge defects to process later. The result is summed up into a report generated by the software. The requirements and the mechanical design of this system are described and an overview of the inspections realized so far with it is provided.

Most existing studies use videos that only contain one activity with involved entities and rely solely on the spatial-temporal relationship among entities. However, in practice, many workers and machines co-exist and collaborate to accomplish different activities, and not all of them are relevant to the same activity, even though they are spatially close. This paper presents a two-step classification approach - working group identification followed by activity recognition, leveraging both positional and attentional cues, to recognize complex interactions and their involved entities from videos that contain different activities with multiple entities. The spatial and attentional states of individual entities are represented numerically,. and the corresponding positional and attentional cues between two entities are computed. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are designed to (1) classify whether two entities belong to the same group, and (2) recognize the activities they are involved in. The newly created method is validated using two sets of construction videos. Identifying working groups before recognizing ongoing activities enables the exclusion of group-irrelevant entities and thus, improves the performance. Moreover, by leveraging both positional and attentional cues, the accuracy increases from 85% to 95% compared with cases using positional cues alone.

To address this anomaly, traffic control planners are tasked with making decisions geared toward reducing hazardous situations caused by transiting vehicles and construction equipment. The growing application of technologies to enhance worker safety should be considered during the traffic control planning process. In certain cases, decisions such as choosing among technology options are made using experiential individual knowledge without the application of scientific and systematic decision-making methods. Use of experience-based decision making in this context is largely the result of sparse literature on scientific methods of selecting between alternatives in highway construction work zones. By applying the Choosing by Advantages (CBA) decision-making method, a process that achieves sound and effective decisions, the current study aims to fill the gap in practice by proposing a decision-making framework that could enhance the value-cost selection process of safety technologies in highway construction work zones. A situation that applied work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs) was selected as a case study. Using a focus group session and case projects as an evaluation study process, the proposed framework based on the CBA decision-making process was applied to evaluate three WZIATs. Findings from the current study will benefit safety professionals and practitioners by providing a step-by-step approach to make sound decisions that can enhance the level of safety in highway construction work zones.

This paper proposes the analysis of consecutive image sequences for automatic identification of irregular operations and their visualization. The data analytics is composed of four steps: object detection, object tracking, action recognition, and operational analysis. The Faster Region-proposal Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is adapted with transfer learning for detection of workers and pieces of construction equipment on the jobsite, while the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) approach is applied for object tracking. A hybrid model integrating CNN and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is employed for action recognition. An alternative form of the Crew-balance Chart (CBC), called line chart in which anomalies are pre-screened, is utilized for recognized actions. Validation was carried out with earthmoving operations. The trained Faster R-CNN reached a 73% Average Precision (AP), and the SORT algorithm modified by this work successfully reduced identity switches. Irregular operations in the testing videos were identified, and truck exchanges were filtered. In addition, an activity log was produced with basic information along with starting and ending times of the identified irregular operations. With the line chart and the log provided by the proposed framework, field managers can efficiently identify potential abnormal activities, providing the opportunity for further investigations and adjustments accordingly.

J	Sharif, MM; Haas, C; Walbridge, S				Sharif, Mohammad Mahdi; Haas, Carl; Walbridge, Scott			Using termination points and 3D visualization for dimensional control in prefabrication	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						3D visualization; Termination points; Worker productivity; 3D data integration; Quality control and measurement; Dimensional control	DISCREPANCY FEEDBACK; CONSTRUCTION; CLOUDS; REWORK	To increase productivity, quality, and safety, heavy industrial construction projects are increasingly adopting prefabrication and modularization techniques. This shift, in turn, has resulted in fabrication shops fabricating more complex assemblies with tighter tolerances. However, most measurement in these shops is conducted using manual hand measurement tools, which can be costly and is known to cause significant rework due to geometric noncompliance of termination points in particular. Termination points are defined as the coordinate system points where assemblies connect or are constrained. Automated, 3D-scanning measurement and visu-alization systems can potentially be accurate, repeatable, and objective sources of termination point data. In this paper, a new framework for classification and calculation of termination points is presented that is based on automated, 3D-scanning measurement and visualization. The utilization of the framework enables fabrication shops and project owners to adopt effective 3D measurement solutions. To investigate the usefulness of the defined framework, a termination-point-based scan-vs-BIM method is developed for objects with circular cross sections, such as pipe spool assemblies. The method was validated in an industrial-scale experimental study. The study demonstrated that the new framework can be used to develop applications that are more accurate and provide superior visualization to craft workers during fabrication, and thus potentially improve produc-tivity and reduce rework.

While previous studies have identified several factors that cause low construction productivity, factors related to site amenities and labor welfare measures have not received enough attention. This paper encompasses factors related to site amenities and labor welfare that directly or indirectly affect productivity of the construction workforce. Factor analysis conducted on 151 responses associated with 38 identified site amenities and labor welfare attributes identified eight factors: (1)health and medical provisions, (2)site services, (3)labor camp facilities, (4)hygiene and sanitation, (5)leave and benefits, (6)social welfare and employment policies, (7)remuneration, and (8)accommodation facilities. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare the views of the engineers and supervisors. Furthermore, data were collected from five different construction sites to assess the quality of the prevailing conditions of site amenities and labor welfare and its implications for labor productivity. It was found that the major reasons leading to poor quality of site amenities and labor welfare are related to improper letters of intent (LOIs) and delays in land acquisition for setting up proper labor camps. The outcome of this study is likely to direct more research and organizational efforts in this direction, especially in the context of developing countries such as India, where work and living conditions of construction workers have yet to receive the required attention of both policymakers and project stakeholders.

J	Karatas, A; El-Rayes, K				Karatas, Aslihan; El-Rayes, Khaled			Parallel Computing Framework for Optimizing Environmental and Economic Performances of Housing Units	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC-ALGORITHM; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; HVAC SYSTEMS; ENERGY; PROJECTS; ENVELOPE	Decision makers in the housing industry need to carefully analyze housing design and construction decisions to improve housing environmental and economic performances. Available energy optimization models are able to find minimum-cost housing design and construction decisions at different target energy-saving levels. The application of these models, however, is limited due to their time-intensive and often impractical computational requirements. This paper presents a scalable and expandable parallel computing framework to reduce the computational time that is required to optimize the trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial cost. The framework is designed as a global parallel optimization algorithm to provide an efficient distribution of the multiobjective genetic algorithm computations over a number of parallel processors. The optimization algorithm is also coupled with an external building energy simulation engine to enable an accurate modeling of housing energy performance. The performance of the parallel computing framework was tested using seven experiments that utilized 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 worker processors. The results of this analysis illustrated that the present framework is able to reduce the computational elapsed time from 12days to 1.7days by utilizing eight parallel worker processors that are commonly found on many PCs with quad core and eight threads. This significant reduction in the elapsed time proves that the developed parallel computing framework is capable of transforming the optimization of housing units from a time-consuming and often impractical problem to a feasible and practical one.

Previous research has acknowledged that social interactions among supervisors and workers shape safety implementation on work sites. However, a detailed examination of the nature and impact of these social interactions has been missing. An ethnographic method was deployed in which a researcher spent approximately 100 h attending four construction sites over a 6-month period. This deep embedded research method enabled the nature and impact of social interactions to be explored. Organized safety walks and informal walk-arounds were attended, during which interactions were observed and conversations were held with project participants, including foremen, professional health and safety advisors, supervisors, and workers. Field notes and comments were subjected to thematic content analysis. Different understandings of safety were apparent, with key differences emerging in relation to the role attributed to the principal contractors' site safety rules. The social ecosystem at the four sites was also embedded within broader construction industry practices, in particular competitive tendering and price-based selection. The results reveal limitations inherent in traditional technical approaches to understanding safety in the construction site environment because these approaches tend to ignore the social and power relations at play. The results reveal that safety at the principal contractor-subcontractor interface is better understood as an emergent property of a complex ecosystem of social relationships and interactions.

Its acute effects include a decrease in cognitive abilities, productivity and heightened risk of accidents whereas prolonged physical exertion led fatigue could lead to psychological issues and development of musculoskeletal disorders. To monitor physical exertion, traditionally questionnaires have been used while recent advances have focused on onsite and on-body sensors to automate the process. Considering the limitation of the recent approaches, this study explored the use of combined cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory measures to model physical exertion using machine learning algorithms. Controlled manual material handling experiments were conducted during a preliminary study to induce exertion at a steady rate involving ten participants. The results revealed that the proposed methodology could predict exertion levels with a high accuracy of 95.3% for combined data modeling of all participants. However, for some predictions, the error between predicted and actual exertion was up to five levels on the Borg-20 scale. To mitigate this issue, individualized machine learning models were used that effectively reduced the maximum error to one level with an average accuracy of 96.7% while using only one-tenth of the total data set. Overall, this study highlights the advantage of using multiple physiological measures for enhancing physical exertion modeling. Notably, the study underpins the use of individualized models for exertion monitoring and management to prevent physical fatigue development and its ill effects.

Reducing Risk Habituation to Struck-By Hazards in a Road Construction Environment Using Virtual Reality Behavioral Intervention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Struck-by accident; Risk habituation; Unsafe behavior; Virtual reality (VR); Behavioral intervention; Construction safety	VISUAL-ATTENTION; EYE-TRACKING; SAFETY; PERCEPTION; VIGILANCE; ATTITUDES; IMPACT; TIME	Repeated exposure to hazards in road construction work zones often generates worker habituation to risks associated with those hazards, a key causal factor in workplace accidents. Understanding the developmental process of risk habituation and providing effective intervention are thus critical to preventing fatalities in road construction work zones. To this end, this study investigates the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as a behavioral intervention tool to mitigate a decline in vigilant behaviors with habituation to workplace hazards. A VR environment that simulates road construction/maintenance tasks was created and used to repeatedly expose participants to struck-by hazards in road construction operations. An accident was simulated upon the emergence of inattentiveness to hazards within the VR environment. The sustained intervention effect was examined using pretest-posttest analyses to compare the frequency and threshold of participants' vigilant behaviors. The results revealed that the VR environment elicited a reduction in attentiveness associated with risk habituation over a relatively short period of time, and the simulated accidents in the VR environment generated sustained impacts in the mitigating of the effects of habituation on attention over a week's time interval. The outcomes of this study contribute to the understanding of how workers' risk habituation can be measured in a VR environment and provide new knowledge regarding how a VR-based behavioral intervention can mitigate the attentional consequences of habituation to repeatedly exposed workplace hazards.

Augmented hearing protection technology that uses advanced artificial intelligenc-based signal processing to amplify safety-critical sounds offers great potential to address the issue. To facilitate the acceptance of this new technology, it is critical to understand the user's intention of use of augmented HPDs. The current state-of-the-art, however, offers little understanding about the user's intention of use of such new technology. This paper fills the gap by exploring factors that determine the user's intention of use of augmented HPDs in the construction environment. Data were collected using questionnaires from 298 practitioners in the US, China, and Japan. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was adopted for analyzing the collected data. The results denote that the intention of use of augmented hearing protection technology is determined by the user's perceived usefulness of which the perceived ease of use, hearing health, and safety consciousness, trust on autonomy are among the most critical factors. The findings of this study enrich understandings of the theories of technology adoption in construction. It presents a further step towards critical design and implementation considerations for the success of augmented hearing protection technology in the future.

Many vision-based construction site-monitoring methods exist, but current technology has not achieved the accuracy required to robustly recognize objects such as construction equipment, workers, and materials in actual jobsite images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep convolutional network-based construction object-detection method to accurately recognize construction equipment. A deep convolutional network can achieve high performance in various visual tasks, but is not easy to be applied in the construction industry where there is not enough publicly available data for training. This problem is solved by transfer learning, which trains a model for the construction industry by transferring the knowledge of models trained in other domains with a large amount of training data. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark data set is created for five classes: a dump truck, excavator, loader, concrete mixer truck, and road roller. This benchmark data set includes various shapes and poses for each class to evaluate the generalization performance of the proposed construction equipment detection model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs remarkably well, achieving 96.33% mean average precision. In the future, the proposed model can be used to infer the context of construction operations for producing managerial information such as progress, productivity, and safety.

The preliminary analyses and experiments described in this paper concern two of the most important functionalities which must be included in the system's final release. The first functionality consists in real-time position-tracking of workers involved on construction sites and the second-in a software tool for the prevention of non-authorized access to dangerous zones. This research step is part of a vaster, ongoing research project, addressing the development of a new generation of advanced construction management systems which allow real-time monitoring and coordination of tasks, automatic health and safety management, on-site delivery of technical information and the capture of "as-built" documentation. This paper focuses mainly on the development of a reliable methodology for real-time monitoring of the position of both workers and equipment in outdoor construction sites by applying Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based technologies. This positioning system was then interfaced with a software tool which performs virtual fencing of pre-selected, dangerous areas. Guidelines for the design of the receivers' topology will be addressed and the results of measurements recorded on a typical medium-sized block of flats, during different phases of the construction progress will be summed up. Finally, the preliminary experimental results obtained by the virtual fencing application tool will be presented and used to plan future research objectives.

There have also been limited studies focusing on how site employees' perceptions could be affected by multiple external and internal factors such as workers' experience levels. This study firstly developed a theoretical safety cognition framework addressing site employees' perceptions toward hazards. Empirical data from construction safety reports in China were collected to quantify and define eight common safety hazard or accident scenarios. Following the empirical data analysis, these eight hazards were ranked in terms of their occurrence, severity, and controllability. Based on the results of questionnaires received in China's construction industry, site employees' perceptions toward these eight hazards were analyzed, ranked, and compared with the empirical ranking. Major findings included but were not limited to: (1) hazards with higher occurrences tended to be perceived with less deviation; (2) more experienced employees were more likely to apply prior scenarios and safety knowledge to perceiving given hazards and to have more reliable perceptions; and (3) prior scenarios might also create biased perceptions in the case of electrocution. The current study contributed to the knowledge in safety climate by proposing and testing the framework incorporating safety perceptions. Further research could be performed to explore more subgroup factors' effects on workers' perceptions, as well as how to design an effective safety training program to correct their biased perceptions.

Predominantly, workers leave the workforce because of injuries. In particular, musculoskeletal disorders are depleting the construction workforce. Previous studies have contrasted the safety records of journeymen versus novices. However, no study to date has examined the combined effects of experience level on safety, productivity, and the balance between them. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap and to investigate the underlying reasons for these effects. Twenty-one masons distributed in four experience levels were recruited to build a 72-block six-course wall using standard concrete masonry units. Participants' body kinematics were tracked using inertial measurement units and video cameras simultaneously. Biomechanical analysis was carried out to examine the loads experienced by major body joints during bricklaying. Results indicate that journeymen with more than 5 years of experience as well as novice masons work in ergonomically safer ways than apprentices with 1 and 3 years of experience. It was found that apprentices gain proficiency and increase productivity at the cost of higher risk of musculoskeletal injury. The results indicate that those masons who gain experience in ergonomic safety and productivity in tandem are more likely to remain in the workforce beyond the 5-year mark. Thus, it is essential to alter apprentice training to guarantee this outcome. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Bobick, TG				Bobick, TG			Falls through roof and floor openings and surfaces, including skylights: 1992-2000	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; INJURY HAZARDS; SAFETY; WORK	Fall-related occupational injuries and fatalities are still serious problems in the U.S. construction industry. Two Bureau of Labor Statistics databases-Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries and Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses-were examined for 1992-2000. An important subset of falls-to-lower-level incidents is when workers fall through openings or surfaces, including skylights. A total of 605 fall-through fatalities occurred during 1992-2000. Also, 21,985 workers were injured seriously enough from fall-through incidents to miss a day away from work (DAFW). Fall-through injuries are among the most severe cases for median number of DAFW. Median DAFW were 35, 11, 25, 12, and 36 for fall-through roof and floor openings, roof and floor surfaces, and skylights, respectively, compared to 10 DAFW for all fall-to-lower-level incidents in all U.S. private industry. A conservative approach, which assumes that direct and indirect costs are equal, estimates a range of $55,000-$76,000 for the total cost of a 1998 DAFW fall-through injury. Current work practices should use commercial fall-prevention products to reduce the frequency and costs of fall-through incidents. These analyses have identified a subset of fall-related incidents that contribute to excessive costs to the U.S. construction industry. Researchers can use a systems approach on these incidents to identify contributing risk factors. Employers and practitioners can alert managers and work crews about these dangerous locations to eliminate these hazards that are often obvious and easy to rectify.

Hence, safety programs have been according great emphasis on enforcing proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by deploying safety officers on construction sites. However, the current practice of supervising large construction areas is still manual, tedious, and ineffective. Therefore, this study aims at creating an integrated framework that can automatically and efficiently detect any noncompliance with safety rules and regulations, in particular a failure to wear a hardhat, using computer vision techniques applied on videos captured from construction sites. This is mainly achieved by (1) isolating mobile workers or construction personnel from the captured scene by means of a novel motion detection algorithm and a human classifier and (2) detecting the hardhat in the identified region of interest using an object detection tool coupled with a color-based image classification one. Several experiments were conducted and results highlighted that the proposed framework proved accurate, fast, and robust under different conditions and identified hardhats with high precision and recall. More specifically, the newly developed motion detection algorithm showed an improved accuracy compared to common background subtraction methods; the human classifier performed well and was able to identify several human postures, unlike support vector machine classifiers; and the hardhat detection algorithm achieved high precision and recall simultaneously.

Marking work for building materials that is currently performed manually is an indispensable part of the construction process. Its possible automation would allow construction workers to focus on the installation step and thus significantly boost their productivity. In this study an automated mobile robotic system for marking free access floors has been developed. Building such floors requires drawing grid-pattern lines whose intersections (representing the positions of future pedestal bases) can be automatically marked by the proposed system consisting of a mobile robot with a marking device at its center and a laser positioning unit. Cross marks are drawn on the floor by controlling the marking device, while the laser positioning unit accurately moves a line laser along a designated direction and measures the distance to a projected object. The marking robot tracks the line laser and arrives at a designated point. The deviation between the designated position and the robot center is calculated, and the cross mark is drawn exactly at the former location. The marking performance of the developed robotic system has been evaluated by conducting an experiments inside a 6 m x 6.5 m area at a construction site. It is found that the average deviation between the marked and designated positions is 2.3 mm, while 77% of all deviations are smaller than 3 mm.

Removal of occluding construction workers in job site image data using U-Net based context encoders	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						CNN; U-Net; Context encoders; Image inpainting; Progress monitoring; BIM	EQUIPMENT; TRACKING; MODELS	In the field of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management (AEC/FM), job site surveying is critical for tasks such as construction progress monitoring and quality assurance and quality control. Moving obstacles often occlude the sight of view, and sometimes block the view of interest. However, images are often collected for documentation and analysis of the building under construction or operation. The occluding objects, such as the construction workers, compromise the collected image data. On the other hand, the capability of the Context Encoders model took the pioneering step providing the opportunity of image inpainting. This research applies Context Encoders to remove redundant objects in images and inpaints the background context. The original Context Encoders model, a deep learning model, requires a large training dataset for a decent image inpainting. In the model, the region in need of context inpainting is constrained to be a predefined area, fixed in size and position in the image. In this work, we adapted a deep learning architecture, U-Net, for a direct image -to-image translation for context inpainting, and thus relaxing the fixed size and position constraints in the original Context Encoders model. Simultaneously in a single framework, the proposed model not only erases redundant objects but also inpaints the missing content in the pixel scale, based on surrounding semantic clues. Employing the U-Net yields encouraging results for cases in operating buildings and those under construction.

J	Loosemore, M; Alkilani, S; Mathenge, R				Loosemore, Martin; Alkilani, Suhair; Mathenge, Robert			The risks of and barriers to social procurement in construction: a supply chain perspective	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Diversity; employment; gender; Indigenous; social procurement; social value	DISABLED PEOPLE; INTERSECTIONALITY; DISABILITY; ENTERPRISES; STRATEGIES; EMPLOYMENT; GENDER; SECTOR	Social procurement policies place new requirements on subcontractors to create employment opportunities for people suffering disadvantage. However, the subcontractor's voice is largely absent from the social procurement debate, despite employing the majority of people in the construction industry. Addressing this gap in social procurement research, a survey of seventy Australian subcontractors was undertaken to explore perceived barriers to integrating six disadvantaged groups targeted by social procurement policies into the construction workforce (Indigenous people, people suffering disability, women, disengaged youth, migrants and refugees, ex-offenders). Results indicate that rather than reducing disadvantage for the most marginalised groups in society, satisficing behaviour in complying with emerging social procurement policies could have the opposite effect. Subcontractors see significant business risks associated with safety, productivity and costs with disengaged youth being perceived as the highest risk cohort, followed by migrants and refugees, people suffering disability, ex-offenders, women and Indigenous workers and employment priorities reflect these perceptions. Perceived barriers to employment vary significantly across these groups with smaller and younger firms perceiving the greatest barriers - particularly for women and Indigenous workers. Practically, the results highlight the potential risks which social procurement policies present to vulnerable people if they are introduced without sufficient support and regard for an industry's culture, structure and capacity to deliver. Conceptually, taking this research forward, the results highlight the potential value of cross-sector collaboration and intersectionality as theoretical frameworks to better understand how these groups experience working in the construction sector.

J	Jafari, KG; Noorzai, E				Gharouni Jafari, Kobra; Noorzai, Esmatullah			Selecting the Most Appropriate Project Manager to Improve the Performance of the Occupational Groups in Road Construction Projects in Warm Regions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project manager competencies; Performance; Occupational groups; Engineer; Technician; Worker; Road projects; Construction phase; Project size; Decision-making	COMPETENCES; LEADERSHIP; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; AGENCY; MODEL; AHP	This research proposes a framework to determine the most appropriate project manager (PM) to enhance the performance of occupational groups (POGs) in large, medium, and small road construction projects in warm regions. The occupational groups (OGs) in road projects were divided into three categories: workers, technicians, and engineers. Using the Pareto principle, 14 critical project manager competencies (PMCs) were extracted from a 70-item list developed by performing a comprehensive literature review. Two indexes were ranked in each size of road project using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique: which OG's performance improves the most when the PMCs identified are implemented, and the importance of each PMC in improving the POGs. The results showed that in small projects, a PM with strong communication skills is needed to maximize the performance of all three OGs, whereas negotiation skills in medium projects and project management knowledge in large projects are the most critical PMCs that a PM should possess to increase engineers' performance. The findings can help road construction firms to select the most appropriate PM to improve the POGs for road projects by project size, eventually leading to project success. The principal distinction of this research is its investigation of the correlation between PMCs and the POGs across different road project sizes. The main limitation of this research is that the research scope was limited to warm zones.

J	Zhang, MY; Cao, TZ; Zhao, XF				Zhang, Mingyuan; Cao, Tianzhuo; Zhao, Xuefeng			Using Smartphones to Detect and Identify Construction Workers' Near-Miss Falls Based on ANN	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Near-miss falls; Motion recognition; Construction safety; Smartphone; Machine learning; Artificial neural network (ANN)	TRIAXIAL ACCELEROMETER; SAFETY; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHMS; ACCIDENT; SYSTEM; SITES	In certain circumstances, near-miss falls can evolve into fall accidents in construction sites. Insight into near-miss falls offers an efficient way to better understand fall accidents. In this context, this paper explores potential applications of the smartphone as a data-acquisition tool to detect and identify near-miss falls on the basis of an artificial neural network (ANN). In training and evaluation experiments, a loss-of-balance (LOB) environment was artificially established by means of a balance board to simulate the scenarios in near-miss falls. Through a transition model between static and dynamic near-miss falls, the similarity between simulated and actual scenes of near-miss falls was improved. Furthermore, the feasibility of adopting ANN to correctly identify near-miss falls was verified. The results showed that the average precision, recall, and F1 score were 90.02%, 90.93%, and 90.42%, respectively, with an average error-detection rate of 16.26%. In test cases, the thresholds H20% (0.07692) and H10% (0.06061) were acquired and illustrated from the perspective of probability. This approach, which demonstrates the feasibility of integrating smartphones and ANN to measure near-miss falls, will help detect near-miss fall events and identify hazardous elements and vulnerable workers. In addition, it provides a new perspective for measuring the relationship between near-miss falls and fall accidents quantitatively, laying a solid foundation for better understanding the occurrence mechanisms of both events.

J	Brockman, JL				Brockman, Julie L.			Interpersonal Conflict in Construction: Cost, Cause, and Consequence	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Conflict management; Cost in construction; Construction productivity; Organizational issues	WORKPLACE; STRESS; HEALTH; WORKERS; SAFETY	Interpersonal conflict on the job is identified as one of the top occupational job stressors, strongly linked to a reduction in worker psychological and physical health. In addition, interpersonal conflict has been identified as a determinant of work disability, occupational accidents, and other costs related to reduced quality, loss of skilled employees, restructuring inefficiencies, decreased motivation and productivity, absenteeism, and employee turnover. For the construction industry, studies suggest that construction owners and contractors ranked conflict among construction project participants as the highest factor affecting project cost. It is astonishing, in light of this fact, that no research studies exist which attempt to expose the unmistakable financial cost of day-to-day conflict in the construction industry among project participants at the supervisory and trades level. Therefore, the research question being explored is: What are the triggers and consequences of interpersonal conflict on a construction site and at what financial cost? Using the critical-incident technique, a qualitative research method, 74 construction industry personnel were individually interviewed using a protocol designed to elicit one or more conflict incidents recalled by the interviewee. All interviews were audio taped, transcribed, and analyzed using Nvivo 9 qualitative software. Forty-one of the 86 reported incidents underwent an additional analysis using the time reported and associated labor costs. Based on the key findings, it is recommended that educational opportunities and innovative changes to the construction process could reduce/prevent the incidence of interpersonal conflict on the construction jobsite.

J	Scott-Young, CM; Turner, M; Holdsworth, S				Scott-Young, Christina M.; Turner, Michelle; Holdsworth, Sarah			Male and female mental health differences in built environment undergraduates	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Belonging; built environment students; construction industry; females; mental health; resilience; sex	PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; UNCONSCIOUS BIAS; RESILIENCE; WOMEN; STRESS; DISORDERS; PREVALENCE	The construction industry faces skills shortages and growing mental health issues which have stimulated a research focus on the underrepresentation of female employees and on its tough macho-culture and stressful working conditions. Evidence of sex differences in construction workers' mental health is starting to emerge, with women and younger workers experiencing the greatest levels of distress. This study takes an upstream perspective on construction human resources to explore sex differences in mental health and resilience in the early career pipeline of emerging built environment (BE) professionals. A survey of 384 BE undergraduates was conducted using the DASS-21 measure of mental health and the Resilience at University scale to explore the psychological adjustment of first and final year student cohorts. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and regression. Compared to first year students, female students' mental health appeared to have deteriorated across the four-year degree, whereas, male students' overall mental health improved. The results suggest that the construction classroom may be operating as a microcosm of the cultural environment faced by women in society in general and in the construction industry with its macho culture filtering back into the university sector. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to sex and gender differences in mental health. It is recommended that construction educators and employers partner together to proactively affect culture change by addressing gender bias early, by consciously creating a female-friendly, inclusive culture which emphasises a sense of belonging, and by providing gender-appropriate support systems and resilience training for emerging construction professionals.

Application of cutting-edge information and communication technologies (ICTs) can enhance the quality of construction training, and help in attracting youth to an industry that traditionally has a poor image and slow in uptaking innovation. This paper reports on the development of a novel mixed reality (MR) system uniquely targeted for the training of construction trade workers, i.e.,skilled manual workers. From a general training viewpoint, the system aims to address the shortcomings of existing construction trades training, in particular the lack of solutions for enabling trainees to train in realistic and challenging site conditions, while eliminating occupational health and safety risks. From a technical viewpoint, the system currently integrates state-of-the-art virtual reality goggles with a novel cost-effective 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head pose tracking system supporting the movement of trainees in room-size spaces, as well as a game engine to effectively manage the generation of the views of the virtual three-dimensional environment projected on the VR goggles. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the 6-DOF head pose tracking system, which is the main computational contribution of the research reported in this paper. Then, preliminary results reveal its value to enable trainees to experience construction site conditions, particularly being at height, in different settings. Details are provided regarding future work to extend the system into the envisioned full MR system whereby a trainee would be performing an actual task, e.g.,bricklaying, while being immersed in a virtual project environment.

J	Simpeh, F; Amoah, C				Simpeh, Fredrick; Amoah, Christopher			Assessment of measures instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19 on construction site	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction site; COVID-19; health; measures; safety; workers		COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue that is ravaging every aspect of human life. Various countries, thus, institute many measures to prevent the spread of the disease among the citizenry. This article investigates measures that are put in place at construction project sites to curb the spread of COVID-19 among construction site workers. An open-ended questionnaire was used as an instrument to collect qualitative data from construction companies. A purposive sampling method was used to distribute the interview questions. The collected data were analyzed with content analysis. The findings show that most construction companies have instituted prescribed and appropriate measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 on-site. Moreover, some construction companies had implemented extra measures and developed new protocols to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on-site. However, few construction companies were lacking in the provision of some of the recommended measures. The study identified three categories of measures (i.e. screening, site access and handling of material and equipment deliveries on-site) where improvement is required. Construction companies could use the recommendations provided to improve upon the approach adopted to curb the spread of COVID-19 on-site. The study could also inform policymakers on COVID-19 measures that are unsatisfactorily implemented on site for which more attention and oversight is required. Research on construction site health and safety measures during this COVID-19 season are still being developed. Thus, this article contributes to advancing the body of knowledge in this area of study. Data were collected from grades 6 to 9 construction firms; therefore, the research findings may not be applied to smaller construction firms. A study that focuses on lower grades is recommended.

J	Sherratt, F; Ivory, C				Sherratt, Fred; Ivory, Chris			Managing "a little bit unsafe": complexity, construction safety and situational self-organising	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Complexity; Safety; Management; Social constructionism; Construction site; Construction safety; Situational self-organising	MANAGEMENT; DISCOURSES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to unpack the shared understandings of safety held by workers on large UK construction sites using a complexity lens, and so provide empirical support for the inclusion of situational self-organising within construction site safety management systems (SMS). Design/methodology/approach A social constructionist epistemology supports the discourse analysis of talk (semi-structured interview and conversational), text (SMS and documentation) and visual (safety related signage) data collection from five large (+20 pound m) UK construction sites. Findings Construction workers readily understand safety to be an emergent phenomenon with the complex system that is the construction site. Contemporary safety management approaches struggle with this complexity, yet there is the potential to mobilise situational self-organising on sites to improve safety in practice. Research limitations/implications - Epistemological foundations mean no claim is made to generalisability as perceived by traditional positivistic parameters. The data are limited to large (+20m) pound UK construction sites; however, underlying construction management systems are common to the industry as a whole and can find fit with practitioner experiences and other empirical academic work from both the UK and other countries. Practical implications - Situational self-organising of safety management within the construction workforce is proposed as a key contribution to a relevant, dynamic and effective SMS. Originality/value Data are analysed from a social constructionist perspective and considered through a complexity lens. This approach unpacks these data in an original way to seek synergy with existing adaptive safety approaches, specifically situational self-organising and make recommendations for practice.

Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted using a qualitative approach through an ethnographic methodology in relation to three companies. The greater part of the data collection period was structured into observations that ranged between 2 and 4 hr per day, 1-3 days per week, for a period of six months. A total of ten sites were explored; and on each site, the observations involved activities by 5-20 people. Findings The results showed the pivotal importance of interpersonal relationships in coping with the uncertainty of working conditions, the coordination of teamwork and managing responsibilities and power interactions. It was found that the impact of stress is multifaceted, affecting the physical status, interpersonal relationships, work performance and emotional well-being of construction workers. The workers who were studied emphasised five sources of support that help moderate work-related stress: additional tools such as communication systems and software, a facilitated access to professional help (e.g. psychological services), organisational changes in leadership, provision of resources for the well-being of personnel (e.g. job training) and better teamwork. Practical implications - The study underlines the importance of dedicated services for stress management and specific training-related abilities devoted to reinforcing positive person-organisation dynamics. In particular, the abilities should relate to managing the impact of stress in terms of physique, interpersonal relationships, work performance and emotional well-being. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to adopt a psychological perspective for understanding construction scenarios and phenomena and was conducted by a qualified psychologist.

In spite of the different policies launched in recent years, the casualty rate has held constant, raising doubts over the effectiveness of current measures for improving safety performance in RMAA works. Against this backdrop, this study is aimed at identifying and evaluating the 1) effectiveness of prevailing policies; 2) potential difficulties in improving safety performance in Hong Kong; and 3) best ways to improve the safety performance of RMAA. Following an extensive literature review, 15 existing policies and 10 common difficulties are established. Based on the solicitation of experts having rich experience in the area of RMAA, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is employed to prioritize the identified policies and Likert-scale-based survey to establish the relative importance of the identified difficulties. The 'award of encouragement' is found to be the most effective policy category, whereas the 'lack of self-regulation of workers' appeared as the most significant hurdle. In order to further validate the results obtained from the study, a number of interviews using highly experienced professionals were conducted. It is recommended that strategies such as registration of RMAA workers, intensifying monitoring and enforcement, and provision of loan services for safety can overcome the difficulties. The hindsight provided from this study can pave the way for the concerned parties towards improving the occupational safety and health (OSH) of such projects by improving the effective policies concurrently with improving the status quo of critical hampering.

Data-Driven Monitoring System for Preventing the Collapse of Scaffolding Structures	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Temporary structures; Smart monitoring; Machine learning; Finite element model (FEM); Scaffold	CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS; SAFETY; WORK	As temporary structures, scaffolds have essential roles to hold workers, materials, and equipment throughout construction activities. However, because a safety inspection for scaffolds is primarily visual and labor intensive, the OSHA standards related to scaffolds are frequently violated. Improper management of scaffolds has caused scaffolding collapses that have a potentially detrimental effect and liability on workers' lives. This paper discusses the significance of scaffolding collapses and explores a method to perform scaffolding monitoring. To establish an integrated method, this research cross-connects various components (e.g.,strain data, finite element model (FEM)-based structural analysis, machine learning, and an actual scaffold) in the presented framework. More specifically, this framework for a smart monitoring system is involved with: (1)developing a wireless strain sensing module for data collection, (2)modeling an FEM and learning data for failure mechanisms through FEM to characterize scaffold behaviors under certain loading conditions, and (3)investigating a machine-learning algorithm (i.e.,support vector machine) for decision making. The FEM simulation analyzes a scaffolding to calculate strain values for each scaffolding column from randomly generated 1,200 load cases. Load-related strain data form training and testing sets for the machine-learning algorithm that enables the distinguishing of scaffolding conditions such as safe, over-turning, uneven-settlement, and over-loading conditions. In the experimental validation, the developed wireless strain sensing modules perform the real-time strain measurement and the machine-learning algorithm to successfully estimate the status of the scaffolding structure with 97.66% accuracy on average. The proposed method could escalate a monitoring paradigm for temporary structures from a labor-intensive manual inspection to a systematic real-time approach.

Our dataset consists of 10 videos of interacting pairs of construction equipment filmed at ground level with accompanying ground truth annotations. These annotations consist of per-equipment and per-frame equipment bounding boxes that also have associated identities and activity labels. Our videos depict an excavator interacting with 1 or more dump trucks. We also propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and tracking objects based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The tracking trajectories are fed into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that automatically discovers and assigns activity labels for any observed object. Our HMM method leverages trajectories to train a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with which we estimate the probability density function of each activity using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed HMM also models activity duration and the transition between activities. We show that our method can accurately distinguish between individual equipment working activities. Results show 97.43% detection Average Precision (AP) for excavators and 75.29% AP for dump trucks, as well as cross-category tracking accuracy of 81.94% and tracking precision of 87.45%. Separate experiment results show activity analysis results of 86.8% accuracy for excavators and 88.5% for dump trucks. Our results show that our method can accurately conduct activity analysis and can be fused with methods that detect motion trajectories to scale to the needs of practical applications.

High task demands increase the likelihood of errors, with implications for rework, safety, and productivity. To ensure the safety and productive efficiency of workers, it is important to better understand the task demands and manage them effectively. This exploratory study investigated the task demands in masonry work, the factors that generate the demands, the influence of demands on performance, and the practices that field supervisors use to manage/regulate them. Data were collected on two masonry projects. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was used to measure the workers' subjective assessment of task demands. The members of masonry crews perceived different type and level of task demands depending on their role-supervisor, masons, laborers, and operator. Interviews with the crew members identified design features and work practices that influenced the task demands. Extensive field observations identified three strategies that field supervisors use to manage task demands: (1) matching task demands with capabilities; (2) reducing temporal demands; and (3) shifting task demands between roles. Finally, data were collected on performance problems with emphasis on delays, mistakes, rework, and safety incidents. Rework often involved higher task demands and hazards than the normal tasks. The study contributes to practice by identifying factors that increase the task demands of masonry activities and that need to be managed to improve performance. In terms of research, the study identifies and measures the multiple task demands for the different masonry crew roles, identifies sources of task demands, and strategies to manage them.

J	Bajjou, MS; Chafi, A				Bajjou, Mohamed Saad; Chafi, Anas			Exploring the critical waste factors affecting construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction waste; Waste reduction; Factor analysis; Lean construction; Environmental performance; Sustainable construction	LEAN CONSTRUCTION; BUILDING-PROJECTS; COST OVERRUNS; MANAGEMENT; GENERATION; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; INDUSTRY	Purpose Waste is typically encountered during the building's life cycle, from the design phase, through the construction phase, to modification and demolition. Most of these construction wastes are unnoticed or unattended by project managers, which lead to serious environmental problems. Effective waste reduction strategies will require a thorough and detailed understanding of the causes of construction waste. Hence, this paper aims to explore critical waste factors (CWFs) affecting the performance of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review was carried out to determine these factors based on previous studies, from which a questionnaire was developed. Series of statistical analyses such as reliability analysis, Spearman Correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and factor analysis were performed on a total of 330 valid responses to identify latent factors responsible for wastes occurrence. Findings This study reveals 31 CWFs through evaluation of prior relevant studies carried out in several countries and then adjusted and validated through semistructured interviews. The significant differences in views within various groups of respondents with different organizational characteristics are highlighted. The results of factor analysis showed that there are six principal components extracted with 66.3% of variance explained (material-related factors; subcontractors and workers; planning, communication and coordination; people involvement and financial issues; people development strategies; and external factors). Originality/value This study differs from other studies in the literature by gathering all relevant waste factors including those related to nonphysical waste such as time, budget, workers and equipment. Furthermore, this paper will be of great interest to both practitioners and researchers since it brings various recommendations concerning the prevention/reduction of waste through lean construction for more sustainable construction projects.

Existing established methods of assessing fatigue include surveys and questionnaires, which are cumbersome to implement at construction sites. This study presents a novel approach for real time monitoring of physical fatigue in construction workers using wearable sensors. Changes in the heart rate, thermoregulation and electrical brain activity during a simulated construction task were monitored from 12 participants using a heart rate monitor, infrared temperature sensors and an EEG sensor. Borg's RPE was used as a subjective scale to collect the level of fatigue experienced by the participants. Boosted tree classifiers were trained using the features extracted from the heart rate and temperature sensor signals and used to predict the level of physical fatigue. Only physical fatigue was assessed as none of the participants developed any sign of mental fatigue during the study. The results show that physical fatigue can be monitored using wearable sensors. The classification accuracy, based solely on features extracted from average of skin temperature data, was 9% higher than based solely on heart rate data, and combining the information from both sensors resulted in the best accuracy of 82%. The results also show that monitoring thermoregulation from temple can be more useful compared to other studied monitoring sites, the classification accuracy based only on data from the temple was 79%. This accuracy is significantly higher compared to the classification accuracy based only on heart rate data (59%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Luo, XW; Leite, F; O'Brien, WJ				Luo, Xiaowei; Leite, Fernanda; O'Brien, William J.			Location-Aware Sensor Data Error Impact on Autonomous Crane Safety Monitoring	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data error; Wireless sensor networks; Tower crane; Autonomous safety monitoring; Precision and recall; Dangerous area control	WIDE-BAND TECHNOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; SYSTEM; LOCALIZATION; WIRELESS	Emerging sensing technologies offer a solution to improve jobsite safety performance by providing location information to determine a worker's safety situation regarding proximity to dangers. However, due to the imperfections inherent in real-world sensor data, the collected location data might be imperfect (missing, uncertain, erroneous, and inconsistent). Among those types of imperfection, error is one of the most common. In many cases, jobsite safety monitoring applications are built on the assumption that the collected location data represent the exact situation, which might not be true due to erroneous data. However, data errors and their potential impacts on the decisions in autonomous jobsite safety monitoring systems have not been substantially studied. This paper describes an autonomous jobsite safety monitoring testbed developed to collect data from location-aware sensors. The authors developed six jobsite crane-safety monitoring test scenarios to replicate the construction activities on a full-scale jobsite and used the collected data, as well as simulated sensor data at various error levels, to quantify the impacts on decision-making performance in terms of precision and recall of workers' dangerous situations. The results indicated that the worst performance appears near the transition area of different risk levels (red to yellow/yellow to green) and the performance degrades significantly after the standard deviation of the localization errors reaches 2 cm in the testbed, corresponding to 2 m in a jobsite. The study provides researchers with an understanding of how much data errors impact safety monitoring system performance and guide future research directions.

J	Wanberg, J; Harper, C; Hallowell, MR; Rajendran, S				Wanberg, John; Harper, Christofer; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Rajendran, Sathyanarayanan			Relationship between Construction Safety and Quality Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Quality; Planning; Project management; Labor and personnel issues	FORENSIC PROJECT-MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; REWORK; MODEL	It is well established that the project cost, quality, safety, and duration are the four critical elements that contribute to project success. Past literature has established theoretical relationships between construction safety and quality on the basis of opinions of industry experts. This is the first empirical inquiry into the relationship between safety and quality, testing the null hypothesis that there is no statistical relationship among quality performance indicators and safety performance indicators. To test this hypothesis, empirical data were collected from 32 building construction projects, ranging in scope from $50,000 to $300million dollars. Several quality metrics (e.g.,cost of rework per $1M project scope and rate of rework per 200,000 worker-hours) were used as predictor variables and first aid and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable injury rates were used as response variables. Linear regressions among the predictor and response variables showed that there are two statistically significant relationships: the OSHA recordable injury rate is positively correlated to rework (r2=0.968; p-value=0.032) and the first aid rate is positively correlated to number of defects (r2=0.548; p-value=0.009). To understand why these relationships exist and to identify specific strategies that promote both safety and quality, open-ended interviews were conducted with project managers. These individuals indicated that the most compelling reason for the strong positive correlation between rework and injuries is the fact that rework involves demolition, schedule pressure, and unstable work processes. They also noted that devoting resources to preplanning, allowing the necessary time to complete tasks correctly the first time, encouraging leadership at the workface, and encouraging workers to take pride in their work are all strategies that promote both safety and quality.

Architects and design engineers have the opportunity to positively affect construction worker safety and health through the choices they make in the design process. Lack of designer knowledge about construction processes and limited availability of tools to assist in assessing the safety risk associated with a design are considered as inhibitors to implementation of the design for construction safety (DfCS) concept. This paper presents research conducted to quantify the construction safety risk of each of the design elements present in typical multistory buildings in the United States. The major research efforts were (1) identification of the typical building design elements and associated construction activities; (2) quantification of the unit and cumulative risks of the design elements and construction activities; and (3) development of an online design risk-assessment tool. Absolute safety risks were quantified for 141 design elements and 683 construction activities using the survey-analytical research method. The risk factors developed were incorporated into an online tool titled Safety in Design Risk Evaluator (SliDeRulE). The research contributes to the construction industry body of knowledge by providing quantitative values that link specific design features to construction safety. The website is designed to assist building designers with assessing the level of construction safety risk associated with their designs and is intended for use by designers during the design phase to create buildings that are safer to construct.

Integrating mobile Building Information Modelling and Augmented Reality systems: An experimental study	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						AR; BIM; Cloud -based; Experiment; Design science; Task efficiency	DESIGN SCIENCE; BIM; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; ARCHITECTURE; TECHNOLOGY	The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM) have typically been tied to its capability to support information structuring and exchange through the centralization of information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of data acquisition has created information intensive work environments, which can result in information overload and thus negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction. Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance the process of information extraction from building information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency through improving the information retrieval process during construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual information retrieval methods (control group), with information retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results revealed that the participants using the artefact were approximately 50% faster in completing their experiment tasks, and committed less errors, when compared to the control group. This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick Response markers can significantly improve the information retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration has the potential to enhance task efficiency.

J	Pan, Y; Zhang, LM				Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao			A BIM-data mining integrated digital twin framework for advanced project management	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Digital twin; Building information modeling (BIM); Process mining; Time series analysis		With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the highfidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.

Labour and skill shortages in Hong Kong's construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hong Kong; Construction industry; Employee attitudes; Labour shortage; Labour supply model; Skill shortage		Purpose - With many large-scale infrastructural and residential projects in Hong Kong, the construction industry is suffering from serious labour and skill shortages. The purpose of this paper is to identify practicable strategies for resolving these problems, assess the effectiveness of these identified strategies and finally develop a conceptual labour supply model. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected qualitatively and quantitatively through discussion forums and questionnaire surveys. Comprising 30 expert members, two discussion forums were held to identify both practical response strategies and conceptual labour supply framework. Based on ten identified strategies, surveys were then conducted in the form of a web-based questionnaire. In total, 2,900 respondents were invited to take part and 438 questionnaires were completed. Grounded theory approach was adopted to develop a labour supply theory. Findings - In total, three identified strategies which could deliver quick results to the industry were increasing worker wages, importing foreign workers and engaging employers to provide training. Other identified strategies were also effective over the medium and long terms. Practical implications - Many of the identified solutions are enforceable. These are not only applicable to Hong Kong, but also transferable to other countries where voluntarily based measures under the free-market economy do not work in an effective manner. Originality/value - Unlike previous studies largely relied on voluntarily based measures, most of the identified strategies in this study are enforceable to ensure its effectiveness. In addition, based on the grounded theory approach, this study has developed a conceptual model for analysing labour supply issues in both local and overseas situations, thus contributing to the new knowledge in this area.

Although numerous studies on accident causation models have discussed the correlations of unsafe behaviors with various factors (e.g., unsafe conditions), limited research explores correlations between unsafe behaviors within accidents. The purpose of this paper is mining strong association rules of unsafe behaviors from historical accidents to clarify this kind of tacit knowledge. Design/methodology/approach A case study was adopted as the research approach, in which accident records from building and urban railway construction in China were selected as data resources. The groups of unsafe behaviors extracted from accident records were expressed by the definitions of unsafe behaviors from safety regulations and operating procedures. Frequent Pattern (FP)-Growth algorithm was used for association rule mining, and the critical correlations between unsafe behaviors were represented by the effective strong rules. Findings The findings identify and distinguish correlations between unsafe behaviors within construction accidents. In building construction, workers and managers should pay attention to preventing unsafe behaviors related to personal protective equipment and machines and equipment. In urban railway construction, workers should especially avoid unsafe behaviors of inadequately dealing with environmental factors. Practical implications Tacit knowledge is transferred to explicit knowledge as the critical correlations between unsafe behaviors within accidents are determined by the effective strong rules. Additionally, the findings provide practice guidance for safety management, to collaboratively control unsafe behaviors with strong correlations. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of safety knowledge in construction and provides a further understanding of how construction accidents are caused by multiple unsafe behaviors.

J	Chang-Richards, Y; Wilkinson, S; Seville, E; Brunsdon, D				Chang-Richards, Yan; Wilkinson, Suzanne; Seville, Erica; Brunsdon, David			Effects of a major disaster on skills shortages in the construction industry Lessons learned from New Zealand	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Skills; Human resource management; Construction industry; Earthquakes; Strategic planning; Labour force	HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION; MANPOWER DEMAND; LABOR; PERSPECTIVE; CHALLENGES; RESILIENCE; MECHANISMS; CRISIS; RISK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the effects of a major disaster on the management of human resources in the construction sector. It sets out to identify the construction skills challenges and the factors that affected skills availability following the 2010/2011 earthquakes in Christchurch. It is hoped that this study will provide insights for on-going reconstruction and future disaster response with respect to the problem of skills shortages. Design/methodology/approach - A triangulation method was adopted. The quantitative method, namely, a questionnaire survey, was employed to provide a baseline description. Field observations and interviews were used as a follow-up to ascertain issues and potential shortages over time. Three focus groups in the form of research workshops were convened to gain further insight into the feedback and to investigate the validity and applicability of the research findings. Findings - The earthquakes in Christchurch had compounded the pre-existing skills shortages in the country due to heightened demand from reconstruction. Skills shortages primarily existed in seismic assessment and design for land and structures, certain trades, project management and site supervision. The limited technical capability available nationally, shortage of temporary accommodation to house additional workers, time needed for trainees to become skilled workers, lack of information about reconstruction workloads and lack of operational capacity within construction organisations, were critical constraints to the resourcing of disaster recovery projects. Research limitations/implications - The research findings contribute to the debate on skills issues in construction. The study provides evidence that contributes to an improved understanding of the industry's skills vulnerability and emerging issues that would likely exist after a major disaster in a resource-limited country such as New Zealand. Practical implications - From this research, decision makers and construction organisations can gain a clear direction for improving the construction capacity and capability for on-going reconstruction. Factors that affected the post-earthquake skills availability can be considered by decision makers and construction organisations in their workforce planning for future disaster events. The recommendations will assist them in addressing skills shortages for on-going reconstruction. Originality/value - Although the study is country-specific, the findings show the nature and scale of skills challenges the construction industry is likely to face following a major disaster, and the potential issues that may compound skills shortages. It provides lessons for other disaster-prone countries where the resource pool is small and a large number of additional workers are needed to undertake reconstruction.

J	Ling, FYY; Liu, M; Woo, YC				Ling, Florence Yean Yng; Liu, Min; Woo, Yue Chiau			Construction fatalities in Singapore	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fatalities; Construction accidents; Construction safety; Prevention; Risks		This study investigates proximal causes to 40 fatalities between 2006 and 2008 in Singapore's construction industry. We statistically analyzed the data and found 11 characteristics of deceased workers, types of work, and the environment. Construction fatality causes in the US between 2003 and 2006 were also analyzed and compared with the data in Singapore. We developed 41 strategies to minimize fatalities. We interviewed seven Singapore and US construction safety managers for their opinions on the effectiveness of the strategies. We conclude that in addition to those recommended strategies, changes in organizational safety culture, enhancement of the penalty system, and effective communication are critical to improve safety performance in Singapore's construction industry.

J	Pink, S; Tutt, D; Dainty, A; Gibb, A				Pink, Sarah; Tutt, Dylan; Dainty, Andrew; Gibb, Alistair			Ethnographic methodologies for construction research: knowing, practice and interventions	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction site; construction workers; ethnographic research; indigenous knowledge; informal practices; knowledge in practice; local knowledge	SAFETY	Ethnographic methodologies developed in social anthropology and sociology hold considerable promise for addressing practical, problem-based research concerned with the construction site. The extended researcher-engagement characteristic of ethnography reveals rich insights, yet is infrequently used to understand how workplace realities are lived out on construction sites. Moreover, studies that do employ these methods are rarely reported within construction research journals. This paper argues that recent innovations in ethnographic methodologies offer new routes to: posing questions; understanding workplace socialities (i.e. the qualities of the social relationships that develop on construction sites); learning about forms, uses and communication of knowledge on construction sites; and turning these into meaningful recommendations. This argument is supported by examples from an interdisciplinary ethnography concerning migrant workers and communications on UK construction sites. The presented research seeks to understand how construction workers communicate with managers and each other and how they stay safe on site, with the objective of informing site health-and-safety strategies and the production and evaluation of training and other materials. Les methodologies ethnographiques developpees en anthropologie sociale et en sociologie sont extremement prometteuses pour aborder des recherches pratiques, basees sur la resolution de problemes et portant sur le chantier de construction. La caracteristique etendue chercheur-engagement de l'ethnographie est revelatrice de riches enseignements, mais est neanmoins peu souvent utilisee pour comprendre comment les realites du lieu de travail sont vecues sur les chantiers de construction. De plus, les etudes faisant effectivement appel a ces methodes sont rarement presentees dans les revues consacrees a la recherche dans le batiment. Cet article defend l'idee selon laquelle les innovations recentes dans les methodologies ethnographiques offrent de nouvelles voies, qu'il s'agisse de poser des questions; de comprendre les socialites sur le lieu de travail (c'est-a-dire les qualites des relations sociales qui se developpent sur les chantiers de construction); d'en apprendre plus sur les formes, les usages et la communication des savoirs sur les chantiers de construction; et de transformer cela en des recommandations utiles. Cette argumentation est appuyee par des exemples issus d'une ethnographie interdisciplinaire qui concerne les travailleurs migrants et la communication sur les chantiers de construction britanniques. Le travail de recherche presente vise a comprendre comment les ouvriers du batiment communiquent avec leur encadrement et entre eux et comment ils maintiennent leur securite sur les chantiers, l'objectif etant d'influer sur les strategies relatives a la securite et a la protection de la sante sur les chantiers, ainsi que sur la production et l'evaluation des materiels de formation et autres.

Project planning for construction under uncertainty with limited resources	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						project management; uncertainty principles; resource management; construction industry	CRITICAL-PATH METHOD; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Much of the project scheduling literature treats task durations as deterministic. In reality, however, task durations are subject to considerable uncertainty, and that uncertainty can be influenced by the resources assigned. The purpose of this paper is to provide the means for contractors to optimally allocate their skilled workers among individual tasks for a single project. Instead of the traditional use of schedules, we develop control policies in the form of planned resource allocation to tasks that capture the uncertainty associated with task durations and the impact of resource allocation on those durations. We develop a solution procedure for the model and illustrate the ideas in an example. The data for the example is collected from a real project.

If they are under designed, they lead to project delays, which are expensive. If they are over designed, then they cost more to construct than necessary. The accurate estimation of vertical transportation demands is necessary to optimally determine the temporary vertical transportation systems required. The current demand estimation process is mostly manual and, therefore, time-consuming and prone to errors. In this paper, a methodology to estimate vertical transportation demands during the construction of high-rise buildings is proposed, that is automated and, therefore, both faster and less prone to errors than the current manual process. The methodology exploits building information modeling (BIM), and improves estimates by explicitly considering (1) the demands related to the transportation of temporary construction systems (i.e., formwork, shoring and scaffolding systems), auxiliary construction resources (e.g., tools, equipment), construction waste, and construction workers, (2) the demands in different construction zones, (3) the demands for inter-floor transportation and transportation to non-construction locations, (4) the demands handled by all vertical transportation systems, and their availability in these over time. Four items that have not been simultaneously considered in previous research. The methodology is demonstrated by using it to estimate the vertical transportation demands for the construction of a 36-story high-rise reinforced concrete building. It is shown that the new process is faster and more accurate, and can be easily adjusted to account for changes.

Variation in construction tasks is important as it can impact productivity performance. Construction projects consist of a large number of interdependent tasks. When the starting time and/or duration of one task varies, it can affect other downstream tasks and result in disruptions to the schedule and/or decreased productivity. The construction process is complex and involves numerous people with different levels of responsibility, which makes identifying the root causes of the variation difficult. A nationwide survey was administered to workers, foremen, and project managers to identify the most prevalent causes and magnitude of both starting time and task duration variation. Fifty individual causes of variation were divided into eight categories: prerequisite work, detailed design/working method, labor force, tools and equipment, material and components, work/job site conditions, management/supervision/information flow, and weather or external conditions. This research examined the similarities and differences in perceptions between craft workers, foremen, and project managers in terms of starting time and task duration variation. The top eight causes of starting time variation and top nine causes of task duration variation were identified. The research also quantitatively analyzed the underlying structure of the causes of variation using factor analysis. This was done by grouping the 50 individual causes into nine orthogonal factors that represent the underlying structure of the affecting causes. The findings will help construction project managers and field managers focus on the root causes of variation during planning in order to develop effective strategies to reduce variation and improve project productivity performance.

Autonomous Mowing-Improving Efficiency and Safety of Roadside Vegetation Control	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Highways and roads; Maintenance; Landscaping; Automation; Robotics; Vegetation; Safety; California		This paper discusses the use of autonomous mowers for application in highway vegetation control. In recent work by these writers, a unique autonomous mower testbed has been developed to prove the efficacy of such an approach. The testbed's uniqueness comes from its relatively low cost and its new and accurate sensing method. The mowing performance is evaluated based on the consistency of consecutive mowing paths from actual outdoor testing. Then, a hypothetical implementation is used to evaluate the practicality of the system in California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) applications. Results show that autonomous mowers have the potential to significantly reduce Caltrans' dependence on herbicide, improve worker and public safety, lead to enhanced levels of environmental quality, and decrease the operation's costs.

J	Franz, B; Wang, T; Issa, RR				Franz, Bryan; Wang, Tong; Issa, Raja Raymond			Exploration of burnout in early-career construction management professionals in the USA	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Stress; Emotional exhaustion; Workforce; Project management; Millennial generation	SOCIAL SUPPORT; MARITAL-STATUS; JOB BURNOUT; WORK; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; TURNOVER; DEMANDS; STRESS; HEALTH	Purpose Construction managers face many work-related stressors induced by unrealistic schedule expectations, tight budgets, and long hours. Over time, these stressors can result in both mental and physical exhaustion, a condition referred to as burnout. Early-career managers are a key worker demographic, as they represent the near-term future of the construction industry, yet they have a high risk for burnout. The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence of burnout in new construction managers, and to identify which individual or work-related factors are associated with feelings of burnout. Design/methodology/approach Using the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS), data from 146 early-career professionals (less than 10 years of experience) with construction management degrees in the USA were collected and analyzed using correlational and best subset regression techniques. Findings The results show that the early-career demographic in the USA experiences both the Emotional Exhaustion and Cynicism dimensions of burnout at comparable levels to prior studies with more mid-to-late career respondents. However, the Professional Efficacy dimension was significantly higher in early-career professionals than any other sample. No individual factors, such as gender, marital status, or number of children, were predictive of any dimension of burnout. Instead, only work-related factors including co-worker friendliness, opportunities for personal development and promotion, and the ability to control the work pacing were strongly associated with one or more dimensions of burnout. Originality/value This study is the first to explore burnout in the key early-career demographic for construction managers in the United States construction industry. This work provides evidence that organizational policies and culture have a greater efficacy in alleviating burnout in this demographic, when compared to the work-life balance of the individual.

One ramification of this theory is that dispositional factors-such as sensation-seeking propensity-may contribute to the likelihood and nature of behavioral adaptations to safety interventions. Accordingly, this paper discusses a mixed-reality roofing simulation that explored sensation-seeking propensity as a determinant of individuals' risk-taking behavior. Three increasing levels of safety interventions (i.e., no intervention, injury-reducing intervention, and injury-preventing intervention) served as the experimental manipulations. Participant's motions, risk-taking behaviors, and risk perceptions were monitored using real-time location-tracking sensors and semistructured interviews. Collectively, the results demonstrated that risk propensity (in terms of sensation-seeking disposition) moderated the relationship between providing safety interventions and risk-taking behaviors. While participants in this study took significantly more risks when protected with a safety intervention-thereby demonstrating risk compensation due to a greater decline in perceived level of risk-those with a high sensation-seeking propensity especially adapted their behaviors to offset safety gains intended by interventions. Thus, individuals scoring high in sensation-seeking appear to form a unique high-risk propensity group of subjects. While students acting as unskilled roofing workers were recruited for this study, the findings provided an initial empirical understanding of how more safety protections might implicitly signal subjects with high-risk propensity to take additional risks and behave in riskier fashion without perceiving their behavior to be risky. This paper reveals the need to provide participants scoring high in sensation-seeking with injury-prevention interventions to counteract their excessive risk-taking and risk compensation behavior.

However, a survey of the existing classification systems of services shows that they are not designed specifically for the management of technology in services, and, thus, fall short when applied to such an environment. This paper describes and provides illustrations of a new framework which is useful for technology management in the service sector. The framework focuses on managing according to where the value is added in the service: in the technology (knowledge-embedded) or in the worker him/herself (knowledge-based). Additionally, the extent to which the service has a product component is also argued to be critical to the successful management of technology.

The long- term development of project workers, their career paths and their contribution to organizational success is explored. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews was employed to gain an understanding of social and human issues related to careers in project management (PM). By researching the lived experiences and feelings of those pursuing a career in PM the aim was to gain insight into the career journeys and experiences of practicing project managers. Findings - Those who choose to pursue a career in PM have the personal characteristics and sufficiently high levels of self-efficacy to deal effectively with the uncertainty inherent in the nature of projects and of project-based employment. Research limitations/implications - Participants were drawn from current project practitioners. As a result, the views of those who have worked on projects and chosen not to continue their career in the area have not been gathered. Practical implications - Predictions are that there will be a continuing demand for project managers with the capabilities required to deliver successful projects. The challenge for organizations is to create an environment that will encourage greater numbers of people to embrace the uncertainty of project. The findings reported provide insight into how organizations might attract, develop and retain the project expertise they require for success. Originality/value - This research provides further understanding into the lived experience of project managers, with a focus on those who have unexpectedly found themselves pursuing a career in PM.

J	Wang, J; Razavi, S				Wang, Jun; Razavi, Saiedeh			Spatiotemporal Network-Based Model for Dynamic Risk Analysis on Struck-by-Equipment Hazard	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction safety; Dynamic risk analysis; Network analysis; Struck-by hazard; Safety leading indicator; Spatiotemporal interaction	WORKERS-ON-FOOT; CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT; MISS INTERACTIONS; SAFETY	Having an approach that can analyze and identify safety risks in the dynamic and hazardous construction environment is one of the key steps to the success of health and safety plans. Struck-by-equipment hazard is one of the leading causes of construction injuries and fatalities. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate and provide an effective method of safety risk analysis on struck-by-equipment hazard. A spatiotemporal network-based model is developed in this paper which performs dynamic risk analysis on the struck-by-equipment hazard at both entity and network levels. The developed model performs safety risk analysis in a real-time and proactive manner by considering the spatiotemporal interactions among all construction entities (equipment and workers on foot) across the jobsite. Three risk factors of struck-by-equipment hazards were selected, including proximity, blind spots, and velocity. The interactions of the selected factors between entities are quantified and used to generate the network. Three safety leading indicatorsdegree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and relative risk scoreare adopted to represent the risk levels of individual entities and jobsites. The implementation and evaluation of the network-based model with the three leading indicators are conducted and illustrated based on four simulated jobsites. Accordingly, the derived practical applications for risk analysis and hazard identification and prevention are described. The work presented in this paper enables the quantification and analysis of struck-by-equipment risk for both individual entities and jobsites from multiple perspectives. Further insight into the temporal aspects of risk and the safety performance of entities, as well as jobsites, is gained to proactively identify and prevent hazards.

J	Chen, HN; Luo, XW				Chen, Hainan; Luo, Xiaowei			Exploring the Quantitative Impact of Localization Accuracy on Localization-Based Safety Monitoring's Performance on a Construction Jobsite	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Autonomous safety monitoring; Localization error; Monte Carlo simulation; Regression model; Precision and recall; Tower crane	TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; INSPECTION; TRACKING; SYSTEMS; MODEL	The construction industry continues to be one of the industries with the highest accident rate. With the recent advancement of computing and sensing technologies, more efforts have been made in the field of context-aware autonomous job site monitoring, which can automatically track and evaluate the worker's behavior and job site conditions in real time to issue warnings for unsafe behaviors and conditions on sites. The location of an entity (e.g., worker, equipment, or material) is one of the core information for context-aware management. Therefore, a large number of recent studies focus on exploring different approaches to improve the localization technologies' accuracy, robustness, and convenience of deployment. However, systematic knowledge is missing on how the localization algorithm's accuracy affects the construction safety monitoring's performance. To quantify the impact in this paper, first, a localization system accuracy model and three safety clearance models are proposed as the base. Second, a Monte Carlo simulation model is designed as an abstract representation for localization systems. By conducting the simulation, the effects of the localization errors on safety monitoring performance are quantitatively analyzed. A case of a tower crane scenario is investigated as a demonstration. With the simulation data, a regression model is established, indicating that the precision and recall of the location-based safety decision making are not only related to the accuracy of the localization system but also related to the size of the safety zones. With the proposed model, the impacts of a given localization system on the location-based safety decision making can be quantified without the actual deployment, offering a more straightforward evaluation tool of the localization system.

A vision-based marker-less pose estimation system for articulated construction robots	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						2D and 3D pose estimation; Stacked hourglass network; Human-robot collaboration; Construction safety	VISUAL RECOGNITION; RESOURCES; EQUIPMENT; MODEL	The prospect of human-robot collaborative work on construction sites introduces new workplace hazards that must be mitigated to ensure safety. Human workers working on tasks alongside construction robots must perceive the interaction to be safe in order to ensure team identification and trust. Detecting the robot pose in real-time is thus an essential requirement to inform the workers and to enable autonomous operation. Vision-based (marker-based, marker-less) and sensor-based are two of the primary methods for estimating robot pose. The marker-based and sensor-based methods require some additional preinstalled sensors or markers, whereas the marker-less method only requires an on-site camera system, which is common on today's construction sites. This research developed a marker-less pose estimation system for on-site articulated construction robots, which is based on a deep convolutional network human pose estimation algorithm: stacked hourglass network. Both 2D and 3D pose are estimated. The system is trained with image datasets collected from a robotic excavator and annotations of excavator pose, as well as conventional excavators working on construction sites. A KUKA robot arm with a bucket mounted on the end-effector was used to represent the robotic excavator in the experiments. The marker-less 3D method was evaluated, and the results were compared with the sensor-based results and the robot's ground truth pose. The results demonstrated that the marker-less 2D and 3D pose estimation methods are capable of performing proximity detection and object tracking on construction sites and can overcome the missing data issues encountered in the sensor-based method. However, the lower accuracy of the bucket pose estimation due to occlusion highlights the need for modifying the network and collecting additional datasets for training in future work.

J	Costin, A; Pradhananga, N; Teizer, J				Costin, Aaron; Pradhananga, Nipesh; Teizer, Jochen			Leveraging passive RFID technology for construction resource field mobility and status monitoring in a high-rise renovation project	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated field reports; RFID; Renovation project; Resource allocation; Safety and security; Work sampling; Workforce, material, and workforce tracking	CRANE PRODUCTIVITY; TRACKING	The hypothesis is that leveraging automated data collection technology for site status analysis would play a more significant role in advancing decision making in construction projects if applied to traditional labor intensive management work tasks. Such manual data record keeping is, for example, progress tracking measurements and reporting of daily work status and process flows. Recent research on material tracking has demonstrated that the implementation of automated material tracking technology is feasible. Studies have yet to demonstrate whether the same or other technology can be used on other resource types, including workers, and furthermore, in advancing technology that works bi-directional: (1) collect and analyze data, and (2) return automated feedback to the decision makers at the management or even the workforce level. Despite a rigorous cost-benefit, hardware reliability and safety tests, implementation of technology in field operations is often performed on an as-needs basis. Project based case studies are effective research tools to measure the benefits and barriers that technology comes with. This paper will demonstrate results to the design, development, and furthermore and mainly, the effective and affordable implementation of a state-of-the-art wireless passive RFID-based technology system that collects and distributes information from and to decision makers. The developed technology was tested for several consecutive months on more than 50 construction workers, material carts and work related items, and personnel and material lifts that were critical in a high-rise building renovation project. Metrics to measure success in the phases of data collection, the signal and data processing, and in the use of newly generated or already available information for advanced decision making based on passive RFID technology will be presented.

Social Media Data Analytics for the US Construction Industry: Preliminary Study on Twitter	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction industry; Social media; Twitter; Big data; United States	MANAGEMENT	The increasing use of the Internet for many purposes is creating big data, many of which are generated from social media. These big data potentially could assist in obtaining valuable administrative information and even explore new social phenomena. Traditional ways of collecting data, such as questionnaire surveys, are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, the use of social media affords the opportunity to extract information that might be of benefit to the construction industry in a responsive and inexpensive manner. To this end, this paper explores whether information and knowledge that would be valuable in the construction domain can be generated by analyzing social media data. Twitter was selected for an initial trial analysis because of its wide usage in the United States. Because they represent a majority of the construction users in Twitter, the following four user clusters were selected and analyzed: construction workers, construction companies, construction unions, and construction media. For each user identified in the four clusters, the 3,200 most recent Twitter messages were collected, which were analyzed from the following aspects: sentiment analysis, topic modeling, link analysis, geolocation analysis, and timeline analysis. Different data-analysis methods were used for the specific themes, such as Stanford Natural Language Processing (StanfordNLP) for sentiment analysis. The detailed findings, benefits, and barriers to incorporating social media data analytics in the construction industry, as well as future research directions, are discussed in this paper. For example, the sentiment analysis results indicated that construction workers tend to have a higher proportion of negative messages compared to the other clusters, which may prompt more attention to emotional guidance and understanding by construction companies and the public. This paper benefits academia by testing an alternative way of studying the construction population, which could help decision makers gain a better understanding of real-world situations in the construction industry.

J	Nnaji, C; Gambatese, J; Karakhan, A; Eseonu, C				Nnaji, Chukwuma; Gambatese, John; Karakhan, Ali; Eseonu, Chinweike			Influential safety technology adoption predictors in construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety management; Technology adoption; Success predictors; Mixed method	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; UNITED-STATES; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; HEALTH; ORGANIZATIONS; ANTECEDENTS; ACCEPTANCE	Purpose Existing literature suggests that construction worker safety could be optimized using emerging technologies. However, the application of safety technologies in the construction industry is limited. One reason for the constrained adoption of safety technologies is the lack of empirical information for mitigating the risk of a failed adoption. The purpose of this paper is to fill the research gap through identifying key factors that predict successful adoption of safety technologies. Design/methodology/approach In total, 26 key technology adoption predictors were identified and classified using a combination of literature review and an expert panel. The level of influence for each identified safety technology adoption predictor was assessed and ranked using the Relative Importance Index. Analysis of variance was performed as well to assess the potential difference in perceived level of importance for the predictors when the study participants were clustered according to work experience and company size. Findings Statistical analysis indicates that 12 out of the 26 predictors identified are highly influential regarding technology adoption decision-making in construction. Technology reliability, effectiveness and durability were ranked as the most influential predictors. The participants who work for small companies and who had less than ten years of experience rated individual- and technology-related predictors significantly lower than the experienced participants working for medium and large companies. Practical implications - The present study provides construction researchers and practitioners with valuable information regarding safety technology predictors and their magnitude, both of which are essential elements of a successful safety technology adoption process. Improved technology adoption can enhance workplace safety and minimize worker injuries, providing substantial benefits to the construction industry. Originality/value This study contributes to technology adoption knowledge by identifying and quantifying the influential predictors of safety technologies in relation to different organizational contexts. The study informs the need to develop an integrated conceptual model for safety technology adoption.

J	Newaz, MT; Davis, PR; Jefferies, M; Pillay, M				Newaz, Mohammad Tanvi; Davis, Peter Rex; Jefferies, Marcus; Pillay, Manikam			Validation of an agent-specific safety climate model for construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Management; Construction; Questionnaire survey; Construction safety	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT; FIT INDEXES; CULTURE; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; FULFILLMENT; INVARIANCE; ACCIDENTS	Purpose Safety climate (SC) is considered a leading indicator of safety performance, but scholars suggest that a common SC assessment framework is yet to be developed. Following the debate between the importance of facet analysis and agent analysis, the purpose of this paper is to test a factor structure, developed by the authors in previous work and arising from their systematic literature review, highlighting the role of safety agents in a construction site setting. Design/methodology/approach Multi-level SC surveys were conducted at five construction sites in Sydney, Australia, collecting data from of 352 workers associated with a mega-construction project. While examining the factor analysis of different studies, data reliability and data validity of the survey findings were ensured and a goodness-of-fit of SC model was examined through structural equation modelling. Findings The systematic literature review of Newaz et al. (2018) suggested a five-factor model of: management commitment, safety system, role of the supervisor, workers' involvement and group SC. However, empirical data indicated that the questionnaire used to measure "safety system" failed to pass scale reliability; thus, a four-factor model was proposed to develop an agent-specific SC factor structure in the construction industry. Originality/value The four-factor model indicates the role and level of influence of different safety agents to improve safety perceptions on construction sites. The findings of this study will encourage researchers in construction safety to use the simplified four-factor SC (agent-specific) model presented and test it to further develop a common factor structure for the construction industry. The fact that the model is comprised of four factors makes further implementation somewhat easier in the development of safety plans, and when considering the role of safety agents, therefore enhancing its potential value.

This allows the authors to identify and discuss what key trends are changing the nature of project organising work. The authors aim to identify what knowledge and which skills, attributes and experiences will be most likely valued and needed in 2030. Design/methodology/approach This paper is essentially a reflective review and is explorative in nature. The authors focus on several recent reports published in the UK and Australia that discuss the way that the future workforce will adapt and prepare for radical changes in the workplace environment. The authors focus on project organising work and the changing workplace knowledge, skills, attributes and experience (KSAE) needs of those working in project teams in 2030 and beyond. The authors draw upon existing KSAE literature including findings from a study undertaken into the KSAEs of project alliance managers working in a highly collaborative form of project delivery. Findings The analysis suggests that there is good and bad news about project workers prospects in 2030. The good news is that for those working in non-routine roles their work will be more interesting and rewarding than is the case for today. The bad news is that for workers in routine work roles, they will be replaced by advanced digital technology. Social implications The issue of the future workplace environment is highly relevant to the social context. Originality/value This paper is about a projected future some 12 years onward from today. It bridges a gap in any future debate about how project organising jobs may change and how they will be delivered in the 2030s.

J	Han, S; Lee, S; Pena-Mora, F				Han, SangUk; Lee, SangHyun; Pena-Mora, Feniosky			Comparative Study of Motion Features for Similarity-Based Modeling and Classification of Unsafe Actions in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety; Motion capture; Action recognition; Dimension reduction; Machine learning; Classification	SAFETY; FUSION; PERFORMANCE	Rapid development of motion sensors and video processing has triggered growing attention to action recognition for safety and health analysis, as well as operation analysis, in construction. Specifically for occupational safety and health, worker behavior monitoring allows for the automatic detection of workers' unsafe actions and for feedback on their behavior, both of which enable the proactive prevention of an accident by reducing the number of unsafe actions that occur. Previous studies provide insight into tracking human movements and recognizing actions, but further research efforts are needed to understand the following characteristics of motion data, which can significantly affect classification performances: (1) various motion data types extracted from motion capture data, (2) variations of postures and actions, and (3) temporal and sequential relations of motion data. This paper thus presents a modeling and classification methodology for the recognition of unsafe actions, particularly focusing on (1) the description and comparison of four motion data types (i.e., rotation angles, joint angles, position vectors, and movement direction) that will be used as a feature for classification, (2) the estimation of actions' mean trajectory in order to model various patterns of action, and (3) the classification of actions based on spatial-temporal similarity. With a concentration on motion analysis, experiments were undertaken for the modeling and detection of actions during ladder climbing using an red, green, blue plus depth (RGB-D) sensor. Through the experimental study, we found that the proposed approach performs well (i.e., an accuracy of up to 99.5% in lab experiments), that a rotation angle outperforms a joint angle and a position vector, and that movement direction explicitly improves the accuracy of motion classification as combined with each of the other three.

The data details 137,323 injuries and 2846 deaths, and includes age, sex, and length of service of each accident victim, as well as the type of construction, employer scale, and date of the accident. Upon describing the distribution of the dataset, machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost analyses were applied with the derivation of major variables influencing classification in each algorithm. A comparison of the performance of each model showed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to be highest for the random forest method, at 0.9198, which translates to a 91.98% successful predictive rate in terms of classifying workers who could face a high fatality risk. The random forest analysis of this study indicates that the month (season) and employment size are the most influential factors, followed by age, weekday, and service length based on mean decrease Gini values to predict the likelihood of a fatality accident. Moreover, this analysis generated ensemble predictions based on all the factors contained in the dataset. Hence, this study demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning in the construction safety management area. The results obtained can contribute to the prevention of accidents by raising awareness of potential safety risks, by quantitatively predicting fatal accidents and incorporating the findings with a manpower control system at a construction site.

J	Goel, A; Ganesh, LS; Kaur, A				Goel, Ashish; Ganesh, L. S.; Kaur, Arshinder			Social sustainability considerations in construction project feasibility study: a stakeholder salience perspective	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project feasibility study; Construction; Social sustainability; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder salience	LONGITUDINAL CONTENT-ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DECISION-MAKING; IMPACT ANALYSIS; DESIGN; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT; LICENSE; KEY	Purpose Past research recommends integration of social sustainability (SS) considerations in construction project feasibility study for benefitting a larger group of project stakeholders. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to this effect, especially from the developing economies. The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap through a SS-centric analysis of feasibility study reports using a stakeholder salience perspective. Design/methodology/approach Feasibility study reports for 61 projects were obtained from various government organizations in India. The SS considerations were identified in the reports using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The former was based on content analysis and the latter was conducted using "VOSviewer" text analysis software. Findings SS considerations related to occupational health and safety, workers' employment practices and proactive involvement of communities and end-users were found to be inadequately addressed in the reports. Based on occurrences of the SS considerations, project-affected community was found to be the most salient stakeholder, followed by the end-users and the construction workers. Statistical analysis revealed significant relationship between the SS considerations and the type of project as well as the type of project delivery system. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of integrating SS considerations in feasibility study of construction projects. Its results provide useful inputs to decision-makers for orienting construction projects, right from the early phases, towards benefitting the disadvantaged and weaker stakeholders irrespective of their salience attributes. In developing economies, such interventions may improve quality of lives of a large number of project stakeholders and also cultivate a positive societal image of the construction industry as a respectful, ethical and employee friendly industry.

J	Kolar, Z; Chen, HN; Luo, XW				Kolar, Zdenek; Chen, Hainan; Luo, Xiaowei			Transfer learning and deep convolutional neural networks for safety guardrail detection in 2D images	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Computer vision; Construction safety; Guardrail detection; Convolutional neural networks; Transfer learning; VGG-16	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; OBJECT DETECTION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; TRACKING; POSTURE	Safety has been a concern for the construction industry for decades. Unsafe conditions and behaviors are considered as the major causes of construction accidents. The current safety inspection of conditions and behaviors heavily rely on human efforts which are limited onsite. To improve the safety performance of the industry, a more efficient approach to identify the unsafe conditions on site is required to supplement the current manual inspection practice. A promising way to supplement the current manual safety inspection is automated and intelligent monitoring/inspection through information and sensing technologies, including localization techniques, environment monitoring, image processing and etc. To assess the potential benefits of contemporary technologies for onsite safety inspection, the authors focused on real-time guardrail detection, as unprotected edges are the ones cause for workers falling from heights. In this paper, the authors developed a safety guardrail detection model based on convolutional neural network (CNN). An augmented data set is generated with the addition of background image to guardrail 3D models and used as training set. Transfer learning is utilized and the Visual Geometry Group architecture with 16 layers (VGG-16) model is adopted to construct the basic features extraction for the neural network. In the CNN implementation, 4000 augmented images were used to train the proposed model, while another 2000 images collected from real construction jobsites and 2000 images from Google were used to validate the proposed model. The proposed CNN-based guardrail detection model obtained a high accuracy of 96.5%. In addition, this study indicates that the synthetic images generated by augment technology can be used to create a large training dataset, and CNN-based image detection algorithm is a promising approach in construction jobsite safety monitoring.

A literature review has identified a number of independent constructs with the potential to affect the safety climate. A research model was developed based on the hypothesis that safe work behaviors are consequences of the existing safety climate, which, in turn, is determined by the identified independent constructs. A questionnaire survey was used in order to facilitate the collection of information from construction sites. The model was tested using structural equation modeling. The paper presents the results of testing the research model. The results corroborate the importance of the role of management commitment, communication, workers' involvement, attitudes, competence, as well as supportive and supervisory environments, in achieving a positive safety climate.

J	Kim, SK; Russell, JS				Kim, SK; Russell, JS			Framework for an intelligent earthwork system - Part I. System architecture	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction automation; earthwork; intelligent system; agent-based system		Recently, there has been an increase in the demand to enhance the intelligence of construction equipment and systems. Especially for semiautonomous and autonomous systems that have great potential for impact on the construction industry, artificial intelligence approaches are required to generate instructions and plans necessary to perform tasks in dynamically changing environments on their own. The framework for an intelligent earthwork system (IES) is suggested by the authors. It generates a plan automatically for construction equipment, provides a means of cooperation between construction equipment seamlessly, and improves worker safety. This paper describes some factors that can affect earthwork operation performance, five emerging technologies that can be adapted to implement an IES, the system architecture, and the system control strategy for IES.

Building upon such a perspective, a quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted, with 247 project managers and workers participating. Principal component analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were performed. The results reveal that OCB not only facilitates meeting the "iron triangle" (time, budget, quality) of project management but also improves the relationship quality among individual actors beyond the termination of projects. This relationship is partially moderated by project duration. The implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

Analyzing a panel data on 52 public accounting firms in Taiwan for ten years from 1993 to 2002, our results indicate that the productivity growth of these accounting firms was primarily due to their accumulation of IT capital. In addition, our results indicate that services diversification towards nonaudit services and workforce quality contributed to accounting firms' IT capital accumulation, which, in turn, led to their productivity growth.

With a growing recognition of organizational followers as a backdrop, this article reports on basic research comparing attributes of leaders and followers and seeks to provide recommendations for enhancing the leadership development process in engineering organizations. Using theories proffered by Sashkin (Visionary Leadership) and Chaleff (Courageous Followers) as an experimental framework, data was collected from technology workers (N = 111) and analyzed to ascertain the nature of leader-follower correlations in an effort to further explore intrapersonal leader-follower relations and exchange. The analysis indicates the concepts are correlated. Based on the correlation, recommendations are provided for the leadership development process.

A general model architecture of image captioning is then instituted by combining an encoder -decoder framework with deep neural networks, followed by three experimental tests involving the selection of model learning strategies and performance evaluation metrics. It is demonstrated the method's performance is comparable with that of state-of-the-art computer vision methods in general.

The cleaning work is difficult and extremely dangerous for human workers, and there are several ongoing studies to automate this work by robotic solutions. To achieve successful cleaning performance, the cleaning operation must adapt to the environmental conditions. In this study, we design and assemble a manipulator for use in wall-cleaning applications. From the design requirements identified by investigating a high-rise building in Korea, we determine the two important degrees of freedom (DOF) and design a parallel mechanism to achieve motion. With the parallel configuration, the design parameters are optimized based on a dynamic index to achieve high cleaning performance on a scaffold. A prototype is assembled, and the cleaning performance is verified on a test bench. A field test with the developed manipulator will be performed in the near future.

Two objectives are proposed in the optimization processes when such schedules are created. These objectives include minimizing the time for completing jobs and minimizing any extra energy expended by laborers due to inappropriate work assignments that force them to work longer than the maximum acceptable work duration. A GA-based mechanism was developed to search the Pareto front, which is one of the effective ways for solving multiobjective optimization problems.

Therefore, formwork engineering is a key factor affecting project success. Traditional formwork construction entails non-value-adding activities resulting in waste. The objective of this study is to adapt lean manufacturing techniques to formwork engineering in a bid to reduce waste, specifically by developing a lean formwork construction model. In the model, andon is used to establish an on-site quality control culture, allowing form workers to obtain assistance immediately whenever a problem occurs. In addition, formwork operations are pulled through the kanban system to reduce mould inventory and achieve continuous construction flow. A case study is used to validate the applicability of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce waste in the formwork construction flow and increase the value of operations, thus providing a new approach to improving formwork engineering.

Accident prevention begins with having a clear understanding of the causes of these accidents. This paper discusses the analysis of 296 fatality reports related to trenching operations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the 1997-2001 time frame. In this paper, two models will be considered to analyze the fatality reports and to find the major relationships between the "how" and the "why" of trenching fatalities. The first model considers the causes related to physical processes, and the second model evaluates causes that can be linked to human behavior. The understanding of the major links between these two models and other factors will help to develop more effective strategies to prevent trenching fatalities.

One of the critical ingredients of innovation is the source of the idea or inspiration for the innovation. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative importance of 14 different sources of product and process innovation as reported by 235 professional R&D workers in large and small technology-based firms. While overall there was agreement on the importance of a number of sources, R&D professionals in SMEs valued customers, coworkers, marketing, and journals more highly, while professionals in large firms valued suppliers more highly. Implications of these results, in light of the previous research studies on innovation, are addressed.

However, scholars have yet to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these links. In this study, we sought to investigate the mediating influences of commitment, team satisfaction, and turnover intention on these associations. An analysis of data collected from 341 project team members in large-scale construction projects showed that construction project workers with higher emotional intelligence exhibit higher satisfaction, greater commitment towards their job, and lower turnover intentions. Additionally, role ambiguity acts to weaken the positive association between team satisfaction and performance. This research contributes to project management literature and has clear implications for building and training project teams in large-scale construction projects.

Research shows that such buildings are detrimental to their occupants' wellbeing and productivity, sometimes causing them to feel overcooled or overheated. This post-occupancy evaluation illustrates such problems through the case study of a courthouse building in a hot arid environment. A strong association is shown between occupant satisfaction, building ventilation and sense of wellbeing at work. A positive correlation was found between satisfaction with personal control, and overall satisfaction survey results show that workers express a willingness to compromise future salary rises in order to receive operable windows. Key lessons for architects are discussed.

Decrement of operators' hazard detection ability resulting from attention failure is a leading cause of these accidents. Although mental fatigue induced by prolonged and monotonous operating tasks is known as the primary cause of this type of failure, little is revealed on how mental fatigue influences operators' ability to detect hazardous situations and associated visual attention features. To address this issue, this study uses wearable eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impact of mental fatigue on operators' ability in hazard detection and the corresponding patterns of visual attention allocation. Twelve healthy participants performed a simulated excavator operating task in a laboratory experiment. Subjective mental fatigue assessment, hazard detection task performance, and eye movement metrics were recorded and analyzed. In the experiment, mental fatigue was effectively induced and manipulated by a Time-On-Operating (TOO) procedure. Results revealed that operators' hazard detection ability decreased with the increase in subjective mental fatigue level, reflected by significant increases in reaction time for hazards and the number of misdetections. Attention allocation-related data were further analyzed to explain the specific manifestations of hazard detection failure in visual attention. The results indicated that the decrease of operators' hazard detection ability is associated with the changes of the distributions of fixation and gaze point while mental fatigue level increases. Consequently, clear observation of surrounding hazards and related details becomes difficult for operators. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of wearable eye-tracking technology in measuring and quantifying operators' mental fatigue and hazard detection ability. More importantly, the findings offer insights into the impairing effect of mental fatigue on operators' hazard detection ability from a visual attention perspective. Such insights provide a solid basis for developing effective safety interventions and attentional guidance-based safety training methods to mitigate relevant site accidents.

Convolutional networks are used to detect construction equipment in the tunnel CCTV video and the context of the earthmoving process is inferred by the context reasoning process. The construction equipment detection model exhibited enhanced performance, with a mean average precision of 99.09%, and the error rate of the estimated context information was only 1.6% of the actual earthmoving context measured by a human. The estimated context information was used as an input for the WebCYCLONE simulation to generate a productivity and cost analysis report. Sensitivity analysis regarding construction equipment provided a new equipment allocation plan that could reduce the cost of the current earthmoving process by 12.25%.

In the planning process, assigned loads and quantitative capacity are well defined quantitatively through quantity takeoff and database estimation. However, tracking and managing such workforce information, including skills, accident history and experiences, is a challenging task. This research seeks to develop a prototype workforce information database system that defines not only quantitative data but also qualitative measures in relation to load and capacity. A workforce information database system is described for use in workforce-level production planning. This database system tracks the daily quantitative and qualitative production capacities of each worker. The paper also explored the benefits and its applicability in production planning through a survey.

It is a contentious practice: Managers seek effective ways to monitor work, unions demand an end to the systems, and legislators debate the appropriate degree of control over the practice. Yet little is known about why certain applications or designs of electronic monitors are acceptable, while others are not. Quantitative and qualitative data from a survey of 1500 service workers demonstrated that four factors (tasks measured, frequency of measurement, object of measurement, recipient of data) can be altered to significantly affect the acceptability of a monitor design. A fifth significant factor was the perception that computers are appropriate evaluation devices in a given job. These findings can help businesses, unions, and governments understand how to design acceptable monitors.

The reason is that navigating in highly unstructured and dynamic indoor environments remains a great challenge. Therefore, we present a hallway explorationinspired guidance approach (HEIGA), which guides an agent to its destination based on a series of directional guidance without the need for self-localization in a global frame. A series of experiments were conducted which prove that fully autonomous material transportation can be realized without being influenced by the complexity or dynamics of real construction sites. We expect this new approach to effectively: (i)free workers from heavy and repetitive material transportation tasks; and (ii) improve construction productivity. In the future, the presented approach will be applied in construction sites considering multi-robot collaboration, aiming at a higher material transportation efficiency.

To acquire an understanding of the developments and applications of computer vision research within the field of construction, we performed a detailed bibliometric and scientometric analysis of the normative literature from 2000 to 2018. We identified the primary areas where computer vision has been applied, including defect inspection, safety monitoring, and performance analysis. By performing a mapping exercise, a detailed analysis of the computer vision literature enables the identification of gaps in knowledge, which provides a platform to support future research in this fertile area for construction.

J	Young-Corbett, DE				Young-Corbett, Deborah E.			Prevention through Design: Health Hazards in Asphalt Roofing	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Health hazards; Construction equipment; Construction methods; Construction materials and methods	CONSTRUCTION; WORKERS	The optimal method of preventing occupational illnesses, injuries, and fatalities is to design out the hazards and risks, thereby eliminating the need to control them during work operations. In 2007, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched a national Prevention through Design (PtD) initiative calling on all major industrial sectors to emphasize hazard mitigation at the design stage. PtD applies to the design of all tools, equipment, materials, and work processes that are employed during the construction process. This article reviews the asphalt roofing health hazards and currently available design solutions for their control and identifies gaps and priorities for further research. PtD solutions such as tanker systems, insulated hot luggers, mechanical asphalt spreaders, fume-suppressing asphalt, and local exhaust ventilation systems are discussed in terms of effectiveness and availability.

The idea leading to the present development is that measuring the location of workers at regular time intervals, using Automated Data Collection (ADC), enables the generation of labor-input data automatically. The paper presents the difficulties and challenges of developing such an Automated Project Performance Control (APPC) system, and proposes a solution using ADC. Enabling technologies for ADC are identified and systematically evaluated. Based on the findings, a theoretical ADC model is presented. The main finding of the paper is that an ADC system is feasible using three different technologies. A number of additional applications of the principles presented in the paper are also discussed.

In order to encourage better management, the European Union has set up a minimal 70% recovering rate - in mass for building and public works by 2020. And to help deconstruction companies to reach this aim without extra cost or delays, a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm is suggested. The algorithm will work out a deconstruction strategy - i.e. type of waste treatment, number of required workers... - and will take into account three objectives - cost, delay and recovering rate - with 17 decision variables. Use on a real deconstruction situation highlights the interest of the algorithm. Eight optimization algorithms were tested and the most efficient algorithm is Decomposition-Based Evolutionary Algorithm. It came up with better strategies than the company one. This work proves that environmental performance can be improved without increasing cost or delay.

The main results reveal similar (no) influential factors on efficiency. For all models, the determinants found were capital intensity, prefinancial and postfinancial crisis periods, and workers' skills. There was no difference in terms of sign and statistical significance. Firm age was positively related to efficiency in two of the three models. Firm size was not significant in any model. Finally, the average efficiency values obtained by the models are 55.3, 69.2, and 91.0%, suggesting the possibility of significant improvements in resource management.

It is thus essential to investigate the physical demands of body movement in the construction manufacturing workplace to proactively identify worker exposure to ergonomic risk. This paper proposes a methodology to use three-dimensional (3D) skeletal modeling to imitate human body movement in an actual construction manufacturing plant for ergonomic risk assessment of a workstation. The inputs for the creation of an accurate and reliable 3D model are also identified. Through 3D modeling, continuous human body motion data can be obtained (such as joint coordinates and joint angles) for risk assessment analysis using existing risk assessment algorithms. The presented framework enables risk evaluation by detecting awkward body postures and evaluating the handled force/load and frequency that cause ergonomic risks during manufacturing operations. The results of the analysis are expected to facilitate the development of modified work to the workstation, which will potentially reduce injuries and workers' compensation insurance costs in the long term for construction manufacturers. The proposed framework can also be expanded to evaluate workstations in the design phase without the need for physical imitation by human subjects. In this paper, the proposed 3D visualization-based ergonomic risk assessment methodology is validated through an optical marker-based motion capture experiment for a lifting task in order to prove the feasibility and reliability of the framework. It is also compared to the traditional manual observation method. Three subjects are selected to conduct the experiment and three levels of comparison are completed: joint angles comparison, risk rating comparison for body segments, and Rapid Entire Body Assessment/Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (REBA/RULA) total risk rating and risk level comparison.

In this paper, a new safety assessment method, termed the 4D Interactive Safety Assessment, is described which offers an improvement. This involves individual construction workers being presented with 4D virtual risky scenarios concerning their project and a range of possible actions for selection. The method provides an analysis of results which include the assessment of the correctness or otherwise of the user's selections to contribute to an iterative process of retraining and testing until a satisfactory level of knowledge and skill is achieved.

J	Maloney, WF				Maloney, WF			Strategic planning for human resource management in construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The rate of change in the external environments of construction organizations is increasing, which necessitates that increased attention be paid to strategic planning and, in particular, strategic planning for human resource management. Strategies may be intentional and their implementation deliberate before they become realized. Intentional strategies may also not be realized and are thus discarded. Strategies may also be unintentional, i.e., they simply emerge from the things that an organization does. Human resource management strategies tend to be emergent. With the changes taking place in its external environments, a construction organization must attempt to develop deliberate human resource management strategies. In developing these strategies, a construction organization must address issues such as the organization's strategic vision, its view of human resources, whether it has a management or a worker driven orientation, whether it has a short-term or a long-term orientation, production technologies, workforce diversity, and the availability of a skilled workforce.

The Project Involvement Index, psychological distress, and psychological well-being: Comparing workers from projectized and non-projectized organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Psychological distress; Well-being; Organizational structure	MENTAL-HEALTH; STRAIN; METAANALYSIS; VALIDATION	It is important to understand the extent to which project involvement affects mental health. As projects and project management expand beyond traditional fields, it is also important to compare project involvement and mental health across settings that vary in terms of management structure. This study is the first to validate a Project Involvement Index (PII) useful in various settings to understand how workload relates to mental health defined as high psychological well-being and low psychological distress. Our results demonstrate that the PII is parsimonious measure showing reliability, predictive validity, and discriminant validity. Furthermore, results show that people involved in projects from a non-projectized organization show less mental health than those from a projectized organization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

In particular, fall accidents constitute the majority of these accidents, and therefore appropriate managing measures are needed. In this study, a safety monitoring system was established at a site where fall accidents often occurred, with the aim of reducing the rate of fatal accidents on the construction site. The system consisted of a mobile sensing device for detecting the worker's approach, transmitter sets and repeaters for sending the detected information to a receiver. and exclusive software for interpreting this information. The system was applied to a real construction site and tested in order to verify its utility and efficiency. It is expected that the system will decrease the potential for fall accidents and increase the efficiency of safety management. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Improving Hazard-Recognition Performance and Safety Training Outcomes: Integrating Strategies for Training Transfer	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety training; Hazard identification; Hazard recognition; Training transfer; Training delivery; Safety management; Labor and personnel issues	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; IDENTIFICATION; MODEL	Most construction safety activities focus on managing identified hazards. Hazards that remain unrecognized, and as a result unmanaged, can potentially result in catastrophic and unexpected injuries. Therefore, proper hazard recognition is foundational to the success of any safety program. However, recent research has revealed that a large proportion of construction hazards remain unrecognized in construction projects. To improve hazard recognition performance, employers provide their workers with safety and hazard recognition training. Despite these efforts, desirable levels of hazard recognition have not been achieved, and the anticipated return on investment (ROI) from training has not been attained. Such failures in training efforts are partly because knowledge acquired through training programs is often not transferred or applied in the workplace. Subsequently, training efforts do not alter work practices or behavior once workers return to the field. Other reasons for training failure include improper training delivery and the adoption of low-engagement training methods. To advance theory and practice in hazard recognition, training transfer, and training delivery, the objectives of this study were to (1)identify training transfer elements that maximize the transfer of safety training, (2)evaluate the relative effectiveness of the identified training transfer elements in transferring safety knowledge gained through training programs, and (3)assess the interaction effect between training method (i.e.,high-engagement versus low-engagement training) and training transfer levels on hazard recognition performance. The objectives of the study were accomplished by gathering input from construction industry experts through interviews, questionnaire surveys, and the analysis of empirical data gathered from 51 case projects in the United States. The results of the study revealed that training efforts may be undermined if training transfer elements are not synergistically adopted. Specifically, the findings suggest that safety training is necessary, but is not sufficient to maximize training outcomes such as hazard recognition. To maximize safety training outcomes, employers must adopt training transfer elements along with high-engagement training methods. This study represents the first formal attempt to evaluate the role of training transfer elements in the construction context.

J	Yan, XL; Kim, YC				Yan, Xiaoli; Kim, Young-Chan			A conceptual framework of ITSMCA for a building collapse accident	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Conceptual framework; IT support; Building collapse accident; Stage model; Contributing factors; Attributes variation	TIME SAFETY MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION SITES; VIDEO SURVEILLANCE; SYSTEM; INDUSTRY; TECHNOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; WORKERS; MODELS; CRISIS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to timely control of a construction collapse accident effectively during its development process by constructing a stage model and then aligning IT with each stage to help provide the information for decision making. Design/methodology/approach Through comprehensive literature review, this paper first identifies the various IT applications in on-site construction monitoring and analyzes the existed disaster/crisis stage models, also the stage models are compared with the causation models to illustrate the strengths. Then, a three-step methodology was conducted to develop and apply the conceptual framework, including the construction of the four-stage model; the establishment of the conceptual framework of information technology (IT) support for management of construction accidents (ITSMCA); and a building collapse accident used to illustrate the proposed framework. Findings The accident is divided into four stages, which are incubation stage, outbreak stage, spreading stage and final stage. The real-time staged information to support decision making, such as the contributing factors of on-site workers, materials, equipment and workplace, can be provided by emerging IT. Therefore, IT is aligned with the variations of contributing factors' attributes in the four stages and ITSMCA is constructed to help accidents management. Research limitations/implications The focus of the framework presented in this paper is that the stage model is effective for it catches the variations of the attributes whose values can be provided by IT rather than research on the practical application of the IT system. The construction and application of the IT system will be the research focus in the future.

The objectives are to determine the level of management efforts made by contractors oil H&S and their correlation with H&S performance. To achieve these objectives, a field Survey involving a sample of 40 contractors selected by stratified random sampling from the contractors registered with the Federation of Construction Industry of Nigeria was carried Out. For the study, 6 H&S management variables and 7 H&S performance variables were selected. The H&S management variables are in compliance with H&S regulations, provision of H&S facilities, structures for managing H&S in head and site offices, provision of PPE and H&S incentives, while the H&S performance variables are respondents' assessment of the performance of structures for managing H&S in head and site offices, accident, injury, accident per worker. injury per worker and injury per accident rates. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analysed by mean and Spearman correlation test. The results reveal that contractors' efforts on structures for managing H&S oil site are the best correlates of H&S performance, but their level is low. The levels of contractors' efforts in provision of PPE, compliance with H&S regulations are high, but these efforts are not correlates of H&S performance. The levels of contractors efforts in structures for managing H&S in head office and provision of H&S incentives are low and they have low correlation with H&S performance. The Study considers these results as indication that the management efforts made by Nigerian contractors to ensure a healthy and safe work environment are yet to have meaningful impact. It Suggests increased efforts on local H&S regulations. Structures for managing H&S in both head and site off-ices and provision of H&S incentives as measures for improving safety in the Nigerian construction industry.

It is crucial for stakeholders to have insightful information on regional input of resources and output of productive efficiency for making policies and investment decisions. The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficiency measurement for the CE and explore the regional differences of construction productive efficiency across the three regions of China. Design/methodology/approach Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an objective benchmarking methodology used for measuring the performance of construction productivity. Distance friction minimization (DFM) approach, based on DEA model, is applied to identify the causes of inefficiency, sources of growth and the optimal paths to efficient frontier for regional CE. Further studies are conducted to provide insightful information for efficiency improvement, according to DFM modeling results and empirical analysis. Findings The results indicate that eastern region leads construction development due to strong performance of coastal provinces. Faced with decreasing supply of skilled workers in developed region, investing more on construction plants and equipment for labor savings is more efficient to the long-term productivity growth of CE in the east. For developing midland region, heavy reliance on cheap manpower should be gradually relieved by allocating more budgets to vocational training and education program to boost quality labor supply, as well as making steady investment on construction equipment and advanced technology. In underdeveloped western region, raising construction labor wages is recommended to attract more workers to meet the market demand and achieve an optimal production efficiency in the CE. Originality/value The findings provide insights into the causes of inefficiency, the sources of growth and the best strategies for efficiency improvement in regional CE, recommendations are made for policy making and strategic planning to enhance the overall performance of China's construction productive efficiency.

This paper reports upon field research analysis of the hand-arm vibration (HAV) exposure levels of utility workers in the UK construction sector when operating hand-held vibrating power tools. Design/methodology/approach An empirical epistemological lens was adopted to analyse primary quantitative data on the management of hand-held tool trigger times (seconds) collected from field studies. To augment the analysis further, an interpretivist perspective was undertaken to qualitatively analyse interviews held with the participating company's senior management team after field study results. This approach sought to provide further depth and perspective on the emergent numerical findings. Findings The findings reveal that none of the operatives were exposed above the exposure limit value (ELV) and that 91.07% resided under the exposure action value (EAV). However, the Burr four parameter probability model (which satisfied the Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared goodness of fit tests at alpha 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 levels of significance) illustrated that given the current data distribution pattern, there was a 3% likelihood that the ELV will be exceeded. Model parameters could be used to: forecast the future probability of HAV exposure levels on other utility contracts and provide benchmark indicators to alert senior management to pending breaches of the ELV. Originality/value HAV field trials are rarely conducted within the UK utilities sector, and the research presented is the first to develop probability models to predict the likelihood of operatives exceeding the ELV based upon field data. Findings presented could go some way to preserving the health and well-being of workers by ensuing that adequate control measures implemented (e.g. procuring low vibrating tools) mitigate the risk posed.

J	Namian, M; Albert, A; Zuluaga, CM; Behm, M				Namian, Mostafa; Albert, Alex; Zuluaga, Carlos M.; Behm, Michael			Role of Safety Training: Impact on Hazard Recognition and Safety Risk Perception	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety training; Safety management; Hazard identification; Hazard recognition; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Training delivery; Training method; Labor and personnel issues	CONSTRUCTION; HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION; BEHAVIOR	Hazard recognition and the accurate perception of safety risk are fundamental to the success of any safety program. When hazards remain unrecognized, or the associated safety risk is underestimated, the likelihood of catastrophic and unexpected injuries dramatically increase. Unfortunately, recent research has found that a large number of hazards in construction remain unrecognized. Likewise, past studies have demonstrated that safety risk is widely underestimated within construction. To improve hazard recognition and the accurate perception of safety risk, employers adopt a wide variety of training programs. However, the prevalent use of ineffective and unengaging training methods have significantly impeded training efforts in construction. The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of safety training on two objective training outcomes: hazard recognition performance and safety risk perception. The research objectives were accomplished by gathering empirical data from 51 active projects in the United States. Specifically, data pertaining to the training method (i.e.,high-engagement versus low-engagement training) adopted at the project level were gathered, following which the hazard recognition ability of representative workers and their safety risk perception levels were measured. The results of the study revealed that (1)compared to low-engagement training, high-engagement training is associated with higher levels of hazard recognition and safety risk perception; and (2)the effect of training on safety risk perception is mediated by hazard recognition performance. Therefore, workers representing projects that offered high-engagement training were able to identify a larger proportion of hazards, and consequently perceived that safety risk was relatively higher. The findings of this study will be useful to practicing professionals seeking to improve training delivery, hazard recognition performance, and the perception of safety risk within construction. This study represents the first formal attempt to empirically evaluate the holistic relationship between training, hazard recognition, and safety risk perception in the construction context.

However, there is a lack of research efforts comparing and evaluating virtual manipulation hardware for construction tasks. Moreover, the current practice of virtual manipulation has limited functionality to guide users with the placement of objects in virtual environments. To address these issues, this paper presents 1) a detailed case study that compares three types of manipulation hardware (image-based, infrared-based, and magnetic-based) for construction applications and 2) a snap-to-fit method that improves the VM through solving limitations of the advanced virtual reality interaction metaphors. The latter enhances the placement process for manipulation by comparing two models (e.g., scan and BIM models) for proper placement in assembly scenarios. The case study results show that magnetic-based systems outperform others in construction scenarios. Lastly, the snap-to-fit function was validated in terms of accuracy and time performance.

Development of an accident modelling in the Hong Kong construction industry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; accident modelling; construction; Hong Kong	SAFETY CLIMATE; SYSTEM; IMPLEMENTATION; WORKERS; HEALTH	Safety is always an important issue in the construction industry. An increasing number of construction projects are carried out in the recent decades to meet the ever increasing demand from population increase. To grasp the growth rate of construction accidents, safety measures and planning are necessary. Indeed, it is essential to forecast the accident rates based on relative factors to support an efficient planning and propose suitable safety measures for lowering the accident numbers. This paper aims to examine the potential accident-related factors and investigate their relationship with accident rates by developing a forecasting model. Three types of accident-related factors including working conditions, environmental factors and management actions are selected for investigating their relationship with the construction accident rates. The result indicates the forecasting model with efficiency up to 56.7%. It is also showed the accident rate highly depends on the number of vacancies, the number of days with lightening and tropical cyclones.	[Tsang, Y. T.; Fung, Ivan W. H.; Lu, C.

Common approaches for detecting missing barricades (e.g., manual inspection of the site or three-dimensional models) are not practical due to two inherent challenges: (1) these approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming; and (2) FFH hazards are dynamic and changing as construction work progresses. To address these challenges, two computer vision-based detection approaches, including Masks Comparison Approach (MCA) and Missing Object Detection Approach (MODA), are developed in this study to automatically detect missing barricade. The performance of the proposed approaches and their benefits and implementation challenges were evaluated through a case study. The results demonstrate that MODA can achieve better performance and have several implementation advantages over MCA. The average precision and average recall for MODA were 57.9% and 73.6%, respectively. These two approaches can help site managers take action promptly to reduce the risks of FFH accidents.

Expert knowledge in the making: using a processual lens to examine expertise in construction	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Becoming; intuition; la duree (duration); organization theory; process philosophy	DELIBERATE PRACTICE; COMPETENCE; PROFESSIONALISM; ROUTINES; WORKERS	Expertise in construction has typically been associated with the esoteric, where experts occupy privileged positions through their possession of specialist skills and knowledge. In this conceptual piece, an attempt is made to broaden this view of expertise found in the construction management literature by drawing on a reading of the process philosophical writings of Henri Bergson and others. Re-reading expertise from a processual standpoint, it is argued that our conceptualization of expertise in construction management should move beyond its treatment as a thing to bring to the fore expertise as an open-ended, ongoing, ever-evolving process of becoming. At the heart of this ontological shift of expertise in construction lies the emphasis on the tacit and recognition that expertise is, at the same time, interactional, intuitive and incidental. These ideas are illustrated in a vignette of environmental expertise in an airport context.

In order to extract the uranium ore remotely, thus ensuring minimal radiation dose to workers and also to access the ore from stable ground, the Jet Boring System (JBS) was developed by Cameco Corporation. This system uses a high-powered water jet to remotely excavate cavities. Survey data is required to determine the final shape, volume, and location of the cavity for mine planning purposes and construction. This paper provides an overview of the challenges involved in remotely surveying a JBS-mined cavity and studies the potential use of a time-of-flight (ToF) camera for remote cavity surveying. It reports on data collected and analyzed from inside an experimental environment as well as on real data acquired on site from the Cigar Lake and Rabbit Lake mines. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These contain valuable data that, if harnessed efficiently, can help automate or at least reduce human effort in diverse construction management activities such as progress monitoring, safety management, quality control and productivity tracking. Extracting meaningful information from images requires the development of technology and algorithms that enable computers to understand digital images or videos, replicating the functionality of human visual systems. This is the goal of computer vision.

Transportation-Based Framework for Deriving Perturbations to the Inoperability Input-Output Model	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Transportation management; Risk management; Economic factors; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty principles		The Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) provides a mechanism to enable examination of interdependencies among economic sectors to estimate the effects of a disruptive event. In previous IIM applications, parametric analyses were used to represent uncertain model inputs that created ambiguity in physical interpretations. This paper develops a transportation-based framework for decomposing the IIM inputs into two components: (1) workforce and (2) commodity flows. For workforce analysis, we estimate the number of workers using a particular asset, the normal income level, and the reduced income resulting from a disruption. For commodity analysis, we estimate the Value of goods traveling across a particular asset and the resulting reduction due to a disruption. The workforce and commodity formulations were demonstrated using an ex post analysis of the 2003 closure of Virginia's Midtown Tunnel. The study utilized a computer tool to execute the model and to perform sensitivity analysis to account for the data uncertainties.

However, their deployment could potentially result in hazardous situations such as worker distraction or struck-by accidents. This paper introduces iSafeUAS as an initial effort to develop and assess a platform designed for safety inspection purposes with customized features such as a super optical zoom RGB Camera and a Parachute Recovery System to ensure safe yet accurate visual data acquisition without the need to fly over or near populated areas. After conducting multiple flight tests to evaluate its technical performance, the iSafeUAS was deployed on a construction jobsite to validate its safety inspection capabilities. The study results showed that the Parachute Recovery System reduced the fatality probability by more than 40%, and the super optical zoom capabilities helped safety managers better identify and inspect potential safety hazards.

Currently, most bridge inspections have been done manually by counting the number of cracks, measuring their lengths and widths and taking pictures of them. Thus the quality and reliability of diagnosis reports on bridges are greatly dependent upon the diligence and education of inspection workers. The robotic inspection system to be proposed consists of three parts: a specially designed car, a robot mechanism and control system for mobility and a machine vision system for automatic detection of cracks. Ultimately, this robot system has been developed for gathering accurate data in order to record the biennial changes of the bridge's safety circumstances as well as check the safety status of bridges. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested crack detecting and tracing algorithms through experiments on a real bridge crack inspection. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tixier, AJP; Hallowell, MR; Rajagopalan, B; Bowman, D				Tixier, Antoine J. -P.; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Bowman, Dean			Automated content analysis for construction safety: A natural language processing system to extract precursors and outcomes from unstructured injury reports	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated content analysis; Natural language processing; Text mining; Knowledge extraction; Accident; Injury; Safety; Attribute; Risk; R	CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; MANAGEMENT	In the United States like in many other countries throughout the globe, construction workers are more likely to be injured on the job than workers in any other industry. This poor safety performance is responsible for huge human and financial losses and has motivated extensive research. Unfortunately, safety improvement in construction has decelerated in the last decade and traditional safety programs have reached saturation. Yet major construction companies and federal agencies possess a wealth of empirical knowledge in the form of huge databases of digital construction injury reports. This knowledge could be used to better understand, predict, and prevent the occurrence of construction accidents. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a clear methodology and the high costs of manual large-scale content analysis, these valuable data have yet to be extracted and leveraged. Recently, researchers have proposed a framework allowing meaningful empirical data to be extracted from accident reports. However, the resource limitations inherent to manual content analysis still remain. The present study tested the proposition that manual content analysis of injury reports can be eliminated using natural language processing (NLP). This paper describes (1) the overall strategy and methodology used in developing the system, and specifically how key challenges with decoding unstructured reports were overcome; (2) how the system was built through an iterative process of coding and testing against manual content analysis results from a team of seven independent analysts; and (3) the implications and potential uses of the data extracted. The results indicate that the NLP system is capable of quickly and automatically scanning unstructured injury reports for 101 attributes and outcomes with over 95% accuracy. The main contribution of this research is to empower any organization to quickly obtain a large and highly reliable structured attribute and outcome data set from their databases of unstructured accident reports. Such structured data are a necessary prerequisite to the application of statistical modeling techniques, allowing the extraction of new safety knowledge and finally the amelioration of safety management.

J	Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO				Kometa, ST; Olomolaiye, PO			Evaluation of factors influencing construction clients' decision to build	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Evidence indicates that construction clients are not wholly satisfied with the performance achieved on many of their projects, with the blame for failures often attributed to both consultants and contractors. However, the findings of a survey described in this paper suggest that there are several factors influencing a client's decision to build that ultimately bear upon a successful project outcome. It is imperative for project participants to understand these factors before developing the project objectives. These factors operate in the following three main groupings: organizational variables, including director's preference, corporate ego, status/prestige, location, and profit/economic reasons; structural variables, including change of attitude, cultural influence, social expectation, workers' pressure; and externalities, including users' preference, and need for more facilities. Organizational factors predominate the decision to build. If the consultant in general and the client in particular can appreciate the factors that instigate the project, they will both perform their respective roles adequately and ensure a succesful project outcome.

J	Wang, X; Zhu, ZH				Wang, Xin; Zhu, Zhenhua			Vision-based hand signal recognition in construction: A feasibility study	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Hand signal recognition; Dataset creation; Performance comparison; Feasibility study	REAL-TIME; SAFETY	In construction fields, it is common for workers to rely on hand signals to communicate and express thoughts due to their simple but effective nature. However, the meaning of these hand signals was not always captured precisely. As a result, construction errors and even accidents were produced. This paper presented a feasibility study on investigating whether the hand signals could be captured and interpreted automatically with computer vision technologies. It starts with the literature review of existing hand gesture recognition methods for sign language understanding, human-computer interaction, etc. It is then followed by creating a dataset containing 11 classes of hand signals in construction. The performance of two state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks is measured and compared. The results indicated that a high classification accuracy (93.3%) and a short inference time (0.17 s/gesture) could be achieved, illustrating the feasibility of using computer vision to automate hand signal recognition in construction.

J	Behzadan, AH; Kamat, VR				Behzadan, Amir H.; Kamat, Vineet R.			Enabling discovery-based learning in construction using telepresent augmented reality	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Augmented reality; Visualization; Construction engineering; Education; Learning		Construction engineering students often complain about the lack of engagement and interaction with the learning environment. Notwithstanding, many instructors still rely on traditional teaching methods which include the use of chalkboard, handouts, and computer presentations that are often filled with many words and few visual elements. Research shows that these teaching techniques are considered almost obsolete by a many students specially those who are visual learners or team workers. Also, the influence of visual and social media has changed student perceptions and how they expect the instructional materials to be presented in a classroom setting. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical tool that uses remote videotaping, augmented reality (AR), and ultra-wide band (UWB) locationing to bring live videos of remote construction jobsites to the classroom, create an intuitive interface for students to interact with the objects in the video scenes, and visually deliver location-aware instructional materials to them.

It also presents three own original models concerning the issue. The first model is used to build a fuzzy construction schedule taking into account fuzzy norms and the number of workers. The costing model uses fuzzy inference from CBR cases. The aim was to increase the accuracy and correctness of the cost calculation performed for the investor in the construction and investment process with a certain degree of vagueness of the available information about materials. In the last of the presented models, fuzzy sets were used to assess the effects of technological and construction (implementation) risk factors. The presented examples prove the usefulness of fuzzy logic in solving problems in construction, where we have incomplete and imprecise information.

The model is aimed at integrating solutions worked out in the considered areas into a single variant as a research object. A multi-stage decision model reflecting a set of the available combinations of alternatives is developed. The branches of the tree diagram are interlinked based on the inherent relations between building structures, technologies and work safety. The interaction and interrelationship between the criteria describing the above issues affect each criterion in a very specific way. The performance of the system allows the authors to evaluate the effect of each criterion and its interaction with other criteria, which in turn helps with choosing appropriate solutions to solving structural, technological and safety problems.

Automatic detection of location and movement of modules should facilitate progress monitoring and safety management. However, automatic module detection has not been implemented previously. Hence, virtual prototyping and transfer-learning techniques were combined in this study to develop a module-detection model based on mask regions with convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN). The developed model was trained with datasets comprising both virtual and real images, and it was applied to two modular construction projects for automatic progress monitoring. The results indicate the effectiveness of the developed model in module detection. The proposed method using virtual prototyping and transfer learning not only facilitates the development of automation in modular construction, but also provides a new approach for deep learning in the construction industry.

Fog computing emerges as a new computing paradigm for Edge-to-Cloud computing that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technologies to facilitate the development and operation of smart applications. However, a comprehensive methodology that applies Fog computing to construction projects is currently missing. In our work, we use the novel DECENTER Fog Computing and Brokerage Platform to address requirements for flexible use of AI methods in construction projects and develop a relevant methodology. Evaluation is performed through all application development phases at a real construction site in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Recognizing that not all new project team workers possess equally important specific knowledge, skills and abilities for the success of projects, we draw on project management, human resource management, and organizational socialization literature to develop a framework on how new project team members might be socialized, depending on their strategic value for the project. We specifically draw on the socialization tactics literature and propose how four categories of new employees Internal specialists, External specialists, External generalists and Internal generalists; based on two dimensions work task complexity and employment mode, can be socialized more effectively.

While research suggests that these tools are effective in improving operational or worker performance, applications related to engineering and operations management functions, such as monitoring work practices and process control, are less common and reportedly experience additional challenges due to the nature of these tasks. This article reviews research focused on AR applications for management-related tasks exploring progress in this area, identifying key challenges, and defining opportunities for future research. Augmented Reality technology has the potential to support engineering and operations management by creating Immersive Performance Environments; however, there are many challenges to the successful adoption of this technology that must be overcome to bring the potentially powerful benefits of this technology to practice.

The impact of engineering information formats on learning and execution of construction operations: A virtual reality pipe maintenance experiment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Working memory; Engineering information; Cognitive load; Virtual reality; Eye-tracking	COGNITIVE LOAD MEASUREMENT; PUPILLARY RESPONSES; BUILDING DESIGN; WORKING-MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; DILATION; ENVIRONMENTS; NAVIGATION; RESOURCES; RETRIEVAL	Given the increasing complexity of construction tasks, and the growing number of construction operations within confined workplaces, construction workers rely heavily on working memory. In this context, working memory is defined as the short-term and temporary storage of information related to near future events to ensure the seamless execution of construction tasks. Although a strong relationship between engineering information format and task performance has been observed in the relevant literature, there remains an obvious theoretical disagreement-in particular, about the cognitive mechanisms for explaining why different information formats affect working memory development and retrieval in distinct ways. This study presents a human-subject ex-periment (n = 120) to examine the impact of information format on the performance of a pipe maintenance task, and the implications of cognitive costs in both working memory development (information encoding) and retrieval (information recalling). Participants were required to review the operational instructions for a pipe maintenance task for a short period, and then perform the task from memory. Participants were divided into four groups depending on the format of information they received: 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (2D-simple group); 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with rich-text operational instruction (2D-complex group); an interactive 3D model of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (3D group); or an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment with bulleted-text operational instructions (VR group). The results indicated that 3D and VR groups outperformed 2D simple and 2D-complex groups in both operation time and maintenance accuracy. A further cognitive load analysis (based on surveys and pupil dilation) suggested that the superior performance of these groups is driven by more efficient usage of working memory, measured by how easily the encoded information can be recalled in the operation phase. Larger pupil dilation during encoding, indicative of successful working memory formation, was associated with better subsequent performance. These findings provide more evidence about cognitive mechanisms engaged by different information formats, help to resolve the current theoretical disagreement within the construction literature, and may inspire designs of cognition-driven information systems that can improve working memory in construction workers.

J	Lee, C; Lee, G; Park, S; Cho, J				Lee, Chijoo; Lee, Ghang; Park, Suyeul; Cho, Joonbeom			Analysis of field applicability of the rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated construction; Rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block; Field application; Productivity; Safety		The rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block can control the horizontal rotation angle of a steel beam being lifted by a tower crane using a mechanical apparatus. It is expected that the mechanized hook block can relieve safety concerns; however, at the same time, there are several concerns: Is precise control of the rotation angle possible? Won't it be slower than rotating a beam by hand? If a mechanized system is faster, how fast is it? In order to test these, experiments were conducted. The precision of the rotating angle and the time for rotating and stopping the rotation controllable hook block were measured using an orientation sensor and a laser point. The results were compared to those of the conventional manual method. Since a steel beam usually has a symmetrical shape, pi/2 rad (=90 degrees) is the maximum angle for placing a beam in the target location. The experiment results showed that a steel beam stopped after it moved 7 pi/600 rad (=2.1 degrees) and 9 pi/200 rad (= 8.1 degrees) more, on average, due to inertia when the steel beam was rotated pi/12 rad (=15 degrees) and pi/2 rad (=90 degrees), respectively. However, it appeared that when an operator became used to the remote controller, the operator could reduce the rotation speed to stop a steel beam in the target location by reversing the motor direction. In terms of time, it took 5.80 s, 8.69 s, and 17.12 s, on average, to rotate a steel beam pi/12 rad (=15 degrees), n/4 rad (=45 degrees), and pi/2 tad (=90 degrees), respectively. The time for rotating steel beams using the conventional manual method at a construction site was also measured for comparison. The rotation time using the conventional manual method ranged from 11.96 s to 91.00 s depending on how easy it was for workers to reach and rotate a beam because workers rotate beams while hanging on a column. The results showed that the deviation could be reduced and work efficiency could be improved when a mechanized hook block is adopted on a construction site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, the hooking process is dangerous and inefficient due to the complicated site environment and the falling risk workers may face when they need to work at height. This paper presents a method for automating the first step of the process: recognition and localization of CHRs of PCCs. We collect point clouds by placing laser radars on the surface of PCCs, and then the method follows three steps to implement the automation: denoising laser point clouds with a set of filtering rules, extracting rough recognition areas of CHRs using a spatial clustering algorithm, and determining the location of CHRs through pattern recognition. The experimental results indicate that the method achieves desired performance in terms of 0.864 precision and 0.822 recall.

However, few studies have focused on detecting fall portents, identification of which may prevent falls from occurring. This study developed an accelerometer-based fall portent detection system that employed a hierarchical threshold based algorithm. We designed tiling experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The participants performed the tasks under normal, inebriation, and sleepiness conditions on a scaffold while four accelerometers were attached to their chest, waist, arm, and hand. The results revealed that the traditional threshold-based algorithms had unacceptable accuracies of less than 30.66%. Most false warnings could be attributed to misidentifications of work-related motions. However, the work-related motions had a limited effect on the hierarchical threshold-based algorithm, which exhibited a satisfactory detection rate and accuracy of 76.86% and 79.13%, respectively.

J	Lee-Kelley, L; Blackman, D				Lee-Kelley, Liz; Blackman, Deborah			Project training evaluation: Reshaping boundary objects and assumptions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Training evaluation; Boundary objects; Appraisal; Learning	KNOWLEDGE	Training evaluation is an important component of personal development which has received insufficient attention by project managers, members of project teams and their organisations, making training a target for cut-back at times of tightening budgets. Assessing training has historically been operationally oriented, emphasising financial justification, content and quality of the training rather than the potential of improved project performance or organisational transformation. This qualitative, multi-case study demonstrates the limitations of normative boundary objects (the processes, artefacts, documents or technical language or vocabulary in common use within the project community) such as 'best practise' models and 'bodies of knowledge' as the driver and basis for training. The paper proposes using alternate boundary objects to incorporate reflective practises which can increase the utilisation of learning by embedding it in specific contexts. Study findings are of relevance to project workers by helping them think differently about the purpose and outcome of training attendance, and for managers charged with developing the project and programme talent pool within the organisation.

The conventional crack sealing operations are, however, dangerous, costly, and labor-intensive. Labor turnover and training are also increasing problems related to crack sealing crews. Automating crack sealing will improve productivity and quality, and offer safety benefits by getting workers off the road. The reduction in crew size and the increase in productivity of the automated sealing process will be translated directly into significant potential cost savings. The main objective of this study is to develop an automated system for sealing cracks in pavement, and to validate the developed system through field trials. A machine vision algorithm, which is composed of noise elimination, crack network mapping and modeling, and path planning, was developed to operate the proposed automated system effectively. Extension of the algorithms and tools presented in the study to other applications is also recommended for future studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accidents in the project can potentially cause issues, such as workers' injury and progress delay, which lead to financial losses. Generally, accident narratives store all summaries and causes of the related events. Since documentations rapidly use large quantities of resources, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) begins to seek attention. Nevertheless, in current models, there are still drawbacks, such as weak learning performance and substantial error rate. In this regard, this study develops a hybrid model incorporating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS), named Symbiotic Gated Recurrent Unit (SGRU). SOS searches the best parameters of GRU to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing is applied to pre-process the text data prior classification process. The experimental result in this study showcases SGRU as the best classification model among other AI models. Therefore, SGRU shares the capability to aid the safety assessments of construction projects.

For outdoor environments, global positioning systems (GPSs) are widely used. For indoor environments, however, an effective localization system has yet to be fully developed. Existing indoor localization systems usually rely on prior or real-time environment learning, and with just a slight change in the jobsite environment their performances degrade. Furthermore, localization systems that rely on a single sensor can hardly be everything a project manager would wantinexpensive, accurate, and easy to develop. Therefore, to simplify the deployment and enhance the robustness of localization for a dynamic environment, this work proposes a multisensor fusion framework. To simulate a typical residential jobsite's indoor environment (with moving workers and ongoing activities), this work relies on two testbedsan office area of 274m2 with dynamic traffic flow and a lab of 92m2 with ongoing lab tests. During working hours, researchers conducted performance evaluation tests in the testbeds. The results indicate that with simpler deployment the multisensor fusion algorithm was able to achieve the same accuracy level as existing systems without needing prior environment learning.

To control the work efficiency and productivity of earthwork equipment, computer vision (CV) methods have been proposed to monitor equipment operations from site surveillance videos. Existing methods can recognize equipment activities to estimate the working and idling times. Idling time is an important factor that influences equipment productivity; however, the causes of equipment idling have not been considered in previous CV methods. Therefore, this research proposes a method to identify the main causes of excavator and truck idling by analyzing their interactive operations. First, the activities of the excavators and trucks are identified using convolutional neural networks. Then, work groups of excavators and trucks are clustered. Finally, the relationships between each excavator and the surrounding trucks are analyzed to identify the potential reason for idling. The proposed method was validated with videos from several construction sites, and the results were promising.

The development of deep-learning-based methods has demonstrated their capabilities in analyzing complex visual data and inferring valuable insights. Recent applications of these methods in construction have also shown promising performance in making the construction management process smarter. To understand the current research trends and to highlight future research directions, this study reviews state-ofthe-art deep-learning applications on visual data analytics in the context of construction project management. This in-depth review identifies six major fields and fifty-two subfields of construction management where deeplearning-based visual data analytics have been applied. It also proposes a generalized workflow for applying deep-learning-based visual data analytics methods for solving construction management problems. In addition, the study highlights three future research directions where deep-learning-based visual data analytics can be applied on relatively less explored 3D visual data.

The existing methods have shortages such as detection error, locating error, alarming delay and difficulties in identifying intruders based on their backgrounds. This study is to address these problems in enhancing real-time intrusion monitoring through Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies. Five components including intelligent hardhats, portable RFID triggers, web-based management platform (WBMP), smartphone APP and cloud server are studied and developed to implement the IoT-based intrusion monitoring system. Some improvements on detecting error, locating error and alarming delay of intrusion as well as intelligent hardhats and portable RFID triggers regarding effectiveness, convenience and safety are achieved. The study provides an IoT-based methodology to help the project managers enhance safety management by real-timely monitoring the on-site persons with different access right levels regarding their backgrounds, retrieve the intrusion record and plan countermeasures such as reward and punishment mechanism.

However, existing vision-based and non-vision-based working stage identification methods ignore the influence of response delay of hydraulic system on the recognition results. To overcome this problem, three machine learning algorithms, which select the control signals of operating handles that can reflect the actuator real-time operating status as segmentation marks, are used to establish the excavator working stage identification model in this study. The results show that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier has an accuracy of 93.21% and effectively reduces the lagging misidentification to 4.68%. This study contributes to automatic measurement of the excavator operational efficiency. For future work, the approach is combined with the adjustment strategy of engine working point to realize the staged energy-saving control of excavators.

J	Hosseinian, AH; Baradaran, V				Hosseinian, Amir Hossein; Baradaran, Vahid			A two-phase approach for solving the multi-skill resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem: a case study in construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Multi-project scheduling; Game of life; Control charts; Statistical process control; Variable neighborhood search	MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; IMPERIALIST COMPETITIVE ALGORITHM; VARIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; TIME	Purpose The purpose of this research is to study the Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (MSRCMPSP), where (1) durations of activities depend on the familiarity levels of assigned workers, (2) more efficient workers demand higher per-day salaries, (3) projects have different due dates and (4) the budget of each period varies over time. The proposed model is bi-objective, and its objectives are minimization of completion times and costs of all projects, simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a two-phase approach based on the Statistical Process Control (SPC) to solve this problem. This approach aims to develop a control chart so as to monitor the performance of an optimizer during the optimization process. In the first phase, a multi-objective statistical model has been used to obtain control limits of this chart. To solve this model, a Multi-Objective Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (MOGRASP) has been hired. In the second phase, the MSRCMPSP is solved via a New Version of the Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm (NV-MOVNS). In each iteration, the developed control chart monitors the performance of the NV-MOVNS to obtain proper solutions. When the control chart warns about an out-of control state, a new procedure based on the Conway's Game of Life, which is a cellular automaton, is used to bring the algorithm back to the in-control state. Findings The proposed two-phase approach has been used in solving several standard test problems available in the literature. The results are compared with the outputs of some other methods to assess the efficiency of this approach. Comparisons imply the high efficiency of the proposed approach in solving test problems with different sizes. Practical implications The proposed model and approach have been used to schedule multiple projects of a construction company in Iran. The outputs show that both the model and the NV-MOVNS can be used in real-world multi-project scheduling problems. Originality/value Due to the numerous numbers of studies reviewed in this research, the authors discovered that there are few researches on the multi-skill resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (MSRCMPSP) with the aforementioned characteristics. Moreover, none of the previous researches proposed an SPC-based solution approach for meta-heuristics in order to solve the MSRCMPSP.

Dynamic instability is mostly the reason for these falls. By using virtual reality (VR) simulations, previous studies have shown that biomechanical measurements of gait are reliable indicators of fall risk. Despite success in understanding critical factors of falling, these studies mostly overlooked simulations of visual biofeedback in their fall-risk assessments or employed limited-range, orientation-sensitive systems to generate such simulations. To facilitate these endeavors and better understand gait performance at height, this paper proposes and examines a reliable and responsive VR simulator (VS) as a testbed for assessing ironworkers' fall risk. The experimental results on 12 healthy adults show VS surpasses traditional virtual reality systems in evaluating upper-limb stability during gait at height. Such improvement can lead to more effective fall-related safety training. The findings can open doors to enhancements of VR simulation for hazard-prevention techniques.

Analysis of Knowledge-Transfer Mechanisms in Construction Project Cooperation Networks	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Knowledge transfer; Construction project; Network; Knowledge management	SOCIAL NETWORK; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT; TRUST; FIRMS; ORGANIZATIONS; POWER; TIES	Effective knowledge transfer can improve the work efficiency of project network members. However, as traditional labor-intensive enterprises, construction companies do not pay enough attention to knowledge management, and the characteristics of projects increase knowledge loss to a certain extent. This results in the knowledge-transfer performance of a project network not being ideal and work efficiency reduction. This paper aims to explore knowledge-transfer factors and their relationships in construction project cooperation networks (CPCNs). A framework model and hypotheses were formulated through literature research, theoretical analysis, and practical experience. The authors applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses based on a questionnaire survey data set of 210 workers from Chinese construction companies. The results showed that, in the context of Chinese relationships, the temporary nature of projects will not affect knowledge transfer in CPCNs. The urgency of projects will positively affect parts of network members' knowledge transfer. The relationship between knowledge suppliers and recipients plays a critical role in mediating the influences of project characteristics on knowledge-transfer performance.

Focusing on the ethnographic method, it is demonstrated how a self-reflexive ethnography can contribute to a deeper understanding of the variations, contradictions and tensions underlying practices on a building site, thereby serving as a complement to other qualitative approaches. A short four-week ethnographic study illustrates how the subjective 'I' of the ethnographer can be used as an active producer of knowledge, by reflecting on how insights from an individual's role, both as an observer and as a worker, can account for the complex interplay between socialities and materialities on a building site. The results also contribute to the discussion regarding the length of ethnographic studies, by showing how valuable insights can be drawn from shorter 'ethnographic episodes', studied through a self-reflexive lens.

Construction automation systems have been widely proposed as alternatives to overcome these difficulties and to raise construction quality, enhance productivity, and improve safety. To demonstrate the efficiency of a construction automation system, we introduce a Genetic Algorithm-based Repetitive Tasks Simulation (CARTS) model for planning steel erection in high-rise building construction. This model produces an optimized movement path of a bolting robot for fabricating steel structures, proposes a collaboration plan between a robot and a worker, and quantifies the uncertainty of the duration of steel erection. As an illustrative case, the so-called robot-based construction automation system (RCA) was applied to a pilot project. The results showed the model's capacities and justified its application to other extended types of robotic construction systems. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In addition, construction schedulers are frequently forced to incorporate aggressive schedule compression techniques. As already discussed by previous researchers, these schedule compression techniques have direct impacts on project productivity and quality defects. Researchers have also pointed out that schedule compression will affect safety incidents such as Occupational Safety & Health Administration recordable injuries and near misses over long project durations. However, most of the existing studies treated safety as a subcategory of project productivity and project quality, and minimal research has been done to directly quantify the effect of schedule compression on safety at the project level. Therefore, in this research, we conducted a survey and statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between schedule compression and safety in construction projects. We interviewed various members of the Houston construction community from both industrial and non-industrial roles. Statistical analysis was used to identify factors that have significant impacts on the occurrence of safety incidents at an industry specific level.

Improved productivity of construction tasks is paramount in terms of competitiveness and is achieved through the continuous improvement of operations and planning, which often relies on historical data obtained from previous projects. Despite being a common practice, current methods, such as time studies, are not able to capture the changing scenarios resulting from improvements to production. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically detect and track the progress of construction operations by applying a method that combines deep learning algorithms and finite state machines to existing footage captured by closed-circuit television (CCTV) security cameras. Applied in the context of floor panel manufacturing stations, the proposed method examines entire production days recorded by CCTV cameras, while providing the durations of each task, its required resources, and the task efficiency per panel with high accuracy.

In this study, a novel end-to-end deep learning network, namely orientation-aware feature fusion single-stage detection (OAFF-SSD), is proposed for the precise detection of dense multiple construction vehicles using images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed OAFF-SSD consists of three main modules: (1) multi-level feature extraction, (2) novel feature fusion, and (3) new orientation-aware bounding box (OABB) proposal and regression. Meanwhile, specific strategies are designated for the fast convergence of training losses. The application of OAFF-SSD to real construction sites vehicle detection and comparison with the well-known SSD (a benchmark using traditional bounding box) and orientation-aware SSD (OA-SSD) demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

Using interviews with five of the top 20 UK contractors and one medium-sized contractor, this study explored how main contractors manage the H&S influence of subcontracting with a focus on their in-house measures. Some in-house measures found are: restricting the layers of subcontractors on projects; working with a regular chain of subcontractors; implementing a H&S reward scheme for subcontractors; and insisting on non-working subcontractor foremen who have direct responsibility for the safety of workers in their trade. These measures appear to be influenced by clients, industry peer groups, and the moral justification for occupational H&S, and they offer inter-organisational learning opportunities for contractors in devising measures to mitigate the H&S influence of subcontracting. These findings should also allay concerns that removing some of the legislative hurdles in connection with ongoing red tape debate will result in poorer H&S. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Currently, the dominant method for detecting is Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To apply this method, the DNNs always need to be trained on image datasets that contain objects at the construction site. However, a large-scale and publicly available image dataset for detecting objects at construction sites is still absent, and this hinders research in this field. In this study, the Moving Objects in Construction Sites (MOCS) image dataset is presented. The dataset contains 41,668 images collected from 174 different construction sites. Thirteen categories of moving objects found in construction sites were annotated. Furthermore, the objects were precisely annotated using per-pixel segmentations to assist in precise object localization. A detailed statistical analysis was performed in this study. Finally, a benchmark containing 15 different DNN-based detectors was made using the MOCS dataset. The results show that all detectors trained on the dataset could detect objects at construction sites precisely and robustly.

Considering the varied characteristics of these sites, risks within the same type of work can differ. Furthermore, the established safety management performed in other industries does not necessarily apply to construction. To suggest an assessment system considering risk influence factors on construction sites, this study examines the factors through literature reviews and surveys, and builds a weighting system for their classification. The risks for each type of work are estimated based on their frequency and severity. With the understanding that perceiving a specific type of risk on a construction site increases the effectiveness of safety management, the study suggests an assessment system integrating associated risks and risk influence factors. A risk assessment system is proposed that considers influence factors and addresses the characteristics of construction sites. The system is intended for use with regard to the safety of construction workers. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000146. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This study incorporates the systems theory into Heinrich's domino theory to explore the interrelationships of risks and break the chain of accident causation. Through both empirical and statistical analyses of 9358 accidents which occurred in the U.S. construction industry between 2002 and 2011, the study investigates relationships between accidents and injury elements (e.g., injury type, part of body, injury severity) and the nature of construction injuries by accident type. The study then discusses relationships between accidents and risks, including worker behavior, injury source, and environmental condition, and identifies key risk factors and risk combinations causing accidents. The research outcomes will assist safety managers to prioritize risks according to the likelihood of accident occurrence and injury characteristics, and pay more attention to balancing significant risk relationships to prevent accidents and achieve safer working environments.

These changes not only affect the traveling public, but also the workers that perform the construction. The impacts of the work being performed also tend to cause queuing. In addition, these periods of construction operations have been linked to an increase in the number of accidents and fatalities that involve road-users and construction crews. A research project was undertaken to evaluate possible options to improve the safety of construction work zones on interstates in the state of Indiana. One component of this project dealt with the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect traffic data and to relate the traveling conditions encountered with the differing construction activities taking place. This paper describes the GPS study conducted in three different rural work zones on Interstate 65 in Indiana. Multiple runs were conducted at each location to analyze the impact of traveling conditions to changes in lane restrictions during construction periods on traveling conditions.

However, manual slump measurements have limited accuracy and are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Herein, an approach based on deep learning and stereo vision techniques is proposed to effectively improve the determination of concrete slump in outdoor environments. Input images obtained from a stereo camera system were classified into three slump cases via deep learning. The actual slumps were then calculated using depth maps obtained via stereo vision. The results were analyzed for the correlations between camera mounting heights and the distance between the cameras to identify the optimal settings for an onsite working system. A baseline of 70 mm and working height of 1.7-1.9 m yielded optimal results with errors <= 2.05%. Additionally, the mask-region-based volumetric results exhibited errors of <8.9% relative to ground truth, thereby validating the reliability of the proposed approach.

Workers continue to carry out physically demanding tasks which adversely affect their health, safety, and productivity. The flexibility of semi-automated work systems, where operators work in conjunction with machines and robots, is an attractive alternative. It is critical to estimate the anticipated effectiveness of these interventions before integrating them into the current work processes. This study proposes a systematic and objective methodology to assess the value of a semi-automated work system in a construction context, as it pertains to reduced exposure to musculoskeletal disorder risks and productivity improvements. Additional assessments are also suggested for a complete analysis of efficacy. The proposed methodology was validated through an experimental evaluation of a force-assist self-leveling pallet in a masonry task. It provides an objective evaluation of impact on the task showing 40% reduction in joint loads and 10% increase in productivity.

How to effectively convert the information into a machine processable format for safety management is a challenging task. To address this problem, in this paper, combining the HowNet and specific taxonomies from the relevant construction specifications, a semantic modeling approach is developed for the proactive construction hazard identification from images. A semantic scoring system is then introduced for quantifying the similarities between images, via comparing their annotations with the construction hazard specification. Furthermore, an image processing framework is developed to semantically annotate site images and further automatically classify the images into the categories. In this way, the potential hazards implied in the images can be identified automatically. Examples are developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. The outcomes of this study have offered an alternative method to enhance site safety management on site.

While bridges often are essential to connect the affected disaster areas, this study focuses on bridge management associated with typhoons and rain-storms. Recently, although numerous information technology-based applications are available, three problems (i.e. asynchronous information records, unsteady information transmission, and inaccessible information analysis) still influence responses on disaster sites. Therefore, this study integrated several mobile information techniques to propose a mobile disaster response system. The applied mobile GPS- and GIS-based data reports simplify information generation, AR-based assistance enhances information representation, and mobile 3D graphics accelerates information processes. Based on the tests, this system not only improved the recognized problems but also strengthened the cooperation between construction engineers and workers and disaster managers. Overall, this study is a useful reference for similar applications in bridge management and disaster management.

The construction industry, greatly impacted by accidents, is accountable for more than 1,000 fatalities in each of the past 14 years. The human factors analysis classification system (HFACS) is a general human error framework originally developed and tested as a tool for investigating and analyzing the human causes of accidents with applications to rail, air, and offshore environments. This paper introduces the concept of HFACS along with the framework of human error awareness training (HEAT) and their potential contribution to the construction industry. Based on the HEAT approach, this paper proposes a new error analysis educational and classification tool for safety within the construction industry. The primary difference between HFACS and HEAT is found in the structure, content, and presentation of the information allowing for higher effectiveness in incident investigation and safety education and training in construction.

J	Brandenburg, SG; Haas, CT; Byrom, K				Brandenburg, SG; Haas, CT; Byrom, K			Strategic management of human resources in construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Human resource management in Construction has typically been an emergent rather than a strategic or deliberate process. This, has resulted in the infrequent use of comprehensive workforce management strategies in the industry. Researchers at the Center for Construction Industry Studies (CCIS) have proposed a Two-Tier Approach to workforce management. The Tier I strategy is designed to improve the effectiveness and productivity of the construction worldforce through effective Supervision and project management. This paper presents the concepts behind the Tier I strategy and discusses the metrics and the procedures needed to implement this strategy. An analysis of 19 on-site project visits of industrial construction projects, including Surveys collected from over 900 journey-level craft workers and Supervisors, is also presented in order to validate the feasibility and potential of the Tier I strategy. It is anticipated that increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and reduced turnover will be results of the strategy. It is not a revolutionary strategy in itself, but the concepts and elements of the strategy may serve as building blocks for more complex and extensive structured workforce development programs in the construction industry.

Damaged pipes are conventionally replaced manually, which is inconvenient to customers and leads to material wastage and worker safety concerns. This work proposes a different approach by developing a robotic solution in a preventive maintenance manner. The entire robotic system consists of a service robot working at heights and a remote ground station. This paper presents the work process and the major robotic modules: a manipulator arm, a twofinger gripper with force feedback, a sparkless polishing tool with contact feedback, a painting tool with a dip replenish mechanism, and on-board visual monitoring. Field deployment test results validate the effectiveness of the concept. The proposed system saves time from eliminating scaffold preparation setup and reduces material wastage compared with conventional methods. The developed robotic system and process have a potential application in relevant high-rise utility operations.

Improving Labor-Based Road Rehabilitation in Ghana	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In an attempt to create more employment and reduce poverty, a labor-based road rehabilitation program was introduced in Ghana in 1986 with the assistance of international organizations. Although this program has the potential to create more employment than equipment-intensive methods, it is considered less attractive than equipment-intensive methods. It is considered to be too slow, encumbered with labor organization and management problems, and reliant upon casual (nonpermanent) workers. This paper describes the family-based labor management (FBLM) concept intended to make the labor-based road program more attractive to contractors and laborers, and thereby help address the unemployment and poverty problems. It is anticipated that if at least 10% of the $174 million currently used to import construction and earthmoving equipment annually is invested in labor-based road rehabilitation program, about 23,000 jobs could be created. If 50% of the equipment expenses are invested in the program, almost 117,000 jobs could be created annually. The proposed FBLM concept is flexible enough to serve as a model to other African countries encountering similar problems.	[Quagraine, V. K.; Beliveau, Y.

Occupational safety and health performance in the Pakistani construction industry: stakeholders' perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						OSH factors; OSH practices; performance indices; Kruskal-Wallis test; stakeholders; construction industry	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE	Lack of compliance with Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) has resulted in a relatively higher construction accident rate in developing countries such as Pakistan. This study attempts to unveil the aspects of OSH that are ignored and discern the differences in the perceptions of key construction stakeholders. Data collected from 195 respondents were analysed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The results indicate that OSH training is the most neglected factor, followed by non-inclusion of safety in contract documents and workers' non-involvement. Stakeholders have dissimilar perception about three OSH factors, including management commitment to OSH, safety rules/procedures and policies, and OSH training. Regulatory authority is suggested to launch OSH awareness campaigns, announce safety incentives, institutionalize the OSH certification system, and incorporate safety credit points in contractors' registration process. Though this study pertains to Pakistan, the methodology and the recommendations can be generalized for other developing countries with a similar work environment.	[Zahoor, Hafiz; Chan, Albert P.

However, issues of adoption and implementation persist, particularly for on-site use of BIM tools in the construction phase. We describe an empirical case-study of the implementation of an innovative 'Site BIM' system on a major hospital construction project. The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that 'Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping. Technical IT skills were adopted into the construction project through personal relationships and arrangements rather than formal processes. Implementation was driven by construction project employees rather than controlled centrally by the corporate IT function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performance evaluation of ultra wideband technology for construction resource location tracking in harsh environments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						3D; Accuracy; Error analysis; Laser scanning; Location tracking; Ultra wideband; Robotic Total Station; RFID; Safety; Visualization	MODEL; PRODUCTIVITY; SYSTEM; SITE	Emerging wireless remote sensing technologies offer significant potential to advance the management of construction processes by providing real-time access to the locations of workers, materials, and equipment. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the accuracy, reliability, and practical benefits of an emerging technology, effectively impeding widespread adoption. This paper evaluates a commercially-available Ultra Wideband (UWB) system for real-time, mobile resource location tracking in harsh construction environments. A focus of this paper is to measure the performance of the UWB technology for tracking mobile resources in real-world construction settings. To assess tracking accuracy, location error rates for select UWB track signals are obtained by automatically tracking a single entity using a Robotic Total Station (RTS) for ground truth. Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of UWB technology, the paper provides case studies of resource tracking for analysis of worksite operations. The work demonstrates the applicability of UWB for the design of construction management support tools. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that RM frameworks could be enhanced by a more comprehensive understanding of the specific potential non-technical "people risks" in projects. The study focussed on the Oil and Gas industry and undertook interviews with experts in the field. The findings are considered within the framework of key BRM areas; Management Practices, General Employment Practices, Staffing, BR Development, and Compensation and Benefits, along with Project Completion. Drawing together RM and HRM in a project environment, our research provides a unique opportunity to identify critical workforce-related risks. Such identification is the first step towards a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and planning for mitigation of such risks in projects. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

IT based system for construction safety management and monitoring: C-RTICS2	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety; Construction management; Real-time information; Information systems; Safety indicators	COMMUNICATION	In North America, thousands of construction workers get injured and dozens die, on a yearly basis, due to work related injuries and illnesses. This reality prevailed from year 2000 to 2012 without a significant decrease. It seems that advanced health and safety regulations failed to make a positive impact. However, the use of information and communication technologies to improve safety is limited in the construction industry. This paper describes a system that transmits safety related information of multiple construction projects into a centralized database, where real-time safety indicators are generated. The system provides safety indicators related to an individual project or industry-wide figures. On site managers can use such real-time information for informed decisions in work sites. The system can also be accessed by the general public, research institutions, and regulating bodies, to formulate industry-wide safety standards and policies. The proposed system was pilot tested with positive and encouraging results. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

Controlling all persons involved in a project with respect to safety issues are time-consuming and costly. It is clear that in each working group there is a person who affects others because of his experience, knowledge and etc. Therefore, improving the safety of an effective person's behaviour can lead to the safety of other people's behaviours. This study presents a new framework to detect effective persons by using social network analysis. To do this, firstly the most frequent accidents are identified and next, for each accident according to their activities and working groups the most influential person is identified. Finally, the influential level of each person in different accidents is combined with a new decision-making method to find the most influential person. The proposed framework was implemented in one of the construction projects in Iran.

J	Sage, DJ				Sage, Daniel John			Rethinking construction expertise with posthumanism	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Posthumanism; expertise; sociomateriality	WORKERS	Expertise is commonly understood to be a distinct, even defining, aspect of being human: an attribute related to our efficacies to come to know and influence the, mostly non-human, world around us. In construction, expertise is commonly defined as the acquisition of skills and knowledge related to new technical processes, organizational routines, health and safety codes, even cultural norms. Despite the development of rule-following expert systems' in construction and beyond, the proposal that non-human technologies and artefacts can share our expertise is thus to be regarded with doubt: humans are human because of their lived expertise to undertake tasks faster and better than machines and other non-humans. Increasingly, however, this anthropocentric view of expertise can be challenged by a posthuman turn' that is gathering pace across the social sciences and humanities. The work of four seminal posthuman thinkers is drawn upon to evaluate the distinct, and varied, contribution that posthumanism might make to how we understand notions of construction expertise. Fictional examples of construction practices illustrate the challenge and theoretical and practical opportunities in rethinking construction expertise via posthumanism.

This study presents an automatic pumping-recharge system (APRS) to maintain groundwater balance during dewatering, thereby protecting the environment. The APRS overcomes the limitations of the traditional pumping-recharge operation performed manually by workers. Further, in traditional pumping-recharge operations, a large proportion of the pumped water is wasted by draining it into the sewerage system; this is because of the lack of an efficient application for groundwater recharge. The developed APRS system includes three subsystems: i) a pressure control system, ii) an integrated process system, and iii) an intelligent electronic control system. The APRS can not only balance the groundwater system but also control the settlement during underground construction.

J	Getuli, V; Capone, P; Bruttini, A				Getuli, Vito; Capone, Pietro; Bruttini, Alessandro			Planning, management and administration of HS contents with BIM and VR in construction: an implementation protocol	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Immersive virtual reality; BIM; Safety training; Game technology; Prototype protocol		Purpose Building construction is considered a complex, dynamic and highly hazardous process, which embraces many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Many studies proved that the improvement of preventive and proactive measures - dynamically included in the building design, planning and construction - could reduce site accidents as well as increase the site productivity. In this context, process management models and information visualization techniques such as building information modeling (BIM) and virtual reality (VR) seem to be devoted to strongly contribute to the advancement of the current safety management practices. For these reasons, the presented contribution is based on the assumption that a more nuanced approach for construction worker's safety training is warranted and the authors propose a safety training protocol based on BIM-enabled VR activity simulations. Design/methodology/approach The methodology comprised a safety training protocol based on BIM-enabled VR activity simulations. The protocol addresses three methodological issues: (1) Planning in terms of training typologies and related health and safety contents to be implemented in the VR construction site scenarios; (2) Management regarding the solution to integrate BIM and game technologies to deliver VR training experiences; (3) Administration in terms of definition of standardized rules to define a safety training schedule in a given construction project. Findings This work contributes to provide a standardized protocol for a viable integration of BIM and VR technologies for construction safety training in real projects. Practical implications The VR training protocol was applied to a construction project based in Italy that served as case study for the development of the training sessions' contents and their implementation. This case demonstrated the feasibility of the protocol's implementation and pointed out the drawbacks and limitations on which further efforts need to be spent in order to take the proposed protocol from a prototypical stage to a maturity for its larger-scale adoption from the practitioners involved in construction safety training. Originality/value The research gives a contribution to reduce the currently existing knowledge gap regarding how BIM and VR can be simultaneously integrated in real projects for construction safety training by using standardized rules to be extensively reproduced in different construction projects. It uses a customized toolkit with a mobile smartphone solution to administer Safety Training Scenarios which increases its portability in construction site compared to PC-based VR solutions.

We argue that organizations have different degrees of temporariness depending on the following five TO dimensions: temporal duration, nature of the task, team composition, hierarchy, and coordination. Considering the TO dimensions and varying degrees of temporariness, we propose a person-environment (P-E) fit model. The model comprises three levels - organizational-, group-, and job-oriented - and relates personal attributes to the TO dimensions. We contribute to theory by developing a set of propositions on the relationships between personal attributes and organizational-, group-, and job-oriented factors of the work environment in TOs. In doing so, we also extend research on P-E fit to temporary work environments. The model provides a theoretical basis for future empirical research on human resource management in TOs as well as criteria for practitioners involved in decisions on the staffing of temporary teams.

J	Zhang, BF; Zhu, ZH; Hammad, A; Aly, W				Zhang, Bingfei; Zhu, Zhenhua; Hammad, Amin; Aly, Walid			Automatic matching of construction onsite resources under camera views	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automatic matching; Construction onsite resources; Camera views; Combinatorial optimization	IMAGE; PROPAGATION; ALGORITHM	When a video camera network is placed on a construction site to monitor onsite activities, construction resources, such as equipment and worker, might be captured by two or more cameras at the same time. Therefore, it is important to conduct the matching to identify whether the resources captured into separate camera views refer to the same one on the site. Otherwise, it leads to the repetitive counting, when analyzing the onsite resources utilization automatically. This paper proposes a novel matching method that relies on the construction site visual features and the spatial relationships of onsite construction resources as the matching cues. Specifically, the method first searches the potential matching candidates between two camera views following their epipolar constraints. Then, the triangular coordinates of these candidates are calculated based on their locations in the triangular mesh of each camera view. This way, the matching of multiple construction resources between two camera views could be converted to a combinatorial optimization problem and solved with the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed method has been tested with the images and videos captured from real construction sites. The test results showed that the average matching accuracy could reach 93%.

Boundary object efficacy: The mediating role of boundary objects on task conflict in global virtual project networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Boundary objects; Conflict management; Culture; Global; Global projects; Global virtual project networks; Project networks; Virtual teams	FACE-TO-FACE; UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT; DEVELOPMENT TEAMS; SHARED IDENTITY; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION	As project-based industries such as Architecture, Engineering and Construction globalize, workers require strategies for managing conflict in virtual project networks. Our aim in this paper is to explore the efficacy of boundary objects as tools to mediate conflict in culturally-diverse, distributed networks. Based on annotated recordings for eight networks of graduate student engineers, we demonstrate that different interactional patterns between distributed engineers and boundary objects can lead to a reduction in conflict duration. We did not observe higher levels of conflict for global compared to domestic networks, but did discover that, regardless of network diversity, networks that interacted with the boundary objects in certain ways were able to identify and resolve conflicts more quickly. Our findings have important implications for theories of conflict management and boundary object efficacy in addition to practical applications to support conflict management in global virtual project networks.

The aim of this research is to investigate the extent to which operational benefits associated with different resource management policies pertaining to bottleneck configurations can be achieved in off-site construction. To this end, the flow shop environment is recognized as an appropriate operational framework for modeling production dynamics. A quadratic resource allocation model was developed to expose different operational performances corresponding to different resource management strategies. Different resource management policies included no cross-training, hiring single-skilled crew, direct capacity balancing, chaining, and hiring multiskilled crew. Operational performance encompassed makespan and labor costs. Production data from a prefabrication factory based in Melbourne, Australia, were fed to the model, providing the basis for comparison of different resource management policies. Research findings contribute to resource planning and management in off-site construction. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In this article, we revisit the concept by exploring what it means to work at the micro-level within this system. Adopting a practice lens, this study focuses on the daily work of site managers, a category of workers who often have been described to have a hub-like role in construction projects. The findings highlight how their work consists of activities that can be seen as mundane, yet simultaneously fill an important coupling function in the projects, which we conceptualize as coupling work. Coupling work denotes a managerial work practice through which site managers use slack from the parent organization to tighten site-activities. However, they do so in a particular way that tightens the projects closer to their own authority which, in turn, sustains organizational loose coupling. The study contributes to debates on change and development in construction by showing how coupling work is produced and reproduced to preserve the autonomy and control of site managers.

A review on current literature was conducted to develop a hypothetical skill model. Structural equation modelling method was used to test the hypotheses and develop the skill model. The results supported the research hypotheses by showing that the skill components positively influence safety management task implementation and safety climate development. The results further revealed that self-awareness, visioning, and apparent sincerity are the foundation skills and precursors of scoping and integration and self-management, which are the first-tier mediator skills. The second tier mediator skills include social awareness, social astuteness, and relationship management. It is suggested that construction organisations incorporate the training of these skills in their human resource development programs and that tertiary education institutions consider these skills in their construction management related curriculum.

Such hazards are significant contributors to accidents and fatalities. Computer vision has been used to auto-matically detect safety hazards to assist with the mitigation of accidents and fatalities. However, as safety regulations are subject to change and become more stringent prevailing computer vision approaches will become obsolete as they are unable to accommodate the adjustments that are made to practice. This paper integrates computer vision algorithms with ontology models to develop a knowledge graph that can automatically and accurately recognise hazards while adhering to safety regulations, even when they are subjected to change. Our developed knowledge graph consists of: (1) an ontological model for hazards: (2) knowledge extraction; and (3) knowledge inference for hazard identification. We focus on the detection of hazards associated with FFH as an example to illustrate our proposed approach. We also demonstrate that our approach can successfully detect FFH hazards in varying contexts from images.

Predicting thermal comfort in Shanghai's non-air-conditioned buildings	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptive behaviour; expectation; natural ventilation; predicted mean vote (PMV); thermal comfort	ENVIRONMENT	The thermal comfort of people in naturally ventilated environments was examined in a field study in Shanghai, China, in which over 1814 office workers responded to a questionnaire while simultaneous physical measurements were taken. The paper explores whether it is justifiable to use the predicted mean vote (PMV) model to predict inhabitants' thermal sensations. Participants cast votes on standard subjective thermal rating scales and these were correlated with temperature indices that variously account for the thermal impacts of humidity, radiant temperature, air velocity and clothing levels. It was found that the actual mean thermal sensation is lower than the PMV, i.e. about 0.64PMV. The upper boundary of operative temperature is about 29 degrees C which is outside of the current American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard comfort zone (ASHRAE 55-2004), but lower than the temperature of the upper 80% acceptable limit calculated using an adaptive model (30.1 degrees C). This suggests that people residing in this hot area have adapted to its climate and their expectations for comfort allow them to endure heat better than expected.

However, the relationship among these three variables remains unclear. In this study, based on findings from a survey of 218 global project workers representing 33 distinct project teams, we demonstrate the significance of role clarity and trust to individuals' project satisfaction and role clarity to individuals' project performance. We further uncover how global project team (GPT) members' satisfaction and/or performance are affected by where the GPT members are located and whether GPT members are co-located with their project manager. These findings are complemented by 18 in-person interviews with GPT members, which show how one must simultaneously establish and maintain role clarity for oneself while consistently negotiating role clarity with others also participating on global project teams. We conclude this study by outlining an emerging model for creating and sustaining GPTs that benefits both researchers and practitioners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA. All rights reserved.

The constant shift of workers leads to oscillations in the quality of work output. This paper initially examines the effect of the level of employee satisfaction with business processes functioning on the occurrence of internal or external turnover intentions. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods are applied with the purpose of the determination of the potential of corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions integration into the business processes of apparel industry organizations to reduce external turnover rates. Through the conducted research, conclusions about the potential success of the proposed measure of the integration of CSR dimensions in apparel industry organizations of different sizes are drawn, as well as practical implications for engineering managers within apparel industry.

The project scheduling of modular construction should consider the time involved in the factory production, transportation, and erection processes of the units given limited resources (e.g.,the number of modular units, available transportation, and workers) and project restrictions (e.g.,the sequences of manufacturing production and on-site installation). However, current modular construction project scheduling techniques and previous academic approaches cannot deal with the overall project processes and production/on-site installation sequences simultaneously. This is one reason few mass-production multiple projects exist in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, it can lead to inappropriate project management guidelines and fail to minimize the overall project duration. This paper suggests a model for modular construction projects scheduling using a genetic algorithm. The results show that implementing both overall project processes and project requirements is an efficient way to develop a modular construction project schedule. The proposed optimization tool will help project managers allocate resources efficiently and reduce the completion time of multiple projects.

Numerous studies have attempted to identify their root causes, contending that the prevention of defects could be achieved by eliminating the root causes. Yet, their direct causes also need to be considered in order to identify the sequence of events leading to defects. This study aims to classify the defective acts that are directly linked to the occurrence of a defect, in order to provide insights about the nature and the impact of different types of direct causes. The study involves investigation into 272 defects from 81 disputes that occurred in the Dubai residential construction industry in 2009. Results from this study reveal that the majority of construction defects are driven by a violation of practices or workers' lack of skill and competence. While it is difficult to prevent deliberate violations, increased effort toward growing skills and competencies would be effective in reducing defects, and therefore improving construction performance. Also, classification of defective acts is envisioned as a platform toward a more thorough causal tracking of construction defects, facilitating the identification of latent conditions resulting in defects.

J	Dunston, PS; Bernold, LE				Dunston, PS; Bernold, LE			Adaptive control for safe and quality rebar fabrication	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; PLACEMENT; DESIGN; MODEL	Rebar fabrication is a labor intensive operation that uses scrap or "trash" steel For raw materials and therefore can benefit greatly from improvements in safety, productivity, and quality. Shared control through a human-machine interface may be the best alternative for achieving highest quality standards and improving worker performance in safety and productivity. This paper develops a control scheme for automated rebar bending within the framework of computer integrated construction and presents research focused on the task level control to compensate for springback in the bent rebar. Three major problems are addressed: (1) Conception of a hierarchical computer integrated construction control structure that links rebar Fabrication to the other construction project functions: (2) comparative evaluation of alternative algorithms For prediction of springback; and (3) portability of a springback control model that uses real-time electronic sensing. Bending tests were conducted with both a laboratory prototype and an actual shop table bender to experiment with alternative models for in-process springback prediction including a neural network model. Limitations in control system portability were realized in the transfer from the laboratory prototype bender to the shop bender. Springback model evaluations revealed that empirical statistical models, neural networks, and in-process relaxation performed equally well.

Thus, the use of new technologies such, as building information modeling, automatic rule checking, information technology-based safety systems in order to implement the rules and safety standards, better controls the performance of workers on site and make high coordination between operational executives, leading to create a secure environment in projects by reducing accidents. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, a researcher-designed questionnaire was distributed among 200 companies that are active in the field of construction to evaluate the effect of building informationmodel (BIM) for safety projects and barriers to adoption. Only 70 percent of questionnaires were returned. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences analysis has been used to determine the correlation coefficient among the respondents. Findings - The results show the factors that lead to failure in the adoption of BIM in Iran are lack of well-trained personnel, proper social infrastructure, guidance and governmental supports. Originality/value - Finally, the authors presented solutions for overcoming barriers and proposed some factors leading to the successful adoption of BIM in Iran.

However, existing enabling technologies still suffer from a lack of economic feasibility, as well as technological compatibility with equipment fleets that are outdated or that consist of diverse manufacturers' models. In this context, this paper examines the feasibility of measuring the operational efficiency of equipment using low-cost accelerometers. Acceleration data in three axes were collected from a real-world operation of excavators that performed various duty cycles. Multiple features were calculated from acceleration data, and several classifiers using these features were tested to classify equipment operation into engine-off, idling, and working modes. An accuracy of over 93% was obtained in the classification of excavators' operation. This result has demonstrated that the application of low-cost accelerometers has the potential to provide a robust system to automatically measure the operational efficiency of construction equipment without any connection to its legacy engine system.

Due to the fact that the construction project consists of (safety point of view) the site plan and technological cards (notably these documents indicate safety design solutions), the indicators making up a comparable set of indicators to evaluate the site plan, technological cards and the entire project may vary and be diverse. Practice shows that the construction technology project or its parts thereof are to be assessed using 5 to 7 parameters, as in case of a larger quantity of indicators, the significance of each indicator becomes relatively lower and has effect on the priorities of line formation. To ensure the safety of workers on construction sites, when preparing construction technology projects, the application of experimental design is proposed, thus starting the evaluation of the quality of technological solutions to construction projects in terms of safety employing multicriteria mathematical methods.

Participants were provided one of three information formats, traditional, two-dimensional (2D) isometric drawings, 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 2D visual rendering of a three-dimensional (3D) image of the assembly, and 2D isometric drawings supplemented with a 3D physical model of the assembly. Card rotation and cube comparison tests were administered to measure spatial cognition. This paper's primary contribution centers around the discovery that individual spatial cognition significantly influenced the pipefitter's performance, but the format of information can neutralize the effect. Both the information format and spatial cognition significantly influenced performance. When only 2D information was provided, participants with relatively low spatial cognition performed significantly worse than participants with relatively higher spatial cognition. When the 2D isometric drawings were supplemented with 3D information, participants with lower spatial cognition were able to complete the model assembly as efficiently and effectively as participants with higher spatial cognition.

Successful adjustment of these newcomers to the role and organization has implications for performance, retention, and turnover of valuable knowledge workers. Organizations use several tactics to facilitate the new engineer's adjustment to the role and organization. This study investigated the socialization of 135 new engineers using the theoretical framework of organizational socialization tactics. The moderating effects of gender on new engineer adjustment are also examined since engineering is often described as a male-dominated profession. Results show that organizational socialization tactics strongly influence newcomer role clarity, workgroup integration, and task mastery. These proximal outcomes, in turn, lead to increased satisfaction and organizational commitment. Gender-specific differences are also found with regard to the impact of tactics on outcomes. Gender-moderated the effects of investiture, serial, and fixed tactics on role clarity and work group integration. Implications of the results for practice and theory are discussed.	[Kowtha, N.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the extent of research carried out in the field. The paper reports on a scoping literature review on crime in the AEC industry and explores how the literature covers crime in construction, and more specifically the topics of materials, organization, and health, safety, and environment (HSE). The results indicate that research in this area has only recently begun to take off. Characteristics of the AEC industry seem to facilitate the embedding of criminal actors, and in turn, activities leading to crime. The research topics are not covered evenly, and some, namely materials and HSE issues, are lagging behind. This study aids practitioners by highlighting the extent of these topics within the AEC industry. It also provides a number of departure points that can be used by academics for further research.

Previous studies have proven that board composition in organizations can be related to illegal business behaviors. By analyzing board composition data from 45 publicly listed construction companies in Taiwan, this paper provides a tool for predicting corporate misconduct (CM). A support vector machine (SVM) was used to construct such a prediction model, and a logistic regression model was used as a benchmark to assess the performance of the established SVM model. The established SVM model achieved an accuracy rate of 72.22% for predicting the occurrence of CM when applied to all observations in the sample, with a rate of 90% accuracy in predicting misconduct by companies found guilty of doing so in the sample, thus performing better than the logistic regression model. The developed model yields new insights on previous research and can guide stakeholders to reduce the risk of illegal business acts occurring in the construction industry.

There is a need for innovative and cost-effective occupational safety approaches. The Finnish construction industry and its key stakeholders have introduced a new safety training concept, called the Safety Training Park (STP). The STP consists of full-scale training points that use new training methods to stimulate individual safe behaviour and to improve safety climate within workgroups and companies. The Safety Training Park in Northern Finland (STPNF) was designed, constructed, and financed through a collaborative process that included over 80 organizations. A realistic evaluation approach was applied to document the effectiveness of STPNF training from individual and organizational perspectives. Results indicate that the dialogical STP approach with several information sharing channels fits the target groups. Evidence regarding effectiveness at the organizational level is also discussed. Cost-benefit calculations show that the multi-organizational coalition model enables efficient occupational safety and health training with reasonable costs.

We report the results of a study focused on the issue of facilitating the movement of experienced COBOL programmers to become users of the C programming language, The study, conducted at a major financial services firm, is based upon a behavioral model of the acceptance of innovations that derives its foundations from research in social psychology, information technology acceptance, and innovation adoption. The model posits a relationship between beliefs about a target new technology and the subsequent adoption of the technology. Beliefs, in turn, are hypothesized to be influenced by a variety of external factors such as training and individual characteristics. Results suggest that certain beliefs do play a central role in determining acceptance behavior. Results also point to external factors such as organizational tenure, prior technical knowledge, training experiences, and perceived job insecurity that have significant effects on these beliefs. Theoretical and practical implications that follow are discussed.

Due to the significant increase in the weights of modules in recent years, ensuring the integrity of ground support under the crane tracks is paramount for avoiding collapse, which ultimately results in dire consequences for the workers and the project. Consequently, the first order of business is to determine the expected pressure under the tracks to determine the ground support necessary. Typically, the ground bearing pressure (GBP) is computed using the fundamentals of statistics at the four edges of the crane (left front and rear and right front and rear), assuming the track width is under uniform loading. However, finite-element analysis (FEA) shows that the GBP values vary even for two corners of an edge (widthwise). In contrast to the traditional four-point approach, the present study proposes a new methodology to not only calculate the GBP at all the eight corners of crawler tracks, but also to calculate the GBP anywhere on the track area, which can establish the GBP profile in detail.

These represent $6.46 million (2016 USD) in purchases incentivized through the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (OHBWC) Safety Intervention Grant (SIG) program. The source data in the review were extracted from employer grant applications and final reports of the case studies. Results were aggregated by type of construction equipment and included the reduction in safety and ergonomic hazards (risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders), and an assessment of the quality of the case studies as determined through criteria established by the authors. Equipment associated with greatest reduction in risk factors and with case studies of higher quality were electrical cable feeding/pulling systems, concrete sawing equipment, skid steer attachments for concrete breaking, and manlifts (boom lifts). This review illustrates challenges in demonstrating efficacy of equipment interventions to improve construction safety/health-even from case studies within a structured health/safety program. The authors are aware of no other systematic review of case studies reporting on experiences with health/safety intervention equipment specific to the construction industry.

J	Moezzi, M				Moezzi, Mithra			Are comfort expectations of building occupants too high?	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						adaptive behaviour; air-conditioning; climate change; comfort; occupant satisfaction; workplace		The recent Building Research & Information special issue titled 'Comfort in a Lower Carbon Society' has taken up, with subtlety and diversity, prospects for reducing the energy consumed in creating thermal comfort. As this excellent collection of papers shows, comfort quickly becomes 'about nearly everything', so the interdisciplinary discussions such as provided by the special issue are critical to understanding how comfort expectations and comfort provision might change. The following commentary draws out two lines of enquiry from this collection, both relating to everyday experiences of comfort and its acquisition. The first line explores evidence that people are not as thermally comfortable in their places of work as design values specify and as theory assumes. This leads to renewed questions about theory versus design, adaptation, relationships of thermal to other kinds of comfort, and expectations of workers as well as by them. More speculatively, it reflects briefly on how comfort works outside the workplace, in the car and finally at home. The second line explores the theme of expectations about proper conduct, energy-wise and otherwise, in an era of intensified climate change communications and conservation campaigns.

Jerk as an indicator of physical exertion and fatigue	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Physical exertion; Fatigue; Jerk; Lifting; Masonry; Ergonomics; Motion sensing	MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; MUSCLE FATIGUE; MOTION CAPTURE; CONSTRUCTION; WORKERS; DESIGN; COORDINATION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDITY; DEMANDS	Physical exertion may result in fatigue which is a key factor leading to increased risk of injury, reduced productivity, and decline in work quality in construction. Most practical fatigue assessments rely on subjective measurement scales including surveys and questionnaires. While they have the advantage of being inexpensive to implement, they lack reliability. Objective assessments of physical exertion and fatigue that are based on physiological processes are more reliable, however they are cumbersome to implement on-site. The advent of low-cost, wearable motion sensors has made high-frequency sampling of kinematic data possible. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using jerk, the time derivative of acceleration, as an indicator of physical exertion as fatigue develops over the course of a demanding task. As a proof-of-concept, the method was first tested on participants completing a repetitive physically demanding exercise. The method was then demonstrated in a study of masonry work done by bricklayers with varying levels of masonry experience. We conclude that jerk is a useful indicator of physical exertion and experience level.

J	Chen, C; Zhu, ZH; Hammad, A				Chen, Chen; Zhu, Zhenhua; Hammad, Amin			Automated excavators activity recognition and productivity analysis from construction site surveillance videos	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Excavator; Activity recognition; Visual detection; Visual tracking; Productivity analysis; Automatic systems	EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS; WORKERS ACTIVITIES; EQUIPMENT; FEATURES	The productivity of construction equipment plays an important role in completing construction projects within schedule and under budget. However, the current productivity monitoring on construction sites highly depends on manually observing and recording equipment activities, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, an increasing number of research studies focused on automatically identifying equipment activities from site surveillance videos. However, these studies failed to accurately conduct the activity recognition and productivity analysis, when multiple pieces of equipment are working together. This research proposes a novel framework for automatically analyzing the activity and productivity of multiple excavators. In this framework, three convolutional neural networks are designed to detect, track and recognize the activities of excavators. The results are further compiled to analyze excavator's activity time, working cycle, and productivity. The proposed framework has been tested with the videos recorded from real construction sites. The overall activity recognition has achieved 87.6% accuracy. The productivity calculation has achieved 83% accuracy, which indicates the feasibility of the proposed framework for automating the monitoring of excavator's productivity.

However, ABM alone cannot take into account the subjective uncertainty that exists in many construction systems. In this paper, a methodology for the development of fuzzy agent-based models in construction is provided, and its application is illustrated using a case study modeling construction crew motivation and performance. This paper makes three contributions: first, it expands ABM's scope of applicability by integrating it with fuzzy logic to create fuzzy agent-based modeling (FABM) in construction, which can handle both probabilistic and subjective uncertainty; second, it provides a novel methodology for developing fuzzy agent-based models, allowing for the development of new models to assess construction processes and practices; and third, it develops a fuzzy agent-based model of construction crew motivation and performance, which improves the assessments of performance by considering not only the interactions of crews in the project, but also the subjective uncertainty in model variables.

The authors used self-reported data from 3,294 staff members collected over 11months throughout the project and employed logistic regression to compare responses from three role groups, namely supervisors/managers, crew chiefs/lead workers, and employees as well as from three affiliation groups, namely respondents working at division, district, and office levels. As for roles, employees, the main users of ERP system, were less optimistic about the project. As for affiliations, districts were less optimistic about the project. Investigating TxDOT's implementation approach suggested that lack of hands-on training, widespread content of work and variations in daily tasks, and proximity to the power structure might explain the findings. Employees and those from districts might have seen more risk to them personally and been less aware of the significance of the project to TxDOT's efficiency and effectiveness. To help state transportation agencies enhance end-users' acceptance of ERP implementation, relevant recommendations from organizational communication studies are provided.

Empirical Study to Investigate the Difficulties of Implementing Safety Practices in the Repair and Maintenance Sector in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction industry; Accidents; Injuries; Occupational safety; Hong Kong	DELPHI; WORK	Repair, maintenance, minor alteration, and addition work (RMAA) has become more and more important in developed societies, but its safety performance is alarming. For example, RMAA projects accounted for 53.2% of the total construction market and the percentage of RMAA accidents to all construction accidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) increased considerably in 2007. The RMAA sector has a huge potential for safety improvement. This study aims to explore and evaluate the difficulties of implementing safety practices in RMAA work. The mixed methods approach was adopted, and semistructured interviews and a two-round Delphi survey were conducted for the data collection. Major difficulties were identified, including limited safety resources for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), difficulty in changing the mindset of RMAA workers, and difficulty in performing safety supervision. These obstacles for implementing safety practices in the RMAA sector, if successfully removed, could significantly improve the safety performance of the RMAA sector and the construction industry as a whole.

Hence, research efforts have focused on applying Image-based techniques in the construction industry to improve the safety and productivity of construction operations as well as the resilience and sustainability of the construction assets. This paper explores the state-of-the-art in Image-based analysis techniques and their applications in construction. Over 100 journal papers were retrieved from the Scopus database for an in-depth review of major applications, benefits, and areas of future research potential. Accordingly, Three main research directions were identified that utilize image-based technologies: (1) construction safety; (2) progress monitoring; and (3) damage assessment. It is observed that most research efforts focused on object detection (e.g., hardhats, defects) for safety inspection and repair planning. Potential future developments include integrating object detection with quantification and sizing techniques to develop more comprehensive applications.

However, significant portions of the image regions contain little useful information to project engineers and managers. To reduce resource waste in data storage and retrieval, we developed a new semantic region detection approach using transfer learning and modified saliency computation method without the need to specify targeted objects. In the new approach, the saliency matrix is generated using labelled bounding boxes, and the semantic regions are selected using a developed algorithm. The proposed method was applied to case studies based on two image datasets. The case studies suggest that the proposed method can efficiently detect semantic regions in site images and detect construction events from other image datasets without a modifying or retraining process. The research contributes to construction image analytics academically by advancing the context-based semantic region detection method and practically by facilitating the effective storage and processing of the massive site images and videos.

J	Sakhakarmi, S; Park, J; Cho, C				Sakhakarmi, Sayan; Park, JeeWoong; Cho, Chunhee			Enhanced Machine Learning Classification Accuracy for Scaffolding Safety Using Increased Features	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scaffold; Construction site; Safety; Machine learning; Support vector machine (SVM)	HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; FALL HAZARDS; BIM; LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION; PREVENTION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Despite regular safety inspections and safety planning, numerous fatal accidents related to scaffold take place at construction sites. Current practices relying on human inspection are not only impractical but also ineffective due to dynamic construction activities. Furthermore, a scaffold typically consists of multiple bays and stories, which leads to complexity in its structural behaviors with various modes of failure. However, previous studies considered only a limited number of failure cases for a simple one-bay scaffold while exploring machine-learning (ML) approaches to predict safety conditions. Thus, the authors have proposed an approach to monitor a complicated scaffolding structure in real time. This study explored a method of classifying scaffolding failure cases and reliably predicting safety conditions based on strain data sets from scaffolding columns. Furthermore, the research team successfully enhanced the predicting accuracy of ML classification by the proposed self-multiplication method to increase the number of features such as strain data sets. Implementation of the proposed methodology is expected to enable the monitoring of a large, complex system at construction sites.

They must be situated in convenient locations as ease of access can have a significant impact on the efficiency and safety of the construction project. The feasible locations and layouts that satisfy all specified conditions and constraints can still be very large in number; thus, optimal layout planning can be very challenging, even for experienced engineers. A model for solving the construction site layout problem (CSLP) is proposed. A grid system is implemented to simulate sites and facilities more realistically. This model incorporates an algorithm that imitates and calculates the distances of typical travel paths of workers between a pair of facilities during construction operations. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimisation is adopted to solve the problem model. The prototype program was developed and tested on a real construction project case. The results show that the model was able to lay out the site efficiently and optimally. The resulting layouts were better than those from engineers and conventional distance calculation methods.

However, research topics about CLP are highly diversified and there is a lack of systematic analysis in CLP-related issues. Through a systematic review of selected papers from well-known academic journals in construction management, major research areas are identified, such as factors affecting CLP, modeling and evaluation of CLP, methods and technology for CLP improvement, trends and comparisons of CLP, effects of change/variation on CLP, and baseline/benchmarking CLP. Critical reviews on these areas are presented by focusing on industry, project, and activity levels to investigate the state of the art and trends in CLP research. Gaps in research and practices are discussed and future research directions are proposed. The outcome of this paper may provide a platform for both researchers and industrial practitioners to appreciate the latest developments and trends in productivity research.	[Yi, Wen; Chan, Albert P.

This paper aims to identify the motivational factors that affect employees' performance in Kuwait construction industry. Many studies conducted regarding motivational factors for construction workers and site engineers, but there is limited research work aimed to identify the motivational factors for construction employees. The Relative Importance Index (RII) was used to rank the motivational factors for different surveyed categories. The study revealed that the most important motivation factors are job security followed by salary and promotion arrangements while taking responsibility is the least motivational factor. The male group of participants chose salary while the female group chose job security. Normal employees chose good relationships with work companions, while managers chose job security as the top-ranked motivational factor. ANOVA test and Spearman correlation analysis were used to analyze the distinguishing difference between different surveyed categories ranking. This analysis concluded that there is no significant correlation between most of the surveyed categories indicating that there is no consensus between study categories regarding motivational factors ranking. This study's result is important to understand motivational factors which can enhance the working environments to improve productivity for the construction industry.

Much research effort has gone toward analyzing this phenomenon, yet a majority of which focused on isolated elements while ignored the work system. Modern work systems are complex, within which humans interact with technology, social structures, and environments. Outcomes (including accidents and injuries) resulting from such a complex system are not attained by any system element in isolation. As a result, effective risk management requires the control over the whole sociotechnical system (STS). This work demonstrates such an effort in investigating STSs. The work uses a triangulation approach in examining construction-fatality reports. The findings identify three typical STSs, reveal their system weaknesses, and provide remedial recommendations. The work contributes to the knowledge body of risk management, electrical safety, and research methodologies. The introduced triangulation approach in injury analysis and intervention is grounded in the broad concept of workplace safety, namely, organizational, social, political, and psychological contexts.

Immigration and Construction: Analysis of the Impact of Immigration on Construction Project Costs	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Immigration; Costs		There are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States. Of this population, research shows that approximately 19% work in the construction industry, comprising around 14% of all construction workforces. The main objectives of this research are to (1) to predict possible effects of immigration and immigration reform legislation on worker wages and (2) to assess the likely wage increase due to decreased supply of immigrant labor. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, the construction workforces for low-skilled trades such as concrete, masonry, drywall, painting, flooring, and roofing are comprised of approximately 55% illegal immigrant. Based on four factors evaluated in this research (1) prevailing wage provision in legislation; (2) forced tax compliance of the workforce; (3) market correction from currently depressed wages due to immigrant penetration into the workforce; and (4) a labor shortage resulting from a depleted supply of immigrant labor, proposed legislation could increase the cost of trade labor up to almost 70% in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Overall labor costs for projects could increase by almost 18%, and total project costs could rise almost 12% in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region.

J	Mitropoulos, P; Cupido, G; Namboodiri, M				Mitropoulos, Panagiotis; Cupido, Gerardo; Namboodiri, Manoj			Cognitive Approach to Construction Safety: Task Demand-Capability Model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ACCIDENT CAUSATION; INJURY; WORK; ENVIRONMENTS; MANAGEMENT	In the evolution of safety research, the literature identifies three paradigms: normative, error-based, and cognitive engineering. Traditionally, strategies to improve construction safety have been based on the normative paradigm-compliance with prescribed safety rules. However, the normative approach ignores how the characteristics of the production system and team processes influence the work behaviors and the possibility of errors and accidents. These factors are the focus of the cognitive engineering perspective. This study develops a cognitive model of construction safety, which conceptualizes safety as an emergent property of the production system. The model proposes that during a task, the task demands and the applied capabilities determine the potential for errors and accidents. It also proposes that the production practices and the teamwork processes of the crew shape the work situations that the workers face-that is, the task demands and the applied capability. Empirical evidence from recent case studies is discussed. The cognitive perspective shifts the focus of accident prevention from conformance with rules to the issues of task demands and applied capabilities, and the factors affecting them-such as work design, workload, resource allocation, and team processes.

The main purpose of the study is to investigate the rarely discussed role of shared leadership in the successful completion of these types of projects. The data were collected from 216 site engineers working in Tier 3 construction companies on two time points. PROCESS Macro was used to test the hypothesized framework. The results showed that shared leadership plays a direct, significant role in the successful delivery of projects and, through members' autonomy, meets individual psychological needs. Slope analysis revealed that knowledge sharing moderates the relationship between shared leadership and autonomy. The present study's framework deepens the understanding of construction projects with self-determination theory that shared leadership fulfills workers' psychological needs (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) and leads project deliverables. With a multifaceted project approach, this study highlighted that shared leadership is not limited to one dimension of project success but positively impacts project cost, client use, effectiveness, satisfaction, performance, and time management.

To reduce exposure to these risks, an investigation of workstation design is needed. This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based ergonomic assessment method that identifies ergonomic risk ratings proactively in the initial phases of workstation design, thus reducing the need for physical mock-ups and lessening the cost and time required to develop and implement an improved workstation design. This method was demonstrated in an operational task through an experiment conducted with 13 participants. Compared with the physical mock-up, the designed VR application achieved an accuracy of approximately 86% and 80%, respectively, in Rapid Upper Limb Assessment and Rapid Entire Body Assessment to assess risk. Moreover, a questionnaire was developed to obtain feedback from participants on their perceptions toward the designed VR application, which further supported the success of using the proposed VR-based ergonomic assessment method.

Advanced digital fabrication technologies can offer new ways to fill the gap between design and construction. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is one such technology that has many potentials in various fields, however, its capabilities are not sufficiently explored yet, especially in the field of digital fabrication. This study presents a new affordable interactive multi-marker augmented reality tool for constructing free-form modular surfaces implemented by integrating common accessible devices. The proposed tool consists of two digital cameras, a head-mounted display, a processor, and two markers that enable the user to virtually see the accurate location of any proposed object in the real world. A controlling subsystem was also designed to enhance the accuracy of construction. Method efficiency was studied in five full-scale prototypes. The results showed that the majority of errors (91%) were less than 6 mm, and 2 for lateral placements and orientation errors.

J	Coleman, MJ; Irvine, KN; Lemon, M; Shao, L				Coleman, Michael J.; Irvine, Katherine N.; Lemon, Mark; Shao, Li			Promoting behaviour change through personalized energy feedback in offices	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						behaviour; energy demand; energy monitoring; feedback; human agency; offices; wireless technologies	HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; INFORMATION; BUILDINGS; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSERVATION; OCCUPANCY; REDUCTION; EQUIPMENT; MONITORS; PRIVACY	A body of research suggests that the provision of energy feedback information to building users can elicit significant energy reductions through behaviour change. However, most studies have focused on energy use in homes and the assessment of interventions and technologies, to the neglect of the non-domestic context and broader issues arising from the introduction of feedback technologies. To address this gap, a non-domestic case study explores the delivery of personalized energy feedback to office workers through a novel system utilizing wireless technologies. The research demonstrates advantages of monitoring occupancy and quantifying energy use from specific behaviours as a basis for effective energy feedback; this is particularly important where there are highly disaggregated forms of energy use and a range of locations for that activity to take place. Quantitative and qualitative data show that personalized feedback can help individuals identify energy reduction opportunities. However, the analysis also highlights important contextual barriers and issues that need to be addressed when utilizing feedback technologies in the workplace. If neglected, these issues may limit the effective take-up of feedback interventions.

J	Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD				Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD			Exposure to hand-arm vibration: implications of new statutory requirements	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction working practices; exposure times; hand-arm vibration; health and safety legislation; plant and equipment; statutory duty; vibration data		One particular source of vibration exposure for manual workers results from using hand-held power tools. This is generally termed exposure to hand-arm vibration (HAV). Potential negative health effects from HAV were identified at the turn of the 20th century and have become more scientifically understood since then. Due to the nature of its activities, the construction industry is one industry sector representing significant HAV exposure risk. As of July 2005, the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations (CVWR) incorporate HAV into the UK workplace health and safety statute. Implications of the CVWR upon the construction sector are explored, particularly in the context of how construction activities may be affected by the new HAV exposure action and limit values. The paper also demonstrates potential 'problems' of considering (equipment) manufacturers' vibration data with those resulting from measurement of equipment at the workplace. It is concluded that due to limits on operator exposure times to higher vibration tools, the UK construction sector must ultimately come to terms with what will effectively represent an influential change in many of its on-site working practices.

The method consists of three techniques: removing-and-inpainting, cut-and-paste, and image-variation. The removing-and-inpainting technique arbitrarily removes objects from images and reconstructs the removed regions via generative adversarial networks (GAN). The cut-and-paste technique extracts objects from the original dataset and places them into the reconstructed images via the previous technique. The image-variation technique applies three image transformation techniques, intensity-, blur- and scale-variation, to the images. To evaluate the method, 656 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired construction site images were used as the original dataset. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) trained with the augmented training dataset achieves better performance, which is higher than that of a network trained with the original dataset. These results prove that the method is optimal for improving construction resource detection in UAV-acquired images.

J	Tajeen, H; Zhu, ZH				Tajeen, Humaira; Zhu, Zhenhua			Image dataset development for measuring construction equipment recognition performance	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automation; Construction equipment; Dataset; Evaluation; Performance characteristics	OBJECT RECOGNITION; FEATURES	The recognition of construction operational resources (equipment, workers, materials, etc.) has played an important role in achieving fully automated construction. So far, many object recognition methods have been developed in computer vision; however, they have been tested with a few categories of objects in natural scenes. Therefore, their performance on the recognition of construction operational resources is unclear, especially considering construction sites are typically dirty, disorderly, and cluttered. This paper proposes a standard dataset of construction site images to measure the construction equipment recognition performance of existing object recognition methods. Thousands of images have been collected and compiled, which cover 5 classes of construction equipment (excavator, loader, dozer, roller and backhoe). Each image has been annotated with the equipment type, location, orientation, occlusion, and labeling of equipment components (bucket, stick, boom etc.). The effectiveness of the dataset has been evaluated with two well-known object recognition methods in computer vision. The results show that the dataset could successfully identify the performance of these methods in terms of correctness, robustness, and speed of recognizing construction equipment.

Evaluation of Trenchless Technology Methods for Municipal Infrastructure System	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure; Trenchless technology; Deterioration; Rehabilitation; Underground structures		The deterioration of municipal underground infrastructure systems and a growing demand for utility services have increased the necessity for more efficient installation, inspection, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of underground utilities. With conventional open-cut construction methods, direct costs are greatly increased by the need to restore ground surfaces such as sidewalks, pavement, landscaping, and brick paving. Furthermore, taking social and environmental factors into account, open-cut methods have adverse impacts on the community, business, and commuters due to undesirable pollution and traffic disruptions. Trenchless technologies that are used to repair, upgrade, replace, or install underground infrastructure systems with minimum surface disruption offer a viable alternative to existing open-cut methods. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for quantitatively assessing and comparing direct, social, and environmental costs associated with municipal underground pipeline construction. It is suggested that decision makers consider combining these costs with direct capital costs so that the best alternative is selected, which in certain cases can make trenchless technology the most economical alternative. Moreover, productivity, workers' safety, and structural issues have shown that trenchless technology is a more efficient method for underground infrastructure systems.

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Abusive supervision; work to family conflict; psychological distress; family support; construction projects	SOCIAL SUPPORT; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; OCCUPATIONAL STRESS; PATERNALISTIC LEADERSHIP; JOB-SATISFACTION; LIFE; COMMITMENT; MEDIATION; PERFORMANCE; BURNOUT	Work to family conflict (WFC) experienced by employees working in the construction industry has received significant attention from researchers. However, workplace bullying and incivility are rarely considered in relation to WFC, and even more rarely in the context of Chinese construction. Consequently, this study aims to examine how abusive supervisors can influence WFC for employees. Through two surveys of Chinese construction workers, this study analyses the mediation effect of employee psychological distress, and the moderation mechanism of employee family support on the relationship between abusive supervision and employee WFC. The findings show that abusive supervision is positively related to employee WFC, and employees' psychological distress mediates this relationship significantly. Employee family support moderates the direct and indirect relationship between abusive supervision and employee WFC. Understanding how abusive supervision influences employee WFC is useful for both its theoretical and practical implications, particularly in effectively relieving employee work pressure, reducing the transfer of individual stress into the family domain, promoting employee well-being, and improving construction project performance.

Almost all projects in Yemen face challenges to attain the preplanned outcomes. This paper aims to uncover and assess the critical factors causing failure to the construction industry. At initial study?s stage, a comprehensive literature investigation on academic articles was carried out to determine 62 critical factors causing failures to the industry. Then, a quantitative study was carried out using questionnaire survey as a method to obtain the data. 5-points Likert type scales were applied to assess the factors. Then, the factors were categorized into five different groups. Collected data from the survey was analyzed using SPSS software based on relative importance index (RII) and standard deviations for ranking purposes. The study found that, the top ten ranked factors among 62 factors are poor construction management, frequent change of design, continuous suspension of work, shortage of raw materials, hiring uneducated contactor, low salary for engineers and construction workers, cash flow and financial difficulty, delay of progress payment to subcontractors, financial difficulty faced by owners and poor financial control and management. Results from this study are recommended to the Yemeni government in improving the current state of its construction industry.

These management strategies are widely implemented because they are believed to improve labor productivity in general construction projects. However, their effectiveness and relationship with labor productivity have not been systematically studied. Data were collected from 111 general construction projects. The statistical tests confirmed that labor productivity is significantly higher in construction projects with a high-level implementation of the management strategies compared with low-level implementation. The results showed that management strategies such as communication and incentive programs have a strong positive relationship with labor productivity. This paper's major contribution to the overall body of knowledge is that it proves and quantifies the effectiveness of and the relationship of these management strategies with labor productivity through more comprehensive statistical methods than previous studies. It also introduces a tool to assist construction managers in benchmarking the implementation level of the management strategies against similar projects to reveal the areas that require further improvement to achieve higher labor productivity.

These information systems are described as public health information systems (PHIS) in China. When PHIS has thus evolved in a haphazard and fragmented way under the pressure administrative, economic and legal, local health workers who are overburdened with multiple and time-consuming reporting requirements cannot deliver timely, accurate and complete data. Seeing that the information of disease surveillance is provided by hospitals and health service centers in China and that the development of electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) occurs under the policy and investment of health since 2009 in China, there should be a connection and data sharing mechanism between EMR (EHR) and PHIS to support public health surveillance and public health decision-making. The paper aims at discussing current status and problems of PHIS in China, making a brief introduction on the blueprint of health information technology in China, exploring solution for interoperability between PHIS and EHR (EMR), and sharing some experiences and lessons from pilot project on automatic notifiable infectious disease reporting.

Along with globalizing trends in project delivery, the workforce is also globalizing. It is common for engineers to move to other countries as expatriate workers or as emigrants to pursue job opportunities in other firms. Where much is known about global networks of engineers collaborating on projects, little is known about the mediating role played by individuals that share the same nationality as an international partner on a project. In this paper, we examine two project teams executing complex, reciprocally interdependent design projects in India. One team was comprised of Indians and Americans. The other team was identical, but also contained an Indian national who had studied and worked in the United States. Both teams worked on similar design schedule optimization problems. Over the duration of three days, we examined the interactions of the teams assembled to finalize their designs. Through quantitative network analysis and qualitative observations of the cross-cultural interactions, we found the Indian expatriate to play a cultural boundary spanning role resolving cross-cultural knowledge system conflicts and increasing collaboration effectiveness. We induce a propositional theoretical model of cultural boundary spanning in global engineering project networks.

In this paper, we study the development of a road stripe removing equipment that uses a high-pressure water jet system and a semi-automatic control system. The water jet system consists of an intensifier and nozzles to focus a high-pressure water injection on the stripes. The semi-automatic control system is composed of rotary actuator using a DC-geared motor controlled by a lever. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of road stripes and investigate current removing methods in the field. Moreover, we discuss the development of automatic removing equipment, and perform a basic experiment to find out the optimal injection conditions such as the injection distance, injection angle and injection pressure. Finally, in order to examine the perfonnance of the equipment, the whole system is evaluated, and the economic efficiency and marketability are also analyzed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wagner, H; Kim, AJ; Gordon, L				Wagner, Heidi; Kim, Angella J.; Gordon, Linsey			Relationship between Personal Protective Equipment, Self-Efficacy, and Job Satisfaction of Women in the Building Trades	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Women in construction; Personal protective equipment; Job satisfaction; Labor and personnel issues	SHORT-FORM; MODERATOR	Within construction trades, there is a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and work clothing specifically designed and manufactured for women. This was a mixed methods study designed to investigate the use of PPE and work clothing among tradeswomen and to examine attributes significantly related to PPE/work clothing satisfaction using the Functional-Expressive-Aesthetic (FEA) consumer needs model. In addition, the relationship between PPE/work clothing, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction were quantitatively analyzed. The findings of this study suggest the common phrase dress for success applies beyond white-collar workers. The data showed clear connections between satisfaction of PPE and work clothing, self-efficacy, and overall satisfaction of trades work. Although it is a leap to imply properly fitting PPE can improve the statistics of job retention for tradeswomen, this research indicates it is logical to suggest wearing proper PPE and work clothing creates a more positive work experience for women within the building trades. This study provides empirical evidence of steps employers can take (namely, providing proper PPE and work clothing for women on site) to improve the job satisfaction of a diversifying workforce.

J	Winch, GM				Winch, GM			Institutional reform in British construction: partnering and private finance	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						professional system; partnering; private finance; movement for innovation; public sector procurement; British construction; institutional change; UK		The British construction industry is presently going through a period of rapid change. A combination of government-led reform initiatives, changes in government procurement strategies, and increasing exposure to international competition is focusing minds and shifting positions. This paper provides an analysis of the institutional aspects of these changes, identifying the root of the problems that the reforms are tackling, and indicating what the prospects of success might be. The paper starts with a historical overview of the evolution of what is here called the professional system, which has dominated the British industry for 150 years. This provides the context for the exploration of the two principal forces for change in the industry - the reform of contractual relations, especially the diffusion of partnering, and the shift of government procurement towards concession contracting in the shape of the Private Finance Initiative. In conclusion, the prospects for success are discussed, noting that the British construction industry is relatively successful in international markets, but that it shares many traditional problems of other sectors of British industry - the predominance of personal capitalism has meant a failure to develop organizational capabilities - the most notable symptom being the continuing reliance on self-organizing gangs of workers for actual production.

J	Bai, Y; Huan, J; Kim, S				Bai, Yong; Huan, Jun; Kim, Seonghoon			Measuring Bridge Construction Efficiency Using the Wireless Real-Time Video Monitoring System	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bridge; Computer vision; Construction; Efficiency; Neural networks; Real time	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; ALGORITHM	To enhance the efficiency of bridge construction, the wireless real-time video monitoring system (WRITE) was developed. Utilizing the advanced technologies of computer vision and artificial neural networks, the developed system first wirelessly acquired a sequence of images of work-face operations. Then human pose analyzing algorithms processed these images in real time to generate human poses associated with construction workers who performed the operations. Next, a portion of the human poses were manually classified into three categories as effective work, contributory work, and ineffective work and were used to train the built-in artificial neural networks (ANN). Finally, the trained neural networks were employed to decide the ongoing laborers' working status by comparing the in coming images to the developed human poses. The developed system was tested for accuracy on a bridge construction project. Results of the test showed that efficiency measurements by the system were reasonably accurate when compared to the measurements produced by the manual method. Thus, the success of this research indicates promise for enabling project managers to quickly identify work-face operation problems and to take actions immediately to address these problems.

J	Huang, RY; Chen, JJ; Sun, KS				Huang, RY; Chen, JJ; Sun, KS			Planning gang formwork operations for building construction using simulations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						construction; building; formwork; reuse; simulation; CYCLONE		Concrete formwork is a labor-intensive and time-consuming operation. Many modular formwork systems have been developed to automate the process. Such systems improve the productivity as well as the cost-effectiveness of the operation. However, proper planning for the form reuse schemes in the design as well as the construction phases of a building, including resource allocations (modular form sets, cranes, workers, etc.), and the construction sequence, is vital for ensuring a successful use of modular formwork systems. Computer process simulation techniques are employed in this research for the study of different form reuse schemes to use gang forming systems in building construction. Five form reuse schemes are identified. The CYCLONE modeling methodology is employed to develop computer models for each of them. MicroCYCLONE simulations and sensitivity analyses of the schemes, using different numbers of form sets, cranes, and labor crews, are then conducted for a real case to assess their impact on the productivity as well as the cost-effectiveness of the operation. The objective is to better understand the characteristics of different form reuse schemes and, in turn, to produce better plans for gang forming construction. Thus, the application of modular formwork systems in building construction can be facilitated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite a need to understand how design elements of urban living impact our psychological well-being (e.g., stress), very little research has used quantitative, objective tools to measure how existing or proposed urban development impacts the human experience. In this study, we leverage advances in biometric sensing to measure psychophysiological responses to a variety of urban forms using highly controlled virtual, rather than costly and difficult to control, real-life settings. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that certain urban form characteristics impact human psychophysiology. To do so, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) in 35 participants exploring virtual environments that varied in building height and the presence of greenery (e.g., trees). Based on EEG metrics that are sensitive to stress, we found that urban environments with greenery and lower height buildings were associated with less stress. Overall, our results suggest that biometric measures of brain states, combined with virtual environments, can be utilized to assess the effects of urban elements on people's psychological well-being and guide the redevelopment and planning of urban environments.

Despite the acknowledgement that culture improvement results in better H&S performance or behavior, there is still no consensus on how to measure and improve H&S culture in an organization. The study therefore aimed to characterize and rate construction organizations' H&S culture using existing H&S culture models and to determine the level on the safety culture maturity model (SCMM) and its relationship with H&S behavior in the organizations. Empirical data were collected using questionnaires distributed in three provinces in South Africa. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, to output mean scores, standard deviation and Pearson's correlation values. The study revealed a strong correlation between an organization's leadership, involvement, procedures, commitment, communication and competence (LIP +3C) and the Safety Culture Maturity as well as behavior. These findings demonstrate that improving the level of factors characterized by the LIP +3C model would lead to improving H&S performance as evidenced on the SCMM model and the exhibited behavior in workers and management. Cultural progress and maturity can be tracked using the SCMM model.

To address such issues, this study presents a non-intrusive earthmoving productivity analysis method using imaging and simulation. The site access log of dump trucks is used to infer earthmoving contexts, which is produced by analyzing videos recorded at the entrance and the exit of a construction site. An algorithm for license plate detection and recognition in an uncontrolled environment is developed to automatically produce the site access log, by leveraging video deinterlacing, a deep convolutional network, and rule-based post-processing. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for producing the site access log. Based on the site access log, simulation-based productivity analysis is conducted to produce a daily productivity report, which can provide the basis for earthmoving resource planning. It is expected that the resulting daily productivity report promotes data-driven decision-making for earthmoving resource allocation, thereby improving potential for saving cost and time for earthworks with an updated resource allocation plan.

Addressing the factors influencing labor productivity is crucial for improving the productivity performance of the sector. A theoretical structural model is developed to understand the influence of six key factors on construction labor productivity and their links to labor productivity performance on a project. A structural equation modeling technique is used to analyze data collected via a questionnaire survey of 185 respondents consisting of government authorities and construction actors. The final model adapts 29 attributes across six labor productivity factors, namely, management and control, workforce, financial, external, project, and material and equipment. The outcomes of the final structural equation model confirm the significance of management team competency level and workforce quality in enhancing labor productivity. Moreover, client support and efforts by government authorities are found to be significant for labor productivity improvements. Despite the limitations of the study, it is hoped that the research outcomes will significantly contribute to improve the labor productivity performance in the Malaysian construction industry for faster delivery of construction projects with lower cost and higher quality.

However, existing vision-based tracking methods are not able to achieve high tracking precision, robustness, and practical processing speed simultaneously. Occlusions and illumination variations on construction sites also prevent vision-based tracking methods from obtaining optimal tracking performance. To address these challenges, this research proposes a vision-based method, called construction machine tracker (CMT), to track multiple construction machines in videos. CMT consists of three main modules: detection, association, and assignment. The detection module detects construction machines using the deep learning algorithm YOLOv3 in each frame. Then the association module relates the detection results of two consecutive frames, and the assignment module produces the tracking results. In testing, CMT achieved 93.2% in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) and 86.5% in multiple object tracking precision (MOTP) with a processing speed of 20.8 frames per second when tested on four construction videos. The proposed CMT was integrated into a framework of analyzing excavator productivity in earthmoving cycles and achieved 96.9% accuracy.

J	Lee, D; Khan, N; Park, C				Lee, Doyeop; Khan, Numan; Park, Chansik			Rigorous analysis of safety rules for vision intelligence-based monitoring at construction jobsites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction safety; computer vision; machine vision; safety rules classification; work-stages based rule compliance	WORKERS; FALLS	Construction safety rules play a vital role in mitigating accidents and fatalities at construction sites. Many researchers are currently devoted to monitoring the rule compliance using computer vision-based approaches; however, such systems are still not mature for application at construction job sites. A single autonomous source's job-site safety control such as CCTV is a nontrivial task that requires a detailed analysis of safety rules for a work-stage based compact vision intelligence system. This paper proposes a grounded theory methodology (GTM) to systematically classify the safety rules for practical implementation using vision intelligence technology. The rules are classified into four groups employing open coding, axial coding, and selective coding approaches: (1) before work, (2) with intervals, (3) after work, and (4) during work. The proposed GTM-based model is further linked with scene-capturing sources, such as single-scene-capturing through smartphones for the required rules: (a) before work and (b) after work, (c) periodic scene-capturing using robots and drones for the required rules with intervals, and (d) CCTVs for the safety rules to continuously monitor safety. It is anticipated that this research will pave the new direction in computer vision intelligence-based construction safety management.

By maximizing the amount of waste that is recycled or reused, the environmental impact from the refurbishing works can be minimized. As a solution for environmental impact minimization through maximizing reduction/reuse and recycling of construction debris, the Selective Demolition Method (SMD) has recently been introduced in the construction industry as an alternative to conventional methods. However, there has been a lack of in-depth analysis in terms of productivity, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. This study demonstrates a comparative analysis by quantifying the merits/demerits of the SDM method in a refurbishing residential project. After pilot-testing the SDM method in a real-case project using evaluation tools, including work sampling, a foreman survey, and worker interviews, the results showed that SDM method could lead to positive outcomes compared to the existing demolition method. Although the case study is merely a showcase for quantifying the two methods, the findings may positively support the benefits of the SDM method in terms of cost and environmental issues.

Spatial and Temporal Exposure to Safety Hazards in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENT	Given the dynamic nature of construction sites, analysis of construction activities and their related hazards is inadequate for reliable risk assessment if it does not explicitly account for the likelihood of exposure of potential victims to hazardous situations. In traditional risk level calculations for manufacturing industries, the number of victims is factored with the likelihood of an accident and the potential severity, but the victims are simply assumed to be those typically present at the accident location. In construction, exposure cannot be accounted for at a generic metaproject level: it must be assessed at the level of the activities and the physical context in which they are performed. Conceptually, accidents are "loss-of-control events" to which victims are exposed; without exposure, no accident is assumed to occur. A set of algorithms has been developed to demonstrate estimation of the likelihood of exposure of construction workers to loss-of-control events. The algorithms have been implemented in a prototype software application designed to predict fluctuating risk levels in construction projects. The software implements the "construction hazard assessment with spatial and temporal exposure" model for managing safety in construction, which empowers planners at all levels to adjust construction plans to mitigate high levels of risk or to undertake appropriate proactive measures to ensure safety when high risk levels are unavoidable.

Unethical Practices in Nigerian Engineering Industries: Complications for Project Management	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The purpose of the paper is to establish the unethical practices in engineering industries and identify the various factors that could encourage unethical practices in the nation's life with a view to highlighting the findings for corruption-free management of projects. A sample of 226 was randomly selected for the study from a population of 12,230 workers from selected companies in the manufacturing and construction industries in Lagos state. The data were analyzed using simple percentages and the chi-square statistics. The results revealed that organizations have a code of conduct that should generate in the workforce values such as accountability and integrity and that there are disciplinary and control measures to check malpractices, yet individuals still engage in unethical practices. Of all the 34 unethical practices studied, "people want to acquire wealth by all means to enhance public status" ranked highest, followed by "people are driven by their inherent greed for money." The factor that contributed most to the unethical practices is economic pressures, followed by societal practices, vested interests of stakeholders in contracts, and last organization's practice. The result also showed that there are vested interests in design, award, execution, and commissioning of projects by stakeholders of the projects and that unethical practices have serious negative impact on project management.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology provides an opportunity to meet the current needs for uniquely identifying facility components, storing some maintenance history information on the component, and accessing this information on-demand within a facility. There have not been any research studies that tested the performance of active ultrahigh frequency RFID technology on facility components during operations and maintenance phase repetitively over an extended period of time. The objectives of this study were to identify how RFID technology can improve current FM processes and to determine technological feasibility of using RFID within a facility repetitively on a daily basis. The writers tagged fire valves in a facility with RFID tags and conducted a longevity test for sixty consecutive days by simulating tag identification, data access, and entry in real-life conditions. The results demonstrate that current commercially available active RFID technology performs well in a building environment where metallic objects and different obstructions are present. The observed reading distances were approximately half of the reading range expected in open air provided that there are not any massive obstructions between the reader and the tag.

In practice, however, the application of deep learning and computer vision has been limited due to an array of technical (e.g., accuracy and reliability) and managerial challenges. These challenges are a product of the dynamic and complex nature of construction and the difficulties associated with acquiring video surveillance data. In this paper, we design and develop a deep learning and computer vision-based framework for safety in construction by integrating an array of digital technologies with multiple aspects of data fusion. Then, we review existing studies that have focused on identifying unsafe behavior and work conditions and develop a computer-vision enabled framework that: (1) considers current progress on computer vision and deep learning for safety; (2) identifies the research challenges that can materialize with using deep learning to identify unsafe behavior and work conditions; and (3) can provide a signpost for future research in the emergent and fertile area of deep-learning within the context of safety.

Automated activity recognition can enhance the efficiency of the measurement system. The present study investigates accelerometer-based activity classification for automating the work-sampling process. A methodology is developed for evaluating classifiers for recognizing activities based on the features generated from accelerometer data segments. An experimental study is carried out in instructed and uninstructed modes for classifying masonry activities by using accelerometers attached to the waist of the mason. Three types of classifiers were evaluated, and multilayer perceptron, a neural network classifier, gave the best results. A 50% overlap for data segments enhanced classifier performance. The study showed that the utilization of best features instead of all features did not affect the classification accuracy significantly but reduced the run time considerably. An accuracy of 80% was obtained with accelerometers attached at both sides of the waist in an uninstructed environment. The results from preliminary studies have shown the potential of the proposed method for automating the activity recognition in construction sites. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000097.

However, this will lead to congestion as a major contributing factor that can affect labour productivity and significantly impact the construction process. Various studies have analyzed the effects of congestion on labour productivity; however, they fail to quantify the impacts of congestion on labour productivity. Therefore, this paper applies the Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) as an effective tool for predicting the effects of congestion on labour productivity in construction projects. A Java-based application is developed as an implementation of the proposed model. Based on a real case study, the paper discusses the potential benefits of the model, e.g., accurately predicting labour productivity, providing opportunity for workspace allocation, and simulating project reality in a virtual model. The simulation results demonstrate a 30% decrease in productivity due to congestion. The results confirm that the impacts of congestion on labour productivity at a construction site can be predicted as an emergent property from the interaction between workers, tasks, and their environment, i.e., a construction site, as well as the dynamics of varying productivity.

One leading indicator for equipment related incidents are blind spots that are prevalent around most construction equipment, inhibiting the operator's visibility of personnel and vital materials on jobsites. Incidents such as injuries and fatalities do occur because operators or ground personnel fail to identify that other objects can be in too close proximity to the work envelope they are operating in. This paper presents a new and unparalleled research approach to help identify the blind spots of equipment in order to quantify and protect the required safety zone(s) for such equipment. An automated blind spot detection tool is presented that determines the equipment blind spots rapidly and in 3D through analyzing the point cloud data from a laser scan inside the equipment cab. Terminology of planar and spatial blind spot measurements are defined and explained. Results to numerous vehicle types that were studied in the construction environment are presented and compared to existing manual and semi-automated methods for similarities. Future work and the applicability of automating the blind spot detection with alert technology in the construction industry are presented. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It seeks to display the methods of understanding used by site personnel to constitute the construction site as a local work site. In making these explicit, an alternative is offered to recent suggestions that critical studies of situated learning demand recourse to historical or macro resources. Findings confirm insights from previous studies, detailing in addition: the role of trial and error; alternative bodies of knowledge underpinning competing authority structures; and complex and subtle patterns of the informal authority of elite manual workers, its ambiguity and its limitations. The experiential knowledge valued by site personnel forms a basis for the recognition of authority on site that can conflict with that of construction professionals. The conflict between forms of authority and knowledge can inhibit the dissemination of good safety practice: initiatives will meet significant resistance if they contradict the experiential knowledge of site operatives; if they do not make use of this experiential knowledge, they may fail to address hazards fully; methods of site learning, particularly in the development of innovative practice, are inherently hazardous.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the efficiency of maintenance in hospitals with less than 200 beds. Eight Spanish hospitals with similar construction characteristics and identical maintenance strategies were analysed between 2012 and 2018. The number of maintenance incidents, operation times, costs generated, number of user complaints and other variables were studied and quantified. The results reveal that in hospitals with more than 25,000 annual stays, there are fewer maintenance costs and reports per surface and fewer reports per bed. It was found that hospitals larger than 10,000?m(2) generate lower maintenance costs and fewer reports per useful area and maintenance reports per bed. Moreover, equations to estimate the annual average maintenance costs in hospitals based on its annual number of patient stays and useful floor area were found. A hospital with 164 beds was analysed as a case study. A series of maintenance indicators that allow comparing the efficiency and sustainability of a hospital is proposed, for example, annual maintenance operations and average time spent on preventive and corrective operations.

Temporary bracing to restrict lateral buckling is a potential preventive approach, but has received little study. Lateral acceleration, lateral displacement, and rotation of wood composite I-joists were measured under different bracing conditions while participants traversed the joists. Five different bracing stiffnesses and two different bracing placements were examined. Lateral displacement and rotation increased near the midspan of the joist, while acceleration remained consistent. Greater lateral displacement and rotation were found with increasing participant weight and lack of construction experience. Construction experience was found to be a significant factor in the amount of joist motion. A safety platform similar to the testing methods discussed may have potential as a training tool to expose workers to partially braced joists. The relationship of lateral displacement and rotation with bracing stiffness was nonlinear. Bracing placement had little effect upon lateral displacement and rotation. Increased bracing stiffness reduced lateral displacement and rotation at a decreasing rate, indicating that bracing stiffness can be optimized to reduce cost.

Improving Megasite Management Performance through Incentives: Lessons Learned from the Shanghai Expo Construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Megasite management; Incentives; Shanghai Expo construction; People's Republic of China (PRC)	CONTRACTORS; PROGRAMS; SUCCESS	As the biggest expo site in history, construction of the Shanghai Expo site faced a lot of challenges, including involvement of lots of investors, megaconstruction scale, concurrent construction mode, involvement of more than 40,000 migrant workers, and extremely tight completion deadlines, among others. Consequently, these challenges imposed great obstacles on accomplishing the safety, quality, and environmental goals. Through a case study of the Shanghai Expo construction, this paper paper presents the design and implementation of multicriteria incentives in megaprojects to accomplish the safety, quality, and environmental goals. Both quantitative and qualitative findings were triangulated to demonstrate the outcome of the incentives. Six critical success factors (CSFs) for the incentives, rule design, process orientation, top management support, training and promotion, communication in process, and process learning and improvement are identified and validated through case study data and content analysis. It is believed that the findings of this paper can enhance understanding of multicriteria incentive schemes in general and provide insights in implementing these incentive schemes in future megaprojects, particularly in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

A framework for evaluating muscle activity during repetitive manual material handling in construction manufacturing	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Surface electromyograms; Repetitive lifting; Muscle fatigue; Human body modelling; Muscle force	ISOMETRIC CONTRACTIONS; ACHILLES-TENDON; BACK PAIN; FATIGUE; COORDINATION; WALKING; MODELS	Workers in construction sites are exposed to highly labor-intensive tasks. Ergonomic principles, in addition to engineering considerations, should thus be included in the design of workstations in order to minimize the risk of injury. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework to assess muscle force and muscle fatigue development due to manual lifting tasks using surface electromyography (sEMG) and human body modelling. Muscle forces are calculated using the human body model and compared qualitatively to sEMG muscle activities. The results show that sEMG is capable of visualizing muscle activity. However, sEMG application in identifying muscle fatigue development is limited to bulkier and superficial muscle bundles in low fat areas. The proposed human body model, which is driven by kinematic motion capture data, predicts muscle forces during the entire task maneuver. The predicted muscle forces from the human body model are compared with sEMG data from corresponding muscles as well as data available in the literature. In future research, the developed model will be used to determine optimal task maneuvers that minimize muscle forces with the ultimate goal of preventing muscle injuries in workstations.

Construction Project Managers' Motivators and Human Values	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction managers; Motivation; Human values; Productivity; Labor and personnel issues	PERSONAL VALUES; NEEDS; MODEL	Construction project managers occupy middle management positions and their performance is as important as the performance of skilled/unskilled workers to the success of a project. This study investigates the factors that motivate construction managers, identifies the dominant human values of construction managers, and explores the relationship between construction managers' human values and their motivators. A total of 101 construction managers participated in a survey to rate the importance of 20 motivators and 18 human values. Although simple correlation analysis indicated that many motivators are highly correlated with many human values, this finding ignores the interrelationships between the many variables. Factor analysis was used to reduce the 20 motivators to six motivating factors, and regression analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between each of the six motivating factors and human values, albeit without much success because of the nonlinear nature of the problem. However, by using an artificial neural network (ANN) model, it was possible to show that a relationship exists between human values and each of the six motivational factors with 75% accuracy. It is concluded that the performance of construction project managers can be enhanced by promoting motivators that agree with construction managers' human values.

Effects of Positioning Data Quality and Navigation Models on Map-Matching of Indoor Positioning Data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; LOCALIZATION	With rising complexity of indoor environments and growing demand for positioning and tracking of people (such as occupants and field workers) indoors, there has been an increasing need to have accurate and reliable indoor positioning. In this paper, the effects of (1) the quality of positioning data and (2) the types of navigation models on the accuracy of map-matching of indoor positioning data are evaluated. Sensitivity analyses on the quality of two different types of positioning data, namely, (1) absolute point-positioning data and (2) relative point-positioning data have been carried out. Two different types of navigation models, namely, (1) network models and (2) metric models, have been evaluated to examine their effect on the accuracy of the map-matching results. Eight different map-matching algorithms were selected and their accuracies were assessed in six different indoor data-collection routes containing spaces with varying density, sizes, and shapes. The results show different ways through which the quality of positioning data and the navigation model type affect the performance of map-matching algorithms in different indoor layouts. In addition, no single algorithm generates the most accurate results for all the cases. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This information, and the actual experiences of one eight-person mine-section crew who escaped from a fire, were used to construct an 18-frame (page) table-top simulation exercise, which was then field tested with 134 miners. The exercise is a research tool that measures miners' proficiency in the information-gathering and decision-making skills related to escaping from a mine fire. It also helps miners to learn and practice these cognitive skills. The exercise was found to be valid and reliable. All miners reported that the exercise was authentic and would help them to remember important information. The exercise total score, and all but two item scores, significantly discriminated among miners with different levels of training. The two items that did not discriminate dealt with whether or not to abandon a helpless fellow miner. When the exercise total score data were pooled, only 13.6% of the miners achieved a desirable score of 90% mastery or greater. The simulation is important because it teaches and assesses critical judgment and decision-making skills that are rarely addressed in miner training.

This is especially important as construction is known as a demanding industry in which its workers experience high levels of stress and poor well-being. The resilience and well-being of construction management students in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States were explored. Three hundred and sixty-six undergraduates completed a survey. Resilience and well-being were measured using the Resilience at University scale, Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and the emotional exhaustion component of the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale - Student Survey. Students from the United States had the highest level of resilience followed by Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong. Of the four countries, students from Hong Kong had the lowest level of well-being. Findings identified that resilience is a predictor of student well-being, highlighting the importance of building students' resilience through the construction management curricula. The results suggest that the development and nurturing of resilience at university should be considered in the context of country. As resilience is a transferable skill, efforts to facilitate resilience development will support students to transition, adapt and thrive in the demanding construction industry.

JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor and personnel issues; Health; Dietary habits; Caffeine	SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES; REASONED ACTION APPROACH; WORK ABILITY; SICK LEAVE; HEALTH; CAFFEINE; ALCOHOL; OBESITY; SLEEP; BEHAVIOR	Construction workforces' health behaviors have received little attention compared with work injury risks and management. Formulated caffeinated beverage (FCB) (energy drink) consumption is relatively new to construction sites and excessive consumption may have effects on both health and safety owing to known short-and long-term physiological responses. This study contributes to understanding drivers and deterrents of caffeine and FCB consumption in construction. Data were collected from workers at six construction sites in Queensland, Australia, using mixed-method research design involving semistructured interviews (70) and quantitative surveys (n = 250). Convergent interviewing underpinned by the theory of reasoned action was used to analyze qualitative interviews. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine determinants of caffeine and FCB consumption. Work hours were associated with caffeine consumption >210 mg/day (beta = -0.046, p = 0.037). Qualitative results indicate energy drinks are consumed widely and regularly on site, with stress and attempts to manage the pace, timing, and intensity seen as drivers for consumption. In combination, these findings suggest management of FCBs on construction sites requires more attention as a potential health hazard. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

It is imperative to determine the policy implications of the construction labor force's skill formation that concerns both the economic and social development of Asian metropolitan regions. Nevertheless, little comparative research has investigated construction VET models of the fast-changing regions. This paper used a multiple exploratory case study design to study the construction VET of two Asian metropolises, Singapore and Hong Kong, which share similar historical paths of skill formation and face comparable challenges of skills shortages and aging workforces in the construction sector. The research design combined an in-depth literature review, document analysis, field trip observations, and semistructured group interviews. The results revealed how developmental, collective, and liberal skill-formation features were combined to form the hybrid construction VET systems in the two metropolises to serve the governments' agenda of enhancing productivity and developing high-skills societies; and unveil the political-economic, cultural, and historical reasons underpinning the challenges faced by the systems in developing occupational competence of construction workforce.

Approximately 75% of struck-by fatalities are caused by inappropriate spatial-temporal relationships between construction workers and heavy equipment. Construction safety can be improved if the location and movement of heavy equipment are tracked in real time. However, detecting and tracking heavy equipment with kinematic joints and changing poses, such as excavators, is still a challenge for vision-based sensing methods. This study proposes to detect and track excavators using stereo cameras based on hybrid kinematic shape and key node features. Specifically, templates of excavator components are synthesized for detection following kinematic constraints of each component. Thereafter, a fast directional chamfer matching algorithm is used to detect the excavator components, and the detected components are articulated at the key nodes. Finally, the three-dimensional positions of the key nodes are tracked through triangulation to depict the excavator movements. Results from field experiments demonstrated that concatenating the detected components following a matching order enhances the detection performance. It is also found that the stereo triangulation enables efficient tracking of excavator movements by targeting at the key nodes. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Case Study to Identify Barriers and Incentives to Implementing an Engineering Control for Concrete Grinding Dust	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health and safety; Management responsibilities; Engineering controls	LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS USE; CRYSTALLINE SILICA DUST; HEARING PROTECTION; EXPOSURE; INTERVENTION; SAFETY; HEALTH; INDUSTRY; QUARTZ	Research has indicated that respirable crystalline silica dust exposure is a serious health hazard in the construction industry. One source of this hazard is the dust generated by drilling, sawing, chipping, and grinding concrete. There are several options for controlling this hazard, one of which is the use of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) directly attached to the cutting tool. Implementing an engineering control presents a challenge on the construction work site where it is often difficult to determine who will take the initiative for introducing an innovative strategy. This study examines the implementation of an LEV system on an overhead grinder illustrating the roles that various members of the construction team played. The results of the case study found that key factors that affected implementation were: (1) a cooperative relationship between individuals employed by the general contractor and the concrete subcontractor; (2) the effect of high airborne dust levels on scheduling the work of other subcontractors; (3) the public relations effects of high dust levels in a downtown area; and (4) the concrete subcontractor perceived benefits that exceeded the short-term cost of the intervention.

While a considerable body of research has accumulated to explain why accident and incident rates remain high in China, research into safety climate in Chinese major construction projects remains scant. To address this gap in knowledge, a survey of 189 construction professionals across five major construction projects in China was undertaken using a validated safety climate framework. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with nine senior construction safety professionals to verify the survey analysis results. The findings indicate that safety climate in major construction projects in China is perceived to be strong, and management commitment appears to be the underlying factor to promote this positive result. Safety rules and procedures is a dimension that requires attention because of their complexity and competing interests during their implementation. All the dimensions of the safety climate are strongly interrelated, indicating that multidimensional and holistic strategies should be employed to improve safety climate in major construction projects. This research enriches the understanding about the characteristics of safety climate in Chinese major construction projects and the effective measures which can be taken to further enhance the safety performance on these projects.

Human resources constitute the backbone of the managerial processes. One of the most important factors causing difficulties in the construction industry is the frequently changing labor force due to employee turnover. Here, the work-related perceptions of employees play an important role because of their effects on employees' commitment to the workplace. The psychology of the employees depends on numerous variables. This study aims to uncover the concepts forming and affecting the work-related attitudes and perceptions of the construction industry workers and investigate the relationships among them. A multivariate model through which the effects of the personality traits, job satisfaction, professional commitment and organizational commitment of the employees were investigated and tested using the Structural Equation Modeling method and recommendations were offered in light of our results. When the relationship between the variables were investigated, the relationship between personality and organizational commitment was determined with the help of the mediating effect of job satisfaction.

Various commercially-existing automated identification (ID) and information technologies (IT) were used to design a mobile Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) portal for checking the PPE compliance of personnel. When such gates are positioned at the entrance or within construction sites and once low-cost passive RFID tags are embedded or attached to PPE, automatic site access, time recording, and completeness control can be performed. These improve the logistics of the existing compliance checking process and provide users with timely feedback. Results to "personnel entering a construction site" demonstrate how the safety process, especially the awareness among personnel wearing PPE, can be pro-actively managed and controlled. Data further suggests the limitations of the developed approach and its potential for gathering leading safety indicator data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Temporary structures provide support for permanent structures during construction and serve as work platforms for construction workers, but most standards for temporary structures are voluntary. Design and construction considerations, therefore, are thus left to individual engineering judgement. The new approach utilizes a series of chronological digital images to detect incipient structural instability during the construction process. Any structural deformation becomes a measurable variable through image analysis and can serve as a measurable harbinger of structural failure. The proposed technology matches images in the series with their predecessors to highlight and locate differences in the structure. The small-scale experiment conducted and validated that the proposed methodology shows great potential for detecting micro changes that are too small to be detected by eye. The chronological images are expected to provide a coherent and persistent structural deficiency data-set that can be applied to diagnose physical forms of failure at an early stage of deformation, defining a clear starting point for rehabilitation and enabling structural engineers to draft and implement a comprehensive plan to address incipient problems in temporary structures.

This need is more critical when guidance is needed to locate people or objects that need immediate attention. For example, an inexperienced facility worker might need to locate a building component (e.g., leaking pipe) for repair to prevent any damage to a facility or its residents. In such situations, an approach that can help the user to reach his/her destination point (i.e., a component of interest or a specific location in a facility) based on his/her current location is desired. To provide such guidance, the location of a person needs to be determined at a given point in time. This process is known as localization. The objective of this research study is to determine the technological viability of using radio frequency identification (RFID) to support localization. To assess the capability of RFID for localization, the writers conducted multiple field tests under real operating conditions within a facility at Carnegie Mellon University. Hypothesis tests and K-nearest neighborhood algorithm were used to determine the technological feasibility of RFID to support localization. The results showed that it is possible to identify the location of a user using this approach; however, some improvements in accuracy are needed.

Swami			Manual bar bending - An occupational hazard for construction workers in developing nations	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; LUMBAR SPINE; IN-VIVO; FORCE; MUSCULATURE; JOINT; TRUNK; MODEL	Bar bending is the process of bending reinforcement bars to required angles in civil and construction engineering. Manual bar bending involves strenuous physical activity, which is usually performed in a poor ergonomic environment at a construction worksite. This could lead to chronic musculoskeletal disorders such as low back pain among bar benders. The aim of this study is to assess the ergonomics of manual bar bending and thereby develop a customized optimal workplace for bar bending. Biomechanical analysis was done using a three-dimensional Schultz-Andersson model to determine the influence of the diameter of the bar on the compressive force (F-c) at L-5/S-1. The effect of table height, grip arm distance, and back bend angle on F-c were also evaluated. F-c decreased up to 53%, with an increase of table height by 400 mm, and up to 41%, with an increase of grip arm distance by 500 mm; however it increased with back bend angle. F-c was higher than the NIOSH safety limit of (3.4 kN) in all cases except when bending 8 mm bars. A quick field reference for optimal table height and grip arm distance was prepared based on subjects' anthropometry and diameter, using Nash bargaining principles.

Numerous empirical studies have been conducted on various themes on WLB in the construction industry. Nevertheless, a systematic review of the extant studies, which is critical for future venture is scanty. This paper systematically reviews 40 extant literature on WLB in the construction industry from 1999 to 2019 (years inclusive). Main research method, causes of poor WLB, WLB interventions and WLB initiatives of both developed and developing countries are identified in the literature. The findings of the study contribute to the comprehensive understanding of causes of poor WLB, WLB interventions and initiatives in the construction industry and sparked future research study based on the identified significant knowledge gaps. To the practitioners, the identified causes of poor WLB would assist in determining construction project management practices leading to work-life imbalance, and strategic interventions to mitigate the causes. Drivers of WLB initiatives retrieved from previous studies would help practitioners to manage organizational, team and individual factors shaping the adoption of the initiatives.

Exploratory Study with Construction Crews	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Crew management; Productivity; Personality; Compatibility; Correlation analysis	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; JOB-PERFORMANCE; TEAM PERFORMANCE; 5-FACTOR MODEL; WORK TEAMS; FIT; ORGANIZATION; METAANALYSIS; TRAITS	Crew productivity is a function of how efficiently labor is utilized in the construction process. However, previous research in construction has not comprehensively investigated the relationship between personality and crew productivity. This paper uses personality profiles to investigate a new fundamental concept, the relationship between compatibility of personality and crew productivity at the task level. Twenty-eight masons completed a revised questionnaire of the Big Five to indicate their personality. Personality scores were used to calculate compatibility in each of the 20 participating two-mason crews working on eight projects. Regression analysis was performed to establish the relationship between compatibility and crew productivity. Results show that that there is a high positive correlation between compatibility and crew productivity. Compatibility accounts for more than half of the predictable variance in productivity. This paper makes four major contributions: it proposes a new metric to measure compatibility of personality among workers in a crew; it reveals how personality factors affect productivity; it provides rigorous methods to analyze correlations (using confidence intervals and Bayesian inference) for construction experiments; and it provides theoretical contributions to advancing the theory of personality and productivity in construction projects.

This research aims to identify and quantify the energy used in the construction of healthcare centres and propose indicators based on different operational variables. For this purpose, seven healthcare centres built between 2007 and 2010 were analysed, and the energy embodied in the manufacturing, transport and placement of materials on-site, including the final tests and commissioning of the building, were calculated. The results show that the average embodied energy is 9.97 GJ per unit of built area, 0.011 for each euro invested in construction and 2.18 GJ for each user. Emissions per worker, construction working hour, electrical power and energy consumed were also typified, and different reference indicators were proposed. Equations have also been devised using multivariate regression to determine the embodied energy of a healthcare centre according to its built area (m(2)), investment in construction (sic) and the number of users (No). The building elements with the most embodied energy were also identified, and the authors found that the average embodied energy is 29.31 times higher than that consumed in a year at the healthcare centre.

Using Contractor Bid Amounts to Estimate the Impact of Night Construction on Cost for Transportation Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Highway; Night; Nighttime; Construction; Productivity; Illumination; Lighting	PRODUCTIVITY; SAFETY	Many studies have documented the merits and problems of nighttime work for highway construction. Most of these studies have examined the safety of the construction site for workers or the traveling public. Illumination standards, sign requirements, and crash rate data have been studied to determine whether crash rates increase during nighttime hours, and the reasons for these crashes. Few studies have addressed either the effects on cost or productivity that nighttime construction has on a project. This study used hard bid unit prices to focus on the effect that performing certain construction activities at night has on cost and productivity. Specifically, the study assumes that a contractor's bid amount reflects expected relative project productivity and answers the question, What impact, if any, does night work have on construction productivity and therefore bid price? This is the first paper to answer both questions as related. Among the results was the fact that for the most part, the owner would have saved millions of dollars by allowing the contractor the option of working at night or during the day, though some items were bid lowest if the contract allowed for night work only.

J	Bachman, LR				Bachman, Leonard R.			New Professionalism: the post-industrial context	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						built environment; education; professionalism; public institutions; public interest; universities		Definitions and perceptions of professionalism are continually challenged and transformed by public need, government interaction and institutional organizations. When the goals of those three entities are focused on near-term results, this poses a significant threat to the integrity, value and relevance of professional services. When the individual and corporate professional's profit margin, corporate shareholder responsibility and news media sensationalism are factored in, this short-termism dynamic is greatly magnified. Built environment professions are seen as particularly vulnerable to this threat, given that investments in buildings and infrastructure have long-life and high-performance service expectations. This commentary responds to the Building Research & Information special issue entitled New Professionalism' (2013, volume 40, number 1) and situates the predicament of built environment professionals within an emerging historical transition: that of the post-industrial information society with its characteristic knowledge workers and cybernetic bases of production. Long-term virtues of the built environment mission such as sustainability, public good and evidence-based design are shown to be reflections of the transition from industrial era short-termism to post-industrial systemic foresight. This commentary supplements the special issue papers with a discussion on the broader academy's potential role in breaking the stranglehold of contemporary short-termism in the built environment professions.

However, wearing hardhats is not strictly enforced among workers due to all kinds of reasons. To enhance construction sites safety, the majority of existing works monitor the presence and proper use of hardhats through multi-stage data processing, which come with limitations on adaption and generalizability. In this paper, a one-stage system based on convolutional neural network is proposed to automatically monitor whether construction personnel are wearing hardhats and identify the corresponding colors. To facilitate the study, this work constructs a new and publicly available hardhat wearing detection benchmark dataset, which consists of 3174 images covering various on-site conditions. Then, features from different layers with different scales are fused discriminately by the proposed reverse progressive attention to generate a new feature pyramid, which will be fed into the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) to predict the final detection results. The proposed system is trained by an end-to-end scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is effective under all kinds of on-site conditions, which can achieve 83.89% mAP (mean average precision) with the input size 512 x 512.

The existing method of cleaning the exterior walls of existing high-rise buildings depended on the methods by workers who used ropes, gondolas, and winch systems. Recently, however, BMU (building maintenance unit) has been developed and applied to resolve safety problems and boost work efficiency. In Germany, USA, France and other countries, various types of robot systems for building facade maintenance are being applied. In South Korea, facade cleaning robots attached with curtain walls are also being developed. In this paper, we propose an integrated control system for the stable control of robots with the building facade cleaning technology. The proposed control system can be divided into three stages such as preparation stage, cleaning stage, and return stage. Each independent robot system performs tasks such as cleaning, moving, and obstacle detection according to each stage. A wireless communication system for stable communication between robots was proposed and applied for controlling the robot system. The proposed integrated control system was applied to building facade cleaning robots and its efficiency was verified compared with existing high-rise building cleaning methods.

Although on-site logistics are critical to efficient project delivery, they receive less attention in terms of research. This research introduces a new method for planning on-site logistics operations utilizing vertical supply systems (VSS) in high-rise projects. This method challenges the limitations of using critical path method and Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem in scheduling high-rise projects. The presented method treats lifting operations as activities with durations. The method presents a new classification of lifting activities based on their relation to other works, and it prioritizes the assignment of VSS to lifting activities based on the flexibility of VSS choice for each task. These two novel contributions allow planning construction works to match the capacity of available VSS, and it allows an efficient distribution of lifting tasks among available VSS. This method was applied to two towers in an ongoing project. The application to the first tower was during construction which allowed measuring tangible improvements on site and the other applied during the planning stage. The application of this method resulted in shorter floor cycles by 20% to 30%, less idle workers and more efficient cost control.

To identify the critical causes of tower-crane accidents, this study adopted a method that combined system thinking and case analysis. The entirety of tower-crane accident causes was considered as a system, and was divided into six subsystems and 34 causal factors. Information was collected on 141 investigation reports of tower-crane accidents in China from 2013 to 2018. The occurrence frequencies of accident causal factors and situation severities of subsystems were statistically analyzed. A combination of order relationship analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory methods was used to quantitatively evaluate the correlations among different causal factors, and the results of a comprehensive centrality and causality of 34 causal factors were obtained. Critical causes of tower-crane accidents were identified, including workers' wrong actions, inadequate safety training, inadequate safety inspection, low safety awareness, and safety engineer's mismanagement. To verify the practicability of the system model and identified critical causes, a case study of a typical serious tower-crane accident was conducted. Finally, corresponding recommendations are proposed for tower-crane safety management improvement and accident prevention.

However, research has generally not taken into consideration the differential effects of job title or types of project organizations on job demands, perhaps assuming that all levels within a project team and all project types offer similar levels of job demands. This study addresses the question of how the perception of job demands varies by job title (project manager, engineer, and project team member) and across project type (construction, research and development, and information technology). Using a sample of 208 project personnel, we examined the dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced personal efficacy) for the evidence of their differential impact across both job title and project type. Our findings suggest that there is no significant difference in perceived job demands across both job title and project type. However, we found that project managers have a significantly higher level of the emotional exhaustion form of burnout than other job classifications and construction project personnel suffer from a significantly higher level of emotional exhaustion than those working on other classes of project.

However, determining the proper number of new laborers to add is quite challenging because newly added laborers' short-term productivity for their first several production cycles could be significantly different from that of existing laborers. While existing studies suggest that newly added laborers' site-learning may cause such a difference, this process has not been considered when forecasting newly added laborers' short-term productivity. In this context, this study presents a method that takes into account site-learning effects and the periodic characteristics of newly added laborers' short-term productivity. The periodic characteristics of productivity are analyzed based on a time-series model of existing laborers' productivity. Then, the impact of the site-learning effect on the productivity is considered based on existing learning-effect theory. An illustrative example demonstrates the accuracy and usefulness of the presented method. Its results indicate that the consideration of the site-learning effect prevents the frequent and counterproductive underestimation of the required number of newly added laborers in establishing an accelerated recovery schedule.

A comprehensive safety climate questionnaire survey was conducted with all sites and employees of a leading construction company and its subcontractors in Hong Kong. In total, 4,719 records were returned from 54 sites. By means of factor analysis, a 15-factor Structure that defines the dimensions of the safety climate has been extracted. Compared with previous research studies, the roles and influences of fellow workers, and safety resources on the safety climate are emphasized. The results also confirm the feasibility of exploring common factors of the safety climate in the construction industry. Through further analysis, logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the safety climate and personal characteristics. Statistically significant relationships were found between safety climate and personal characteristics. including gender, marital status, education level, number of family members to support, safety knowledge, drinking, habits. direct employer, and individual safety behavior. This research is a case study and the results are derived from the data of one company. but the methodology of this research may be useful as a model for further research, and the findings may provide useful information for construction managers and safety practitioners in the construction industry to improve their safety culture.

Research and practice have demonstrated that management tasks may be duplicated when standards are implemented in parallel. Consequently, integrated management systems are strongly advocated. However, existing literature demonstrates that the integration of planning and control instruments involves a high level of uncertainty. This paper presents an innovative model to enhance the integration of environmental-and health and safety-management systems in construction companies, focusing on the subsystems for identifying, assessing, and operationally controlling environmental aspects and health and safety hazards and using risk as an integrating factor. The findings of this study have direct implications for both designers and contractors because the model helps to explicitly consider on-site environmental impacts and construction-worker safety during the design process and offers on-site guidance to eliminate the remaining impacts and risks or reduce them to acceptable levels. A case study is reported to illustrate the practical use of the proposed model and its benefits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000579. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However, recent advances in computer technology, where the hardware is getting smaller in size yet more powerful, allow computer systems to be used in the field to help inspectors collect inspection information. To provide useful and practical computing support for inspectors in performing inspection activities in the field, a computer system for supporting these inspectors has to be designed and customized to recognize the specific inspection tasks being performed and the physical and knowledge-based contexts of the inspection. Unfortunately, the development of field inspection support systems is both difficult and time consuming, since this process suffers from a lack of generality. Effort is currently wasted when implementing different applications for supporting different field workers that still share some common aspects. This paper first discusses the use of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to model inspection information useful in the development of inspection support systems and then discusses how the model can be used by the Java Inspection Framework (JIF) to automatically create an inspection application. XML in concert with JIF reduces the effort required to create an inspection application because the application can be developed without requiring the application developer to create a single line of Java code.

J	Jung, M; Park, M; Lee, HS; Chi, S				Jung, Minhyuk; Park, Moonseo; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Chi, Seokho			Agent-Based Lift System Simulation Model for High-Rise Building Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Lift system performance in construction sites can vary significantly depending on lift traffic within the system, rendering it imperative to control this factor by limiting the range of the lift car's service floors. There are various methods of defining and combining service-floor range, and system performance can be increased or decreased depending on the extent of suitability between the planned lift system and distribution of given traffic. In designing a construction lift system, it becomes essential to carry out a quantitative performance analysis and comparison of system alternatives. However, traditional simulation methods of modeling global system processes inhibit the evaluation of multiple system alternatives with their own distinct global processes. Therefore, this study aims to address such deficiencies by developing an agent-based simulation method, beginning with a literature review on lift systems intended to examine the external and internal factors affecting system performance. An agent-based simulation method is then used by modeling the behavioral rules of system components (e.g., lift cars and workers). Simulation experiments are conducted alongside assessments of the performance of seven lift system alternatives with unique system processes. The resulting research reveals the complex relationship among configuration of service floors, lift car range, and system performance, thereby suggesting how agent-based modeling techniques can contribute to the analysis of operational-level systems with diverse global system processes.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries in these specialty construction sectors over time as well as their effects on the level of safety performance in the industry. Accordingly, the most prevalent causes of fatal and nonfatal incidents in the mechanical and electrical sectors are investigated and presented as a longitudinal study from 2005 to 2015. The trends in occupational injuries in these sectors over this period of time are also compared with the trends reported in previous studies. The results from this study show that the direct causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries in the electrical and mechanical sectors differ from those found in the construction industry in general. In addition, the electrical and mechanical construction industry trends identified in this study are similar to previously reported trends. The similarities between the current findings and those of previous studies highlight real shortcomings in the safety management approaches within the construction industry. Based on the findings of this study, a learning investigation system has been recommended to improve safety performance among electrical and mechanical specialty contractors.

To comprehend the current state of art of suicide in the construction industry, systematic review becomes the viable option. Despite this, there is scanty study on systematic review of suicide in the construction industry. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review 28 extant studies on suicide in the construction industry from 1992 to 2021 (years inclusive) to reveal the current state of art in the subject area. The study deduced that previous studies focused on risk factors for suicide, economic cost of suicide and suicide interventions in the construction industry. Theoretically, the findings contribute to the body of literature by revealing the limitation in the identified risk factors for suicide, economic cost of suicide and suicide intervention to unpack future studies on suicide risk factors, optimum investment in suicide and theoretical model on relationships between suicide risk, suicide interventions and suicide in the construction industry. To the practitioners, the identified risk factors can be used to develop psychosocial risk management for suicide, economic cost to determine the optimum financial investment for suicide prevention and suicide interventions to reduce suicide rate among construction workers.

Predicting Construction Labor Productivity Based on Implementation Levels of Human Resource Management Practices	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction labor productivity; Building project; Human resource management practices	PERCEPTIONS; WORKERS; ENVIRONMENT; DRIVERS; MODELS	The prediction of the odds of achieving higher or lower productivity as compared to some baseline productivity is one of the important steps to consider while analyzing labor productivity in construction projects. The objective of this research is to build a logistic regression model that can be used to estimate the productivity of building projects based on the levels of planning or implementation of human resource management practices. Quantitative data were collected from 39 contractors who worked on multistory building projects completed between 2011 and 2016. Correlation analysis was carried out and the associations between productivity, human resource management (HRM) practices, company profiles, and project characteristics were investigated. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop the probability-based labor productivity prediction model. Project delay is found to be negatively correlated with HRM practices, whereas company size is positively associated with HRM practices. A scoring tool to measure the levels of HRM practice implementation on building projects was developed. On that basis, a logistic regression model of HRM practices and productivity was built. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a tool that can be used to assess the odds of having high productivity based on the implementation levels of HRM practices on a certain building project.

MEASURING VALUE-ADDED-ORIENTED BIM CLIMATE IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: DIMENSIONS AND INDICATORS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						construction projects; value-added; BIM climate; dimensions; indicators	ORGANIZATIONAL-CLIMATE; JOB-SATISFACTION; SAFETY CLIMATE; TEAM CLIMATE; PSYCHOLOGICAL CLIMATE; JUSTICE CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; WORK; PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE	A value-added-oriented (VAO) BIM climate is the organizational climate of BIM value-added. However, a lack of research on VAO BIM climate has thwarted progress on BIM knowledge systems. By using the socio-technical systems approach and the competing value approach, 12 dimensions and 39 indicators of a VAO BIM climate are proposed and tested using 306 questionnaires collected from workers engaged in BIM construction projects across China. Data was analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that the proposed dimensions and indicators are highly reliable and valid. The VAO BIM climate is heavily influenced by autonomy, career development, and task orientation. The top 10 indicators were mainly related to participation, task orientation, and goal effectiveness. And the MWD-BIM, RCS-BIM, CDMT-BIM, and SMD-BIM were mistaken as key indicators of participation, autonomy, peer relations, and organizational adaptability, respectively. The proposed dimensions and indicators can be used to advance scholarly understanding and theory on BIM climate in construction projects through directing resource allocation, enhancing the understanding of human-BIM interactions, improving the BIM knowledge system and facilitating decision framework of BIM adoption. Practical implications for managers in construction projects are provided in the end.

Reducing unregulated energy use in the commercial office requires an understanding of the factors that influence workplace behaviour. To date these factors have been assumed to be similar to those that influence behaviour in the home. However, the social dynamics of the workplace are different to those in the home. This study examines the degree to which theories of behaviour change generated largely in a domestic building setting could be used as the basis for designing interventions to reduce unregulated energy consumption in the workplace. It studies the unregulated energy consumption of 39 workers engaged in office-type activities in two separate locations. Following a 100-day monitoring period, three behaviour change interventions were developed and their impact measured over a 100-day period. Results from the study found, on average, an 18.8% reduction in energy use was achieved. Furthermore, by comparing pre- and post-intervention responses to an environmental questionnaire, it was evident that savings were realized without significant changes to pro-environmental attitude or perceived social norms, which may have implications for energy-saving interventions in the commercial sector.

Due to the recent and ongoing growth in robot capabilities and functionalities, humans and robots are now able to work side-by-side and to share workspaces. The emerging field of human-robot collaboration has significant potential applications in construction and continues to advance the state of the art in defining the responsibilities of both humans and robots during collaborative work. This paper proposes a new taxonomy for collaborative human-robot work in construction teams. The evolution of construction robots during the last two decades is first reviewed, and relevant bodies of work are categorized into one of five levels of human-robot collaboration: Preprogramming, Adaptive Manipulation, Imitation Learning, Improvisatory Control, and Full Autonomy. The categories of the proposed taxonomy are defined based on the level of robot autonomy and the corresponding human effort in collaborative teamwork. Second, this paper uses the categories of the proposed taxonomy as a contextual framework to identify current challenges and knowledge gaps in collaborative human-robot construction work and recommends directions for future research.

Our study has new implications for the effects of supervisor ratio, which has not been specifically investigated in past engineering management research. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used on 85 organizational-level datasets from 17 large U.S. federal agencies. The findings suggest that engineer turnover is negatively related to supervisor ratio and positively related to engineer supervisor percentage. Mediation and moderation effects were observed. The study found partial mediating effects of engineer supervisor percentage in weakening the negative association between supervisor ratio and engineer turnover. Engineer turnover was also found to moderate the negative association between supervisor ratio and non-engineer turnover rate. This study further provides a theory-building framework for the role of organizational supervisor ratio in mitigating turnover risk for both engineers and all other knowledge workers in interdisciplinary work environments. Applying value congruence theory, engineering managers can use these findings to understand the role of supervisor ratio in organizational design and its impact on engineer turnover. We conclude with practical engineering management recommendations for engineer-manager training programs, engineer mentorship, organizational strategic communications, and the strategic deployment of engineers across the organization.

Pinpointing Safety Leadership Factors for Safe Construction Sites in Trinidad and Tobago	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Leadership; Risk; Construction; Accident; Intervention; Labor and personnel issues	EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES; CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; WORK	Construction industry safety performance is of grave concern to practitioners and lawmakers. Despite a determined effort to improve, the results are still disappointing. Improving the industry's track record requires an in-depth understanding of the factors that drive risks to individual safety and of how behavior and attitudes can be improved. Construction managers lack knowledge of the safety leadership characteristics, which specifically reduce risk-taking behavior of subordinates on construction sites. This information is presented in this research. A leadership-based safety model consisting of subordinates' self-reported accident and near miss records were investigated along with leadership considerations and initiating constructs, the construction manager's safety behavior and attitude profile, and the safety climate characteristics to determine whether any of these factors contributed significantly to a safer construction site. A stepwise regression model was developed to determine key drivers toward the risk-taking behavior of construction workers. Construction managers were also classified by their effective management of safety. Contrary to the postmodern perspective on safety leadership, construction managers who focused on safety standards on-site, ruled with an iron rod, and needled people working with them for greater efforts were more effective at reducing accidents on-site than those construction managers who did otherwise.

Labour productivity study is used in current practice to obtain the required cycle time of manual tasks. However, the reliability of labour productivity study in estimating durations of manual activities is inhibited by its dependence on various factors which change with the different working conditions of construction jobsites and the difficulties associated with measuring productivity. This study thus investigates the use of a predetermined motion time system (PMTS) for modelling manual construction operations for cycle time estimation and efficiency evaluation. A motion-level simulation approach is developed by integrating PMTS into discrete-event simulation (DES) modelling, providing an automated and simple-to-use method of analysing manual tasks. As a case study, manual construction operations from a construction jobsite with different levels of repetitiveness are modelled, and the actual and simulated cycle times are compared and analysed. The results confirm the effectiveness of a PMTS-based simulation approach to modelling manual construction operations and its reliability in estimating the duration of manual tasks.

Despite an increased use of ABW, studies focusing on its impact and the resultant office design are yet to follow suit. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by providing empirical evidence from studies conducted before and after relocation from contemporary open-plan offices to ABW spaces. Results from post-occupancy evaluation (POE) surveys (n = 896 responses), spot measurements of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and step-count monitoring (one case study; n = 20 participants) before and after relocation are reported. A total of 10 workspaces participated (six combi and four ABW) in this study. Design features were documented and analyzed. While there were limited differences in the measured IEQ conditions between office layouts investigated here, ABW workspaces yielded significantly higher satisfaction results on key IEQ dimensions, perceived productivity and health. Office layout was also found as a significant (or nearly significant) predictor of occupants' lightly active and sedentary time but did not affect occupants' daily step counts and distance they travelled. These results highlight the significance and impact of office layout and human-centred approach to design on occupants' satisfaction, perceived productivity and incidental physical activity opportunities.

By investigation of the previous research works, it is revealed that there is a lack of a simple and applicable framework to develop a hybrid SD-ABM simulation approach. This research proposes a hybrid SD-ABM simulation framework for modelling construction projects. The dynamics of project environment arising from the complex interrelated structure of various influencing continuous factors are taken into account using SD. The complexity of the system emerges from the interactions between different agents is also accounted by ABM. The SD and ABM simulation paradigms are finally combined. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid simulation framework, it is implemented in a real construction project. The safety behaviour of different working groups involved in the project is modelled using the proposed hybrid simulation framework. The influence of safety behaviour of different working groups on the project performance is finally assessed. The achieved simulation results show how the value of unsafe behaviour of different agents is varied throughout the project duration due to the interactions with other agents as well as the safety-related regulations that exist in the site.

J	Sun, Y; Fang, DP; Wang, SQ; Dai, MD; Lv, XQ				Sun, Yu; Fang, Dongping; Wang, Shouqing; Dai, Mengdong; Lv, Xiaoquan			Safety risk identification and assessment for Beijing Olympic venues construction	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; CHINA; INJURY	New technologies, new materials, and innovative designs have been extensively adopted in Beijing Olympic venues construction. The extreme requirements for time deadline and competition function expose the venues construction to high risks. These risks would potentially bring negative impacts on the site safety performance. Meanwhile, there is a lack of systematic management for safety risks in China's construction industry, especially for large projects such as the Beijing Olympic venues construction. This paper identifies and assesses safety risk factors inherent in Beijing Olympic venues construction with the involvement of 27 experienced and highly respected experts from government agencies, the construction industry, and academe through brainstorming, workshop discussions, and questionnaire surveys. The finding reveals that more than half of the critical safety risk factors are from contractors and subcontractors such as: lack of emergency response plan and measures; workers' unsafe operation, and contractors ignoring safety under schedule pressure. Based on these critical safety risks, a risk register is composed and a model is developed in application of the analytic hierarchy process to assess the status of risks on site safety. The model has been attempted in two Olympic venue projects under construction and the validity has been approved. The risk checklist, register, and assessment model developed in the paper were integrated into the risk management system that has been used for Beijing Olympic venues construction.

J	Novieto, DT				Novieto, Divine Tuinese			Safety climate and occupational safety behaviours: the mediating role of psychological ownership among construction professionals	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Safety climate; Occupational safety behaviour; Psychological ownership; Construction professionals; Ghana	ORGANIZATIONAL-CLIMATE; REGULATORY FOCUS; MODEL; LEADERSHIP; WORKERS; COMMITMENT; MOTIVATION; VALIDITY; CULTURE; HEALTH	Purpose Encouraging employee's safety behaviour remains a challenge in the construction industry from developing countries. Several studies have examined the nexus between safety climate and safety behaviour. This paper investigates the psychological ownership as a mediator in the relationship between safety climate and occupational safety behaviours among construction professionals in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional design was used for the study. Two hundred and eighty-two respondents (282) took part in the study by completing an online survey. The respondents were selected using a convenience sample technique. Data were processed using IBM SPSS version 21. The results were analysed using PLS-SEM. Findings Results of the study reveal that safety climate positively predicts construction professional's safety behaviour and psychological ownership. Furthermore, psychological ownership was found to (1) predict occupational safety behaviour and (2) mediate the nexus of safety climate and occupational safety behaviour. Practical implications Managers should continuously implement far-reaching policies that would promote healthy workplace safety climate and feeling of ownership among construction professionals. Originality/value This paper is one of the pioneers to have tested a model including safety climate, occupational safety behaviour and psychological ownership in a constructional profession.

Current construction hazard identification mostly relies on safety managers' capabilities to detect hazards. Consequently, numerous hazards remain unidentified, and unidentified hazards mean that hazards are not included in the safety management process. To enhance the capability of hazard identification, this paper proposes an automated hazardous area identification model based on the deviation between the optimal route (shortest path) which is determined by extracting nodes from objects in a building information model (BIM) and the actual route of a laborer collected from the real-time location system (RTLS). The hazardous area identification framework consists of six DBs and three modules. The unidentified hazardous area identification module identifies potentially hazardous areas (PHAs) in laborers' paths. The filtering hazardous area module reduces the range of possible hazardous areas to improve the efficiency of safety management The monitoring and output, generation module provides reports including hazardous area information. The suggested model can identify a hazard automatically and decrease the time laborers are exposed to a hazard. This can help improve both the effectiveness of the hazard identification process and enhance the safety for laborers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strategies for providing enriched thermal environments must be conjoined with reducing energy; these are inseparable for any building striving for high performance. The objective of current comfort standards is to have no more than 20% of occupants dissatisfied, yet buildings are not reaching even that scant goal. A significant energy cost is incurred by the current practice of controlling buildings within a narrow range of temperatures (often over-cooling in the summer). If building designers and operators can find efficient ways to allow building temperatures to float over a wider range, while affording occupants individual control of comfort, the potential for energy savings is enormous. Five new ways of thinking, or paradigm shifts, are presented for designing or operating buildings to provide enhanced thermal experiences. They are supported by examples of research conducted by the Center for the Built Environment, and include shifts from centralized to personal control, from still to breezy air movement, from thermal neutrality to delight, from active to passive design, and from system disengagement to improved feedback loops.

J	Kwon, OS; Park, CS; Lim, CR				Kwon, Oh-Seong; Park, Chan-Sik; Lim, Chung-Rok			A defect management system for reinforced concrete work utilizing BIM, image-matching and augmented reality	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction defect management; Image-matching; Augmented reality; Mobile application; BIM	INSPECTION; TRACKING	The repeated and inevitable occurrence of defects remains one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns in construction. Currently, quality management on site is done by site managers through their visual senses. However, it is often challenging for a handful of site managers to perform quality management efficiently for an entire site based on inspected progress of construction works. As a consequence, inspections are often omitted, resulting in faulty construction and quality degradation which may necessitate rework. This may adversely affect project costs and schedule. This paper addresses these issues by utilizing BIM, image-matching, and augmented reality (AR) to develop two types of defect management systems including: 1) an image-matching system to enable quality inspection without visiting the real work site; and 2) a mobile DM-AR app which enables workers and managers to automatically detect dimension errors and omissions on the jobsite. The two systems are tested and evaluated by lab and site experiments for reinforcement concrete (RC) work to assess the benefits and limitations. Experimental results demonstrate the defect management system's effectiveness in automatic omission and error detection at real job sites. The study emphasizes the potential applicability of BIM, image-matching, and AR technologies that could be utilized to improve construction defect management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Health and Safety Management within Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Developing Countries: Study of Contextual Influences	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction health and safety; Contextual influences; Ghana; SMEs	STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY	Considerable attention has been focused on addressing construction health and safety risks in developed economies. Sadly, the same cannot be said of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where accident figures are extremely high. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the contextual environment within which Ghanaian construction small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage occupational health and safety (OH&S). A questionnaire survey was administered to construction SMEs to better understand the health and safety management practices and associated problems followed up by field interviews to explore key issues identified by the survey. The results of the study highlight the institutional structure for implementing OH&S standards, prevailing economic climate, and extended family culture as challenges to the management of OH&S. The study identifies low literacy levels, low socioeconomic status of workers, owner/managers' ignorance of their OH&S responsibilities, commitment to extended family obligations, and ineffective OH&S administration as key factors limiting the capacity of construction SMEs to manage OH&S effectively. The study concludes that effective institutional structure and an enabling socioeconomic environment are needed to enhance the OH&S performance of SMEs and advocates for more proactive OH&S management that take into consideration the work cultures of SMEs.

Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 274 project-level employees of 10 construction organizations in Sri Lanka. A path analytical model is developed to assess the research hypotheses. Findings Results support the mediation model of job stress, in which satisfaction with supervision and job security directly contributed to a reduction in stress levels, which in turn lessened the turnover intention. Full mediation is observed from supervision, and partial mediation is observed from job security. Satisfaction with pay and co-workers directly predicted a decline in turnover intention. Contrary to the authors' expectations, the authors could not find any significant effect from promotion to job stress and promotion to turnover intention. The results further illustrated that demographic variables, i.e. gender, age and organization tenure play a role in determining employees' stress levels. Originality/value In identifying how job satisfaction facets, job stress and turnover intention are linked together, the present study added the mediating role of job stress to the previous empirical research on the relationship between job satisfaction facets and turnover intention.

Testing the relationship between objective indoor environment quality and subjective experiences of comfort	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Facilities management; technological innovation; technology management; indoor environmental quality	SICK BUILDING SYNDROME; CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; THERMAL COMFORT; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; OFFICE WORKERS; MODEL; PRODUCTIVITY; ASSOCIATIONS; VENTILATION	At present, workplace researchers lack a suitable methodology for combining objective indoor environmental quality (IEQ) data with repeated subjective assessments of comfort in real offices. To address this gap, we conducted a study at two office sites. Four IEQ parameters (carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and illuminance) were continuously monitored at each site, and brief environmental comfort surveys were sent to employees' smartphones four times per day across the study period. In total, 45 employees across the two sites completed 536 surveys. The findings confirm that the repeated sampling approach is a more appropriate method for measuring comfort than a questionnaire delivered at one time only. Adherence to recommended temperatures reduced the risk of thermal discomfort, however this effect was weak and other predicted associations between the physical environment and environmental comfort were not supported. The results also showed a strong association between environmental comfort and self-rated productivity, such that employees rated themselves as most productive when they were satisfied with noise levels, temperature, air quality, and lighting within the office. Overall, the results highlight that it is critically important to consider strategies for optimising occupant comfort, although this is unlikely to be achieved through adherence to environmental comfort boundaries alone.

J	Karakhan, AA; Gambatese, JA; Simmons, DR				Karakhan, Ali A.; Gambatese, John A.; Simmons, Denise R.			Development of Assessment Tool for Workforce Sustainability	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Workforce development; Social sustainability; Equity; Diversity and inclusion; Training and education; Competence; Employee retention; Maturity	CONSTRUCTION LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; AGING WORKFORCE; SAFETY	The work environment in construction is physically and mentally demanding. This demanding environment can place adverse risk on the construction workforce including emotional, physical, and financial challenges. To minimize such challenges, continued development and cultivation of the construction workforce is required. Continued development and cultivation can sustain the workforce and lead to both personal and business growth. The process of developing and cultivating the workforce enhances construction workforce sustainability, a measure of the social sustainability of the construction workforce. The aim of the present study is to develop a practical tool for assessing workforce sustainability in construction. A mixed-methods research approach that relied on a review of literature, semistructured interviews, and a multiround expert survey was utilized to achieve the aim of the study. The developed workforce sustainability tool includes three levels of components (attributes, indicators, and metrics) organized in a hierarchy to characterize a workforce. The use of the assessment tool yields a final aggregated score that reveals the level of sustainability of a workforce. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means to assess and ultimately improve workforce sustainability in construction. Widespread use of the tool is expected to help the construction industry develop and nurture its workers to produce a healthy, productive, and resilient workforce.

J	Genc, O				Genc, Olcay			Identifying principal risk factors in Turkish construction sector according to their probability of occurrences: a relative importance index (RII) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction sector; exploratory factor analysis (EFA); relative importance index (RII); risk factors; risk management	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; MODEL	A construction project has many phases, all of which involve various risks. The first step in risk management is risk identification. The literature lacks to address identifying key risk factors affecting construction projects concerning the variables' likelihood of occurrences. The goal of this paper is therefore to investigate key risk factors affecting Turkish construction sector based on their probability of occurrences by using Relative Importance Index (RII) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). 201 valid responses to a questionnaire detailing 33 risk variables are analyzed using RII and EFA. The results emphasize that disaster and force majeure, project management, technical management, external, and design-estimation are the main risk factors in the construction projects. It is also found that using unqualified subcontractors/workers/staff during the process, delays in payments, economic matters such as inflation, speculations on prices, late change-order requests of project stakeholders and, failure to complete the work within expected budget limits are the top five most-likely risks while flood, boycott, landslide, attack, hurricane, tornado risks are rare. Through the findings, practitioners that consider defined risk factors when evaluating the potential risk management approaches may increase the accuracy of their risk response method and related cost estimates.

Safety in construction is a complex issue and is influenced by many factors, such as the technology being used, worker behaviour, actual site conditions and, of course, the design being constructed. Given this background, safety hazards identification and accident precautions are important elements in any construction site safety management system. The development described in this paper has produced a visualization of the construction process that can be used to assess safety hazards. The aim of the research is to produce a design-for-safety-process (DFSP) tool. This will help to identify safety hazards inherited during the building construction phase that are actually produced during the design phase. The domain, in which this particular application is being developed, is a typical 40-storey Hong Kong Housing Authority residential block. In this paper, the components of DFSP tool are discussed. The components of DFSP tool comprise of virtually real construction components and processes, virtual reality functions, and DFSP database. The integration of these components enables a user to do a walk-through in the virtually real project and to identify safety hazards inherited within construction components and processes as well as to select accident precautions needed to prevent the occurrence of accidents.

Setting Baseline Rates for On-Site Work Categories in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Activity analysis; Adaptive neurofuzzy interface system (ANFIS); Baseline rate; Labor performance; Direct-work rate; Productivity; Continuous improvement; Construction automation; Artificial intelligence; Project planning and design	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS; US; ANFIS	Labor performance drives construction project performance. Labor performance can be improved by increasing the direct-work rate, which is the time spent by workers on installing materials and equipment. However, setting baseline rates for direct-work rate and determining expectation levels during the construction phase requires further investigation. The focus of the research reported in this paper is to establish a methodology for setting a desirable and realistic baseline rate based on activity analysis, primarily for industrial projects. First, an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based method was developed as a means of estimating baseline rates based on existing knowledge. The method was trained using 272 data points. Its flexibility and functionality validate its usefulness; however, three additional methods of defining baseline rates were also developed based on simpler concepts and demonstrated with data points available from 14 projects, and the experience associated with these projects. As a result, comprehensive methods and a valuable initial dataset for industrial construction projects to better establish baseline rates for direct work and supporting activities were contributed. This should help project managers to estimate appropriate baselines and set realistic goals for direct-work rate which ultimately may lead to improvement of labor performance.

J	Hemstrom, K; Gustavsson, L; Mahapatra, K				Hemstrom, Kerstin; Gustavsson, Leif; Mahapatra, Krushna			The sociotechnical regime and Swedish contractor perceptions of structural frames	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Construction sector; Sweden; sociotechnical regime; structural frame; multifamily buildings; cognitive rules; technological change	SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; WOOD; INNOVATION; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; ARCHITECTS; TIMBER; EVOLUTIONARY; BUILDINGS	To deepen the understanding of the sociotechnical regime that directs the selection of structural frames in multifamily buildings in Sweden, we study the perceptions of contractor representatives. Contract managers (CMs) employed at contractor firms were interviewed regarding their role, the selection of the structural frame and how they perceived different options. The results show that CMs largely influence the selection of the structural frame in multifamily buildings, which are guided by the established concrete-based sociotechnical regime. The regime is maintained through cognitive rules regarding structural frame options and the alignment of skills of construction professionals. Because of their influence and their investments in the skills of construction workers, CMs make important contributions to maintain the regime and the concrete path dependency. Furthermore, the regime varies in strength in different locations. Some locations carry a strong norm to cast concrete frames on site. This makes it more difficult to deviate from the established practice. In other locations, wood-promoting initiatives have changed the cognitive rules associated with the regime. Nonetheless, the sociotechnical regime makes the selection of concrete structural frames beneficial. This prevents wood-framed multifamily buildings from entering common usage, even though such buildings can contribute to mitigating climate change.

Also, these practices are seldom implemented consistently from project to project. To help address this problem, the authors identified essential management practices for productivity improvement and developed the Best Productivity Practices Implementation Index for Industrial Projects (BPPII Industrial) based on these practices. The BPPII Industrial is a method and metric for assessing the planning and implementation levels of key practices needed to ensure high levels of labor productivity. The practices included in the proposed method are those that are widely accepted in academia and industry to have a positive impact on labor productivity. This paper presents the development, verification, and validation of the BPPII Industrial. This paper's primary contributions are the identification of key productivity practices, quantification of the relative importance of these practices, development of a method to assess the level of implementation of these practices on project productivity performance, and validation of the proposed method based on its implementation on several industrial projects.

However, the detection of engineering structural components still cannot be done reliably and effectively by any technical means. Following a detailed analysis of existing object detection algorithms, an automatic method for building structural component detection based on the Deeply Supervised Object Detector (DSOD) is proposed. Compared with other algorithms, DSOD only needs limited data and can obtain the highest level of object detection by training from scratch. To verify the effectiveness of the method, based on the entity-scale reduction model of a building structure, a combined image data set of engineering structural components is established by multilayer, polymorphic, multidirectional, multiangle, structural data acquisition. Following the definitions of true positive, false positive, and false negative, the precision and recall rate of structural component detection at different shooting angles, different visual ranges, and different occlusion degrees were tested with a confidence threshold of 0.7. The experimental results show that the method has high detection precision, high recall rate, and high speed. It can effectively solve the problem of the detection of structural component of building engineering and provide practical guidance on how to scientifically collect engineering structural component images at construction sites.

J	GARDEN, AM				GARDEN, AM			POTENTIAL REASONS FOR SOFTWARE EMPLOYEES IN SMALL COMPANIES TO LEAVE THEIR PRESENT COMPANY	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A sample of 339 software professionals in 11 software companies of different size categories was analyzed in terms of potential reasons for leaving their present company. The most important reasons for the sample as a whole were salary, more experience, more interesting and challenging work, need for a change, and promotion. Work context and organizational conditions, such as greater flexibility, were less important. Those people in the companies with less than 50 people were significantly more likely to want to leave to run their own company, to go to a more successful company, to obtain an equity stake, or because their present company was getting too large. Those in larger companies were significantly more likely to want to leave to obtain promotion, because the present company was getting too large, or to obtain more challenging work. These results support previous findings on the task characteristics important for the "technical personality," in general. They suggest also that, in addition, appropriate research criteria for smaller companies should include characteristics associated with the effects of different organizational size. The implications for managers suggest that not only do the particular needs of knowledge-based workers have to be taken into account in such a sample, but also the particular demands of those with a "small-organization" mentality rather than a "large-organization" mentality.

J	Oswald, D; Sherratt, F; Smith, S				Oswald, David; Sherratt, Fred; Smith, Simon			Managing production pressures through dangerous informality: a case study	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Scheduling; Case study; Construction safety	UK CONSTRUCTION; ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS; SAFETY ATTITUDES; WORK; BEHAVIOR; SITE; DYNAMICS; INDUSTRY; CLIMATE; HEALTH	Purpose It is well-known that significant production pressures exist on many construction projects and previous studies have suggested that this pressure is a contributory factor in safety incidents on sites. While research has established that production pressures exist, less is understood about the construction practices that occur when projects are under such pressures and their repercussion for safety. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Through an ethnographic approach on a large construction project in the UK, these practices were explored and unpacked. The lead researcher was a member of the Health and Safety department, and undertook participant observation as a main research tool for three years. Findings It was found that informal, covert and dangerous "piecework" strategies were adopted at the site level in direct response to scheduling demands. Construction workers were incentivised through extra finance and rest periods to finish the work quickly, which, in turn, prioritised production over safety. Unreasonable production pressures remain an unresolved problem in the construction industry and are, perhaps consequentially, being informally managed on-site. Originality/value This study improves our understanding of the complexities involved in the unresolved demands between production and safety on construction sites, which marks a step towards addressing this substantial challenge that is deeply ingrained within the industry.

Ergonomic assessment, as a tool and method for analyzing human activities and their interactions with the surrounding environment, is thus crucial for designing operations and workplaces that achieve both high productivity and safety. In construction, however, the constantly changing work environments and laborious tasks cause traditional approaches to ergonomic analysis, such as manual observations and measurements, to require substantial time and effort to yield reliable results. Therefore, to simplify and automate the assessment processes, this study explores the adaptation and integration of various existing methods for data collection, analysis, and output representation potentially available for comprehensive ergonomic analysis. The proposed framework integrates sensing for data collection, action recognition and simulation modeling for productivity and ergonomic analysis, and point cloud model generation and human motion animation for output visualization. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study using data from an off-site construction job site. The results indicate that integrating the various techniques can facilitate the assessment of manual operations and thereby enhance the implementation of ergonomic practices during a construction project by reducing the time, effort, and complexity required to apply the techniques.

Developing a Risk Assessment Model for construction safety	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Risk assessment; Prioritization; Decision support system; Work trade; Construction	OCCUPATIONAL INJURY RISKS; PERFORMANCE; WORKERS	Problems on occupational health and safety are commonly occurred in the construction industry, including falling of materials or person from height, stepping on objects and injured by hand tools. Key of dealing with project safety and risk assessment in construction industry is important, thus, way on doing assessment and liability of assessment are necessary for all professionals. However, it is found that those professionals prone to heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making on risk assessment, which lack of a systematic approach and lack of ways to check the reliability of the decisions. This paper investigates the need for people involved in construction to take systematic and effective risk assessments for different trades. 14 common types of trades, accidents, and accident causes are explored, in addition to suitable risk assessment methods and criteria. A Risk Assessment Model (RAM) is then developed for assessing risk levels as various project stages with various work trades. A case study is used to prove the workability and reliability of the developed RAM in the practical industry. The developed RAM is found to be benefit for predicting high-risk construction activities and thus preventing accidents occurred based on a set of historical accident data.

J	Lan, A; Galy, B				Lan, Andre; Galy, Bertrand			Evaluation of a Horizontal Lifeline System Used during Installation of Residential Roofs	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Roofing; Fall protection; Horizontal lifeline system; On-site braced trusses; Fall tests; Construction materials and methods		Residential roofing is considered as one of the most risky occupations. Usually, workers use roof anchors for fall protection during roof installation. This method is time consuming and hinders their tasks. Instead of roof anchors, a building contractor has developed a horizontal lifeline system (HLLS) consisting of two 4.9-m long posts made up of three aluminum hollow structural sections of size 51x152x6.4mm welded together and a horizontal lifeline (HLL) wire rope of 9.5mm diameter. The posts are assembled to end trusses and hoisted in place by a crane and the HLL is installed at 1.524m above the ridge. The HLLS is heavy and has never been tested on on-site braced trusses as the host structure. This paper presents the results of a study to evaluate and optimize the HLLS and to verify the strength of on-site braced trusses as the host structure of the HLLS. Tests results show that the HLLS and the on-site braced trusses have passed all fall tests and can be used as fall protection during roof installation. The HLLS has to be installed with a crane during roof installation and it is not easy to be used on an existing roof. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A				Cox, RF; Issa, RRA; Frey, A			Proposed subcontractor-based employee motivational model	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MANAGEMENTS PERCEPTION; CONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; INDICATORS	The intent of this research was to identify the factors that promote positive motivational behavior in construction subcontractor crews. The factors affecting motivation, goal-setting, workforce needs, and incentives were investigated to determine the attributes for a subcontractor employee motivational model. A survey addressing these four categories was distributed to subcontractor foremen and supervisors to establish a list of motivational factors. The statistical analysis of the survey results aided in the final development of the proposed subcontractor based employee motivational model, which includes such components as confidence and competence as being reinforced by quality of work, incentives, safe performance, praise, and a sense of belonging. The proposed model provides industry practitioners with another level of understanding of the motivation sequence of the subcontractor's labor force. Perhaps the most interesting finding was related to the attributes found in relation to workforce needs. A common link "feeling of being a member of the team/crew" was discovered between "praise" and "job security." It was surmised that essentially a worker must first receive praise before they feel as if they are a member of the team/crew and once they feel like a member of the team, they then begin to acquire feelings of job security. The results of this study further reinforce the findings of several previous behavioral studies. Future research should attempt to validate the model using a larger sample size incorporating multiple general contractors.

A systematic review	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						activity-based working; agile working; job performance; occupants; office; workplace; workspace	OFFICE TYPE; PERCEIVED PRODUCTIVITY; SATISFACTION; WORKSPACE; BEHAVIOR; FLEXIBILITY; ENVIRONMENT; LOCATION; OUTCOMES; PRIVACY	Numerous claims have been made about the benefits of activity-based working (ABW) on workers' health and work performance. Yet, it is unclear if these claims are proven. This systematic review aims to establish whether there is an evidence base for the effects of ABW on health, work performance and perceptions of the work environment. Eight databases were searched in September 2016. Three reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed the studies and extracted the data. Seventeen studies involving 36,039 participants were included. The study designs varied in rigorousness from qualitative studies to pre-post-trials and in sample size ranging from 12 to 11,799. This review found that ABW has positive merits in the areas of interaction, communication, control of time and space, and satisfaction with the workspace; however, it is unfavourable for concentration and privacy. For physical and mental health, the evidence is equivocal. ABW seems to be a promising concept that can be implemented and promoted based on some benefits for work performance and perceptions of the work environment when it is coupled with appropriate management support and organization. More high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base further and establish its health effects.

JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competition rule; competitive tendering; perception; project type; China	DECISION-MAKING; BID EVALUATION; SELECTION; PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; CLIENT; MODEL; LEAD; TIME	Recent years have witnessed the diversifying means of competitive bidding, where the client plays a critical role in the determination of competition rule. It is widely recognized that the competition rule should be placed on a win-win basis to ensure that both the client and contractors are well considered with respect to their interests. Nevertheless, a vast majority of biddings fail to take account of what contractors really want. Using the methods of literature review and content analysis, 34 tender evaluation factors are proposed to compose the competition rule in China. Contractors' opinions on these factors are collected by virtue of questionnaire survey. Based on the Pareto law, it is found that the competition rule encompasses eleven key factors, and the composition varies slightly between public and private sectors. The Hotelling's T test is conducted on those key factors in common. The implication is that contractors can use indifferent factors (e.g., credit rating, construction plan, completeness of bid components, timely payment to workers) to improve competitiveness, while the client may utilize different factors to diversify the competition rule. This paper probably presents an earliest effort put to examine the acceptability of competition rule in the construction context.

J	Navon, R; Kolton, O				Navon, R.; Kolton, O.			Algorithms for automated monitoring and control of fall hazards	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION SAFETY	Most lethal accidents in construction are caused by falling from heights. Researchers point out the importance of safety control, carried out systematically and based on real-time data collection, as the most important element of accident prevention. An automated model to monitor and control fall hazard was developed. The model identifies the activities associated with risk of fall from heights and the areas where these activities are scheduled to be performed and plans the protective measures-guardrails in the present case. The model is designed to follow up the existing guardrails and constantly compare their locations and lengths to the planned ones. Based on this comparison, the model issues warnings whenever guardrails are missing, or temporarily removed. The model provides reports and warnings-the reports are used for planning the materials, or workers, needed to erect the protective measures. Warnings are given when a dangerous activity is per-formed without appropriate protective measures, or when the latter were removed before the dangerous activity was completed. The model's main algorithm s-dangerous activities and areas identification-were implemented and evaluated on site. Whereas the proposed model was developed to improve safety during the construction stage, it can be used as a useful tool during the design stage too. Including safety in the design stage, typically absent, can meaningfully improve safety during the actual construction.

Transfer to the United States of JIT is characterized by special production management practices involving inventory and quality control, industrial relations, and supplier-manufacturer relationships. Because so many different aspects of plant operation are involved, the transfer of JIT requires a substantial effort on the part of U.S. manufacturers. Despite this barrier, anecdotal evidence suggests that substantial transfer of Japanese production methods has taken place and that this transfer has had a significant impact on the performance of U,S, manufacturing plants. However, there is little empirical evidence of this process that is based on broad samples of plants and workers from various manufacturing industries. The purpose of this paper is to help fill this gap in the literature. Using a sample of U.S,- and Japanese-owned manufacturing plants in the United States in three different industries, we show that the implementation of JIT has improved many of the performance measures for these U,S, manufacturing plants.

Resource Planning in Engineering Services Firms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Linear optimization; management of scientists and engineers; project scheduling; resource allocation systems; resource management	ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM; SERIAL PRODUCTION; SCHEDULING MODEL; WORKFORCE; OPTIMIZATION; ANALYTICS; WORKERS	We develop a model to enable engineering professional services firms to improve the management of their competitive resources, i.e., skilled engineers, to be better able to respond to customer demand. The model was informed by semistructured interviews with senior executives from engineering, information technology (IT) services and technical consulting firms. As a result, we capture many of the complexities associated with the resource planning process in the professional engineering services sector. In the resulting model, the key attributes of supply, demand, and operations constraints are identified. Based on information obtained from the interviews, a number of test firms are created. We then use these test firms to study the impact of various resource planning policies on firm performance. These policies include the skill mix and profile of skilled employees, limits on the number of concurrent projects to which an employee can be assigned, and policies governing employee cross-training and hiring. The impact of these policies is evaluated in terms of business metrics, such as the project completion rate and net revenue. Finally, our model is extended to capture a multiphase rolling planning horizon, where projects may span multiple phases with the goal of ensuring consistency in employee assignment to projects.

Anxiety, as an intuitive feeling toward uncertainties, generally exists among residents who are confronted with redevelopment, and this feeling has gradually attracted scholars' attention. However, relatively few studies have focused on the multidimensional view of this concept and its influencing factors. Drawing upon a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 13 pilot areas in China, this study refines and verifies five prominent dimensions of anxiety, namely, housing conditions, monetary compensation, public services, life adaptation, and public participation level, through factor analysis and one-samplet-test. The finding contributes to achieving a complete understanding of anxiety, and the scales developed for measuring these dimensions lay the foundation for further empirical studies on anxiety. The individual and collective effects of age, job, and region variables on anxiety dimensions are demonstrated via independent-samplet-test and analysis of variance, which clarifies the formation process of anxiety and highlights the importance of these contextual variables. Tailored strategies for policymaking and engineering management, including establishing reasonable compensation standards, providing equal public services, and delivering high-quality housing, are proposed to relieve residents' anxiety. These strategies are expected to consider further the sensitive group, such as the elderly, farmers, and casual workers.

Referring to existing safety regulations, documents, and best practices, construction safety risks and their pre-control measures as well as the relationships among them were identified and then stored in a PtD knowledge base. Based on the algorithm for extracting and judging specific data information in Revit, an automated rule-based inspection plug-in combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) and PtD knowledge base was developed. The developed plug-in sent the feedback to designers through pop-up alert windows containing construction risk identification numbers (IDs) and the corresponding pre-control measure IDs in the Revit model. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach were also verified by professionals. This research realized accident PtD by integrating the BIM and PtD knowledge base; this approach can help to automatically assess safety risks during the design phase. Therefore, this approach can also increase the willingness and capacity of designers to implement PtD and improve safety performance of the construction industry.

When dealing with an OHS risk analysis problem, how to assess the risk of occupational hazards is a crucial step and a big challenge. In this paper, we aim to develop a new OHS risk assessment model by integrating Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) and Alternative Queuing Method (AQM) to assess and rank the risk of occupational hazards for corrective actions. To this end, the PFSs are utilized to address the vague and uncertain assessment information provided by experts and an improved AQM is introduced to acquire the risk priority of the recognized occupational hazards. Furthermore, we extend the Best Worst Method (BWM) to derive the relative weights of risk criteria based on picture fuzzy information. Finally, a practical example of excavation in a construction yard is provided to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed OHS risk assessment model. The results indicate that the new risk assessment method is able to produce more reliable risk ranking results of occupational hazards, and provides a practical and effective way for risk analysis in OHS.

A framework for addressing construction labour turnover in New Zealand	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Labour turnover; Workforce; Organisational performance; Construction industry; New Zealand		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify critical factors that affect labour turnover in the New Zealand construction sector and develop a framework for addressing this issue. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was adopted. A questionnaire survey combined with interviews was used to capture the personal experiences and views of 157 construction workers regarding labour turnover. Findings The statistical analysis revealed that level of pay, employment relationships, employee welfare, opportunities for career development, commuting distance to work and domestic relationships were the top five factors considered as primary determinants leading to the turnover decisions of most of those surveyed. Factor analysis further categorised the critical factors in three categories, namely, (1) nature of the job, (2) employee satisfaction and (3) employer commitment to staff retention and development. Practical implications While high labour turnover rates take a toll on many construction businesses, the findings from this research will hopefully provide guidance on areas of improvement to create a sustainable construction workforce at both organisational and sectoral levels. Originality/value Although the study is New Zealand-focused, it increases understanding of the factors affecting labour turnover in the construction sector, and the framework developed will provide construction organisations with directions in workforce retention and development to reduce the effects of labour turnover on organisational performance.

A contractor's safety performance is still not a major selection criterion, despite the existence of numerous safety prequalification methods. The negative repercussions of such apathy create a critical need for systems that enable owners to evaluate contractor safety performance and facilitate the selection of safety-conscious contractors by virtue of their good safety practices. This study presents the development of a computerized platform for evaluating contractor safety performance that is capable of analyzing contractors' safety performance data. The platform incorporates newly developed parameters that enable (1) including leading and lagging safety indicators that depict current and past contractor safety performance; (2) conducting analysis on both the organizational and project levels; and (3) satisfying the requirements of international safety standards. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by presenting a validated standard-compliant set of 10 indicators and 71 metrics that facilitate evaluating contractor safety performance and establishing their significance analytically. This should prove useful to decision makers and researchers alike and is a step forward to facilitate including contractor safety performance among major selection criteria, which can ultimately bring significant improvements to the building industry's safety.

Terence			Estimating Construction Labor Productivity Frontier: Pilot Study	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction management; Labor; Productivity; Probability distribution; Visual techniques; Quantitative methods	REPRESENTATION; OPPORTUNITIES; PERCEPTIONS; DELIVERY; GAMMA	Existing practice compares actual productivity with historical data to gauge construction operation efficiency. However, this practice is accurate only if historical data reflect optimal values-generally, such comparisons manifest only relative rather than absolute efficiency. Therefore, in order to determine absolute efficiency, one must compare actual versus optimal productivity. Optimal productivity is the highest sustainable productivity level achievable under "good management" and "typical field conditions." Perfect conditions, though unattainable in the field, conceptually yield the theoretical maximum level of productivity, known as the "productivity frontier." The productivity frontier is a construct that enables the estimation of the optimal productivity of construction operations. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a novel framework for estimating the labor productivity frontier and applying this framework to a pilot study that tests the feasibility of this framework against a single-worker, labor-intensive, sequential construction task. This paper first reviews relevant literature, then presents the theoretical underpinnings of the framework for estimating the productivity frontier in the construction domain, examines the data from the pilot study, and evaluates the feasibility of the proposed framework. By following two approaches-observed durations and statistically estimated durations-this study demonstrates the functionality of this framework by computing that the productivity frontier of the pilot study is 22.32 stations per hour.

Full body pose estimation of construction equipment using computer vision and deep learning techniques	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN); Computer vision; Construction equipment; Deep learning; Ensemble model; Keypoint estimation; Pose estimation; Safety monitoring; Stacked Hourglass Network (HG)	RECOGNITION; SIMULATION; FEATURES; CAMERA	Construction sites are among the most hazardous places with various safety issues. The high rate of hazards on construction sites can be attributed to the dynamic and complex characteristics of construction-related entities, such as the movement of construction equipment and workers as well as the interactions among them. Tracking construction equipment and workers can help avoid potential collisions and other accidents to achieve safer onsite conditions. As construction equipment (e.g. excavators, trucks, cranes, and bulldozers) plays a significant role in construction projects, it is important to track the location, pose and movement of construction equipment. Currently, with the wide installation of surveillance cameras on construction sites, computer vision techniques are explored to process the captured surveillance videos and images, such as to monitor the site conditions and prevent potential hazards. Previous studies have attempted to identify and locate different types of construction equipment on construction sites based on surveillance videos using computer vision techniques. However, there are limited studies that automatically estimate the full body pose and movement of on-site construction equipment, which can greatly influence the safety condition of construction sites and the utilization of the equipment itself. In this study, a methodology framework is developed for automatically estimating the poses of different construction equipment in videos captured on construction sites using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Firstly, keypoints of equipment are defined, based on which the images collected from the surveillance cameras are annotated to generate the ground truth labels. 70%, 10%, and 20% of the annotated image dataset are used for training, validation and testing, respectively. Then, the architectures of three types of deep learning networks i.e. Stacked Hourglass Network (HG), Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN), and an ensemble model (HG-CPN) integrating Stacked Hourglass and Cascaded Pyramid Network are constructed and trained in the same training environment. After training, the three models are evaluated on the testing dataset in terms of normalized errors (NE), percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), area under the curve (AUC), detection speed, and training time. The experiment results demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed methodology framework for automatically estimating different full body poses of construction equipment with high accuracy and fast speed. It is indicated by experiments that both HG and CPN can achieve relative high accuracy, with a PCK value of 91.19% and 91.78% respectively for estimating the equipment full body poses. In addition, the ensemble model with online data augmentation can further improve the accuracy, achieving a NE of 14.57 x 10(-3), a PCK of 93.43%, and an AUC of 39.72 x 10(-3) at the detection speed of 125 millisecond (ms) per image. This study lays the foundation for applying computer vision and deep learning techniques in the full body pose estimation of construction equipment, which can contribute to the real-time safety monitoring on construction sites.

J	Said, H				Said, Hisham			Prefabrication Best Practices and Improvement Opportunities for Electrical Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Electrical construction; Prefabrication; Best practices; Supply chain; Industrialization; Construction materials and methods		Prefabrication is a construction operations approach that moves project work to a controlled offsite facility to be accomplished in a standardized and efficient manner. Prefabrication is increasingly becoming attractive to electrical contractors to improve their competitiveness due to reported safety, time, and cost benefits. This paper presents the findings of an industry-sponsored research study to identify current best practices of electrical construction prefabrication and future improvement opportunities that consider prefabrication dependency on supply chain collaboration and labor union relations. The study tasks are performed in three main phases. First, current state of electrical construction prefabrication is identified through a comprehensive data collection plan that included semistructured interview, site visits, case studies, and questionnaires. The second phase included suggesting a set of best practices of electrical contracting industrialization, related to prefabrication operational/design requirements, role of vendor/distributors, and role of part manufacturers. The third phase involved the identification of future improvement opportunities for electrical contractors' industrialization, which include promoting mutually-rewarding relations among workers' union locals, and increasing implementation of lean principles. The study should prove useful to electrical contractors who seek to start or improve their prefabrication operations, and to industry advocates who seek to improve its performance through better supply chain collaborations and improved union relations. The major contributions of this paper include developing a set of data-driven prefabrication best practices and improvement opportunities for electrical contractors.

Research questions were 1) to what extent does the process of technology culturation affect the acceptance of the Internet 2) to what extent do social norms (SNs) affect the acceptance of the Internet? Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining, respectively, 47% and 37% of the variance. The second method was a qualitative analysis of respondents' free-format comments, These findings reinforce the quantitative findings, on the one hand, and reveal additional cultural barriers that still need to be studied, on the other. Findings identify how culture can both inhibit and encourage technological innovation and how Arab cultures can move their economies more quickly into the digital age.

A temporary precast facility was constructed to produce the wall-linings for the tunnels. The facility is operated 24 h a day from Monday to Friday and 12 h on Saturday with 100 workers. To enhance the safety performance within the facility, an experiential learning safety program referred to as See the Difference was implemented in conjunction with other safety interventions, although the program was the glue that held all initiatives together. This paper describes the safety program and examines its effectiveness and contribution it made toward reducing incidents and engendering teamwork within the temporary precast facility. It was observed that the See the Difference program had a positive influence on changing the mindset of the workforce from a fixed one to one of growth, which was developed through a process of coaching. The paper draws on actual practice and presents a novel approach to improving safety through the introduction of an experiential safety program. The case study offers a learning opportunity for other organizations that are confronted with implementing safety awareness programs, particularly for infrastructure transportation megaprojects.

The sources of influence on successful KM assimilation were explored via a study of Korean firms. A synthesis of previous studies that had utilized various theories to investigate KM variables yields six critical factors (i.e., knowledge worker, technical knowledge infrastructure, external knowledge linkage, knowledge strategy, internal knowledge climate, and knowledge management process), which facilitate KM assimilation. We then evaluated the effects of these critical factors on the level of KM assimilation, using responses from 187 Korean organizations that had already implemented enterprise-wide KM systems. Our findings show that four of the six variables were significantly related to KM assimilation. Interestingly, the KM process was found to be the most critical factor in the proliferation of KM activities across an organization, and knowledge strategy and external knowledge linkage were identified as insignificant ones for KM assimilation. The findings of this paper are expected not only to serve as early groundwork for researchers hoping to understand KM and its effective assimilation in organizations, but also to provide practitioners with guidelines as to how they can enhance their KM assimilation level, thus improving their organizational performance.

There are several ways to collect the information of elements in construction sites, such as manual collection, laser scanning, and tag-based methods. But each of these methods has its own limitations. Considering that effective and accurate construction progress monitoring is fundamental to construction management, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the latest computer vision methods to realize automatically monitoring construction progress of precast walls, one of the essential components in precast construction. In this framework, object detection, instance segmentation, and multiple-object tracking are combined to collect precast walls' location and temporal information from the surveillance videos recording the construction phase. Status information identified and collected is stored as a JavaScript object notation (JSON) format and then sent into a corresponding building information model (BIM) to timestamp the wall components. Each method in the framework is evaluated, respectively, and the demonstration on a real project proves the feasibility, convenience, and efficiency of this vision-based framework. The research results prove the proposed framework's ability to monitor the construction progress of precast walls automatically. Furthermore, the vital information extracted by the proposed framework contributes to serving application scenarios of the cyber-physical system in construction sites.

However, many factors have caused fires at construction sites, where workers are in close proximity and large amounts of materials and machinery are stored. Traditional smoke- and temperature-based sensors cannot be used because of the open-environment conditions and environmental complexities of construction sites. Moreover, traditional fire management on site mainly relies on artificial patrol mode, which is inefficient. Most previous studies focused on traditional real-time fire monitoring of constructed buildings. Therefore, a new, intelligent, and effective method should be developed for real-time fire monitoring of construction sites. The current study proposed a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which is suitable for various construction environments and can recognize real-time fires on site. This research built a fire-recognition model and developed a real-time construction fire detection (RCFD) system. Experiments were conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed system in different environmental conditions. Experimental results showed that the fire detection model based on the CNN algorithm can be applied to various field construction environments, and the recognition accuracy is above 90%. This study used a data-driven method to solve the problem of construction fire safety management. Results indicate that the RCFD system can guide project teams in the timely detection of fires on construction sites, improvement of safety management efficiency, and reduction of fire-related losses.

An international panel from the real estate and social investing sectors evaluated 66 criteria in terms of materiality to investors and importance to the public interest. A moderate to strong level of consensus was achieved. Criteria were ranked in terms of their materiality for financial performance and their importance to the public interest. Top ranked criteria were energy efficiency and conservation, high level of public transport services, transit-oriented development, daylight and natural ventilation, and contributes to higher density, mixed-use walkable places. There were few to no significant differences among the panellists by industry, gender or nationality. Factor analysis uncovered ten dimensions underlying the criteria. Based on this analysis, the panel would emphasize the creation of less automobile-dependent and more energy-efficient cities where worker well-being and urban revitalization are priorities. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating tools were compared with the results and found to be much stronger on environmental criteria than social concerns. The results can guide RPI portfolio audits, database development, third-party assessments of property companies, strategic consulting, the development of corporate reporting standards, RPI certification procedures, updated green building assessment tools, and cost-benefit studies to help guide asset managers.

J	Tang, LYN; Griffith, L; Stevens, M; Hardie, M				Tang, Liyaning; Griffith, Logan; Stevens, Matt; Hardie, Mary			Social media analytics in the construction industry comparison study between China and the United States	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Big data analytics; The construction industry; Weibo; Twitter; Comparison study; China; The United States	BIG DATA; PARALLEL	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discover similarities and differences in the construction industry in China and the United States by using data analytic tools on data crawled from social media platforms. Design/methodology/approach The method comprised comprehensive data analytics using network link analysis and natural language processing tools to discover similarities and differences of social networks, topics of interests and sentiments and emotions on different social media platforms. Findings From the research, it showed that all clusters (construction company, construction worker, construction media and construction union) shared similar trends on follower-following ratios and sentiment analysis in both social media platforms. The biggest difference between the two countries is that public accounts (e.g. company, media and union) on Twitter posted more on public interests, including safety and energy. Research limitations/implications The research contributes to knowledge about an alternative method of data collection for both academia and industry practitioners. Statistical bias can be introduced by only using social media platform data. The analyzed four clusters can be further divided to reflect more fine-grained groups of construction industries. The results can be integrated into other analyses based on traditional methodologies of data collection such as questionnaire surveys or interviews. Originality/value The research provides a comparative study of the construction industries in China and the USA among four clusters using social media platform data.

Owner Perceptions of Barriers to Prevention through Design Diffusion	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Prevention through design; Safety; Owner; Designer; Constructor; Barriers; Labor and personnel issues	CONSTRUCTION; ISSUES	Prevention through design (PtD) is an emerging concept for reducing safety hazards and preventing worker injuries and fatalities. Existing literature suggests that diffusion of PtD faces several significant barriers. This paper reports the results of a funded 2-year research study examining how employees in owner firms perceive potential barriers to PtD, including designers' lack of knowledge about performing PtD, increased designer fees, and designers' resistance to PtD due to fears of increased liability exposure. The research included an industrywide survey of owner-organization employees and case studies of four owner organizations, two of which had formal PtD programs. Research findings indicate that barriers to PtD suggested in the literature are not perceived to be as substantial as predicted. Owner employees are attracted to PtD and believe that it is a viable concept for enhancing construction safety. In practice, implementation requires that owners are knowledgeable about PtD, communicate their interest in PtD to the project team, confirm PtD as a high priority, and establish project processes to implement and monitor its success. The research findings are unique; they provide evidence of a pathway for PtD diffusion that was not previously available. In addition, the findings contribute to the knowledge in this area by providing guidance on how owner organizations participating in construction projects can act to successfully implement PtD on their projects.

To fill the knowledge gap, this research was conducted to identify important influencing factors on fire safety on construction sites, as well as their relationships, through a questionnaire administered to 1,492 fire officers in South Korea. The authors divided the questions into three factors (building, fire, and human) to distinguish factors affecting construction site fire safety. For the majority of the factors, there was high agreement on the importance level of factors affecting fire safety during construction between administrative and field firefighters. However, perception disparity did exist. The authors identified the interrelationships between factors through path analysis and structural equation modeling. The paths of factors showed the highest direct relation between building and fire factors, and the human factor played a mediator role between human and fire factors. The study contributes to the overall body of knowledge by providing officers' insights into the factors contributing to fire safety on construction sites, as well as the quantification of the interrelationship among the factors, which will serve as the basis to develop effective safety measures, such as policies and regulations at both the project level and industry level, to address fire safety on construction sites. The SEM model developed in this study can also be used as a base model for future related studies.

This research aims to identify the technical, economic and social issues and their respective solutions of real-time H&S management technologies during their implementation and operation. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to analyse the technical, economic and social aspects of a number of example real-time H&S management technologies. Using the information gathered from the literature review, Social Construction of Technology approach is used to theoretically analyse each real-time H&S management technology by considering four aspects: technology, social groups who utilize or interpret the technology, problems encountered by each social group and solutions or mechanisms to solve those problems. The study shows that the most common technical issues are occlusions, background disturbances, disturbed line-of-sight and low battery power. Most of these systems have high implementation cost. There is a considerable resistance to physical tagging due to health and privacy concerns. Researchers continue to explore ways to solve the technical issues. However, attention to solving the economic and social issues is relatively low in comparison. The research outcomes will contribute to future innovations and improvements in performance and productivity associated with construction H&S.

This study aims to conceptualize resilient safety culture in the construction environment by integrating resilience engineering principles into the concept of safety culture. To fulfill this research aim, a correlational research design was used. Data were collected using questionnaire surveys targeting construction project managers involved in the delivery of 78 recently completed building projects in Vietnam. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique with partial least-squares estimation (PLS) was used to analyze the data. The results confirmed 3 dimensions (i.e.,psychological resilience, behavioral resilience, and contextual resilience) with 24 measurable scale items to assess safety culture with respect to resilience. The study also revealed that psychological resilience has a weaker impact on accident prevention under higher contextual resilience and behavioral resilience levels. Theoretically, this study provides the theoretical development and empirical evidence to clarify the concept of resilient safety culture in terms of definition, purpose, and value in the context of construction projects. In practical terms, the study suggests that project hazards, unexpected events, and the risk tolerance of construction workers should be addressed to achieve consistently high safety performance. It also offers construction organizations a framework of safety practices to assess their capabilities in managing on-site safety risks.

Fusing imperfect experimental data for risk assessment of musculoskeletal disorders in construction using canonical polyadic decomposition	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Tensor decomposition; Risk assessment; Data fusion; Construction safety	TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS; MATRIX	Field or laboratory data collected for work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD) risk assessment in construction often becomes unreliable as a large amount of data go missing due to technology-induced errors, instrument failures or sometimes at random. Missing data can adversely affect the assessment conclusions. This study proposes a method that applies Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) tensor decomposition to fuse multiple sparse risk-related datasets and fill in missing data by leveraging the correlation among multiple risk indicators within those datasets. Two knee WMSD risk-related datasets-3D knee rotation (kinematics) and electromyography (EMG) of five knee postural muscles-collected from previous studies were used for the validation and demonstration of the proposed method. The analysis results revealed that for a large portion of missing values (40%), the proposed method can generate a fused dataset that provides reliable risk assessment results highly consistent (70%-87%) with those obtained from the original experimental datasets. This signified the usefulness of the proposed method for use in WMSD risk assessment studies when data collection is affected by a significant amount of missing data, which will facilitate reliable assessment of WMSD risks among construction workers. In the future, findings of this study will be implemented to explore whether, and to what extent, the fused dataset outperforms the datasets with missing values by comparing consistencies of the risk assessment results obtained from these datasets for further investigation of the fusion performance.

In this paper, we aim to take a novel approach to reconcile prior conflicting perspectives. We argue that previous seemingly discrepant findings may stem from ignoring different forms of network embeddedness and innovation. An innovator has doubly embedded relations in innovation networks: relational and structural embeddedness (SE). Additionally, innovations are categorized into two distinct types: exploratory and exploitative innovations. Our analysis is based on 2936 patent records involving 1561 inventors from a large U.S. company over a 16-year period. The findings indicate that, both relational and SE contribute to promoting exploitative innovation, while they have inverted U-shaped relationships with exploratory innovation. Furthermore, we argue that the whole network structure (e.g., the small-world quotient) must be considered to fully understand the effectiveness of network embeddedness. The implications of our findings are discussed for embeddedness, innovation, and network theory. For policy practice, researchers and knowledge workers should be more aware of modifying the levels of relational and SE, adopt appropriate embeddedness levels in a different situation, and match their embeddedness strategy with the whole structure of the intrafirm network.

However, the improvement of construction labour loyalty on construction sites remains a largely neglected measure for reducing their turnover and improving their productivity. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively investigate the managerial drivers of labour loyalty, including macro-environment of the project host country, organizational living environment, job system, rewards, and communication, and to explore the significance of satisfaction as a mediating variable in the relationship between the managerial drivers and construction labour loyalty. First, hypotheses on the relationships between construction labour loyalty, satisfaction and the five managerial drivers were proposed. Second, structural equation modelling was adopted to test these hypotheses. Finally, the results demonstrated two types of influence paths: (1) macro-environment, job system and communication have significantly direct effects on construction labour loyalty, (2) mediated by satisfaction, organizational living environment and rewards offer positive indirect effects on construction labour loyalty. The first type of path serves as a long-term strategic orientation for improving labour loyalty. The second type of path is a tactic for short-term goals of labour loyalty enhancement. The research results can contribute to the body of knowledge of human resource management and the practice of enhancing labour productivity through improving construction labour loyalty in the context of international construction projects.

Workforce location tracking to model, visualize and analyze workspace requirements in building information models for construction safety planning	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Construction safety; Global positioning system; Lean construction; Resource location tracking; Workspace modeling and visualization	SPACE; MANAGEMENT; FUSION; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; RESOURCES; LEVEL; BIM	Safety as well as productivity performance in construction is often poor due to congested site conditions. We lack a formalized approach in effective activity-level construction planning to avoid workspace congestion. The purpose of this research is to investigate and prototype a new Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled approach for activity-level construction site planning that can pro-actively improve construction safety. The presented method establishes automated workspace visualization in BIM, using remote sensing and workspace modeling technologies as an integral part of construction safety planning. Global Positioning System (GPS) data loggers were attached to the hardhats of a work crew constructing cast-in-place concrete columns. Novel algorithms were developed for extracting activity-specific workspace parameters from the recorded workforce location tracking data. Workspaces were finally visualized on a BIM platform for detecting potential workspace conflicts among the other competing work crews or between material lifting equipment The developed method can support project stakeholders, such as engineers, planners, construction managers, foremen and site supervisors and workers with the identification and visualization of the required or potentially congested workspaces. Therefore, it improves the foundation on how decisions are made related to construction site safety as well as its potential impact on a productive and unobstructed work environment.

J	Phua, FTT				Phua, F. T. T.			Does the built-environment industry attract risk-taking individuals?	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Architecture; occupational attraction; physical risk propensity; gambling risk propensity	CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; UK CONSTRUCTION; SAFETY CLIMATE; MARKET POWER; DESIGN; HEALTH; PROPENSITY; CULTURE; SCALE; PERFORMANCE	This exploratory research examines whether or not those attracted to professional-level occupations in the built-environment industry are innately physical risk-takers and hence potentially, thereby, more likely to countenance or contribute to physically risky workplace climates. Using individual-level data, the occupational attractiveness of the built-environment industry subsectors of construction management and architecture are each found positively and significantly to be predicted by physical risk-taking propensity, but not by a comparator risk-taking propensity, gambling. Conversely, the occupational attractiveness of a comparator profession in financial services is found to be significantly predicted by gambling risk-taking propensity, but not by physical risk-taking propensity. Although exploratory, our finding that two key professions in the built-environment industry are each discretely found to be attractive to physical risk-takers suggests not only that constituent occupations within the industry, but that the industry as a whole might perhaps engender a self-reinforcing suboptimal workplace safety climate. Accordingly, constituent subsectors of the industry may need both separately and collectively to consider the phenomenon of physical risk-taking propensity amongst the professionals it attracts in order effectively to set and manage the site work-place safety climate that such professionals are ultimately responsible for creating and delivering in a sector fraught with physical risks for site workers.

Wuhan Metro's Sanyang road tunnel, which crosses the Yangtze River in China, was selected for this case study. A slurry shield machine with a cutter diameter of 15.76 m was designed to be hoisted for 44 m into the underground tunnel shafts. The major challenges of this hoisting were as follows: 1) complex construction environment for hoisting, 2) limited visibility of crane operator or blind hoisting, and 3) precise control of position and gesture of a giant cutter wheel in real time. To overcome these challenges, the CPS-SMS was proposed to simulate and monitor the hoisting process to avoid the unsafe status of cranes and the hoisted cutter wheel. Internet-of-things technologies, such as wireless sensor-based location and tracking, self-organized Wi-Fi, and bi-directional communication, were used to prevent accidents in the changing and dynamic hoisting process. The implementation of monitoring blind hoist in the Yangtze River, which crosses the metro tunnel construction site, was successful, that is, no collision or injury occurred. The CPS-SMS can be applied by practitioners to various construction projects, such as dams, high-rise buildings, and large-scale infrastructure projects, to decrease the likelihood of safety risks in blind hoisting in complex environments.

Assessing Work-Related Risk Factors on Low Back Disorders among Roofing Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Ergonomic assessments; Low back pains; Risk evaluation; Musculoskeletal disorders; Experimental studies; Nonfatal injuries	FLEXION-RELAXATION RESPONSE; BIOMECHANICS; FREQUENCY; SURFACE	Roofers have long suffered from low back disorders (LBDs), which are a primary nonfatal injury in construction. Ergonomic studies have identified several risk factors associated with LBDs in workplaces and developed biomechanical models for general LBD risk assessments. However, these models cannot be directly used for assessments in roof workplaces because they are designed for general tasks without considering roofers' posture variance and effects of working on slanted roof surfaces. This paper examined the relationship between roofing work-related factors and LBD risk among roofers using a laboratory assessment. A pitch-configurable wood platform was built to mimic the rooftop. The maximum trunk flexion angle and normalized electromyography (EMG) signals were measured as indicators using a motion capture system and a skeletal muscle signal recording system under different settings, i.e., different roof slopes, postures, facing directions, and working paces. The results indicated the measured factors with significant effects on the LBD development and revealed unfavorable conditions (e.g., using a stooped posture to work on low-pitch rooftops at a fast pace) where the work on rooftops needs particular attention. Such information is useful for systematic understanding of roofing nonfatal LBD developments among construction professionals and may enable development of interventions and guidelines for reducing the prevalence of LBDs at roofing jobsites.

To overcome this problem, clients in the construction industry sometimes use schedule incentive/disincentive (I/D) contracting strategy. However, previous studies have shown that inadequate understanding and wrong implementation of schedule I/D provisions could result in unintended results. Moreover, the use of the I/D contracting method is in its initial stages in many countries such as India. The purpose of this paper is to identify various factors that are essential for schedule I/D success in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among experienced professionals (clients, contractors and consultants) from across the Indian construction industry. Findings Top success factors related to clients in the descending order of their importance are: realistic targets; detailed guidelines for I/D implementation; close coordination with other stakeholders; correct estimation of I/D duration and amount; and imposing disincentives after due consideration. Meanwhile, factors related to contractor organisations are: continuous monitoring and control; thorough understanding of schedule I/D targets; specific considerations in appointing senior project personnel; effective communication; and proper labour management. Originality/value This research highlights the specific roles of both clients and contractors in the success of schedule I/D projects in developing countries such as India.

Development and Evaluation of a Probabilistic Local Search Algorithm for Complex Dynamic Indoor Construction Sites	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Indoor localization	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; TRACKING; LOCALIZATION	The nature of an indoor construction site is dynamic and complex. This characteristic becomes even more evident when a multitude of interactions among workers, equipment, and materials exists. To assist various operations of construction, which are dynamic and complex in nature, previous research explored sensing technologies to discover advanced approaches to supporting construction operations. In particular, many researchers have focused on investigating the tracking of construction resources over the past several years. Despite the previous research efforts in radio-signal-strength-indication (RSSI)-based tracking systems, signal interference such as signal degradations, occlusions, obstructions, and multipath effects created by a complex and dynamic construction environment has not been clearly discussed. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of issues associated with signal interference is limited. This research aims to reduce the gap in knowledge of the RSSI-based tracking system when it is used in a highly noisy environment like a dynamic, complex, and large indoor construction site. This paper presents the development of a new probabilistic local search (PLS) algorithm using Bluetooth low energy network technology. The PLS is assessed with respect to accuracy, reliability, and robustness. Two conventional positioning methods are subjected to the same tests as a benchmark for comparison. The results indicate that PLS outperforms the other conventional methods when the signal interference is high and performs comparably when the signal interference is minimal.

Persistent pressures affecting global engineering companies have limited the potential to address the HR element. Simply transferring mature western concepts and analytical tools does not capture the dynamics of the global production workforce. This paper proposes a new theoretical perspective encompassing an evaluative tool, thus moving beyond formulaic implementations of initiatives that erroneously assume maturity of production practices and outcomes. This study helps advance organizations by adding contextualization to the human-centric perspectives of organizational citizenship behavior and discretionary effort. Case-based data from engineering production workers in Thailand were factor analyzed to test the research hypotheses. This research reports on an alternative operationalization of these core ideas, while significantly extending the empirical base through validating the propositions. Furthermore, it contributes and responds to extant literature identifying HR as the missing link in enacting CI programs in practice. This paper addresses this gap, and the data collected support the theory that the proposed HR concepts positively impact organizational CI interventions. Findings have important implications for such interventions encompassing practical and theoretical relevance for global engineering managers with a local engineering production workforce.

Real-Time 3D Crane Workspace Update Using a Hybrid Visualization Approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Crane; Workspace modeling; Point cloud; Vision; Object tracking; Safety	CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT; FRAMEWORK; TRACKING	Crane operators often face poor visibility and collision hazards during lifting operations. Dynamic three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the crane workspace helps to alleviate this by identifying potential collision hazards and offering visual assistance and feedback in real time to the operator. This paper proposes a real-time 3D crane modeling and updating framework using a hybrid visualization approach combining vision and point cloud technologies. A wide-angle camera is mounted on a crane boom and functions as an overhead camera to track moving objects at a site during lift scenarios. The 2D image frames are aligned with a laser-scanned point cloud, and the corresponding 3D bounding boxes for tracked objects are dynamically updated. The tracking and updating loops are executed asynchronously to enable real-time operation of the framework. The proposed method is validated with a mobile crane in five different lift scenarios with different moving objects such as cars and workers. The visual tracking step is found to achieve an 82-94% normalized position accuracy, and the point cloud-vision frame alignment step is found to result in a reasonable root-mean-square error of 3.9 pixels. In addition, tests with simulated 3D objects show that the estimated 3D bounding box can be positioned to within 0.1-0.4 m of the ground truth. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Furthermore, the project must be completed within a given deadline. In previous studies, the objective was to minimize the total number of crews under the assumption that the cost of hiring a crew is the same for all activities. In fact, this cost usually differs among activities because of the differences in type of work, crew size, and technical level of workers. This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model with an extended objective of minimizing the crew employment cost of all activities. The model is equipped with an exact procedure to validate the feasibility of a prespecified deadline. A highway project was used to show the application of the proposed method, and then extensive computational experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method by comparing the obtained results with those obtained by the existing methods. The results highlight the significance of integrating the time-cost trade-off analysis, and indicate that the proposed method can find optimal solutions for large-scale projects within a reasonable amount of time.

Integrated Planning of Operational Maintenance Programs for Water and Gas Distribution Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure management; Municipal distribution networks; Vehicle dispatch problem; Intervention planning; Inspection planning	INFRASTRUCTURE; RELIABILITY	Drinking water and natural gas are essential goods provided by municipal distribution networks. In order for there to be a reliable provision of such commodities, infrastructure managers must regularly dispatch vehicles to perform tasks such as valve and hydrant inspections and meter replacements. As public concerns about sustainability grow, managers must look for ways to reduce carbon emissions. This, however, should be done without jeopardizing service. One conceivable approach is to train staff to perform additional maintenance tasks so that combined work packages can be carried out. This would require resources to be spent in different areas, such as supplemental worker training and organizational restructuring of the utility. Infrastructure managers must thus weigh the expected efficiency gains against the associated costs. The infrastructure asset management process combined with digitalization are powerful tools to assess such questions. Unfortunately, digitalization in the infrastructure sector lags behind other sectors of the economy. To bridge this gap, real-world examples are needed to further spur adoption. This paper addresses this need with a methodology and case study for infrastructure managers of water and gas networks. Specifically, this paper presents a methodology to quantify the resource requirements of operational maintenance programs for a large municipality. As utilities plan maintenance routes differently, four algorithms are used to model the resource requirements of the status quo. The effect of prioritization as well as frequency of inspections/replacements is considered.

Despite its importance, this task is still performed manually. Previous studies have taken a significant step forward in introducing computer vision technologies, although they have been oriented toward limited classes of objects or limited types of activities. Furthermore, they especially focus on single activity recognition, where an image contains only the execution of an activity by one or a few objects. This paper introduces a two-step method for recognizing diverse construction activities in still site images. It detects 22 classes of construction-related objects using convolutional neural networks. With objects detected, semantic relevance representing the likelihood of the cooperation or coexistence between two objects in a construction activity, spatial relevance representing the two-dimensional pixel proximity in the image coordinates, and activity patterns are defined to recognize 17 types of construction activities. The advantage of the proposed method is its potential to recognize diverse concurrent construction activities in a fully automatic way. Therefore, it is possible to save managers' valuable time in manual data collection and concentrate their attention on solving problems that necessarily demand their expertise.

Developing a precast production management system using RFID technology	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Radio Frequency Identification (RFID); Building automation; Precast construction; Precast production	RADIO-FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; TRACKING	Radio Frequency identification (RFID) is characterized with superior predispositions, including the recognition of multiple markers, communication ranges from five to six meters, and a storage database for thousands of data files. These unique features resolve data storage and record-reviewing difficulties, prevent repetitive data entries, and facilitate instant feedbacks. The precast industry is a management-intensive sector, for which pivotal issues include methods relevant to the instant provision of acquired management information to executive managers, materials of precast concrete products, quality control inspection and inventory and transportation management information, and convenient data entry for frontline personnel. It is anticipated to integrate usage of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) and the application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Using RFID tag and reader to collect the information, and then transmit the multifaceted, mobilized information such as the production quantity, the materials quantity, quality control inspection and inventory and transportation management information to the manager office or the site worker via the PDA and wireless Internet. This precast production management system which has been developed by the author and utilized in precast production management encompasses inspection of incoming materials, production process inspection, molds inspection, specimen strength feedback, and logistic and receiving management. The mobilized information frame elaborated in this proposal can, to certain degree, be regarded as a reference for the construction of a mobilized precast industry management system.

This is consistent with a recent and prominent stream of research that investigates the characteristics of workers as antecedents of ambidexterity behaviors and their effect on performance. We also analyze the role of entrepreneurial intensity as an important context issue that hampers this relationship. We test our hypotheses in the context of Italian television drama series productions, which are small project-based enterprises, by analyzing the careers of 1736 project entrepreneurs who had been working in the industry from 1996 to 2010. Our results suggest that for project entrepreneurs, high diversity in work experiences positively affects the project performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that the industry tenure of project entrepreneurs lessens the main relationship, by reducing the positive effect of entrepreneurial intensity and limiting benefits of ambidextrous behaviors. Our findings allow us to add insights to the entrepreneurship research and individual level ambidexterity theory. First, we contribute to this stream of research by analyzing how the diversity of work experiences at the individual level affects project performance. In doing so, we overcome the prior literature, which limited analysis only to the project portfolio level. Second, we develop a framework that investigates the argument regarding whether and under what circumstances does individual level ambidexterity improve project performance.

Performance evaluation of 3D descriptors for object recognition in construction applications	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						3D object recognition; Point cloud; Machine learning; Descriptor	EXISTING BUILDINGS; MODELS; BIM; RECONSTRUCTION; FEATURES	3D object recognition from field-acquired point cloud data is important for modeling, manipulation, visualization and other post-processing tasks in the construction domain. However, building semantically-rich models from raw point cloud data is a difficult task due to the high volume of unstructured information as well as confounding factors such as noise and occlusion. Although there exist several computational recognition methods available, their performance robustness for construction applications are not well known. Therefore, this research aims to review and evaluate state-of-the-art descriptors for 3D object recognition from raw point clouds for construction applications such as workspace modeling, asset management and worker tracking. The evaluation was carried out using 3D CAD models with known labels as training data and laser-scanned point clouds from construction sites as testing data. The recognition performance was evaluated with respect to varying level of detail, noise level, degree of occlusion, and computation time. Experimental results show that for all evaluated descriptors, increasing the level of detail and decreasing the noise level results in a moderate increase in recognition accuracy whereas reducing occlusion results in a significant increase in recognition accuracy. In addition, experimental results suggest that the key features that distinguish an object can be derived around the 10 mm level and any further increase in the level of detail do not significantly increase the recognition accuracy.

J	Yeo, CJ; Yu, JH; Kang, Y				Yeo, Chang Jae; Yu, Jung Ho; Kang, Youngcheol			Quantifying the Effectiveness of IoT Technologies for Accident Prevention	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Internet of Things; Safety in construction; Accident-prevention effect; Safety management	WIDE-BAND TECHNOLOGY; EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM; WORKERS-ON-FOOT; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; MISS INTERACTIONS; IDENTIFICATION; EQUIPMENT; FRAMEWORK; INTERNET; MOBILE	The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted attention in recent years as a way to prevent construction site accidents. Although various IoT technologies have been tested for the purpose of safety management, few have been implemented in actual projects. One possible reason is that the effectiveness of these technologies has rarely been calculated. In this study, a method for quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of IoT technologies for accident prevention is presented. Taking the domino theory of accident causation into account, this method has three aspects: the degree of the causes of accidents that an IoT technology prevents, association between accident types and their causes, and frequency of each accident type. To quantify these, two different types of survey were conducted, and statistical records about construction accidents by type were used. To test the applicability of this method, the effectiveness of two IoT technologies was calculated. The method successfully quantified how much each technology contributes to preventing certain types of accident as well as the overall accident-prevention effect. The proposed method can enable practitioners to assess the effectiveness of certain IoT technologies, which will be useful in justifying investments in the technology. The method will lead to deploying more IoT technologies for safety management, which will eventually contribute to decreasing accidents in the construction industry.

Site operatives' attitudes towards traditional masculinity ideology in the Australian construction industry	CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Attitudes; diversity; gender; hegemony; masculinity; corporate social responsibility	INVENTORY-SHORT-FORM; HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY; WOMENS EXPERIENCE; GENDER; SEXUALITY; CONFLICT; POLITICS; WORK	There is a widely accepted assumption in the construction literature that the industry is highly masculinised. However, there has been a surprising lack of empirical evidence around workers' own attitudes towards masculinity in the sector. Addressing this lack of research, a survey to measure construction site operatives' attitudes towards traditional masculinity ideology was undertaken in Australia using the Male Role Norms Inventory Scale-Short Form (MRNI-SF). It is found that the focus of attitudes towards masculinity in the construction industry may be shifting to reflect trends in the wider population and may be more inclusive and less hegemonic than has been previously argued. It is also found that the focus of masculinity in the construction industry is closely related to the physical and high-risk nature of work and that sexuality and humour may also be an important source of masculine identity. These results are important since they contribute a more nuanced understanding of the dimensions and exact nature of attitudes towards masculinity in the construction industry. It is concluded that future research into the impact of masculinity in areas such as gender diversity, safety and mental health would benefit from a more inclusive theoretical lens which recognises the dynamic nature of masculinity and which highlights the institutional legacies of past hegemonies that have to be challenged to move the industry forward.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is an empirical focused on of lean production theory and value stream mapping. The data in the case study were collected in real time on-site for each process during the production process of a prefabricated exterior wall. Findings The results of the current value stream map indicate that the main problems of the current production process are related to equipment, technology and organization. The equipment problems include simple demolding and cleaning tools and the lack of professional transfer channels. The technology problems include the lack of a marking mechanism and pipeline exit mechanism. There is a lack of standard operating procedures and incomplete process convergence. A comparison and analysis of the current value stream and the future value flow indicate that optimizations of the process flow, the production line layout, and the standard operating procedures have shortened the delivery cycle, reduced the number of workers, improved the operator's operating level and balanced the production line. Originality/value This research represents an innovative application of lean production theory and value stream mapping in a complex production line of precast concrete components and thereby fills the gap between the theory and practice of the optimization of a precast concrete component production line.

J	Scrase, JI				Scrase, JI			Curbing the growth in UK commercial energy consumption	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						air conditioning; building stock; climate change; energy consumption; energy efficiency; offices; regulations; sustainability; UK		The rate of growth in UK commercial energy consumption since the early 1970s has been approximately three times greater than in the domestic sector. Consumption is projected to continue growing faster than in all other sectors except transport. Increasing floor space has been accompanied by rising energy intensity in many commercial buildings. In the office sector, demand for air conditioning has grown rapidly, and this is associated with a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions. Significant cost-effective CO2 savings have been identified in the sector, using readily available technologies. The Climate Change Levy, and questions of comfort, health and productivity among workers, are pushing energy issues up the agenda for many businesses. However positive action is impeded by barriers in the commercial property sector, such as conflicts of interest between landlords and tenants, poor information and professional conservatism. These barriers act to limit energy efficiency investment, to the detriment of building occupants and wider society for generations to come. These problems will limit the efficacy of existing initiatives that aim to curb commercial sector energy use. The Association for the Conservation of Energy considers that new legislation is needed. This would require freeholders to improve the energy efficiency of their new and existing buildings, in consultation with occupiers and/or unions. Further research is needed on options for sharing the costs and benefits with occupiers and/or energy service companies.

The growing popularity of building information modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily upon the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project life cycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. Therefore, we propose an acceptance model for BIM in construction organizations using structural equation modeling (SEM). The key components, including the BIM acceptance model (BAM), are identified through a literature review about technology acceptance-behavior related theories, and was then consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on the components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, and engineers) in South Korea. A total of 114 completed questionnaires were retrieved. We used SEM for hypothesis testing. The validated BAM can serve as a foundation for positioning and comparing BIM acceptance research and provides users with a framework for evaluating BIM acceptance.

Much of the research oil improvement of performance of the construction industry has mainly focused Oil contractors and the supply chain. The performance of a client is important because any decision made will affect project Success. Failure oil the part. of the client might lead to stress factors causing significant problems ill Successive stages of the project. This research is an investigation into the roles of the client to find Out whether clients ill the building industry in Uganda are playing their part. Due to the non-specific nature of clients, a guided questionnaire survey was carried out among architects who normally work with different types of clients. The majority of the building clients in Uganda are individuals followed by limited liability companies. It was found out that delay by clients in paying the contractors is a major factor affecting the performance of contractors. Almost all clients do not Support training of the workers in its different forms. Construction works start before the designs are completed and the majority of the variations is due to incomplete briefs and designs.

Estimation and control of the tool center point of a mobile concrete pump	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Flexible link manipulator; Concrete pump; Feedback control; Estimation concept; Sensor fusion	ATTITUDE ESTIMATION	Booms of modern mobile.concrete pumps are vulnerable to elastic vibrations due to the light-weight construction. Although these vibrations can be effectively damped with appropriate controllers, the residual movement of the tool center point (TCP) during the pumping process is still uncomfortable for the workers guiding the end hose. In this paper, it is shown that this movement can be compensated with a position controller in combination with a damping controller. In practice, the required measurement of the absolute height of the TCP with respect to the ground is, however, difficult. Therefore, a strategy for the determination of the height of the TCP based on the kinematic description of the boom is proposed. For this purpose, the measurement of the inclination of each boom segment with inertial sensors in combination with an observer concept is presented which circumvents the disadvantages of tilt sensors. It is shown that a complementary filter design utilizing an additional inertial sensor placed on the TCP allows for the practical implementation of a PD-controller based on the inverse differential kinematics of the rigid-body approximation of the boom. This effectively compensates the vertical movement of the TCP. The estimation and control concepts are evaluated by extensive simulation studies on a validated mathematical model of a mobile concrete pump. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the benefits of using BIM in the OAS of prefabricated construction cannot be cultivated with an incomplete, inaccurate, and untimely data exchange and lack of real-time visibility and traceability. To deal with these challenges, an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled platform is designed by integrating loT and BIM for prefabricated public housing projects in Hong Kong. The demands of the stakeholders were analysed; then smart construction objects (SCOs) and smart gateway are defined and designed to collect real-time data throughout the working processes of on-site assembly of prefabricated construction using the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The captured data is uploaded to cloud in real-time to process and analyse for decision support purposes for the involved site managers and workers. Visibility and traceability functions are developed with BIM and virtual reality (VR) technologies, through which managers can supervise the construction progress and approximate cost information in a real-time manner. The IoT-enabled platform can provide various decision support tools and services to different stakeholders, for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of daily operations, decision making, collaboration, and supervision throughout on -site assembly processes of prefabricated construction.

Over the last few decades, various rule-based postural assessment systems have been developed and widely used to facilitate the measurement and evaluation of risks related to WMSDs in many industries. However, the applicability of rule-based assessment to tasks involving heavy material handling has not yet been examined. This study investigated the applicability of three rule-based assessment systems (RULA, REBA, and OWAS) to a bricklaying task. To achieve this goal, an automated assessment tool was developed to implement those systems on whole-body data sets consisting of static postures captured by wearable inertial measurement unit suits. The study demonstrates the use of this tool in assessing risk levels (grand scores) encountered by 43 masons during the laying of 16.6-kg concrete masonry units (CMUs) in a standard wall. Furthermore, the biomechanical analysis of the same data set was carried out and utilized as ground truth to evaluate those results. It was found that rule-based assessment may lead to erroneously inflated risk evaluation in heavy manual handling tasks. In contrast, biomechanical analysis provided sensitive risk evaluations that distinguish the different degrees of risk arising from different motion patterns while participants performed the same tasks. These findings suggest using biomechanical analysis as an objective and robust method to evaluate risks encountered in tasks involving heavy material handling.

Among all construction operations, excavation is one of the most hazardous because of its inherent consequences from potential cave-ins, falls, and contacts of workers-on-foot with equipment or unknown objects. Current design, planning, and inspection of safety equipment at excavation sites is insufficient as it is still done manually, infrequently, time-consuming, and prone to human error. A new method is presented that semi-automatically identifies fall and cave-in hazards related to excavation pits and models, among other temporary geotechnical excavation objects, the required fall protection equipment. The approach first extracts relevant fall risk criteria from safety rules and regulations published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and applied in industry best practices. Three-dimensional (3D) range point clouds from the excavated pits are then collected to measure the geometrical properties of the pit. An algorithm extracts height information automatically to identify and locate fall hazards. The integration of geometric parameters with geotechnical and safety regulations finally results in a building information model (BIM) that includes the installation of safety equipment. An experimental field trial demonstrates the applicability of the developed method for successful use by practitioners in the industry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Said, H; Mali, A; Deshmukh, A				Said, Hisham; Mali, Aishwarya; Deshmukh, Ajay			Identification and assessment of the unionization factors of the US electrical construction trade	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction; Strategic management; Questionaire survey; Management	UNION MEMBERSHIP; LABOR UNIONS; PRODUCTIVITY; SAFETY	Purpose Construction trade unions have been a vital force in improving the job standards and wellbeing of trade workers. However, the union membership in the construction industry has dropped by half between 1983 and 2017. The objective of this study is to identify and assess the controlling factors of construction electrical trade unionization in the United States. Design/methodology/approach The study involved four main steps. Literature review and industry townhall meetings were conducted to identify the electrical trade unionization factors. A new unionization trend metric was developed using available union market share data to quantify the growth and decline of local unions. Mixed-mode surveying was used to collect questionnaire and interview data on the unionization factors in different local units of the electrical trade union. Finally, the survey data from the questionnaire and interviews were merged and their correlation with the unionization trend data was assessed. Findings The study found that the unionization of this specialty trade is dependent on increasing the crew ratio, expanding the non-apprenticeship union membership program, organizing larger contractors, and continuing the union focus on public and heavy industrial projects. Originality/value The study contributes to the construction management body of knowledge by providing a data-driven industry-wide assessment of the factors that affect electrical construction unionization. The study advances the understanding of construction trade unions by narrowing the theory-practice knowledge gap, illustrating the use of macro quantitative empirical research methods, and developing a new unionization trend metric.

J	Kim, K; Cho, Y; Kim, K				Kim, Kyungki; Cho, Yong; Kim, Kinam			BIM-Driven Automated Decision Support System for Safety Planning of Temporary Structures	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; MODELS	Temporary structures are essential to support various activities of a construction project. Proper utilization of temporary structures can have a significant influence on critical aspects of the project such as cost, productivity, and safety. However, a process of planning temporary structures still relies on labor-intensive and error-prone efforts based on implicit knowledge of workers. Moreover, temporary structures are planned without detailed spatiotemporal analysis of their implications and systemized approach to safety. This tendency may yield the inefficient employment of temporary structures and unsafe job sites. Lack of systemized approach for identifying hazards related to the temporary structure would result in not only an economic loss but also fatalities and injuries. This paper introduces a building information model- (BIM-) based decision support system that provides safety plans for temporary structures considering their costs and durations. Focusing on scaffolding, the system automatically generates multiple scaffolding plans and quantitatively evaluates them regarding safety, cost, and duration. By analyzing project-specific spatiotemporal information to identify relevant hazards and variations of cost and duration, a specific plan for utilizing scaffolds, which is the most appropriate regarding safety, cost, and duration, is selected among the generated plans. The developed system was implemented using a BIM software tool and validated with an in-depth case study on a real-world construction project. This can be utilized as a decision-support system that enables the users to develop a plan with minimized safety hazards related to scaffolding while considering workflow, cost, and duration at the same time.

Mechanical Response of Unbraced Wood Composite I-Joist to Walking Loads	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Composite materials; Buckling; Human factors; Pedestrians; Joints; Walking loads; Wood composite I-joists; Human loading; Lateral buckling; Construction materials and methods	FOOTBRIDGES	Lateral buckling of unbraced wood composite I-joists is a form of instability that causes the joist to deflect laterally and rotate. This instability may be a cause of worker falls and should be explored to understand the range of loading and out-of-plane motion required to cause lateral buckling. While walking on unbraced joists is uncommon on construction sites, understanding the movement of unbraced joists is needed to model more commonly observed partially braced joists. This paper investigated the load and out-of-plane movement of several unbraced wood composite I-joists subjected to human walking loads. Vertical load at the ends of the joist, top and bottom horizontal loads at one end of the joist, as well as lateral deflection and rotation at the midspan and quarter-span were measured while participants traversed the joist. Lateral buckling of joists was observed due to walking loads. Total vertical load measured was similar to participant weight, while horizontal loads ranged from 9.6 to 13.7% of participant weight. Differences were observed in I-joist behavior between different lengths and manufacturers studied. Load, lateral deflection, and rotation of the joist increased as participant weight increased. Vertical load at each end, lateral deflection, and rotation were positively correlated with participant weight. A set of curves demonstrating the lateral deflection and rotation for different joists as a function of participant weight was developed.

This study conducts a scientometric review of the global research published between 1999 and 2019 on computer vision applications for construction, through co-author, co-citation, keyword and clustering analysis. A total of 1158 journals and conference proceedings from Scopus database were analyzed. Trends within the field are identified, as are the dominant sub-fields and their interconnections, as well as citation patterns, key publications, key research institutions, key researchers, and key journals, along with the extent to which these interact with each other in research networks. The provided results were analyzed to identify the deficiencies in current research and propose future trends. Among these is a bias in the research literature towards traditional on-site construction and a concerning gap of off-site construction research, as well as a lack of inter-relationships and collaboration between researched areas, the researchers themselves, and/or the research institutions. In the near future, computer vision will play a key role in the future development of smart construction and improvement of quality in construction projects. This study hopes to bring awareness to the industry, the journal editors, and the researchers of the need for a deeper exchange of ideas in any future research efforts.

J	BUCHOWICZ, BS				BUCHOWICZ, BS			A PROCESS MODEL OF MAKE-VS-BUY DECISION-MAKING - THE CASE OF MANUFACTURING SOFTWARE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article							STRATEGY	The decision to develop (make) a product or process internally or to purchase the relevant technology (buy) is one facing many organizations. What has been written about make-vs.-buy decisions usually consists of generic checklists of dubious relevancy to the decision maker's specific situation. Since the literature offers few clues as to how decisions are actually made, development of a process model based on a class of such decisions seemed to be in order. The make-vs.-buy decision for manufacturing software was the focus of this study. In-depth cases studies in seven organizations were conducted, guided by a series of key issues pertaining to the process of strategic decision-making. Experience gained at eight other sites added to the analysis and development of a model. The study found that make-vs.-buy decisions are treated in various ways. Of special interest was the recognition, in some organizations, of made-vs.-buy decisions as opportunities to develop or support an existing competitive advantage. In such firms, the entire approach and decision-making style were oriented towards achieving such an advantage. Organizations that did not view the make-vs.-buy decision as such an opportunity tended to utilize precedents and were often dominated by cultural values that sought professional peer approval. The failure of several firms in the study to see make-buy as an opportunity to achieve competitive advantage appeared to be linked to a failure on the part of technical workers and middle-level managers to fully understand and appreciate top management's strategy and goals.

HAV represents a particular risk within construction that relies extensively on these types of tool. Since becoming a legal requirement throughout the European Union for employers to manage vibration risks, construction managers must (inter alia) assess workers' vibration exposure. Here two specific problems confront them: a dearth of vibration emission data relating to construction tools; and the 'irrelevance' of much data currently available (due to their not being measured under real work conditions). To help address these shortcomings, emission data were measured according to ISO 5349 and analysed in respect of several hammer-action and percussive tools of varying types and weights, while using different sizes of tool inserts. Some additional measurements were also carried out on materials of different hardness. Results show that HAV emissions vary among differing tool insert sizes, albeit 'regular' patterns of variance were not found. Larger insert sizes did tend to emit larger vibration emissions; and this coupled with increased operator time exposure (per unit of work done) with such inserts represented a greater HAV risk. These characteristics, combined with observed emission variance among similar tools of different weights and working upon different materials, help provide construction managers with a broader pool of data with which quantitative HAV exposure assessments may be carried out.

J	Li, XY; Li, H; Skitmore, M; Wang, F				Li, Xiaoying; Li, Heng; Skitmore, Martin; Wang, Fan			Understanding the influence of safety climate and productivity pressure on non-helmet use behavior at construction sites: a case study	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Safety climate; System dynamics; Helmet use practices; Productivity pressure; Construction project		Purpose - Neglecting to wear a safety helmet can result in serious injuries at construction sites, but the cause of such unsafe behavior has not been fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a means of systematically understanding on the causes of non-helmet use behaviors at construction sites. Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilizes the system dynamics (SD) modeling to portray the construction system works at project, management and individual levels to understand the relative importance of safety climate and productivity pressures. A real-time helmet use behavior tracking system (the Eye on Project (EOP)) is developed to provide an objective record of helmet use practices. Using the data collected from the EOP, the proposed SD model can be calibrated to simulate the influence of safety climate and productivity pressures on the non-helmet use behaviors of construction workers. Findings - The data collected from 91 responses through the questionnaire survey were utilized to develop the SD model, which consists of two balancing loops and two reinforced loops. The mean absolute percentage error is further used to evaluate the model. The results show that a positive safety climate significantly reduced the rate of non-helmet use behavior. Originality/value - This study divided the primary contributors of non-helmet use behavior into three levels for the SD model development. The SD model can be used to develop policies for mitigating helmet misuse, which in turn improves the safety performance of construction sites.

An Integrated Productivity-Practices Implementation Index for Planning the Execution of Infrastructure Projects	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Labor productivity; Project performance; Best practices; Infrastructure projects; Project planning; Implementation index	CONSTRUCTION LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; BENCHMARKING; INDUSTRY; WORKERS; DRIVERS	Productivity and project performance can be improved through implementing best practices. This paper describes the development of a best productivity practices implementation index (BPPII) for infrastructure projects. The index is a checklist of practices that are considered to have a positive influence on labor productivity at the project level for infrastructure projects. These practices have been grouped together into a formalized set of categories, sections, and elements. Each practice and its planning and implementation levels were defined and assigned a relative weight on the basis of its importance in affecting labor productivity. The productivity factor (PF), defined as a ratio of estimated productivity and actual productivity, was used as a metric to collect information about labor productivity to validate the accuracy of the BPPII for infrastructure projects. Data were collected for infrastructure projects in regards to their planning and implementation level of practices in addition to their PF and project schedule performance. The statistical tests confirmed that the higher implementation of best practices as defined in the index have a strong positive relationship with the PF and project schedule performance. Projects that have a high level of implementation of practices experienced better productivity and schedule performance than those having low implementation. This research contributes new insight into the relationships between sets of practices and project performance as well as a tool for planning practice implementation on infrastructure projects.

J	Kim, J; Hwang, J; Chi, S; Seo, J				Kim, Jinwoo; Hwang, Jeongbin; Chi, Seokho; Seo, JoonOh			Towards database-free vision-based monitoring on construction sites: A deep active learning approach	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction site; Vision-based monitoring; Database-free; Active learning; Deep learning; Object detection	ACTION RECOGNITION; EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS; SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS; WORKERS ACTIVITIES; EQUIPMENT; RESOURCES; FEATURES; FALLS	In order to achieve database-free (DB-free) vision-based monitoring on construction sites, this paper proposes a deep active learning approach that automatically evaluates the uncertainty of unlabeled training data, selects the most meaningful-to-learn instances, and eventually trains a deep learning model with the selected data. The proposed approach thus involves three sequential processes: (1) uncertainty evaluation of unlabeled data, (2) training data sampling and user-interactive labeling, and (3) model design and training. Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method and confirm the positive effects of active learning: one experiment with active learning and the other without active learning (i.e., with random learning). In the experiments, the research team used a total of 17,000 images collected from actual construction sites. To achieve 80% mean Average Precision (mAP) for construction object detection, the random learning method required 720 training images, whereas only 180 images were sufficient when exploiting active learning. Moreover, the active learning could build a deep learning model with the mAP of 93.0%, while that of the random learning approach was limited to 89.1%. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method and highlight the considerable positive impacts of uncertainty-based data sampling on the model's performance. This research can improve the practicality of vision-based monitoring on construction sites, and the findings of this study can provide valuable insights and new research directions for construction researchers.

J	Kim, K; Cho, Y; Zhang, SJ				Kim, Kyungki; Cho, Yong; Zhang, Sijie			Integrating work sequences and temporary structures into safety planning: Automated scaffolding-related safety hazard identification and prevention in BIM	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Safety; BIM; Scaffolding; Temporary structures; Construction planning	CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; MODELS	Construction remains as a hazardous industry that can expose construction workers to fatal accidents and illnesses. With recent advances in BIM technology, project information in BIM can be analyzed in the early design and planning stages to address potential safety issues. However, despite the impact on safety and productivity of the entire construction project, temporary structures, such as formwork and scaffolds, are often omitted from drawings or BIM. In practice, it is challenging to consider temporary structures in current manual jobsite safety analysis which is time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, in construction plans, potential safety hazards related to temporary structures are unknowingly created which need to be identified and prevented during the construction phases. Focusing on scaffolds, this research integrates temporary structures into automated safety checking approach using BIM. A safety planning platform was created to simulate and visualize spatial movements of work crews using scaffolding. Computational algorithms in the platform automatically identify safety hazards related to activities working on scaffolding and preventive measures can be prepared before the construction begins. The algorithms were implemented in a commercially available BIM software as a plug-in and validated with a real-world construction project The results show that the algorithms could identify safety hazards that were not noticed by project managers participating in the case study project The simulated results are visualized in the developed safety planning platform to potentially facilitate early safety communications.

J	Baniassadi, F; Alvanchi, A; Mostafavi, A				Baniassadi, Farshid; Alvanchi, Amin; Mostafavi, Ali			A simulation-based framework for concurrent safety and productivity improvement in construction projects	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; Simulation; Construction planning; Construction safety	BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Purpose Safety and productivity are key concerns in the construction projects. While safety looks to the construction workers need to work in a safe environment, productivity affects the project's profitability and is of a paramount importance from the project owner's view. The different perspective to the safety and productivity from these two major players in construction projects poses a potential for the conflict between the two. This problem can be fundamentally addressed by methods concurrently improving project safety and productivity. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach To this aim, a discrete event simulation (DES) based framework applicable was proposed for complex and hazardous operations. The utility of the framework was tested using a case study of an eight-story residential building in the north-east part of Tehran, Iran. The excavation and stabilization operation was identified as the most hazardous and critical operation in this case. The framework could improve safety and productivity of this operation by 38 and 4 percent, respectively. Findings This framework is a complement to the conventional construction project safety and productivity planning methods. Its main application is in complex and hazardous construction operations. Originality/value For the first time, a comprehensive framework for concurrently improving safety and productivity of an entire project was proposed in this research. DES was used as the main modeling tool in the framework to provide an ex-ante evaluation foundation applicable to a wide range of construction projects.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and define the concept of the digital skin of the future smart construction site. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides a systematic and hierarchical classification of 114 articles from both industry and academia on the digital skin concept and evaluates them. The hierarchical classification is based on application areas relevant to construction, such as augmented reality, building information model-based visualisation, labour tracking, supply chain tracking, safety management, mobile equipment tracking and schedule and progress monitoring. Evaluations of the research papers were conducted based on three pillars: validation of technological feasibility, onsite application and user acceptance testing. Findings Technologies learned about in the literature review enabled the envisaging of the pervasive construction site of the future. The paper presents scenarios for the future context-aware construction site, including the construction worker, construction procurement management and future real-time safety management systems. Originality/value Based on the gaps identified by the review in the body of knowledge and on a broader analysis of technology diffusion, the paper highlights the research challenges to be overcome in the advent of digital skin. The paper recommends that researchers follow a coherent process for smart technology design, development and implementation in order to achieve this vision for the construction industry.

J	Kang, Y				Kang, Youngcheol			Use of Fall Protection in the US Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fall accident; Fall protection; Fall height; Injury class; Safety	SAFETY PERFORMANCE; FATALITIES; WORKERS; ROOFS; PATTERNS; OSHA	The lack of fall protection has been the most frequently cited Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard in the US construction industry. This article investigates the use of fall protection in the US construction industry over the past two decades. Using fall accidents data between 1997 and 2012 from the OSHA Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), the use of fall protection, categorized into three classes (correct use, misuse, and no fall protection), was studied with regard to industry sector, project cost, fall cause, injury class, and fall height. Inferential statistics, such as chi-square and the Kruskal-Wallis test, and frequency analyses were conducted. The data analyses revealed that more than 70% of fall accident victims lacked fall protection. Over time, the portion of victims lacking fall protection has decreased, but the portion of victims using fall protection incorrectly has increased. Regarding the relationship between fall protection use and injury class, it was found that fall protection contributes to mitigating injuries, and the association between fall protection use and injury class is statistically significant. Also, this study found a statistically significant correlation between height and fall protection use, meaning that laborers working in higher places tend to use fall protection more often. Few studies on the use of fall protection have made use of the comprehensive OSHA IMIS database. This study's findings contribute to specifying strategies to promote the proper use of fall protection in the construction industry.

While some industries have successfully utilized WSDs, such as smart personal protective equipment (PPE), to track data related to health, fitness, or even location, the construction industry has been relatively slow in implementing WSDs. Although some progress is expected, construction management research is yet to provide clear evidence of the impact of WSDs on vital project and organizational performance metrics such as safety and productivity. To fill this gap, the present study established the first WSD success model using multiple complementary frameworks and theories. The success model comprises individual adoption factors that influence individual WSD use and highlights implementation success indicators needed to evaluate adoption success. It was tested using survey questionnaires retrieved from 415 users of WSDs in the United States. Test results indicate the success model was a good fit. Moreover, findings suggest a strong positive relationship between the use of WSDs and individual performance, and project performance. This hybrid model provided critical insights on the impact of WSDs on workers' performance, project metrics, as well as essential information for supporting the increased adoption of WSDs. It is believed that this framework will also guide construction practitioners in the effective integration of WSDs into their work processes.

J	Jung, M; Chi, S				Jung, Minhyuk; Chi, Seokho			Human activity classification based on sound recognition and residual convolutional neural network	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Human activity recognition; Sound recognition; Residual neural network; Convolutional neural network		Human activity recognition is crucial for a better understanding of workers in construction sites and people in the built environment. Previous studies have been proposed various ways in which sensing and machine learning techniques can be utilized to collect human activity data automatically. Sound recognition has the potential to be utilized in ways that complement the limitations of the previous methods because sound signals are easy to propagate in indoor environments where many physical obstacles exist, and this method can simultaneously recognize not only sounds from human activities but also sounds from related objects. Therefore, this study develops a sound recognition-based human activity classification model using a residual neural network. A sound data is collected based on ten classes representing people's daily activities in the indoor environment. Then, the features of the sound data were extracted using the Log Mel-filter bank energies method, and a residual neural network model with 34 convolutional layers was trained using the data. The results showed the following: the accuracy of the model was 87.6%, and the Precision score for each class ranged from 76.8% to 92.6%, the Recall scores ranged from 75.8% to 98.6%, and the F1 -score ranged from 78.6% to 93.7%. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate that sound recognition can classify people's indoor activities successfully, but this study leaves the limitation that it is based on a monophonic method that only one activity can be classified at a time.

J	Awolusi, IG; Marks, ED				Awolusi, Ibukun G.; Marks, Eric D.			Safety Activity Analysis Framework to Evaluate Safety Performance in Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Activity observation; Construction safety; Performance evaluation; Performance measurement; Safety activity analysis framework; Labor and personnel issues	BEHAVIOR-BASED SAFETY; CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; LEADING INDICATORS; CLIMATE; RISK; IMPROVEMENT; VALIDITY; CULTURE	The construction work environment remains one of the most hazardous worldwide. As a result of dangerous working environments, construction workers often face safety and health risks throughout the construction process. However, an emphasis on construction safety has increased mainly in the aspect of safety performance, and efforts are required to not only monitor but also seek to improve safety performance. This research develops a safety activity analysis framework and tool to facilitate the collection and analysis of the safety activity data for continuous evaluation of safety performance. A case study is also carried out on an active construction project to implement and validate the framework and tool. The findings of the case study show that the safety index of the construction site increased from 37.0 to 62.8% and was in consonance with the actual site records of the project's total recordable incident rate, which decreased from 7.11 to 1.42. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a methodical and operational safety activity analysis framework that can be used to proactively monitor safety performance, set improvement targets, and provide continuous feedback to enhance safety performance on construction sites. This research also provides a safety activity analysis tool that is a management information system that transforms a laborious and ineffective manual method of collecting and analyzing safety data into a more functional computer-based approach.

The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long "lookahead" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights - through various construction scenarios into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle.

J	Choe, S; Leite, F				Choe, Sooyoung; Leite, Fernanda			Construction safety planning: Site-specific temporal and spatial information integration	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety planning; Safety risk; 4D BIM; Temporal and spatial information	MODEL; MANAGEMENT; HAZARDS	The Occupational Safety and Health Act was established in 1970. Since then, various injury prevention strategies have been developed and resulted in measurable improvements in construction safety management. However, the last decade has seen a deceleration in construction safety improvements, which may be due to the dynamic nature of construction jobsites. Traditional safety planning approaches rely primarily on static information, tacit knowledge, regulations, company safety policies, and 2-dimensional (2D) drawings. As a result, site-specific dynamic information, temporal (e.g. when and who will be exposed to potential hazards) and spatial (e.g. location of dangerous zones) information are currently not specifically addressed. This paper presents a formalized 4-dimensional (4D) construction safety planning process that addresses site-specific temporal and spatial safety information integration. The authors integrated safety data, which includes general safety knowledge, site-specific temporal and spatial information, from a project schedule and a 3-dimensional (3D) model. The authors conducted a case study to test and verify the proposed safety planning process. Findings show that risky activities, days, and zones can be prioritized when project schedule contains activity information regarding number of workers including occupation types and zoning plan. In addition, activity safety risk can be visualized when a 3D model is integrated. The proposed safety planning approach is expected to provide safety personnel with a proactive and site-specific safety planning tool that can be used to better manage jobsite safety. In addition, visual safety materials can enhance safety communication among project participants.

J	Zolfagharian, S; Irizarry, J				Zolfagharian, Samaneh; Irizarry, Javier			Constructability Assessment Model for Commercial Building Designs in the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Constructability; Design; Quantitative; Commercial building projects; Project planning and design	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS	At the early design stage of construction projects, designers often rely on rules of thumb to make critical decisions about the geometry, construction systems, and materials of their designs without evaluating construction requirements and constraints. The ease of building, or constructability, is a critical factor that should be examined at the early stage of construction projects when the design is the most amenable to change. The motivation for this study is the current demand for skilled workers and the lack of a quantitative constructability model for commercial construction projects in the United States. To meet these needs, this paper investigates constructability factors and their relative importance in the selection of the most constructible building systems using a multicriteria technique, the analytic hierarchy process. Through a comprehensive literature review, 79 constructability attributes are identified, and based on 298 responses received from a questionnaire survey, the attributes are categorized into six factors. Then using pairwise comparisons between constructability factors and common building systems in the United States, knowledge from construction experts is obtained and a constructability assessment model is developed. The main contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is to develop constructability indexes for building components and their construction systems and to formulate a model for measuring the constructability of commercial building designs. Using the proposed constructability assessment model, designers can identify the trade-offs between the constructability of their design alternatives and make informed decisions.

J	Jarkas, AM; Radosavljevic, M				Jarkas, Abdulaziz M.; Radosavljevic, Milan			Motivational Factors Impacting the Productivity of Construction Master Craftsmen in Kuwait	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Motivation; Master craftsmen; Operatives; Performance; Productivity; Efficiency; Construction trades; State of Kuwait	LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; WORKERS	In today's global economic conditions, improving the productivity of the construction industry is becoming more pressing than ever. Several factors impact the efficiency of construction operatives, but motivation is among the most important. Since low productivity is one of the significant challenges facing the construction industry in the State of Kuwait, the objective of this case study is to identify, explore, and rank the relative importance of the factors perceived to impact the motivational level of master craftsmen involved in primary construction trades. To achieve this objective, a structured questionnaire survey comprising 23 factors, which were shortlisted based on relevant previous research on motivation, the input of local industry experts, and numerous interviews with skilled operatives, was distributed to a large number of master craftsmen. Using a relative importance index technique, the following prominent factors are identified: (1)payment delay; (2)rework; (3)lack of a financial incentive scheme; (4)the extent of change orders during execution; (5)incompetent supervisors; (6)delays in responding to requests for information (RFI); (7)overcrowding and operatives interface; (8)unrealistic scheduling and performance expectation; (9)shortage of materials on site; and (10)quality level of drawings. The findings can be used to provide industry practitioners with guidance for focusing, acting upon, and controlling the critical factors influencing the performance of master craftsmen, hence, assist in achieving an efficient utilization of the workforce, and a reasonable level of competitiveness and a cost-effective operation.

J	Said, H				Said, Hisham			Modeling and Likelihood Prediction of Prefabrication Feasibility for Electrical Construction Firms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction materials and method		Electrical contracting firms have consistently pursued industrializing their business through the implementation of prefabrication, lean production, and supply chain integration. Despite the pioneering prefabrication efforts of electrical contractors, there is still no clear understanding of the determinants of electrical prefabrication feasibility in terms of supply chain collaboration and surrounding industry requirements. Accordingly, this paper presents the development of prediction models of prefabrication feasibility for electrical contractors. The research tasks of this study were performed in three main phases. The first phase included various data collection tasks, including conducting semistructured interviews, providing an online questionnaire, and obtaining relevant local economic data of the respondents' metropolitan areas. The second phase involved the utilization of the collected questionnaire responses and economic data to develop logistic regression models that relate the prefabrication feasibility to its statistically significant determinants. The third phase involved validating the developed models by assessing their prediction accuracy and performing extensive sensitivity analysis of their determinants. The findings of this study should prove useful to electrical contractors who need to obtain data-driven assessment of prefabrication feasibility considering their business attributes and surrounding industry parameters. This study presents the two main contributions to the study field of construction prefabrication. First, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on four industry-related determinants: regional economic growth, industry competition, labor cost rate, and worker union resistance. Second, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on two main internal firm-related determinants: building information modeling capability and supply coordination with vendors.

Motion Data-Driven Biomechanical Analysis during Construction Tasks on Sites	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Work-related musculoskeletal disorders; Biomechanical analysis; Motion data	LOW-BACK; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; WORK; STRATEGIES; CAPTURE; DESIGN; STOOP; MODEL; SQUAT; EXPOSURE	Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are one of the major health issues that workers frequently experience due to awkward postures or forceful exertions during construction tasks. Among available job analysis methods, biomechanical models have been widely applied to assess musculoskeletal risks that may contribute to the development of WMSDs based on motion data during occupational tasks. Recently, with the advent of vision-based motion capture approaches, it has become possible to collect the motion data required for biomechanical analysis under real conditions. However, vision-based motion capture approaches have not been applied to biomechanical analysis because of compatibility issues in body models of the motion data and computerized biomechanical analysis tools. To address this issue, automated data processing is focused on to convert motion data into available data in existing biomechanical analysis tools, given the BVH motion data from vision-based approaches. To examine the feasibility of the proposed motion data processing, an experiment for both static and dynamic biomechanical analyses was conducted on lifting tasks. The results indicate that vision-based motion capture data-converted as proposed in this paper-can provide a sufficient level of detail on human kinematics to conduct biomechanical analysis, thus allowing for the identification of particular body parts where excessive forces are placed during tasks. The issues and directions of future research are also discussed to perform on-site biomechanical analysis during construction tasks. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Resilience has been proposed as an important asset for trades and semi-skilled women to manage work hazards and retain work focus. An explanatory sequential research design incorporating survey and interview data was used to explore the resilience of women. One hundred and sixty-eight Australian trades and semi-skilled women completed the Employee Resilience Scale and forty-three of these participants were interviewed. Survey results indicate that participants had a high level of employee resilience, suggesting a strong ability to adapt and succeed in a challenging work environment. Thematic analysis of the interview data identified that resilience is considered as a mandatory capability by women working onsite to manage gendered workplace hazards and attain career success. The findings indicate that these women had high levels of resilience despite little to no support from their workplace. Given its importance, it is recommended that resilience development be included in apprenticeship programs to support retention and career success for tradeswomen. Developing the resilience of semi-skilled women requires more consideration from the industry given their precarious employment status and career pathway. More broadly, the results reiterate that more needs to be done to provide a safe working environment for women working onsite. Rather than relying on women to navigate hostile workplaces, construction employers must protect the safety and health of all workers irrespective of gender.

The construction industry can potentially benefit from this machine intelligence by linking algorithms with construction videos to automatically analyze productivity and monitor activities from a safety perspective. However, an effective image data set of construction machines for training deep learning object detection algorithms is not currently available due to the limited accessibility of construction images, the time-and-labor-intensiveness of manual annotations, and the knowledge base required in terms of both construction and deep learning. This research presents a case study on developing an image data set specifically for construction machines named the Alberta Construction Image Data Set (ACID). In the case of ACID, 10,000 images belonging to 10 types of construction machines are manually collected and annotated with machine types and their corresponding positions on the images. To validate the feasibility of ACID, we train the data set using four existing deep learning object detection algorithms, including YOLO-v3, Inception-SSD, R-FCN-ResNet101, and Faster-RCNN-ResNet101. The mean average precision (mAP) is 83.0% for Inception-SSD, 87.8% for YOLO-v3, 88.8% for R-FCN-ResNet101, and 89.2% for Faster-RCNN-ResNet101. The average detection speed of the four algorithms is 16.7 frames per second (fps), which satisfies the needs of most studies in the field of automation in construction.

J	Shi, YP; Xia, YM; Zhang, YM; Yao, ZW				Shi, Yupeng; Xia, Yimin; Zhang, Yumin; Yao, Zhiwei			Intelligent identification for working-cycle stages of excavator based on main pump pressure	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Excavator; Working-cycle stage; Main pump pressure; Support vector machine	EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS; ACTION RECOGNITION; CONSTRUCTION; PREDICTION; EQUIPMENT; TRACKING; FEATURES; WORKERS; SYSTEM	An identification of the working stages of the excavator is used as the basis to realize a staged energy-saving control and reduce the fuel consumption. However, existing methods based on computer vision and multi-sensor information fusion technologies have limitations in practical applications. In this paper, an intelligent identification method for the working-cycle stages of an excavator is proposed based on the relationship between the working stages and the main pump pressure waveform. Three machine learning algorithms, a support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and logistic regression (LR), were used to establish the intelligent recognition model. In addition, an intelligent calibration system was established to reduce the effects of human-induced factors and pressure fluctuations on the accuracy when using the original main pump pressure signals. The relationships among the identification accuracy, time window width, and signal sampling frequency were also studied. The results show that the library for support vector machine (LIBSVM) model outperforms the BPNN and LR, recording an accuracy of 94.64% when using the test set and an accuracy of 93.82% with an intelligent calibration system when using the original main pump pressure signals. The optimal time window width and signal sampling frequency are 0.5 s and 20 Hz, respectively. The proposed method is a practical approach to realize the real-time supervision of the working stage of an excavator, providing theoretical support for a staged energy-saving control.

Using Animated Augmented Reality to Cognitively Guide Assembly	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Augmented reality; Assembly manual; Cognitive learning curve; Working memory		Assembly is the process in which two or more objects are joined together. An assembly manual is typically used to guide the tasks required to put together an artifact. As an emerging technology, augmented reality (AR) integrates three-dimensional (3D) images of virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of digitalized information into the real workspace using AR can provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures with improved accuracy and reduce errors. A prototype animated AR system was configured for assembly tasks that are normally guided by reference to documentation and was tested using a series of experiments. A LEGO model was used as the assembly and experimental tester task. Experimentation was devised and conducted to validate the cognitive gains that can be derived from using AR to assemble a LEGO model. Two formal experiments with 50 participants were conducted to compare an animated AR system and the paper-based manual system. One experiment measured the cognitive workload of using the system for assembly, whereas the other measured the learning curves of novice assemblers. Findings from the experiments revealed that the animated AR system yielded shorter task completion times, less assembly errors, and lower total task load. The results also revealed that the learning curve of novice assemblers was reduced and task performance relevant to working memory was increased when using AR training. Future work will apply the knowledge gained from the controlled assembly experiments to the real-scale construction assembly scenario to measure the productivity improvements.

J	Calderon, WT; Roberts, D; Golparvar-Fard, M				Calderon, Wilfredo Torres; Roberts, Dominic; Golparvar-Fard, Mani			Synthesizing Pose Sequences from 3D Assets for Vision-Based Activity Analysis	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; TRACKING; WORKERS; SAFETY; EXCAVATORS; EQUIPMENT; IMAGES	In recent years, computer vision algorithms have shown to effectively leverage visual data from jobsites for video-based activity analysis of construction equipment. However, earthmoving operations are restricted to site work and surrounding terrain, and the presence of other structures, particularly in urban areas, limits the number of viewpoints from which operations can be recorded. These considerations lower the degree of intra-activity and interactivity category variability to which said algorithms are exposed, hindering their potential for generalizing effectively to new jobsites. Secondly, training computer vision algorithms is also typically reliant on large quantities of hand-annotated ground truth. These annotations are burdensome to obtain and can offset the cost-effectiveness incurred from automating activity analysis. The main contribution of this paper is a means of inexpensively generating synthetic data to improve the capabilities of vision-based activity analysis methods based on virtual, kinematically articulated three-dimensional (3D) models of construction equipment. The authors introduce an automated synthetic data generation method that outputs a two-dimensional (2D) pose corresponding to simulated excavator operations that vary according to camera position with respect to the excavator and activity length and behavior. The presented method is validated by training a deep learning-based method on the synthesized 2D pose sequences and testing on pose sequences corresponding to real-world excavator operations, achieving 75% precision and 71% recall. This exceeds the 66% precision and 65% recall obtained when training and testing the deep learning-based method on the real-world data via cross-validation. Limited access to reliable amounts of real-world data incentivizes using synthetically generated data for training vision-based activity analysis algorithms.

J	Mahamid, I				Mahamid, Ibrahim			Impact of rework on material waste in building construction projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Material waste; rework; buildings; steel reinforcement; concrete	GENERATION; INDUSTRY; COSTS	This study aims at identifying the relationship between material waste and rework in building construction projects in the northern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To elicit the views of professionals in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia about rework factors, material waste factors and the relationship between rework and material waste, 82 questionnaires were distributed and 70 were returned. The study reveals that the main rework causes on construction sites are errors and omissions, lack of labour skills, non-conformance with specification requirements, inadequate supervision, and scope changes. While the study concludes that the top causes of material waste are using untrained labours, rework due to workers' mistakes, frequent design changes, selecting the lowest bidder contractor/subcontractor, and design and construction detail errors. To develop regression models that describe the relationship between rework and material waste, data from 47 building projects were collected. The predictive models emanating from the current study indicate a significant relationship between rework and material waste on construction sites in Saudi Arabia. Equally, the nature of the relationship is directly proportional, i.e. the higher the rework cost the higher the material waste and conversely the lower the rework cost the lower material waste. Results of this study will draw attention to potential causes that contribute to material waste and rework on construction sites. It may also help construction practitioners in the derivation methods and strategies to minimize rework and material waste and hence, enable improvements of construction industry to be made. The recommendation of this study may also apply to other developing countries.

J	Alazzaz, F; Whyte, A				Alazzaz, Faisal; Whyte, Andrew			Linking employee empowerment with productivity in off-site construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Employee empowerment; Engineering management; Off-site construction productivity; Skills-base application; Sub-element fabrication; Efficiency factors	PERFORMANCE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address current knowledge gaps in off-site sub-element fabrication efficiency factors, by identifying an explicit relationship between productivity and employee empowerment. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on two engineering fabrication-yard case studies that investigate both qualitatively (via analysis of semi-structured interviews that incorporate a five-point Likert scale, with fabrication-product stakeholders), and also quantitatively (via assessment using SPSS statistical analyses to determine significance and trends in the data-set) the relationship between empowerment and productivity. Findings - The results reveal a positive linear relationship in off-site construction between "employee empowerment factors" and, explicitly fabrication-yard "productivity-levels". An especially strong and significant positive correlation is found to exist in resource development, worker involvement, process improvement, and task recognition as they refer to off-site construction productivity. Practical implications - Most academic studies of off-site construction remain largely anecdotal and lack an empirical objective study; as a result, this (fabrication-yard) case-study research provides a useful approach to measure empirically the link between employee empowerment and productivity of off-site construction. Originality/value - Employee empowerment in the construction industry has long been a focus of analyses; however, there remains a lack of consensus and very few studies into the direct relationship between employee empowerment on the one-hand, and productivity in off-site construction on the other-hand. It is argued here that the on-going new research undertaken in the present study will go beyond subjective opinion towards objective measurement of actual performance in off-site construction.

J	Cai, SY; Ma, ZL; Skibniewski, MJ; Guo, JF				Cai, Shiyao; Ma, Zhiliang; Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.; Guo, Jianfeng			Construction Automation and Robotics: From One-Offs to Follow-Ups Based on Practices of Chinese Construction Companies	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Automation and robotics; Research and development (R&D); Follow-up issue; Construction company	ADOPTION	The follow-up issue is one of the major factors that limit the application of construction automation and robotics. Specifically, many research results with fundamentally good ideas end up gathering dust on a shelf without any follow-up research and development (R&D) or applications. Nevertheless, some construction companies have successful experience in the follow-up issue. Therefore, this study presents and analyzes the processes from R&D to follow-ups of four representative Chinese construction companies that developed their own automation and robotic products and implemented them continuously. Based on the four cases, an intercase analysis was conducted, and 11 influential factors that lead to successful follow-ups were identified. To understand the identified factors effectively, they were then categorized according to an existing theoretical framework, i.e., the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, which is widely used in studies on innovation adoption. As a result, four technological factors (interdisciplinary cooperation, continuous R&D, pilot test, and technological foresight), five organizational factors (company size, human resources, development strategies, organizational structure, and management system), and two environmental factors (market demand and competitive pressure) are obtained. Suggestions are proposed for both the technology providers and adopters, such as establishing industrial alliances, training interdisciplinary personnel and skilled workers, and expanding the business scope to promote wider implementations. It is expected to be valuable for the stakeholders in many countries and regions with the need to implement construction automation and robotics because the analysis has not been confined to the practice in China.

J	Hon, CKH; Chan, APC				Hon, Carol. K. H.; Chan, Albert P. C.			Safety Management in Repair, Maintenance, Minor Alteration, and Addition Works: Knowledge Management Perspective	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety; Knowledge management; Repair and maintenance; Hong Kong	CONSTRUCTION ORGANIZATIONS; HONG-KONG	Safety of repair, maintenance, alteration, and addition (RMAA) works have long been neglected because RMAA works are often minute and only last for a short period of time. With rising importance of the RMAA sector in many developed societies, safety of RMAA works has begun to draw attention. Many RMAA contracting companies are small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that do not have comprehensive safety management systems. Existing safety legislation and regulations for new construction sites are not fully applicable to RMAA works. Instead of relying on explicit and well-established safety systems, tacit safety knowledge plays an extremely important role in RMAA projects. To improve safety of RMAA works, safety knowledge should be better managed. However, safety knowledge is difficult to capture in RMAA works. This study aims to examine safety management practices of RMAA contracting companies to see how safety knowledge of RMAA projects is managed. Findings show that RMAA contracting companies undertaking large-scale RMAA projects have more initiatives of safety management. Safety management of small-scale RMAA works relies heavily on the motivation of site supervisors and self-regulation of workers. Better tacit knowledge management improves safety performance. To enhance safety capability of RMAA contracting companies, a knowledge sharing culture should be cultivated. The government should provide assistance to SMEs to implement proper safety management practices in small-sized projects. Potentials of applying computer software technology in RMAA projects to capture, store, and retrieve safety information should be explored. Employees should be motivated to share safety knowledge by giving proper recognition to those who are willing to share. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Hon, Carol. K.

In this framework, two major approaches are often cited in the literature as having the potential to improve the practices in the industry: Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Lean Construction. Several scientific studies have demonstrated the synergy of these two approaches and very recent research has reported positive results from the use of software applications as support for their implementation on construction sites. However, the stakes of such integration have been very little studied. This article presents the results of a research project conducted within a general contractor firm that decided to implement BIM and Last Planner System (LPS) on its construction sites. The research uses a four-stage action research approach, including the characterization of the research issue, the establishment of an action plan, its implementation and its evaluation. Compared to recent related studies, the research is less enthusiastic. While it highlights the need for new tools to improve production planning and control, it also points to a strong resistance to change by practitioners at the site. They emphasize the necessity for adequate pre-service training and the need for new resources that can work full-time on the ongoing training of site teams. In addition, some limitations of the tool lead workers to believe that it can quickly become a factor that slows down their daily work rather than improving it. Based on the advice of professionals, the paper formulates some recommendations to the industry, the researchers and the software developers.

Operating an oil and gas facility is a process where workers refer to technical specifications to obtain the right information, identify the components, and then make a decision as to the adjustment or correctness. This entire process is iterative and triggers a learning process which may lead to improved proficiency as the cycle is repeated. The inability to find the right information or sequence within a cycle can contribute to efficiency losses. Jobsite training offered by qualified organisations and associations for the oil and gas industry is very limited, and the relevant training facilities and centres that have been established or considered in the construction agenda are far from sufficient to the growing standard of operators and industry expansion. This paper, underpinned by advanced innovative visualisation technologies, proposes a framework to improve efficiency and expedite the process of developing the complex procedural skills in operating and maintaining oil and gas facilities, through identifying scientific principles of enabling complex procedural learning approaches, developing proficiency-based learning approaches and corresponding learning curricula, and appraising learning outcomes according to developed skillset taxonomy. The proposed framework is tested under the development of an innovative and immersive Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality training system, which reveals significantly pragmatic benefits in terms of boosting up workforce productivity while bringing down rework. It is also demonstrated that embedding paradigms of transformative learning process while pedagogically adopting Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in curricula development and assessment regimes can help the sector significantly improve workforce safety.

Use of GIS and Topology in the Identification and Resolution of Space Conflicts	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction management; GIS; Project management; Workspace	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; MULTISTORY BUILDINGS; SITE LAYOUT; WORK SPACE; MODELS; VISUALIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; OPERATIONS; SCHEDULE	Construction activities need space on the jobsite for their execution. Workers, equipment, materials, temporary facilities, and the developing structure share the limited jobsite space during the construction period. Multiple types of spaces for different purposes on various locations are required to execute various activities at different times. Hence, space planning helps provide a safe and productive environment. Planners mentally link two-dimensional (2D) drawings and execution schedules to generate dynamic multiple types of space requirements, which is a complex task. Therefore, researchers suggest the use of four-dimensional (4D) modeling and building information modeling (BIM) for space planning. Both simulate the construction process by linking the execution schedule with a three-dimensional (3D) model to visualize the construction sequence in space planning. However, both still lack features such as topography modeling and geospatial analysis, which affect space planning. In this work, 4D geographic information systems (GIS) were used for space planning that facilitates topographic modeling, different types of geospatial analyses, and database management. GIS was also used to generate multiple types of spaces corresponding to various activities. A feature attribute table (FAT) associated with each space describes when, where, and how long that space will be required on the jobsite. GIS-based area topology was implemented through a set of validation rules that define how working areas have to share the jobsite. A GIS-based methodology that enables space planning, time-space conflict identification, and conflict resolution prior to the construction was developed and implemented.

J	Kim, J; Chi, S; Seo, J				Kim, Jinwoo; Chi, Seokho; Seo, Jongwon			Interaction analysis for vision-based activity identification of earthmoving excavators and dump trucks	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Vision-based; Activity identification; Interaction; Earthmoving operatrion; Excavator; Dump truck	CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT; ORIENTED GRADIENTS; ACTION RECOGNITION; TRACKING; WORKERS; HISTOGRAMS; SENSORS; FUSION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Activity identification is an essential step to measure and monitor the performance of earthmoving operations. Many vision-based methods that automatically capture and explain activity information from image data have been developed with economic advantages and analysis efficiency. However, the previous methods failed to consider the interactive operations among equipment, and thus limited the applicability to the operation time estimation for productivity analysis. To address the drawback, this research developed a vision-based activity identification framework that incorporates interactive aspects of earthmoving equipment's operation. This framework included four main processes: equipment tracking, action recognition of individual equipment, interaction analysis, and post-processing. The interactions between excavators and dump trucks were examined due to its significant impacts on earthmoving operations. TLD (Tracking-Learning-Detection) was adapted to track the heavy equipment. Spatio-temporal reasoning and image differencing techniques were then implemented to categorize individual actions. Third, interactions were interpreted based on a knowledge-based system that evaluates equipment actions and proximity between operating equipment. Lastly, outliers or noisy results were filtered out considering work continuity. To validate the proposed framework, two experiments were performed: one with the interaction analysis and the other without the analysis. 11,513 image frames from actual earth moving sites in total were tested. The consequent average precision of activity analysis was enhanced from 75.68% to 91.27% after the interaction analysis was applied. In conclusion, this research contributes to identifying critical elements that explain interactive operations, characterize the vision-based activity identification framework, and improve the applicability of the vision-based method for the automated equipment operations analysis.

J	Kim, J; Chi, S				Kim, Jinwoo; Chi, Seokho			Adaptive Detector and Tracker on Construction Sites Using Functional Integration and Online Learning	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tracking; Vision-based; Detection; Functional integration; Online learning	ORIENTED GRADIENTS; IDENTIFICATION; EQUIPMENT; HISTOGRAMS; WORKERS; MODEL	Tracking construction equipment is a major task when monitoring work in progress and performance on construction sites. Real-time location data of heavy equipment can be used not only to prevent collision accidents but also to predict work types and idle time. Many researchers have investigated the two-dimensional (2D) tracking of construction equipment from images. However, this method still frequently fails to track construction equipment in the long term due to the high interclass/intraclass variations of construction equipment and sites. In order to overcome this problem, this paper adapts and customizes a tracking method composed of two main concepts for (1) functional integration of a detector and a tracker and (2) real-time online learning using an automatically developed training database on site. The functional integration is first used to solve retracking issues and provide information used for database development. On the other hand, the online learning focuses on the use of a detector, which utilizes a site-customized database that is developed and updated automatically in real time. Validation was conducted using video stream data collected from four different construction sites. The average precision, recall rates, and data sampling accuracy were 86.53, 86.21, and 79.35%, respectively. The eigenvalues were also calculated as 0.66 and 0.39. The experiment results show the proposed method is able to consider the diverse characteristics of construction equipment and sites with promising performance. The contribution of this study is to improve performance and applicability of the functional integration and online learning for enhancing site awareness in the construction domain.

J	Cicmil, S; O'Laocha, E				Cicmil, Svetlana; O'Laocha, Eamonn			The logic of projects and the ideal of community development Social good, participation and the ethics of knowing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Projectification; Co-creation; Community development; Critical participatory perspective; Social good	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DISCOURSE; WORK	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between project-based organizing and the initiatives labelled as "development" by critically engaging with some unchallenged assumptions inherent in the notion of both projects as a means through which social change can be achieved and the wider possibility of delivering social good as an objective of development. Design/methodology/approach - From a phenomenologically informed critical participatory perspective the authors focus on contradictions within the practices of community development (CD) by attending to the interplay between the dominant project form of organizing that frames those practices and the rhetoric of "development". Findings - Drawing on two CD examples, the authors illustrate and discuss the contradictions and damaging consequences of the developmentalism-projectification double-act. The position is that social good is local and contextual and draws expediently and contingently on the means through which it can be achieved by the collective action of those who co-define and co-create the social good. Social implications - The authors propose that there is a need to open the dialogue with development practitioners, funders, project managers, project workers, and the recipients and stimulate multiple participation. Originality/value - The authors believe the critical participatory approach that the authors have taken to CD project management could be both novel and useful as it refocuses attention to non-performative aspects of CD, arguing for de-naturalization of project organizing logic and encouraging emancipation from dominant epistemic inequalities. With an uncompromising focus on embedded practices, the authors hope to spur further debate on the important issue of CD and the possibilities of creating "social good".

Design/methodology/approach Based on the 2-4 Model, a framework of the ACM-HC was constructed, and the accident causal factors (CF) were extracted from four aspects of human, material, environment and management. In addition, association rule mining (ARM) was introduced to analyze accident investigation reports to obtain the interrelationships between the factors. Based on the framework, factors and ARM results, the ACM-HC was established. Finally, the ACM-HC was verified with a tunnel collapse accident. Findings Both the external and internal causes of contractor cause accidents. The flaws of safety management of other stakeholders are external causes. In terms of the internal causes, there are four stages: direct causes, indirect causes, radical causes and root causes. More specifically, the direct causes refer to the unsafe acts and the unsafe conditions; ineffective safety supervision and poor individual factors of frontline workers constitute the indirect causes; the radical causes lie in the flaws of construction procedures and technical schemes; the root causes are related to the poor individual factors of decision makers and managers. Originality/value The ACM-HC expresses the causes, sequence and mechanism of highway construction accidents in a visual way. In addition, this study describes a process of using a qualitative-quantitative hybrid approach to establish a modified ACM, which provides a different perspective for the establishment of an ACM.

Teaching robots to perform quasi-repetitive construction tasks through human demonstration	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Robot learning from demonstration; Visual demonstration; Autoencoder; Reinforcement learning; Digital twin; Ceiling tile installation; Robot apprentice	MANIPULATION; AUTOMATION; IMITATION; INSTALLATION; CALIBRATION; SYSTEM; SAFETY; DUTY	Robots can assist workers in performing physically-demanding construction tasks, which are typically quasi repetitive, wherein the geometry of the workspace is dissimilar despite similar tasks. As a result, robots must determine motion trajectories based on the encountered workspace geometry. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods have the potential to be used in teaching robots specific tasks through human demonstration, such that robots can then perform learned tasks under different conditions. In this paper, the LfD method is investigated to teach robots how to perform quasi-repetitive construction tasks. Considering ceiling tile installation as the experimental process, the tasks of maneuvering and positioning tiles in a ceiling grid are defined as the target knowledge to be learned. Using a set of human demonstration videos, the designed approach first translates the physical work context, e.g., the pose of the tile, to the target digital twin, i.e., the workspace as perceived by the robot. The Reinforcement Learning method is then applied to generate the control policy for the robot to perform the subsequent tasks. The proposed method is evaluated in the Robot Operating System (ROS) Gazebo simulator using a KUKA mobile industrial robotic arm emulator and 60 different scenes as test cases. The results show a 78% success rate in installing ceiling tiles based on 3000 virtual and 85 real demonstration videos. The success rate tends to continually rise with an increase in the number of real demonstration videos, confirming the promise and applicability of the LfD method in teaching robot apprentices to perform quasi -repetitive tasks on construction sites.

J	Deng, F; Liu, GW; Jin, ZG				Deng, Fei; Liu, Guiwen; Jin, Zhigang			Factors Formulating the Competitiveness of the Chinese Construction Industry: Empirical Investigation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						China; Construction industry; Competitiveness; Competition; Porter's diamond model	CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS; PROJECT PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS; CONTRACTORS; STRATEGIES	The competitiveness of the construction industry is significantly affected by various factors, such as abundant manpower, integrated performance of supporting industries, and government support. The construction industry in developing countries is less competitive than its counterparts in the international construction market, and causes of this situation are multifaceted. Nation-related characteristics should be taken into account to produce competitive strategies for a specific construction industry, and this also leads to the situation that factors differ between countries, especially between developing and developed countries. Porter's diamond model is adopted to develop potential factors formulating the competitiveness of the construction industry, and 34 factors are identified within the Chinese constriction industry (CCI). In order to get empirical findings, a questionnaire survey is managed to investigate the significance of these factors, and factor analysis is also applied. Factor analysis further reveals six underlying factors: stable home market (F-I), supply chain management (F-II), corporate management practices (F-III), qualified professionals (F-IV), satisfactory business environment (F-V), and migrant workers (F-VI). The study provides insights in finding key areas that formulate the competitiveness of the CCI, as well as valuable implications for other countries. These research results provide some practical implications for practiced professionals and policy-makers to emphasize these critical aspects that determine the competitiveness of the industry, e.g.,creating a dynamic and advanced domestic market. However, as the market context and institutional environment vary significantly among different countries, similar studies in different construction industries would enrich the understanding of the competitiveness of the construction industry generally.

However, it has been found that using off-the-self augmented reality (AR) devices, such as goggles or helmets, could potentially cause more health, safety, and efficiency concerns in complex real-world construction projects, due to the restricted field of view and the non-negligible weight of those devices. To address these issues, we propose a mobile projective AR (MPAR) framework in which the AR device is detached from human workers and carried by one or more mobile collaborative robots (co-robots). MPAR achieves glassless AR that is visible to the naked eye using a camera-projector system to superimpose virtual 3D information onto planar or non-planar physical surfaces. Since co-robots often need to move during the operation, we design algorithms to ensure consistent mobile projection with two major components: projector pose estimation and projection image generation. For planar surfaces, MPAR is achieved by a homography-based pose estimation and image warping. For non-planar surfaces, MPAR uses iterative closest point (ICP) for pose estimation and common graphics pipelines to generate projection images. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the feasibility of MPAR in a laboratory setting, by projecting 1) as-planned building information onto a planar surface, and 2) as-built 3D information onto a piece-wise planar surface. Our evaluation demonstrated centimeter-level projection accuracy of MPAR from different distances and angles to the two types of surfaces.

J	Oke, AE				Oke, Ayodeji Emmanuel			Bonding capability of Nigerian contracting firms	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk management; Guarantee; Bond; Contracting firm; Project stakeholder	CONSTRUCTION; IMPACT	Purpose The ability of construction contractors to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors depends on capital, experience, capacity and continuity. Using these criteria, the purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the bonding capacity of Nigerian contractors. Design/methodology/approach Factors required for bonding were examined based on a set of questions addressed to managers of contracting firms and personnel involved in issuing bonds and guarantees in commercial banks and insurance companies. The scorecard approach was employed to determine the bonding capability of the contractors. Findings Contractors' financial strength and past performance on previous projects are the two important factors considered by guarantors in granting bond to contractors. However, the condition surrounding the bond, the legal capacity of the guarantor to issue bond and the identity of the guarantor are mostly considered by contractors in approaching a potential guarantor. Using the scorecard approach, about one-third of contractors have the necessary requirements to engage in construction bond agreement with guarantors. This ability of contractors is affected by years of experience of the firm but not by their location nor years of experience of their manager. Practical implications It is necessary for contracting firms to increase their capital base through merging, borrowing, etc., and also engage experienced professionals and workers in the execution of construction projects, as this will eventually improve their bonding ability. Social implications The study is limited to construction contractors registered with Ondo and Lagos State Governments and guarantors that are banks and insurance companies in Nigeria. Originality/value The paper specified various areas of concerns for Nigerian contracting firms in their bid to enhance their bonding ability. This will help them in overcoming various challenges and bottlenecks that may arise in securing bonds and guarantees from guarantors.

J	Chen, YT; McCabe, B; Hyatt, D				Chen, Yuting; McCabe, Brenda; Hyatt, Douglas			Relationship between Individual Resilience, Interpersonal Conflicts at Work, and Safety Outcomes of Construction Workers	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Interpersonal conflict; Safety performance; Individual resilience; Job stress; Construction industry; Labor and personnel issues	HEALTH OUTCOMES; MODERATING ROLE; JOB STRESSORS; FIT INDEXES; WORKPLACE; BEHAVIORS; PREDICTORS; DIMENSIONALITY; WORKHOURS; INJURIES	Interpersonal conflicts at work (ICW) have been widely regarded as a job stressor; however, it is rarely linked to physical safety outcomes. The ICW primarily has two forms on a construction site: conflicts with supervisors (ICWS) and conflicts with coworkers (ICWC). This study examined the occurrences of ICWS and ICWC on construction sites, and investigated the relationship among ICWS, ICWS, and physical safety outcomes together with job stress. In addition, possible antecedents of ICWS and ICWC including workhours, mobility, and individual resilience were also examined. The research was based on 837 surveys collected from more than 100 construction sites in Ontario, Canada between July 2015 and July 2016. Structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were used to test the hypothesized relationships. This paper leads to the following conclusions. Although ICW was reported as quite often or very often by only 6.3% of respondents, it had a significant effect on both physical safety outcomes, including physical injuries and unsafe events, and job stress. Individual resilience (IR) had a significant negative correlation with both ICWS and ICWC, which in turn could decrease the frequency of physical safety outcomes and job stress. The contributions of this study are that safety professionals may consider adding coping skill training safety programs to improve the individual resilience of their workforce and reduce conflict-related safety outcomes.

Quantifying Hazard Exposure Using Real-Time Location Data of Construction Workforce and Equipment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Risk assessment; Quantitative hazard exposure; Proximity warning systems; Real-time location; Labor and personnel issues	PROXIMITY WARNING SYSTEM; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; SURFACE	Traditional risk-assessment methods typically evaluate accident probability, exposure frequency or duration, and consequence severity, respectively, and finally determine a quantitative risk score or a qualitative risk level. The assessment process is prospective and subjective. Changing and complex construction situations impede their practical and efficient application. To assess safety risk with regard to changing site conditions in an objective and efficient way, this study proposes a quantitative model for hazard exposure assessment based on real-time location data of construction workforce and equipment, collected by a location-based proximity warning system. In contrast with traditional risk-assessment methods, the model proposed in this study combines accident probability and hazard exposure duration into a single quantitative concepthazard exposure amount. This concept takes into account the space factor as well as the time factor of construction activities. For ease of understanding, a hazard is analogized as a radiation source and the hazard exposure is then referred to as the radiation quantity received. The longer duration and closer proximity in which a person is exposed to a radiation (hazard), the more radiation the person receives (the higher risk to which the person is exposed). A trial study is described in which a proximity warning system was developed and used to demonstrate and test the model's capability of hazard exposure assessment. This shows that the system can provide safety officers with an ongoing and immediate means of comparing safety risk trends from worker, hazard, and project perspectives.

J	Ketchman, K; Bilec, M				Ketchman, Kevin; Bilec, Melissa			Quantification of Particulate Matter from Commercial Building Excavation Activities Using Life-Cycle Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Particulate matter (PM); PM10; PM2.5; Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Excavation; Commercial building; Construction materials and methods	FUEL USE; EMISSIONS; TRUCKS	Construction activities generate large amounts of differing emissions, including particulate matter (PM). These particles are of various aerodynamic diametersbetween 10 and 2.5m (PM10-2.5), or coarse particulates, and smaller than 2.5m (PM2.5), or fine particulates. Coarse particulates are more commonly associated with fugitive dust releases, whereas fine particulates are generally from the combustion of fossil fuels. The combination of construction equipment and diesel fuel combustion emissions and excavated and then exposed earth on a construction site is of particular concern with respect to PM emissions. This research developed a life-cycle assessment model to quantitatively evaluate PM emissions at different scales. An illustrative case study is used to explore the excavation phase of an urban high-rise. The excavation phase includes excavation and hauling of soil, mobilizing and demobilizing of equipment, workers commuting, delivery of fuel, handling of soil at the soil disposal site and the nonregional activities of equipment manufacturing, and the production and distribution of fuels. The emissions generated at the excavation site accounted for 23% of PM10-2.5 and 13% of PM2.5 total life-cycle emissions by location, whereas the emissions generated over roadways accounted for 59 and 77% of total life-cycle PM10-2.5 and PM2.5, respectively. The remaining emissions by location were generated at the soil disposal site and outside of the regional boundary. The majority of regional PM10-2.5 (89%) and PM2.5 (90%) emissions were a direct result of soil-hauling activities. The results present a case for further discussion and analysis of the impacts of hauling soil on regional human health. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Abdelmohsen, AZ; El-Rayes, K				Abdelmohsen, Ahmed Z.; El-Rayes, Khaled			Optimizing the Planning of Highway Work Zones to Maximize Safety and Mobility	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Optimization; Work-zone safety; Traffic delay; Highway; Crash modification factor; Safety	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; RESOURCE UTILIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS	Highway work zones create potential risks for both traffic and workers in addition to traffic congestion and delays that result in increased road user delay, traffic crashes, and vehicle emissions. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and state departments of transportation (DOTs) are continuously seeking to improve work-zone safety and mobility. To accomplish this, the layout of highway work zones needs to be carefully planned and optimized to accomplish the multiple and often conflicting objectives of maximizing safety and mobility. This article presents the development of an innovative multiobjective optimization model to search for and identify a set of Pareto-optimal work-zone layouts that provide a wide range of optimal trade-offs between minimizing traffic delays and minimizing the probability of crashes. The model has four phases: (1) identify all relevant decision variables for work-zone layout, (2) formulate the optimization objective functions in the model, (3) define all relevant and practical constraints that affect the optimization problem, and (4) perform the model-optimization computations using multiobjective genetic algorithms. The performance of the developed optimization model was analyzed and verified using an application example of work-zone layout. The results of the analysis of this example illustrate the novel and unique capabilities of the developed model in searching for and identifying optimal work-zone layouts. These new and unique capabilities are expected to support state DOTs and construction planners in their ongoing efforts to maximize work-zone safety and reduce traffic delays in the work-zone area.

J	Wang, P; Wu, P; Wang, XY; Chen, X; Zhou, T				Wang, Peng; Wu, Peng; Wang, Xiangyu; Chen, Xin; Zhou, Tao			Developing optimal scaffolding erection through the integration of lean and work posture analysis	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Turnaround maintenance; Value stream mapping; Work posture; Scaffolding; Health and safety	CONSTRUCTION; MAINTENANCE; SYSTEM; IMPROVEMENT; EQUIPMENT; TIME	Purpose Facility structures in liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants require tremendous amounts of scaffolding to facilitate relevant industrial operation and maintenance. As such, the productivity of scaffolding operations in turnaround maintenance (TAM) has attracted much attention in recent years. In addition, health and safety issues have been recognised as a key contributor along with productivity improvement in the LNG industry. This study aims to integrate work posture analysis into value stream mapping to achieve an optimised and balanced improvement in both productivity and health and safety. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach is adopted to integrate lean and work posture analysis in a TAM site. The lean improvement is conducted through value stream mapping, and the work posture analysis is conducted through the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System method. A three-step optimisation strategy is then developed for achieving optimised performance in waste reduction and work posture improvement. Findings It is found that the implementation of value stream mapping can help eliminate waste in the installation process, therefore eliminating potential health and safety risks. However, health and safety of onsite workers does not always improve as lean implementation intensifies. There is an optimised erection schedule that has the lowest health and safety risk within a waste reduction target. Originality/value In contradiction to previous studies, which rely on qualitative assessment to identify the a positive correlation between lean and health and safety, this study reveals the distinct difference between lean attributes and health and safety attributes through a quantitative assessment and is more readily to be implemented at the site level for simultaneous improvement in lean and health and safety.

J	Akanmu, A; Olayiwola, J; Olatunji, OA				Akanmu, Abiola; Olayiwola, Johnson; Olatunji, Oluwole Alfred			Musculoskeletal disorders within the carpentry trade: analysis of timber flooring subtasks	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Technology; Case study; Construction site; Construction safety	ERGONOMIC EVALUATION; POSTURE RECOGNITION; WORKING POSTURES; RISK-FACTORS; CONSTRUCTION; WORKERS; SYSTEM; TASK; OWAS	Purpose Carpenters are constantly vulnerable to musculoskeletal disorders. Their work consists of subtasks that promote nonfatal injuries and pains that affect different body segments. The purpose of this study is to examine ergonomic exposures of carpentry subtasks involved in floor framing, how they lead to musculoskeletal injuries, and how preventive and protective interventions around them can be effective. Design/methodology/approach Using wearable sensors, this study characterizes ergonomic exposures of carpenters by measuring and analyzing body movement data relating to major subtasks in carpentry flooring work. The exposures are assessed using Postural Ergonomic Risk Assessment classification, which is based on tasks involving repetitive subtasks and nonstatic postures. Findings The findings of this paper suggest severe risk impositions on the trunk, shoulder and elbow as a result of the measuring and marking and cutting out vent locations, as well as in placing and nailing boards into place. Research limitations/implications Because of the type and size of wearable sensor used, only results of risk exposures of four body-parts are presented. Practical implications This study draws insights on how to benchmark trade-specific measurement of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Safety efforts can be targeted toward these risk areas and subtasks. Specifically, results from these will assist designers and innovators in designing effective and adaptable protective interventions and safety trainings. Originality/value Extant studies have failed to provide adequate evidence regarding the relationships between subtasks and musculoskeletal disorders; they have only mimicked construction tasks through laboratory experimental scenarios. This study adds value to the existing literature, in particular by providing insights into hazards associated with floor carpentry subtasks.

J	Dewlaney, KS; Hallowell, MR; Fortunato, BR				Dewlaney, Katherine S.; Hallowell, Matthew R.; Fortunato, Bernard R., III			Safety Risk Quantification for High Performance Sustainable Building Construction	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Sustainability; LEED; Risk	INJURY	A recent study found that Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings have a recordable injury rate that is 9% higher than traditional, non-LEED buildings. A follow-up study showed that there are distinct aspects of the design elements and means and methods of construction used to achieve LEED certification that have negative impacts on worker safety. The research described in this paper builds on previous knowledge by quantifying the percent increase in base-level safety risk resulting from the design strategies and construction methods implemented to earn specific LEED credits. A total of 26 interviews and 11 validation interviews were conducted with designers and contractors who had completed an average of four LEED projects, 100 traditional projects, in their average of 18 years of experience in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The results indicate that design elements and means and methods of construction implemented to achieve 12 of the 49 LEED credits increase the frequency of injuries or exposure to known, high risk environments. The most significant impacts are a 36% increase in lacerations, strains, and sprains from recycling construction materials; a 24% increase in falls to lower level during roof work because of the installation of on-site renewable energy (e.g., PV panels); a 19% increase in eye strain when installing reflective roof membranes; and a 14% increase in exposure to harmful substances when installing innovative wastewater technologies. These results can be used to understand the safety impacts of sustainable building design, will enhance designer awareness, and help contractors to better prioritize safety resources.

In most situations, the prefabricated building assemblies are installed by labor crews manually. If some assemblies are ill-designed, clashes between labor crews' workspaces and them may occur, which will have bad effect on workers' productivity and even incur hazard. The purpose of this paper is to provide a 4D building information modeling (BIM) based approach to find potential workspace conflicts during the installation process of prefabricated building assemblies in the detailed design process so as to eliminate them in advance. Design/methodology/approach First, a workspace modeling method is provided; second, three kinds of workspace conflicts are analyzed; third, a 4D-BIM-based approach is established; fourth, a prototype tool based on the approach is developed; and finally, a case study is conducted to test the tool. Findings The result shows that the proposed tool can detect or precaution workspace conflicts and visualize them in a series of views; in doing so, valuable information can be obtained for improving the design quality of prefabricated assemblies. Research limitations/implications The proposed approach and tool only concern the congestions caused by ill-designed prefabricated components; the tool needed to be further optimized for speed; the tests on the tool are limited to a single case study; and more tests are needed to verify its effectiveness. Originality/value This research provides a 4D-BIM-based approach and a prototype tool for installation workspace analysis. It can be used to provide support for design optimization of prefabricated building assemblies.

J	Kim, J; Chi, S				Kim, Jinwoo; Chi, Seokho			Multi-camera vision-based productivity monitoring of earthmoving operations	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Productivity monitoring; Earthmoving operations; Multi-camera; Vision-based; Construction equipment; Construction site; Computer vision	ACTION RECOGNITION; TRACKING; SIMULATION; EQUIPMENT; IDENTIFICATION; WORKERS; EXCAVATORS; NETWORKS; FEATURES; SYSTEMS	To be successful in managing earthmoving projects, it is very important to monitor the operational efficiency and productivity of heavy equipment. Researchers have investigated many vision-based methods and demonstrated their high applicability to automated productivity monitoring. However, they primarily focused on developing a single-camera vision-based approach that monitors heavy equipments movement using video data collected from only one camera, and thus they normally failed in continuous earthmoving productivity monitoring due to its limited visibility; for instance, it would be difficult to understand what dump trucks are actually doing if they disappear from the single-camera's field of view. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-camera vision-based productivity monitoring methodology that analyzes videos captured from multiple non-overlapping cameras at the jobsite. The proposed methodology consists of three main processes: (1) multi-camera placement at different physical locations on site, (2) single-camera vision-based equipment monitoring, and (3) multi-camera vision-based equipment matching (i.e., finding the same object in multiple cameras) for productivity analysis. For validation, the authors conducted experiments using video data of 371,125 image frames recorded from an actual earthmoving site for highway construction, and the results confirmed the potential of precise productivity monitoring with the average 97.6% equipment matching accuracy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to monitor the productivity of earthmoving equipment using multiple cameras, and these findings will support to more reliable automated productivity monitoring of earthmoving operations.

J	Park, M; Lee, HS; Kwon, S				Park, Moonseo; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Kwon, Soonseok			CONSTRUCTION KNOWLEDGE EVALUATION USING EXPERT INDEX	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						knowledge management; knowledge evaluation; expert index	PROJECTS	While the current global economy can be characterized by the intensification of business competitiveness, leaner organizations, the convergence of products and services, and by vast technological developments, the risks and uncertainties inherent in such a dynamic environment make the management of organizational knowledge even more crucial. Indeed, previous theoretical and empirical-based studies have proven that knowledge leads to organizational success. Knowledge Management (KM) has particularly gained credence, and continues to generate interest, in academic and business circles. KM is of especial interest to project-based industries such as construction, as the effective management of knowledge is critical to the survival and continued advancement of a company. In fact, in the construction industry, the implementation of a knowledge management system (KMS) is currently being considered, and an increasing number of companies have already proposed knowledge management initiatives. However, quality of information must take precedence over quantity, especially in the developmental phases of this KMS. Therefore, how to filter and accurately evaluate quantitative and qualitative data becomes a significant challenge. Yet, thus far, only a few studies examining the improvement of knowledge evaluation have been conducted and that researches only focus on the evaluation methods. This research addresses these issues by focusing on knowledge management and evaluation and by specifically addressing how to evaluate knowledge effectively. Based on the Active Knowledge Management, this study proposes a process model for effectual construction knowledge evaluation using Expert Index (EI). EI is the level of specialty workers achieve in a certain field after engaging in a knowledge activity. The proposed model will not only enable precise evaluation, but will also provide stimulating knowledge activities; thus, if practically applied, this model could enhance actual organizational success.

J	Choe, S; Leite, F				Choe, Sooyoung; Leite, Fernanda			Assessing Safety Risk among Different Construction Trades: Quantitative Approach	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; PROJECTS	The construction industry has one of the worst occupational health and safety records of all industries. In recognition of this, several innovative safety techniques have been introduced to mitigate undesired events before they occur, including safety risk assessment. However, evaluation of safety risk is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the construction work environment and lack of reliable references. This study (1)compares safety risk of different construction trades in terms of common hazard types and sources of injuries, and (2)proposes safety risk quantification models by occupations, which can play a role as a safety reference for reliable safety risk assessment. Using occupational injury data, two relative injury indexes, relative fatality and relative days away injury indexes, were used to compare relative safety among 19 different construction occupations as well as the construction average. Each relative injury index of an occupation was further decomposed into hazard types, sources of injury, and injury scenarios. Based on comparative relative injury index data, a tree-based safety risk quantification model was proposed. The findings indicate each occupation has a unique pattern of safety data structure in terms of hazards and sources of injuries. In addition, the same occupation had different hazard types and sources of injury that can lead to different injury severities. A construction project typically involves numerous workers and resources. The safety risk analysis presented in this paper can be used as a general safety reference by safety managers to understand the dynamic nature of safety risk.

J	Jeelani, I; Han, K; Albert, A				Jeelani, Idris; Han, Kevin; Albert, Alex			Development of virtual reality and stereo-panoramic environments for construction safety training	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction safety; Safety training; Hazard recognition; Personalized training; VR	HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION	Purpose Workers and construction professionals are generally not proficient in recognizing and managing safety hazards. Although valuable, traditional training experiences have not sufficiently addressed the issue of poor hazard recognition and management in construction. Since hazard recognition and management are cognitive skills that depend on attention, visual examination and decision-making, performance assessment and feedback in an environment that is realistic and representative of actual working conditions are important. The purpose of this paper is to propose a personalized safety training protocol that is delivered using robust, realistic and immersive environments. Design/methodology/approach Two types of virtual environments were developed: (1) Stereo-panoramic environments using real construction scenes that were used to evaluate the performance of trainees accurately and (2) A virtual construction site, which was used to deliver various elements of instructional training. A training protocol was then designed that was aimed at improving the hazard recognition and management performance of trainees. It was delivered using the developed virtual environments. The effectiveness of the training protocol was experimentally tested with 53 participants using a before-after study. Findings The results present a 39% improvement in hazard recognition and a 44% improvement in hazard management performance. Originality/value This study combines the benefits of using a virtual environment for providing instructional training along with realistic environments (stereo-panoramic scenes) for performance assessment and feedback. The training protocol includes several new and innovative training elements that are designed to improve the hazard recognition and hazard management abilities of the trainees. Moreover, the effectiveness of training in improving hazard recognition and hazard management is measured using specific outcome variables.

The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future.

A total of 21,104 and 17,464 injuries and nonconformances (NCR), respectively, were identified and categorized. A total of 86% of injuries that were incurred were because of minor cuts or sprains, but allowed the person to continue to carry out their normal duties. NCRs less than AU$20 thousand accounted for 96% of the total costs incurred. Moreover, NCRs greater than AU$100 thousand and those between AU$20 thousand to AU$100 thousand accounted for 42 and 36%, respectively. The number of NCRs attributed to rework was 47%, which represented 84% of their total cost. Further analysis revealed that injuries were significantly correlated with NCRs, specifically rework (p < 0.01). As the variance for injuries significantly exceeded its mean, there was overdispersion within the data. Therefore, a negative binomial model was developed to predict injuries, while simultaneously considering the relationship with NCRs and different types of projects based on the worker-hours worked. The mean monthly predicted against actual injuries for 106-month period was computed. The developed model provides an accurate prediction of injury frequency and thus could be used as a passive lead-indicator as part of a contractor's safety and quality performance programs. In addition, it is promulgated that it can support the process of requisite imagination, which involves anticipating what might go wrong and provide the impetus for testing problems in advance of commencing the construction process with regard to quality and safety issues.

Two state-of-art machine learning-based classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were used for modelling CLP. First, a preliminary review of previous literature was carried out to extract all CLP related factors. Subsequently, the list of CLP factors were ranked in terms of most influential in Malaysian Residential standpoint by experienced Project Managers through a pilot survey. The most influential factors identified were labour's lack of work experience, job category, education/training, nationality, skills, age and marital status. Data was collected based on these influencing factors from all construction workers in Malaysian Residential Projects. The data collected were used to develop CLP models using SVM and RF. The performance of the models was assessed using several statistical indices including Percentage of Correct (PC), Heidke Skill Score (HSS), the Probability of Detection (POD), the False Alarm Ratio (FAR) and the Peirce skill score (PSS). The SVM and RF simulated the CLP with high accuracy. The POD for both models was found above 90% in predicting different categories of productivity. The reliability plots showed a high efficiency of the models. The results indicate that the advanced machine learning methods can be used to achieve high accuracy in prediction of CLP. The present study can also be helpful for researchers and industry practitioners to understand how machine learning methods can be employed to learn more about productivity in construction and eventually improve the standards of construction labour productivity in Malaysia.

Although it provides the construction safety professionals with the final illustration of the risks magnitude, it suffers from major shortcomings, including inability to considering the importance of probability and severity, impaired analysis resulting from the use of raw numbers for ratings, and the limited range of classifications for assessing the risks. All these shortages give an impaired insight to the concerned parties, deteriorating the involved workers' safety. As such, this paper aims to develop a novel Risk Assessment Model (RAM) through the integration of the Fuzzy Best Worst Method (FBWM) with the Interval-Valued Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (IVFTOPSIS). Based on the application of RAM to a real-life case study, it was observed that the developed RAM contributes to the body of construction safety risk assessment in five unique ways: (1) computing the importance of the two risk parameters (i.e. probability and severity) using fuzzy-reference-based comparisons, (2) obviating the needs for having statistical data, (3) prioritizing the identified risks using the combination of interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers with TOPSIS, (4) providing the safety analysts with wider ranges of classifications for conducting risk assessment, and (5) providing the safety professionals with appropriate evaluation strategies for controlling the analysed risks. The developed model in the study can be applied to any projects, giving a conclusive plan to the concerned safety professionals for adopting the further prudent mitigation measurements.

Melody			Cognitive Workload Demands Using 2D and 3D Spatial Engineering Information Formats	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Labor; Productivity; Information management; Human factors; Construction management; Personnel management; Productivity; Information management; Mental workload; Analysis of variance; Additive manufacturing; Labor and personnel issues		Construction project performance is significantly reliant on the effective communication of the project's design to the end construction worker. Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats.

Language is an important element of such communication. The purpose of this paper is to examine the communication effectiveness of AIDS-related intervention messages. Design/methodology/approach Case-based semi-structured interviews, with 42 employees from three construction organisations, and with six telephone counsellors from a service provider, were used to explore language in the HIV/AIDS context in the construction industry in the Western Cape region. Findings Workers' knowledge about HIV (a key element in prevention and willingness to engage in treatment regimes) tended to align with their level of education. African cultures may inhibit the use of plain language about AIDS. Graphic posters with text in different languages were the most preferred communication media, but need periodic refreshment to remain effective. For toolbox talks and other company presentations, a comprehensive approach to language differences is limited, and appropriate confirmatory feedback loops are not used - the message sent is not always the message received. The recruitment and training processes for service provider counsellors ensure a more comprehensive grasp of HIV knowledge and a more consistent approach to communication. Originality/value Communication effectiveness is pivotal in the provision of intervention management by construction firms. Ineffective language and communication processes directly and adversely influence HIV/AIDS intervention management success.

To abate this scourge, various control methods including the use of technology have been adopted to improve workplace safety performance in construction. However, not all of the technologies adopted by industry personnel for safety management have achieved the desired outcome or have proved to be effective. More research is needed regarding the adoption of safety technologies in the construction industry. Importantly, industry stakeholders need to evaluate their readiness to adopt safety technologies. The present study develops a decision-making tool that can aid in the adoption of safety technology in the construction industry. The safety technology decision-making adoption tool is developed using the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and consists of three categories of safety technology predictors: external, organization, and technology-related. Technology-based predictors have emerged as the most impactful predictor. Subsequently, a technology adoption assessment protocol was developed and applied to a case study to assess an organization's readiness to adopt wearable sensing devices. The present work contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying, quantifying, and categorizing predictors of technology adoption and then integrating the predictors into an evaluation protocol to assess the adoption of safety technologies in the construction industry. This contribution is translated into practice by developing a user-friendly tool called the Construction Safety Technology Adoption Index (C-STAI). The developed tool is expected to help construction professionals and practitioners make informed decisions regarding the adoption of safety technology. Improved technology adoption in construction is expected to lead to enhanced safety and reduce injuries on construction projects.

To explore the patterns of unsafe behaviors and promote accident prevention, a comparative analysis is conducted to analyze the behavioral risk chains of accidents for these two construction types in the Chinese construction industry using complex network (CN) theory. First, accident cases are collected from government websites, and unsafe behaviors are extracted and classified according to a summary list of several safety standards and operating procedures. Second, behavioral risk chain networks of accidents (BRCNAs) for the two construction types are established as directed networks. Pajek, a program for visualizing and analyzing large networks, is then used to construct network models. Finally, the topological parameters of the BRCNAs are calculated and compared. The results show that BRCNAs are both scale-free and small-world networks. The characteristics of the building construction BRCNA are related to individual workers, and the characteristics of the urban railway construction BRCNA are related to the working environment and supervisors. However, there are certain unsafe behaviors that play an important role in accidents in both construction types. These findings reveal the variations in interactions among unsafe behaviors that cause accidents in the two construction types to further understand the patterns of unsafe behaviors. This study is of theoretical and practical significance for improving accident causation models and supporting on-site safety management in the construction industry.

IDENTIFICATION OF IMPORTANT ORGANISATIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCING SAFETY WORK BEHAVIOURS IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organisational factors; safety work behaviour; Thai construction	CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; ACCIDENTS; OUTCOMES; SUPPORT; HEALTH	Although the importance of organisational factors in human error has been acknowledged, the influence of organisational factors in the area of work behaviour in construction industry has rarely been examined. The first step of investigation should begin with identifying the relevant contributing factors affecting at-risk work behaviours. Thus, the aim of this research is to identify important organisational factors that will reduce at-risk work behaviours. The implications of these findings are further used to quantify and investigate the role of organisational factors as an integral feature of safety intervention. Case studies are used to identify and categorize organisational factors. This identification process begins with literature reviews as commonly performed. The literature related with organisational factors was used as a primary source to investigate the influences of organisational factors on at-risk work behaviours. Hence, semi-structured interviews and reviews of the company's documents were conducted involving safety experts and workers to gain experiential and practical knowledge. The obtained results identified seven important factors of Thailand construction industry: communication, culture, management commitment, leadership, organisation learning, empowerment, and reward system. The implications of particular applications from these factors are considered as critical features for handling work behaviours. In addition, empirical findings provide particularly insight factors from expertise in a practical way. Validations with previous publications of some factors are also discussed. The identified contributing determinants from empirical findings can be expected to be influential at different levels within an organization. Consequently, the proposed hypothetical casual models enables determination of disparity in their influences of organisational factors when considering interventions to reduce at-risk work behaviour or to promote safe work behaviours.

A critical review of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications in construction safety	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Virtual reality; Augmented reality; Construction; Safety; Review		Construction is a high hazard industry which involves many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety has always been advocated by many construction companies, and they have been working hard to make sure their employees are protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training and evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of technical features and types that could be implemented in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated, while significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and identification, safety training and education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works. It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating the research and practice frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the latest VR/AR applications.

Adherence to COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites may prevent the occurrence of COVID-19 cases, which eliminates the risk of site closure. However, adding a disinfection process to the construction process, as mandated in COVID-19 response guidelines, increases overall construction cost and time. Conversely, however, not adding a disinfection process may result in COVID-19 cases among construction workers, which would delay construction and perhaps even cause closure of the construction site. Therefore, this study analyzed the feasibility of COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites, especially the addition of a disinfection process, in terms of cost and time. To this end, CYClic Operations NEtwork (CYCLONE) models were developed to simulate the construction process, and a case study was conducted to validate the applicability of the suggested approach. The results showed that compliance with COVID-19 response guidelines increased the number of working days and the construction costs of the subject construction project, but because there was no more risk of construction site closure, the construction delays were short, and the liquidated damages were minimized. Through the method proposed in this study, it is possible to estimate construction cost and time before and after the COVID-19 pandemic; this method could be used to provide data for both owners and contractors to pro-actively recognize and respond to situations or damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data could also be used as evidence in case of future damages or disputes.

J	Mitropoulos, P; Namboodiri, M				Mitropoulos, Panagiotis; Namboodiri, Manoj			New Method for Measuring the Safety Risk of Construction Activities: Task Demand Assessment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety risk assessment; Construction safety; Task demands; Risk assessment methodology	ASSESSING EXPOSURE; WORK; SYSTEMS; INJURY; MODEL	The task demand assessment (TDA) is a new technique for measuring the safety risk of construction activities and analyzing how changes in operation parameters can affect the potential for accidents. TDA is similar to observational ergonomic methods-it does not produce estimates of probabilities of incidents, but it quantifies the "task demand" of actual operations based on characteristics of the activity and independent of the workers' capabilities. The task demand reflects the difficulty to perform the activity safely. It is based on (1) the exposure to a hazard and (2) the presence and level of observable task demand factors-that is, risk factors that can increase the potential for an accident. The paper presents the findings from the initial implementation of TDA and demonstrates its feasibility and applicability on two different operations: a roofing activity and a concrete paving operation. Furthermore, the paving case illustrates how the TDA method can compare different production scenarios and measure the effect of production variables on the accident potential. The findings indicate that the method can be applied on activities of varying complexity and can account for several risks and task demand factors as required by the user. The selection of task demand factors is a key issue for the validity of the method and requires input from the crew and safety management. The limitations of the methodology and the need for further research are discussed. Overall, TDA provides a tool that can assist researchers and practitioners in the analysis and design of construction operations.

The directions inspired research and marked a milestone in the development of the field. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the past decade and to rejuvenate these research directions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose the umbrella term: "project studies" to denote the research related to projects and temporary organizing. Project studies is conceived not only as a body of research, but also as a social process embedded in research communities, and contemporary Zeitgeist. Based on Sandberg's interpretative approach to the fit between work and worker (in this case research-researcher) and Habermas' three types of human interests: technical, practical, and emancipatory, the authors develop a conceptual framework circumscribing three types of research in project studies. Findings - The conceptual framework is used to craft future research directions, in the lines proposed by Winter et al. (2006b). Research limitations/implications - The authors conclude by proposing for a sixth research direction on the practice of theorizing, and call for engaged, ambidextrous scholars, who's "job" goes beyond the writing of articles and research applications, and includes shaping discourses of project research, nurturing new project scholars, contributing to project practice and carefully considering the legacy of projects and project studies in society. Originality/value - This paper positions research as a social process, and the role of researchers as actors shaping research in project studies.

Existing studies have adopted safety management approaches that address human-factor issues by defining safety climate. From safety climate research, it is evident that certain demographics or subgroup factors can significantly affect safety management. This study aimed to investigate how individual perceptions of safety hazards would be affected by the given hazard's own feature (e.g.,probability of occurrence). In addition, the study explored the impacts of subgroup demographic factors (e.g.,job position and experience level) on safety perceptions. Eight commonly encountered site hazard/accident scenes were predefined according to their occurrence, severity, and visibility. A site survey approach was adopted to investigate how construction employees from different demographic subgroups rated the degree of danger of the eight predefined scenes. The follow-up statistical analysis revealed that (1)a hazard/accident scene with higher occurrence and lower severity caused a higher variation among employees' opinions in perceiving its degree of danger; (2)entry-level employees tended to evaluate hazards with a higher degree of danger; and (3)compared to early career employees and senior peers, the mid-career professionals tended to perceive a lower degree of danger of a given hazard/accident scene. This study contributed to the body of knowledge in construction safety by investigating the effects of the given hazard/accident's feature (e.g.,occurrence) in employees' perceptions, as well as integrating different scenes of safety hazards in the subgroup analysis based on employees' job duties or work trades and their experience levels. Future research is also recommended to address individuals' safety perceptions and demographic factors in safety management.

J	Lu, QC; Lee, S				Lu, Qiuchen; Lee, Sanghoon			Image-Based Technologies for Constructing As-Is Building Information Models for Existing Buildings	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						As-is building information model (BIM); Existing building; Image; Operations and maintenance	ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; 3D OBJECT RECOGNITION; LINE STEREO; LASER; BIM; RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM; EXTRACTION; ACCURACY; FEATURES	Building information models (BIMs) have proven to be data-rich, object-oriented, intelligent, and parametric digital representations of buildings to support diverse activities throughout the lifecycle of the building. Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end, this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps: (1)data capturing and processing, (2)object recognition, and (3)as-is BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed. Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are identified. This paper presents the results of systematic review and analyses for image-based as-is BIM construction processes, contributing to the development and widespread adoption of this technology in the construction industry.

To achieve this aim, a research methodology consisted of literature review and survey questionnaire was developed to accomplish three objectives. First, literature review was used to investigate the nature of the construction industry, identify and classify the causes of site accidents as well as their social and economic impacts on organizations and affected families. Second, a survey questionnaire was conducted with a representative sample of large and medium sized construction firms in Egypt to examine their perception of the causes of site accidents. Finally, outlining research conclusions and recommendations useful to construction firms and governmental organizations. The research identified 16 causes of construction site accidents. These causes were classified into three categories based on the party responsible for the occurrence of site accidents namely, workers, organization management and government. Results of data analysis showed that "Lack of housekeeping" and "Lack of governmental inspection for Safety" were ranked the highest causes of site accidents in the Egyptian construction industry, while "inefficiency of old safety equipment or no safety equipment at all" and "reluctance to input resources for Safety" were ranked the least causes. Moreover, Spearman correlation test showed there are relationships between many causes in which some causes may affect the occurrence of other causes. This research provides valuable information about the nature of the construction industry with particular focus on site accidents, causes and impacts of construction site accidents. The research tackled a topic that received scant attention in construction literature especially in the Egypt context. The work presented in this paper represents a synthesis that is important and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred in the Egyptian construction industry.

J	Hou, L; Wang, XY; Truijens, M				Hou, Lei; Wang, Xiangyu; Truijens, Martijn			Using Augmented Reality to Facilitate Piping Assembly: An Experiment-Based Evaluation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Augmented Reality; Two-dimensional isometric drawings; Original time; Rework time; Payment; Cost; Cognitive workload	MIXED REALITY; SIMULATION; ISSUES	Current practice utilizes two-dimensional (2D) drawings as the main visualization means to guide assembly. As an emerging technology, augmented reality (AR) integrates three-dimensional (3D) images of virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of digitalized information into the real-world workspace using AR can provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures with improved accuracy and reduced errors. The limited available research concerning the applications of AR visualization means in assembly highlights the need for a structured methodology of addressing cognitive and usability issues for the application potentials of AR technology to be fully realized. Thus, the focus of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how much improvement in assembly productivity and performance can be achieved by lowering cognitive workload via AR. The AR system was developed in collaboration with Woodside Energy Ltd. following research project ECHO. Evaluation of the prototyped construction piping scenario revealed that the AR visualization yielded shorter task completion time (50% reduction), fewer assembly errors (50% reduction), and lower total task load. More specific findings also indicated that the animated AR visualization significantly shortened the original time (55% reduction) and rework time (46% reduction), payment to assemblers (50% reduction), and cost of correcting erroneous assembly (66% reduction). Questionnaire feedback revealed that the animated AR visualization better aided assembly comprehension and better facilitated information retrieval and collaboration between human and guidance medium. From a technology innovation perspective, by providing a higher level of immersion and interaction with spatial awareness, the dynamic AR guidance can be integrated with building information model (BIM) technology in helping and training practitioners, because all of the models and assembly sequences are designed in BIM and visualized in AR.

Design for occupational safety and health: key attributes for organisational capability	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Design for safety; Delphi technique; Health and safety; Prevention through design; Safety in design; Voting analytic hierarchy process	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; DELPHI METHOD; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Purpose Against the backdrop of the contribution of design to the occurrence of occupational injuries and illnesses in construction, design for occupational safety and health (DfOSH) is increasingly becoming prominent in the construction sector. To ensure that design interventions are safe for construction workers to build and maintain, design firms need to have the appropriate organisational capability in respect of DfOSH. However, empirical insight regarding the attributes that constitute DfOSH organisational capability is lacking. The purpose of this paper, which trailblases the subject of DfOSH organisational capability in construction, is to address two key questions: what organisational attributes determine DfOSH capability? What is the relative priority of the capability attributes? Design/methodology/approach The study employed three iterations of expert focus group discussion and a subsequent three-round Delphi technique accompanied by the application of voting analytic hierarchy process. Findings The study revealed 18 capability attributes nested within six categories, namely: competence (the competence of organisation's design staff); strategy (the consideration of DfOSH in organisation's vision as well as the top management commitment); corporate experience (organisation's experience in implementing DfOSH on projects); systems (systems, processes and procedures required for implementing DfOSH); infrastructure (physical, and information and communication technology resources); and collaboration (inter- and intra-organisational collaboration to implement DfOSH on projects). Whilst these categories and their nested attributes carry varying weights of importance, collectively, the competence-related attributes are the most important, followed by strategy. Originality/value The findings should enable design firms and other key industry stakeholders (such as the clients who appoint them) to understand designers' DfOSH capability better. Additionally, design firms should be able to prioritise efforts/investment to enhance their DfOSH capability.

J	Kim, J; Chi, S				Kim, Jinwoo; Chi, Seokho			Action recognition of earthmoving excavators based on sequential pattern analysis of visual features and operation cycles	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Action recognition; Earthmoving excavator; Vision-based; Productivity monitoring; Cycle time; Sequential working pattern; Visual feature; Operation cycle; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)	CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; VISION; TRACKING; EQUIPMENT; IDENTIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; NETWORKS; SYSTEM; MODEL; COLOR	This paper proposes a vision-based action recognition framework that considers the sequential working patterns of earthmoving excavators for automated cycle time and productivity analysis. The sequential patterns of visual features and operation cycles are incorporated into the action recognition framework, which includes three main processes: excavator detection, excavator tracking, and excavator action recognition. The first process uses a pre-trained detector to localize earthmoving excavators on sites from all of captured images. Next, the detection results are associated and the excavators are tracked by Tracking-Learning-Detection algorithm. Lastly, to recognize the operation types of the excavators, their sequential patterns of visual features and operation cycles are modeled and trained with a hybrid deep learning algorithm, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks and Double-layer Long Short Term Memory. Three experiments were performed to validate the proposed framework and confirm the positive effects of sequential modeling: (1) an experiment without sequential pattern analysis, (2) an experiment with the sequential pattern analysis of visual features, and (3) an experiment with the sequential pattern analysis of visual features and operation cycles. In the experiments, the research team used a total of 72,365 images collected from actual earthmoving sites. The average accuracies of the excavator action recognition in the three cases were 79.8%, 90.9%, and 93.8% respectively. The results demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework and the significant positive impacts of sequential pattern modeling on the recognition performance. This research contributed to the identification of critical elements that explain sequential working patterns and to the development of a novel vision-based action recognition framework. In addition, the findings of this study can help to automate cycle time analysis and productivity monitoring of earthmoving excavators.

J	Soltani, MM; Zhu, ZH; Hammad, A				Soltani, Mohammad Mostafa; Zhu, Zhenhua; Hammad, Amin			Framework for Location Data Fusion and Pose Estimation of Excavators Using Stereo Vision	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data fusion; Stereo vision; Skeleton extraction; Three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation	VISUAL RECOGNITION; CONSTRUCTION; RESOURCES; EQUIPMENT; TRACKING; WORKERS; SYSTEM; IMAGES; VIDEOS	The application of computer vision (CV) in construction projects has been investigated for many years, resulting in several advanced algorithms and methods. However, there is still a need to advance the current methods for improving the productivity of operations and safety on job sites. The excavator is one of the highly used pieces of equipment on construction sites that needs to be monitored to evaluate both safety and productivity. Knowing the productivity of excavators helps to plan the excavation process more accurately. A long queue of trucks waiting for the excavator(s) means paying more money while the trucks are not being loaded. Moreover, excavators have a higher risk of accidents due to their articulated shape compared to other excavation-related equipment. On the other hand, monitoring an object with four degrees of freedom using sensory data is a very difficult task. Therefore, this research investigates the opportunities to fuse CV-based methods and real-time location systems (RTLSs) and apply stereo vision methods to formulate a comprehensive framework for estimating the three-dimensional (3D) poses of excavators as some of the most widely used equipment on construction sites. Instead of using specialized tools, such as off-the-shelf stereo cameras or markers, this study evaluates the applicability of using the surveillance cameras on construction sites as stereo cameras. Moreover, RTLS data and two or more cameras' data are fused by synchronizing the time and coordinate systems of the cameras and RTLS to investigate the potential of enhancing the accuracy of the pose estimation system and reducing the computational load. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by integrating the results of the excavator parts' detection, the backgrounds' subtraction, and the two-dimensional (2D) skeletons' extraction of the parts from each camera's view.

J	Oladinrin, OT; Ojo, LD				Oladinrin, Olugbenga Timo; Ojo, Lekan Damilola			Characterisation of the drivers of environmental management system implementation	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Construction industry; Drivers; Environmental management system; Nigeria; Sustainability	EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; ISO 14001; INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES; STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS; TOP MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; BENEFITS; BARRIERS; IMPACT	Purpose The detrimental impacts of the construction industry activities, namely, toxicity of cement and concrete to the health of construction workers and the general public, have been reported in previous studies. Several environmental management measures were put in place by international organisations to reduce these impacts on humans and the entire ecosystem. Sadly, such environmental management measures are not widely embraced in the construction industry of developing countries. This contributes to the poor quality of life of construction stakeholders, amongst other outcomes. Therefore, this study investigated the drivers to facilitate an environmental management system (EMS) in the Nigerian construction industry (NCI). Design/methodology/approach questionnaires retrieved from construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises were used to conduct both descriptive and inferential statistics, namely, mean score, standard deviation, Kruskal-Wallis H test, post hoc test and factor analysis. Findings The analyses show that the drivers of EMS implementation in the NCI could be grouped into intellectual enhancement strategies, documentation and cultural strategies, and motivation and tracking strategies. The study concluded that training and education of relevant stakeholders, tracking compliance levels of organisations and recognising firms acting in compliance with stipulated "environmental" policy are essential. It was recommended that the collaboration of all construction stakeholders be upheld to aid EMS implementation in the NCI. Originality/value This paper investigated the drivers of EMS with the opinions of construction professionals in the mainstream of the NCI through survey using to ensure wide coverage of respondents. Investigating the view of construction professionals in the micro, small, medium and large enterprises helped determine possible significant differences. Thus, practical implications of the study were also provided in a systematic manner.

J	Lee, S; Yu, JH				Lee, Seulki; Yu, Jungho			Comparative Study of BIM Acceptance between Korea and the United States	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); BIM acceptance model; Structural equation modeling; Information technologies	MODEL	Substantial research has been performed on data standards and exchanges in the AEC/FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities Management) industry over the past several years. The growing popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily on the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project's lifecycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance the implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. BIM was accepted in the United States earlier than in Korea, and BIM users are expected to have a higher maturity and positive perception about utilizing BIM depending on a lengthier utilization period. This means that the mechanism for achieving acceptance of BIM in Korea differs from the mechanism in the United States. Therefore, Korea's BIM acceptance model was compared to that in the United States using structural equation modeling. The key components, including the BIM acceptance model, were identified through a literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and related theories and was consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on these components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, engineers, and facility managers) in Korea and the United States. A total 164 completed questionnaires were retrieved. Structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing was conducted using commercially-available software. The results from this study can serve as a foundation for research looking into the organizational context to further BIM acceptance in the construction industry. The comparison of the mechanism and subsequent results will serve as a guideline for developing an acceptance strategy that is suitable for Korea. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Martin, L; Benson, L				Martin, Loosemore; Benson, Lim			Relationship quality in construction projects: A subcontractor perspective of principal contractor relationships	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Subcontractors; Construction; Relationship quality; Principal contractors; Supply chain management	BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; TRUST; INDUSTRY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERCEPTIONS; INTEGRATION; DEPENDENCE; BEHAVIORS; FAIRNESS	One of the defining characteristics of the construction industry is its subcontracting model of project organisation. Surprisingly, despite the criticality of the subcontractor/principal contractor relationship to successful project out-comes, research into this important relationship has been fragmented, disorganised and under-theorised. Mobil-ising theories of relationship quality to address this gap in knowledge, a survey of three hundred and thirty seven tier-one subcontractors in the Australian construction industry was undertaken to explore what factors influence relationship quality between subcontractors and principal contractors, whether these factors vary across the sup-ply chain and how they affect overall relational satisfaction. The findings give subcontractors a missing voice in this important debate and provide a more nuanced understanding of this critical project relationship from a novel theoretical perspective. They indicate that from a subcontractor perspective, subcontractor/principal contractor relationship quality is determined by six key factors: integrity respect and fairness; prompt payment; willingness to negotiate risk and price; effective communication; concern for worker health, safety and well-being; and op-portunities for early involvement in planning and design. Conceptually, when these factors are organised under the three dimensions of relationship quality theory (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), the results show that trust is by far the most important determinant of relationship quality. However, subcontractors cannot be treated as a homogeneous group and the factors that influence relationship quality and the importance of trust vary sig-nificantly between large and small subcontractors and by the amount of turnover-dependency in a relationship. Conceptually, the findings are important for refining the concept of relationship quality in a project management context and for helping construction project managers to improve often tenuous subcontractor relationships in an increasingly competitive industry where the quality of these relationships is a critical determinant of project outcomes and competitive advantage.

J	Chan, APC; Yang, Y; Darko, A				Chan, Albert Ping Chuen; Yang, Yang; Darko, Amos			Construction Accidents in a Large-Scale Public Infrastructure Project: Severity and Prevention	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						HZMB-HK project; Marine construction; Safety performance; Drowning; Causes; Preventive measures	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; MARINE CONSTRUCTION; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; ADDITION WORKS; HONG-KONG; INDUSTRY; FATALITIES; INJURIES; MAINTENANCE; INCIDENTS	The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge-related Hong Kong (HZMB-HK) project consists of a set of boundary crossing facilities and transport links that connect the main bridge (HZMB) to the Hong Kong territory. It is a featured large-scale public infrastructure project that involves construction works done above or near the sea. A number of accidents have occurred since the commencement of the project in November 2011. This study aims to analyze the construction accidents that occurred in the HZMB-HK project during the period from 2012 to the first half of 2017. The methodology comprises both quantitative and qualitative approaches. First, the safety performance of the project was quantitatively measured using three indicators: accident, fatality, and lethality rates. In this regard, it was identified that the safety performance of the project was worse than that of public work contracts and the construction industry in general. It was also found that fall and caught in-between were the deadliest types of accidents in the project. Second, eight fatal incidents that resulted in nine fatalities were qualitatively analyzed on the basis of relevant accident investigation reports. In this regard, it was found that of the nine decedents, five died from drowning. This indicates that working above or near the sea poses a high risk of drowning to construction workers. Furthermore, measures to prevent accidents in large-scale infrastructure projects such as the HZMB-HK project were analyzed in this study. This study adds to the construction safety body of knowledge by analyzing the accidents in a large-scale infrastructure project that involves both land- and sea-based construction works. The lessons from this study could help stakeholders, such as policy makers and practitioners, improve the safety performance of large-scale infrastructure projects worldwide.

Enormous legislative efforts have been made to minimize this problem. In Europe, the Directive 92/57/EEC, which establishes a mandatory safety and health requirements, defines the Safety and Health Plan. This paper contains a methodology for automatically extracting structured relevant information from this textual document. Such plans are crucial to provide safety in this sector. However, current documents are often enlarged with nonessential information, while the most relevant information is missing or difficult to locate. The information extracted by our methodology makes it easier for Safety and Health Plans to be validated and approved at an early stage, as well as facilitating their later use and updating. The main steps of this methodology are: i) the definition of the relevant content to be extracted as seven items, in collaboration with experts in the area; ii) text preprocessing and enrichment using existing software resources for the natural language employed; and iii) automated content analysis for extracting information, on the basis of a collection of previously established rules for identifying the content defined in the first step. The output is a detailed and structured report containing the percentage of relevant information identified, as well as the desired items of information. To illustrate and validate our methodology, we have implemented and applied it to 50 real Safety and Health Plans. As a result, our system was able to identify most of the required information for five of the seven items in all of these plans. In addition, we have been able to detect the problems in the textual plan that caused the missing information in the other two items, which will be corrected in future developments.

J	Lingard, H; Warmerdam, A; Shooshtarian, S				Lingard, Helen; Warmerdam, Amanda; Shooshtarian, Salman			Getting the balance right: Regulating occupational health and safety planning and coordination in the Australian construction industry	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction; Interview; Construction safety	MANAGEMENT; MYTHS; RISK	Purpose In Australia, national harmonisation of occupational health and safety (OHS) regulation was pursued through the development of model Work Health and Safety legislation. The model Work Health and Safety Regulations specify that construction works above a threshold cost of AU$250,000 are deemed to be construction projects requiring the appointment of a principal contractor with duties relating to OHS planning and coordination. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of the monetary threshold as a suitable trigger for specific OHS planning and coordination duties. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 46 Australian construction industry stakeholders, including union representatives, employer groups, construction firm representatives and regulators, as well as four international construction OHS experts, to explore perceptions about the effectiveness of the monetary threshold. Two construction scenarios were also modelled to test for variability in operation of the threshold by geographical location of works and design conditions. Findings The monetary threshold was perceived to be subject to two forms of capture problem, reflecting inadvertent capture of low risk works or failure to capture high risk works. Organisations were also reported to deliberately split contracts to avoid capture by the threshold. The cost-estimate modelling revealed inequalities and variation in the operation of the monetary threshold by geographic location and design specification. Practical implications The analysis suggests that limitations inherent in the use of a monetary threshold to trigger duties relating to OHS planning and coordination in construction works. Opportunities to use more sophisticated risk-based mechanisms are considered. Originality/value The study explores a fundamental challenge of risk-based OHS regulation, i.e., how to ensure that workers' health and safety are adequately protected without creating an unnecessarily high regulatory burden. The research provides evidence that using a monetary value as a proxy measure for OHS risk in construction projects may be problematic.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a five-factor model that can be used to diagnose and measure safety climate in construction safety research and practice. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review was adopted, and following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 574 articles were selected at the start of the study based on a developed review protocol for investigating safety climate factors. While examining the factor analysis of different studies, data reliability and data validity of the individual research findings were considered and frequency of factors uploaded was used to determine the significance as a quantitative measure to develop the ranking of safety climate factors. Findings The review identified that, from the established measures of safety climate in construction, there is little uniformity on factor importance. However, management commitment safety system role of the supervisor; workers' involvement and group safety climate were found to be the most common across the studies reviewed. It is proposed these factors are used to inform a five-factor model for investigating safety climate in the construction industry. Originality/value The findings of this study will motivate researchers and practitioners in safety to use the five-factor safety climate model presented in this paper and test it to develop a common factor structure for the construction industry. The fact that the model is comprised of five factors makes it easier to be used and implemented by small-to medium-sized construction companies, therefore enhancing its potential use.

J	Soltani, MM; Zhu, ZH; Hammad, A				Soltani, Mohammad Mostafa; Zhu, Zhenhua; Hammad, Amin			Skeleton estimation of excavator by detecting its parts	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Part recognition; Synthetic images; Auto-annotation; Skeleton estimation; Pose estimation	EQUIPMENT; TRACKING; RECOGNITION; WORKERS	Knowing the near real-time pose of the construction equipment is an important necessity for improving safety and productivity of construction processes. A safer construction site can be achieved by accurately capturing the movements of the equipment and their parts using motion tracking techniques. Recently, the application of Computer Vision (CV) techniques is growing, especially considering that other techniques have difficulties with the deployment and high cost. From the productivity point of view, knowing the pose of the equipment helps to estimate the time that the operator spent on each state of his/her operations. For this purpose, each part or joint of the equipment must be recognized and tracked. Extracting this information requires either using depth sensors or stereo vision, which includes the image information of two or more Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras that have overlapping views. Since the reading range of the common and affordable depth sensors are limited to few meters, this research chooses to use RGB cameras. The most challenging step for this purpose is to process the data of each camera individually for extracting the 2D skeleton of the equipment. After having the 2D skeleton of the equipment from each camera, the 3D pose can be further estimated using the relative rotation and translation information between the cameras coordinate systems. This paper mainly focuses on determining the 2D skeleton of excavators based on the videos received from the cameras available on the site. The method takes advantage of synthetic images of each excavator's part to train the parts' detectors. After detecting the parts, the backgrounds of the detected parts are subtracted. The remaining pixels from the previous step are processed to estimate the skeleton of each part. The fmal skeleton of the excavator is derived by connecting the individual skeletons of each part to their adjacent parts considering the kinematic information of the excavator.

Integrating Worker Health and Safety into Sustainable Design and Construction: Designer and Constructor Perspectives	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Pilot credits; Safety risk; Prevention through Design (PtD); Research methods; Statistical analysis; Sustainable construction		Sustainable building design and construction is gaining rapid growth within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry as a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency of building projects by incorporating efficient and effective materials, technologies, and strategies into the building process. However, these approaches have been found to be associated with negative potential impact on the health and safety of field personnel. Prevention through Design (PtD) strategies are well-suited to prevent potential construction hazards in green jobs. The aim of this study is to examine the perception of construction industry professionals about incorporating PtD practices into sustainable design and construction. To gauge the perception of professionals, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to two construction industry groups (designers and constructors). The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing evidence of the level of viability and extent of implementation of PtD practices into sustainable design and construction as well as identifying prevailing barriers and potential enablers of PtD implementation in the AEC industry. The findings of this research indicate that a majority of construction industry professionals, especially designers, are resistant to the implementation of PtD practices into sustainable projects at this point in time. Fear of liability, contractual methods, and lack of safety knowledge were found to be the most prevailing barriers to the acceptance of PtD practices within the AEC industry. By contrast, ethics was regarded as the primary potential enabler for the implementation of PtD practice within the AEC industry. The authors recommend that the AEC industry move further toward collaborative project delivery methods. This transformation can facilitate a wider implementation of PtD practices within the AEC industry, especially in sustainable design and construction. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However, various motivations such as the shrinking labor population, the aging of skilled workers, and the safety issue of ironworkers have promoted the development of robotic construction systems. In this research, one of those trials, a project entitled "Robot-based construction automation system for high-rise building" is presented. Among diverse construction works, this project focused on a robotic automation of the steel beam assembly. The project is a cooperative effort between a robot research group and a construction automation group in South Korea. The main objective of this paper is to an introduction for the development of a robotic beam assembly system administered by the robot research group. The robotic beam assembly system consists of a robotic bolting device that performs the main function for the beam assembly work and a robotic transport mechanism that transports the robotic bolting device to target bolting positions around a building under construction. This paper presents the specific functions, structures, and mechanisms of the robotic bolting device and accounts for the application of the visual servo control technique to a bolting control system which is a software component. The robotic transport mechanism part is discussed in a companion paper [14]. The real prototype of the proposed system was manufactured and intensive field tests were conducted in a test bed. Moreover, this system was applied to a section of a real building, the Robot Convergence Building of Korea University, South Korea, which has one story below and seven above the ground, and obtained a feasibility of an application of the robotic beam assembly system to actual construction sites. The suggested system is expected to be a promising alternative to ironworkers in the steel beam assembly in terms of safety and time-efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, B; Lee, HS; Lee, S; Park, M				Lee, Bogyeong; Lee, Hyun-Soo; Park, Moonseo; Kim, Hyunsoo			Influence Factors of Learning-Curve Effect in High-Rise Building Constructions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; Labor; Learning-curve effect; High-rise buildings; Labor and personnel issues	PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE	Learning-curve theory has been applied to construction activities due to their labor-intensive and repetitive features. However, previous research argued that the effect of the learning curve does not exist in construction because it is not recognizable by the amount of repetition in construction labor. Although prior research implied that there is a need for the modified learning curve specifically tailored to construction, the studies may not fully investigate the reasons for the gap between theory and practice or fully consider the factors that affect the manifestation process of learning development. Moreover, they tend to underestimate the applicability of the learning-curve theory in construction. To address these issues, this paper clarifies factors that impact the manifestation process to suggest a more suitable learning-curve model for high-rise building construction activities as a subject. Specifically, three influence factors are selected-(1) task change, (2) work adaptation, and (3) vertical transportation time-and a hypothetical learning curve is proposed for the high-rise building construction. A case project in Korea is tested to validate the suggested factors. The quantitative data including labor performance (e.g., work hours, quantity, and number of workers) per floor are converted to the proposed learning curve and compared with actual data. The results show that the suggested learning curve is more suitable for representing the development of learning in high-rise construction than that of previous research. The proposed learning curve can also extend its applicability toward labor productivity issues for the high-rise building because its accuracy was improved considering the influence factors. Based on the results of this research, a project manager can improve labor productivity from the learning-curve effect by controlling influence factors in the construction phase. Further, this research may have implications for investigating hidden phenomenon through a quantitative approach, which is shown as tangible. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

An increasing number of smart construction sites have been designed using different techniques to reduce injuries caused by construction accidents and achieve proactive risk control. However, comprehensive smart construction site safety management solutions and applications have yet to be developed. Thus, this study proposes a smart construction site framework for safety management. Design/methodology/approach A safety management system based on a cyber-physical system is proposed. The system establishes risk data synchronization mapping between the virtual construction and physical construction sites through scene reconstruction design, data awareness, data communication and data processing modules. Personnel, mechanical and other risks on site will be warned and controlled. Findings The results of the case study have proved the management benefits of the system. On-site workers gradually realized that they should enter the construction site based on the standard process. And the number of people close to the construction hazard areas decreased. Research limitations/implications There are some limitations in the technology of smart construction site. The modeling speed can be faster, the data collection can be timelier, and the identification of unsafe behavior can be integrated into the system. Construction quality and efficiency issues in a virtual construction site will also be solved in further research. Practical implications In this paper, this system is actually applied in the mega project management process. More practical projects can use the management ideas and method of this paper to ensure on-site safety. Originality/value This study is among the first attempts to build a complete smart construction site based on CPS and apply it in practice. Personnel, mechanical, components, environment information will be displayed on the virtual construction site. It will greatly promote the development of the intellectualized construction industry in the future.

This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, "Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening" was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society. The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges.

J	Jia, MS; Xu, YQ; He, PW; Zhao, LM				Jia, Meishan; Xu, Youquan; He, Pengwang; Zhao, Lingmin			Identifying critical factors that affect the application of information technology in construction management: A case study of China	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						information technology; construction management; influential factors; empirical study; DEMATEL	SUCCESS FACTORS; IDENTIFICATION; PROJECTS; INTELLIGENT; INNOVATION; QUALITY; SYSTEMS	The new mode for managing construction projects with information technology (IT) has attracted worldwide attention because it can help managers and workers perform tasks and bring potential benefits, such as high-quality products and accident-free production, effectively. However, the application of IT in site have not achieved expected results because it is faced with many constraints caused by internal factors from enterprises and projects and external factors from the government and environment. Although many relevant studies have discussed the constraints of implementing different IT and devices in the construction industry or site, few articles have specifically focused on identifying and analyzing the indicator system. In this work, we took China as the background, scientifically identified 23 influential factors that affect the implementation of IT in construction management through literature review and expert interviews. Subsequently, questionnaires were issued, and Delphi method was used to obtain empirical data that aimed at four different management fields. Then, an efficient and convenient method called DEMATEL was used to deal with these data. Afterward, the factors were divided into four categories, namely, core, diving, independent, and impact factors. Finally, the similarities and differences of the analysis results from the four fields were compared, and the key factors were identified. Results show that the cross-domain talent ability, concept and value cognition, and organization structure are core factors in all management fields that should be managed first along with the IT innovation ability in the enterprise. The formulation of technical standards and related device and training input are also critical in specific fields. Strategic planning plays a role in macro control and promotion. Data management and application, platform construction, solution, and collaboration have direct impacts on information management. The research results provide suggestions not only for the government to formulate effective policies for IT application and promotion in construction industry, but also for enterprises to take measures in improving management efficiency in the construction site and realizing its substantial benefits.

J	Abas, NH; Blismas, N; Lingard, H				Abas, Nor Haslinda; Blismas, Nick; Lingard, Helen			Development of risk assessment tool using damaging energy and argumentation theory for evaluating construction occupational safety and health risks	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Occupational safety and health; Construction industry; Industrialised building system; Damaging energy; Argumentation theory; Knowledge processes		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a risk assessment model to assess the occupational safety and health (OSH) risks presented by different construction approaches, namely traditional and industrialised building system (IBS). The development process applies the concept of argumentation theory, which helps construction designers integrate the management of OSH risk into the design process. In addition, an energy damage model is used as an underpinning framework for developing the model. Design/methodology/approach Development of the model was achieved through two phases. Phase I involved collection of data on the activities involved in the construction process and their associated OSH risks, derived from five different case studies, field observation and interviews. Knowledge of design aspects that have the potential to impact on OSH was obtained from document analysis. Using the knowledge obtained in phase I, a model was developed in the form of argument trees (Phase II), which represent a reasoning template with regard to options available to designers when they make judgements about aspects of their designs. Inferences from these aspects eventually determined the magnitude of the damaging energies for every activity involved. Finally, the model was validated by panels of experts, and revisions and amendments were made to the model accordingly. Findings The risk assessment model development revealed that the concept of argumentation theory and energy damage model is suitable to represent design safety risk knowledge and effectively address the designer's role in making decisions in their designs and further illuminate the level of OSH risk their designs pose. Practical implications The developed model provides best-practice reasoning support for construction designers, which help them to understand the impact of their designs decisions on worker's safety and health, and thereby assist them to further mitigate the risk to an acceptable level. Originality/value This study departs from the existing tool in that the model was developed based upon the combination of argumentation theory and energy damage model. The significance of the model is discussed.

J	Aiello, G; Hopps, F; Santisi, D; Venticinque, M				Aiello, Giuseppe; Hopps, Fabrizio; Santisi, Domenico; Venticinque, Mario			The Employment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Analyzing and Mitigating Disaster Risks in Industrial Sites	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Safety; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Europe; Inspection; Risk management; Regulation; Employment; Disaster prevention; safety engineering; service innovation; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)	UAVS	Effective safety procedures play a fundamental role in high-risk industrial contexts, because the occurrence of an accident can cause environmental catastrophes, severe damages to the structures, and fatal injuries to the workers. In particular, maintaining detailed and up-to-date information about potential accident areas is a crucial issue to prevent the occurrence of disasters and to safely plan the rescue process. In such contexts, periodic safety inspections are therefore performed on a regular basis, although they may expose the inspection personnel to harsh or hazardous environments. The employment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in such situations can provide unprecedented opportunities for predisaster analyses and site management operations. According to the current regulations, however, industrial contexts are classified as "critical," which substantially limits the possibilities of performing UAV operations in such places. The recent introduction of a simplified regulatory system for inoffensive UAVs has opened a wide landscape of new business opportunities. The article discusses the application of such technology for site analysis in industrial contexts, and illustrates the mandatory risk assessment procedure prescribed by the regulation. The results obtained show that although the technical advantages and economic convenience of employing this technology is generally recognized, at the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, the market spread is still poor due to fragmented regulations, cultural barriers, and technical issues. In particular, the compliance with the ATEX directives still constitutes a significant technological problem substantially limiting the spread of innovative industrial services. Such issues are discussed in the article referring to a case study, in order to provide a reference guideline and to highlight the boundaries of application of innovative approaches to the prevention and management of industrial disasters based on UAV technology. In addition, the article identifies some important directives for further research and development of UAV systems capable to operate in high-risk industrial contexts, which constitutes an emerging business area with a vast potential market.

J	Li, J; Yu, MH; Wang, HW				Li, Jue; Yu, Minghui; Wang, Hongwei			A taxonomy of performance shaping factors for shield tunnel construction	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human error; Performance shaping factors; Safety behaviour; Shield tunnel construction	DYNAMIC PROBABILISTIC SIMULATION; COMPLEX SYSTEM ACCIDENTS; OPERATING CREW RESPONSE; METRO CONSTRUCTION; JOB-PERFORMANCE; SAFETY PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; OCCUPATIONAL STRESS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose - On shield tunnel construction (STC) site, human error is widely recognized as essential to accident. It is necessary to explain which factors lead to human error and how these factors can influence human performance. Human reliability analysis supports such necessity through modeling the performance shaping factors (PSFs). The purpose of this paper is to establish and validate a PSF taxonomy for the STC context. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken in this study mainly consists of three steps. First, a description of the STC context is proposed through the analysis of the STC context. Second, the literature which stretch across the PSF methodologies, cognitive psychology and human factors of STC and other construction industries are reviewed to develop an initial set of PSFs. Finally, a final PSF set is modified and validated based on STC task analysis and STC accidents cases. Findings - The PSF taxonomy constituted by 4 main components, 4 hierarchies and 85 PSFs is established for human behavior modeling and simulation under the STC context. Furthermore, by comparing and evaluating the performance of STC PSF and existing PSF studies, the proposed PSF taxonomy meets the requirement for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Practical implications - The PSF taxonomy can provide a basis and support for human behavior modeling and simulation under the STC context. Integrating PSFs into a behavior simulation model provides a more realistic and integrated assessment of human error by manifesting the influence of each PSFs on the cognitive processes. The simulation results can suggest concrete points for the improvement of STC safety management. Originality/value - This paper develops a taxonomy of PSFs that addresses the various unique influences of the STC context on human behaviors. The harsh underground working conditions and diverse resources of system information are identified as key characteristics of the STC context. Furthermore, the PSF taxonomy can be integrated into a human cognitive behavior model to predict the worker's behavior on STC site in future work.

UAV Integration in Current Construction Safety Planning and Monitoring Processes: Case Study of a High-Rise Building Construction Project in Chile	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Safety planning and monitoring; High-rise; Chile	AERIAL SYSTEM UAS; HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; WORKERS; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGIES; INSPECTION; CHECKING; HEALTH; BIM	The majority of construction fatalities and accidents in Chile occur in high-rise building construction projects that also suffer from an insufficient number of safety managers on-site. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their generated aerial visual contents have the potential to help the limited number of safety managers in such projects to quickly and properly inspect the inaccessible, hard-to-reach, or unsafe locations on the site and to enhance their safety assessment of those projects. In this study, a case study approach was adopted to investigate how UAV technology and their generated aerial visual contents might affect the current approach of conducting safety planning and monitoring in a high-rise building construction site in Chile with a limited number of safety managers. The case study involved three steps: (1) understanding the current safety planning and monitoring process in a high-rise construction project, (2) investigating how UAV-related tasks and generated visual contents could be integrated into the current process, and (3) assessment of how such UAV integration might affect the current safety planning and monitoring process. The outcome of the case study provided a detailed overview of the new steps required to integrate UAVs in the current safety planning and monitoring process and concluded that adoption of UAV technology had enhanced identification and assessment of hazards in the high-rise project. Hazards associated with unsafe acts and conditions at height (e.g., missing guardrails or safety nets around unprotected edges or openings and loose or unsecured material at height) were the most common types of hazards identified using the UAV in this case study. Safety managers in the project also rated aerial videos captured by the UAV as the most useful type of data for their safety planning and monitoring tasks. The UAV also significantly reduced the amount of time required for safety managers to conduct their site visit walkthroughs on the project site.

The purposes of this research are to identify construction equipment management practices that have the potential to improve productivity in multistory building projects, develop a tool for measuring such practices, and on that basis, build a logistic regression model for predicting the probability of exceeding a baseline productivity factor when the levels of implementation of equipment management practices are known. The research adopted a two-phase exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. During Phase I, in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 experts who have been involved in the delivery of multistory building projects. The qualitative data were analyzed, and construction equipment management practices that have the potential to improve productivity were identified. In Phase II, data were collected from 39 principal contractors on 39 projects using questionnaires. The quantitative data were analyzed to prioritize the practices identified in Phase I, and on that basis, a scoring tool for measuring the practices was developed; a logistic regression model was also developed for predicting the probability of exceeding baseline productivity factor using a sigmoid graph when the score of the practices is known. Construction equipment maintenance, construction equipment procurement plans, and construction equipment productivity analysis are identified as the three construction equipment management practices that could improve productivity in multistory building projects. Contractors can use the probability-based predictive model to assess the risk of low productivity for specific levels of implementations of construction equipment management practices. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by developing a construction equipment management practices measuring, planning, monitoring, and evaluating tool in the context of multistory building projects. Also, the logistic regression model can be used to test whether a certain level of implementation of a construction equipment management practice might be associated with higher or lower productivity compared to the baseline.

J	Matthews, HS; Williams, E				Matthews, H. Scott; Williams, Eric			Telework Adoption and Energy Use in Building and Transport Sectors in the United States and Japan	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Japan; United States; Buildings; residential; Buildings; office; Energy conservation; Commute; Telecommunication	EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; TRAVEL	Telework (or telecommuting) has been proposed as a way of reducing transportation externalities such as congestion and passenger vehicle energy use. While there is contention among sources about the secondary induced transportation effects, many studies have estimated net benefits as a result of transportation reductions. Analyses including effects from shifts in commercial and residential building energy use, however, are not as visible. It is expected that commercial building energy use would decrease, and residential energy would increase as a result of telework adoption. We estimate macrolevel energy effects across these three energy intensive sectors (transportation, commercial, and residential buildings) to help characterize the potential of telework as a policy initiative to improve national energy efficiency. For current estimated teleworking populations and practices in the United States and Japan, we estimate national level energy savings of only 0.01-0.4% in the United States and 0.03-0.36% in Japan. In a future scenario with pervasive adoption of teleworking, where 50% of information workers telecommute 4 days per week, United States and Japan national energy savings are estimated at only about 1% in both cases. These energy savings are quite modest compared with currently available policy options to mitigate energy demand. By comparison, an improvement in average vehicle fuel efficiency of 20% would save 5.4% of total United States energy demand, suggesting that the direct benefits of adopting telework are relatively small given the large degree of behavioral and structural change required. Still, presuming that future work practices tend to favor greater adoption, the potential energy savings may merit direction towards environmentally beneficial implementation. If trends in the workplace favor more telework in the future, we suggest that maximizing environmental benefits merits greater attention to how telework is adopted. Obviously the increased number of avoided commutes is a factor, but more importantly, elimination of office space due to virtual offices yields energy savings that rival those from reduced commuting. Future analyses and implementation of telework should thus give greater attention to energy use in buildings and residences.	[Matthews, H.

J	Han, Y; Li, J; Cao, XL; Jin, RY				Han, Yu; Li, Jie; Cao, Xiulan; Jin, Ruoyu			Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Studying the Relationships among Safety Investment, Construction Employees' Safety Cognition, and Behavioral Performance	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Construction employee; Safety behavior; Safety cognition; Safety investment; Structural equation modeling (SEM)	CLIMATE; CULTURE; INDUSTRY; ATTITUDES; IMPLICIT; WORKERS; SITES	This study aimed to investigate the internal relationships between safety investments and construction employees' behavioral performance with safety cognition as the mediating factor. A comprehensive methodology was adopted, including theoretical modeling of safety investments, survey questionnaire, and structural equation modeling (SEM). In the theoretical model, four factors were used as safety investment categories: personal protection equipment (PPE), safety education, insurance purchased for site employees, and safety incentives. These four categories were studied for their correlation to the overall safety investment, which was tested for its contribution to employees' behavioral safety performance in both direct and indirect ways. Indirectly, safety cognition was introduced as a mediator to bridge safety investments and behavioral performance. A questionnaire consisting of 28 indicators was adopted to describe safety investment, safety cognition, and behavioral performance. A random sampling approach and the top-down method were implemented to recruit construction site employees from the southeastern region of China. The followup SEM analysis revealed that all four investment categories positively contributed to the overall safety investment, which was found significantly correlated to employees' safety cognition and behavioral performance. Safety incentive was identified as the most significant factor contributing to the overall investment. The current study extends prior studies of safety investments by adopting a quantitative approach from the employees' perspective. Insights are offered to construction employers on how safety investments can affect behavioral performance-for example, the importance of balancing the tangible (e.g., incentive) and intangible (e.g., safety insurance) investment categories. This study also contributes to establishing the internal links among safety investments, safety cognition, and behavioral safety performance. Based on the current findings, future work could investigate how to optimize safety investments to achieve better behavioral performance. The current study, based in China, could be applied in a different geographic context by testing the correlations between safety investments and behavioral safety performance.

J	Lee, HS; Shin, JW; Park, M; Ryu, HG				Lee, Hyun-soo; Shin, Jae-won; Park, Moonseo; Ryu, Han-Guk			Probabilistic Duration Estimation Model for High-Rise Structural Work	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION SIMULATION; BETA-DISTRIBUTIONS; OPERATIONS	The duration of a construction project is a key factor to consider before starting a new project, as it can determine project success or failure. Despite the high level of uncertainty and risk involved in construction, current construction planning relies on traditional deterministic scheduling methods that cannot clearly ascertain the level of uncertainty involved in a project. This, subsequently, can prolong a project's duration, particularly when that project is high-rise structural work, which is not yet a common project type in Korea. Indeed, among construction processes, structural work is notable, as it is basically performed outdoors. Thus, no matter how precisely a schedule is developed, such projects can easily fail due to unexpected events that are beyond the planner's control, such as changes in weather conditions. Therefore, in this study, to cope with the uncertainties involved in high-rise building projects, a probabilistic duration estimation model is developed in which both weather conditions and work cycle time for unit work are considered to predict structural work duration. According to the proposed estimation model, weather variables are divided into two types: weather conditions that result in nonworking days and weather conditions that result in work productivity rate (WPR) change. Obtained from actual previous data, the WPR is used with relevant nonworking day weather conditions to modify the actual number of working days per calendar days. Furthermore, on the basis of previous research results, the cycle time of the unit work area is assumed to follow the beta probability distribution function. Thus, the probabilistic duration model is valid for 95% probability. Finally, a case study is conducted that confirms the model can be practically used to estimate more reliable and applicable probabilistic durations of structural work. Indeed, this model can assist schedulers and site workers by alerting them, at the beginning of a project, to project uncertainties that specifically pertain to structural work and the weather. Thus, the proposed model can enable personnel to easily amend, and increase the reliability of, the construction schedule at hand.

With the rapid development of subway systems in Chinese urban areas, construction workers are being exposed to new risks which are poorly understood and managed. Subway construction projects are large scale and scattered over many construction sites, and involve numerous stakeholders and sophisticated technologies in challenging underground environments. Accident rates are high and have significant economic and social consequences for the firms and people involved. Addressing the gap in research about the safety risk in these projects, the purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of the factors influencing the safety of Chinese subway construction projects with the overall objective of reducing accident rates. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with 399 subway construction professionals across five stakeholder groups. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with five experienced experts in safety management on subway projects to validate the results. Findings It was found that the eight most critical factors perceived by stakeholders to influence safety risks on Chinese subway projects are: project management team; contractor-related factors; site underground environment; safety protection during the use of machines; safety management investment; site construction monitoring and measurement; hazard identification and communication; and use of machines in all stages. This indicates that in allocating limited project resources to improve the safety of subway projects, managers should focus on: developing safety knowledge and positive attitudes in leadership teams; formulating effective risk management systems to identify, assess, mitigate, measure and monitor safety risks on site; improving communications with stakeholders about these risks and effectively managing plant, equipment and machinery. Originality/value This research contributes a new multi-stakeholder perspective to the lack of safety research in Chinese subway construction projects. The research findings provide important new insights for policymakers and managers in improving safety outcomes on these major projects, producing potentially significant social and economic benefits for society and the construction industry.

For example, precast bridge deck slabs are placed on precast girders, and they are connected by shear pockets on deck slabs and shear connectors on girders. For the coupling of deck slabs and girders, it is important to ensure proper connections between shear pockets and shear connectors. However, shear pockets and shear connectors often do not match properly at construction sites because of dimensional errors and misalignments. Furthermore, precast girders deform over time due to their heavy weights, time dependent creep and shrinkage, pre- or post-tensioning, etc., once they are placed on sites. To match these components at construction sites, workers often need to trim and cut some components, delaying construction processes. To shorten such delay, this study proposes a laser scanning and signal processing technique that can automatically identify the optimal placement of precast bridge deck slabs with respect to precast girders by minimizing mismatches between shear pockets and shear connectors. First, scan data from precast bridge deck slabs and precast girders are acquired using a 3D laser scanner, and their dimensions are estimated including the locations and dimensions of shear pockets using DBSCAN and mixed pixel filtering algorithms. Next, locations of the shear connectors are extracted from the scan data of the precast girders using RANSAC and K-means clustering algorithms. Finally, the optimal placement of the deck slabs with respect to the girders is determined by solving a nonlinear minimization problem considering the locations and sizes of the extracted precast components. To validate the performance of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on small-scale test specimens and at an actual construction field. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique could effectively estimate the optimal placement of precast bridge deck slabs with respect to precast girders.

Human experience in an architectural space is defined as the state of mind that is reflected on our physiological, emotional, and cognitive statuses. Previous studies attempted to explain the relation between architectural design features (e.g., the existence of daylight and connectivity to nature) and human experience. However, the extent of how different design features influence human experience has not been fully quantified yet. This study provides an integrated method that fuses virtual reality and noninvasive body area sensor networks (BSNs) to quantify human experience in architectural spaces. Using a set of biometric sensors, several physiological metrics such as skin conductance, brain activity, and heart rate were captured and examined while subjects were navigating and performing tasks in virtual environments (VEs). The integrated platform has been used to quantify the sense of stress and anxiety through structured user experiments in a visualization laboratory using alternate VEs configured by varying the related set of architectural design features. To generalize the findings of this study, a large pool of participants was invited to the experiments, where statistically significantly different results could be obtained. The analysis of the collected body sensor data showed that the human response changes with architectural design, with more than 40% of the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations having higher values across all channels on all frequency bands, 141% having an increase in galvanic skin response (GSR) readings, and lower heart rate variability in photoplethysmogram (PPG) in the stress-reducing environment as compared with the stress-inducing environment. The presented approach provides a systematic way for architectural design firms to get user feedback before the design is finalized for achieving the ultimate experience among the proposed design alternatives.

Undoubtedly, near-miss accidents provide insights into possible accidents and provide a great opportunity to further improve safety margins. It is possible to significantly improve the safety performance by learning from previous near-miss accidents and tracking near-miss accidents in real time leading to taking appropriate action before a potential up-coming accident. However, little research has been done in both autonomous data requirement analysis of near-miss accidents and technological solutions to track near-miss accidents based on real-time information on construction sites. The objective of this paper is to analyze and verify the autonomous information requirement of near-miss accidents and investigate the feasibility and performance of using a Zigbee RFID sensor network to fulfil these requirements. First, the autonomous data requirement of near-miss accidents is systematically analyzed based on typical historical accident cases. Then, considering the features of construction sites and characteristics of near-miss accidents, an autonomous real-time tracking system of near-miss accidents (ARTTS-NMA) on construction sites is proposed, which employs ultrasonic for outdoor and indoor real-time location tracking, adopts sensors for environment surveillance, RFID for access control as well as storage of safety information about workers, equipment and materials, and wireless sensor networks for data transmission. All system components are integrated into a Zigbee RFID sensor network architecture that features a relatively low cost and fast implementation with a pure wireless network backbone. The demonstration system based on the hybrid RFID sensor network architecture is fully working in a laboratory environment and for safety reasons we have chosen to evaluate it in a warehouse, which is considered as the main scenario of a construction site containing both multi-storey structure and open area, to evaluate the complexity of implementation.

J	Hasan, A; Baroudi, B; Elmualim, A; Rameezdeen, R				Hasan, Abid; Baroudi, Bassam; Elmualim, Abbas; Rameezdeen, Raufdeen			Factors affecting construction productivity: a 30 year systematic review	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Construction; Productivity; Construction site	INFLUENCING LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS; RESEARCH TREND; PROJECTS; JOURNALS; INDUSTRY; PERCEPTIONS; WORKERS; PERSPECTIVE; DRIVERS	Purpose A significant amount of work has been performed in the area of identification of factors affecting construction productivity. Previous studies have tried to determine the most important factors affecting construction productivity in different countries for a long time. As a result of continuous effort in this direction, researchers have identified a wide range of factors. While the subject area has matured, no general agreement could be made on the factors affecting construction productivity. To fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review of mainstream studies on factors affecting construction productivity published in the last 30 years (1986-2016). Design/methodology/approach A total of 46 articles from different sources such as journals, conference proceedings, dissertation and PhD theses were identified and thoroughly reviewed. Findings Gaps in research and practices are discussed and directions for future research have been proposed. The literature review indicates that despite noticeable differences in the socio-economic conditions across both developed countries and developing countries, an overall reasonable consensus exists on few significant factors impeding productivity. These are, namely, non-availability of materials, inadequate supervision, skill shortage, lack of proper tools and equipment and incomplete drawing and specifications. Nevertheless, implications of technology, site amenities, process studies, project culture, and impacts of physiological and psychological factors were not adequately covered in existing literature. The study also found that traditional construction projects have remained the main focus of these studies while green construction projects have been generally overlooked. Research limitations/implications The review does not include studies that report productivity at the organisational or industry level as well as total factor productivity. The scope of the review is limited to work on identification of factors affecting productivity at the activity level in construction projects. Practical implications The outcomes of this study would help researchers and practitioners by providing the findings of previous studies in a concise manner. It is also expected that presenting a deeper and wider perspective of the research work performed until now will direct a more focussed approach on productivity improvement efforts in the construction industry. Originality/value This review paper undertakes a comprehensive systematic review of studies on identification of factors affecting construction productivity published during the last three decades.

In recent years, digital technologies are leveraged to develop monitoring systems for construction equipment. These systems are commonly used to detect and/or track different pieces of equipment. However, the recent research work has indicated that the performance of the equipment monitoring system improves when they are able to also recognize/track the activities of the equipment (e.g., digging, compacting, etc.). Nevertheless, the current direction of research on equipment activity recognition is gravitating towards the use of deep learning methods. While very promising, the performance of deep learning methods is predicated on the comprehensiveness of the dataset used for training the model. Given the wide variations of construction equipment, in size and shape, the development of a comprehensive dataset can be challenging. This research hypothesizes that through the use of a robust feature augmentation method, shallow models, such as Random Forest, can yield a comparable performance without requiring a large and comprehensive dataset. Therefore, this research proposes a novel machine learning method based on the integration of Random Forest classifier with the fractional calculus-based feature augmentation technique to develop an accurate activity recognition model using a limited dataset. This method is implemented and applied to three case studies. In the first case study, the operations of two different models of excavators (one small-size and one medium-size) were tracked. By using the data from one excavator for the training and the data from the other one for testing, the impact of equipment size and operators' skill level on the performance of the proposed method is investigated. In the second case study, the data from an actual excavator was used to predict the activity of a scaled remotely controlled excavator. In the last case study, the proposed method was applied for rollers (as an example of non-articulating equipment). It is shown that the fractional feature augmentation method can have a positive impact on the performance of all machine learning methods studied in this research (i.e., Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). It is also shown that the proposed Fractional Random Forest method is able to provide comparable results to deep learning methods using considerably smaller training dataset.

Proactive safety measures such as safety perception and safety detection capability of employees play an important role in improving the safety performance. This study was initiated by three research questions related to (1) the measurement indicators of employees' cognitive load in recognizing safety hazards; (2) site condition factors (e.g., brightness) that can affect subjects' cognitive load; and (3) the quantification of the effects of these site factors on cognitive load. An eye-tracking experimental approach was adopted by recruiting a total of 55 students from construction management or other civil engineering disciplines to visually search hazards in 20 given site scenes. These site scenes were defined by a combination of three different categories, namely distinctiveness of hazards, site brightness, and tidiness. Quantitative measurements of experimental participants' visual search patterns were obtained from data captured by the eye-tracking apparatus. Based on metrics related to experimental participants' fixation, visual search track, and attention map, these measurements were computed to evaluate participants' cognitive load in detecting hazards. Descriptive statistical comparisons analyzed these metrics under predefined categories of site conditions, i.e., distinctness versus obscurity/blurriness, brightness versus darkness, and tidiness versus messiness. The findings revealed that distinct site conditions reduced participants' time in saccades to search hazards but did not improve the accuracy rate of first fixation; messy sites with disorganized items increased participants' cognitive load in detecting hazards in terms of all five measurement items (i.e., accuracy rate of first fixation, fixation count, intersection coefficient, fixation duration, and fixation count in the attention center); the effect of increased brightness on-site needs further studies to determine the optimal balance of brightness level and allocation. Recommendations based on the findings were provided to enhance safety education in terms of site hazard distinctiveness, brightness, and housekeeping best practice. This study extended a few prior studies of adopting eye-tracking technology for safety monitoring by evaluating the impacts of site conditions on participants' cognitive load, which was linked to their hazard detection performance. The study provided insights for evaluating construction employees' hazard detection capabilities to enhance safety education. Future work is proposed to evaluate employees' safety hazard detection pattern under dynamic construction scenarios.

Determining Critical Combinations of Safety Fatality Causes Using Spectral Clustering and Computational Data Mining Algorithms	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY FINDINGS; ASSOCIATION RULES; OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; TRAFFIC CRASHES; ACCIDENTS; WORKERS; PATTERNS; EXPLORE; SYSTEM	Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has played a key role in decreasing safety accidents on construction sites, such reduction is not well perceived among the different types of incidents. For instance, while the injuries resulting in days away from work were substantially decreased, construction fatalities rose in the previous years. While previous safety fatality research work concentrated on studying how different variables could influence the number of fatalities in the construction industry, there is a lack of research efforts that studied the associations, interdependencies, and critical combinations between the different fatality causes. As such, to solve the critical fatality problem that the construction industry is facing, more advanced management methods should be applied. That said, this paper aims to address this important knowledge gap through a methodology based on data-driven computational algorithms. The data analyzed in this paper is comprised of 100 OSHA national fatal accident case files that are prepared by OSHA compliance officers. First, a reference matrix of 100 case files was constructed based on 60 causes that have shown to be the most pertinent to construction fatalities based on a previous study. Second, the spectral clustering computational algorithm was used to cluster the fatality causes based on the strength of their interconnectivities. Third, the frequent pattern data mining and Apriori algorithms were used to determine the critical combinations and associations of causes that mostly contribute to fatal accidents on construction sites. The findings indicate that the 60 fatality causes could be categorized into five clusters. Thus, the most critical combination of fatality causes was determined within each one of the identified clusters. Also, the findings reflected that while safety accidents could happen due to factors or causes that are individually critical, fatalities on construction sites could also result due to a combination of factors that might not be perceived to be critical on the individual level but rather become critical when combined with other factors. This study adds to the body of knowledge by proposing a data-driven accident causation approach to analyze construction fatality accidents, which adds a different dimension to the traditional analysis of safety accidents by factoring possible associations and combinations between different causes. That said, this paper equips safety professionals with a proactive approach that allows them to take the needed preventive actions to avoid fatalities on construction sites by identifying, in hindsight, the critical combinations and associations of fatality causes. Ultimately, the outcomes of this paper would enhance the safety performance in the construction industry and prevent construction fatalities. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Mahalingam, A; Kashyap, R; Mahajan, C				Mahalingam, Ashwin; Kashyap, Rahul; Mahajan, Charudatta			An evaluation of the applicability of 4D CAD on construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						4D CAD; Commercial projects; Infrastructure projects; Benefits; Visualization; Constructability; Project progress review		4D CAD models that integrate physical 3D elements with time, have been used to visualize construction processes in several projects worldwide. 4D models have been used and have been shown to have benefits over processes that span the entire lifecycle of a project such as collaboration with stakeholders, making design decisions, assessing project constructability, identifying spatial conflicts in construction and so on. Despite these benefits, several organizational and project-specific barriers have hindered the widespread adoption of 4D CAD. In order to reconcile the theoretical benefits of 4D models with the practical difficulties faced in implementation, there is an urgent need to explore the implementation of 4D models on construction sites as well as the perceptions of intended users/beneficiaries towards this implementation. This paper aims to address this need and contribute to our understanding of how 4D models must be introduced, positioned and implemented on construction sites, so as to maximize both their acceptability and their usefulness. We describe two 4D models of infrastructure projects and two 4D models of commercial projects that have been built and implemented. Through a process of structured and unstructured interviewing the paper gauges the response of project participants across various organizational levels on each of these projects as to the usefulness of 4D in project planning and control. Through qualitative and statistical analysis of the data we establish that 4D CAD is likely to be most beneficial in the project shaping or planning stage and in the construction stage. In the project shaping stage, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in communicating construction plans and processes to clients, while during the construction phase, 4D CAD is likely to be particularly useful in comparing the constructability of work methods visually in order to detect conflicts or clashes, and as a visual tool for contractors, clients, subcontractors and vendors to review and plan project progress. Further, upper management and site workers are more likely to use and derive benefits from the visualization of processes using 4D given their lack of site related knowledge or skills, while construction professionals who are more construction-savvy are more likely to appreciate and benefit from the analytical and planning aids that 4D simulations provide during the construction phase. However, it is likely that despite these benefits 4D CAD models might not diffuse through the construction industry unless 4D modelling and analysis is integrated into existing project planning approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on future 4D software development that seeks to bring about such integration and leverages the benefits of 4D CAD to bring about improved operational efficiencies on construction sites.

J	Ahmed, A; Mohammed, HA; Gambatese, J; Hurwitz, D				Ahmed, Ananna; Mohammed, Hameed A.; Gambatese, John; Hurwitz, David			Effects of Flashing Blue Lights Mounted on Paving Equipment on Vehicle Speed Behavior in Work Zones	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flashing blue lights; Mobile work zone; Speed reduction; Paving; Freeways		Vehicle speed in work zones is a significant concern to state transportation agencies and their construction partners. Prior research indicates that law enforcement vehicles within a work zone with active flashing lights result in reduced vehicle speeds. Placement of flashing blue lights on construction equipment during nighttime construction work has also been identified as a potential control measure to reduce speeds. The goal of this research study is to determine the impact of flashing blue lights on construction equipment on the speed of passing vehicles in mobile work zones. The research design consisted of a controlled experiment involving flashing blue lights mounted on the rear of a paver during mainline paving operations on three case study projects on high speed roadways at night in Oregon. Vehicle speed data were collected during multiple work shifts for each case study, both with and without the flashing blue lights on. The experimental results reveal that vehicle speed is affected by the presence of flashing blue lights during nighttime work. With the blue lights flashing and at distances upstream of the paver where the driver can see and react to the blue lights, mean vehicle speeds tended to be 4.3-25.7 km/h slower than when the blue lights were off. Closer to, immediately adjacent to, and downstream of the paver, the difference in the mean speed with the blue lights on was typically less or not significant; in some cases and mostly downstream of the paver location, the mean speeds were higher with the blue lights on than with the blue lights off. The speed differential (i.e., the speed prior to the work zone minus the speed in the work zone) was measured as 4.8-11.3 km/h greater with the blue lights turned on than with the blue lights off. The results support construction contractors and state departments of transportation for decision making about the use of flashing blue lights on equipment in work zones. The researchers recommend using flashing blue lights on paving equipment during nighttime operations if allowed by local laws to reduce the speed in the work zone and increase worker and driver safety. This research contributes to the construction industry by providing quantitative evidence of the extent to which flashing blue lights mounted on paving equipment impact vehicle speeds in work zones. Recently, all stakeholders, including the Oregon Department of Transportation, law enforcement, and contractors, have agreed to use the flashing blue lights on paving equipment in Oregon during the 2021 construction season.

J	Moezzi, M; Goins, J				Moezzi, Mithra; Goins, John			Text mining for occupant perspectives on the physical workplace	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; indoor environmental quality; occupant adaptation; occupant perceptions; text analysis; workplace satisfaction	THERMAL COMFORT; ENVIRONMENT; MODEL; WORK; BUILDINGS	An analysis is presented of occupants' responses from a commercial building indoor environment satisfaction survey database. Building from satisfaction ratings and standardized categorical responses collected in surveys for 192 office buildings in the United States, text analysis software is used to analyse text responses to open-ended survey questions, focusing on occupants' perspectives on the workplace and building overall, temperature, and acoustics. These occupant texts detail interactions between occupants and their physical environment in a technical sense, but also interpret these interactions, assess their consequences, and reflect on social relationships and other matters that lie outside dimension-by-dimension assessments of the physical environment. Viewed together these texts reveal a user-centred perspective that points to issues that rest below the surface of more technical analyses of buildings, such as over air-conditioning, worker stress and frustration, workplace usability, and relationships between physical and other aspects of the workplace. Attending to this perspective could lead to improvements in occupant experience, building and technology design, building operations, and survey research, as well as inform initiatives that require occupant adaptation and cooperation, including those for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Il est presente une analyse des reponses des occupants provenant d'une base de donnees d'enquetes de satisfaction sur l'environnement interieur d'immeubles commerciaux. En s'appuyant sur les notations de satisfaction et les reponses normalisees par categorie recueillies dans des enquetes menees sur 192 immeubles de bureaux aux Etats-Unis, un logiciel d'analyse de texte est utilise pour analyser les reponses textuelles aux questions ouvertes d'enquete, en se concentrant sur les points de vue des occupants sur le lieu de travail et l'immeuble dans son ensemble, la temperature et l'acoustique. Les textes de ces occupants detaillent les interactions entre les occupants et leur environnement physique dans une acception technique, mais interpretent egalement ces interactions, en evaluent les consequences et reflechissent aux relations sociales et aux autres questions qui se situent hors des evaluations dimension par dimension de l'environnement physique. Consideres dans leur ensemble, ces textes sont revelateurs d'un point de vue centre sur l'utilisateur qui met l'accent sur des problemes qui ne parviennent pas a affleurer dans les analyses plus techniques des immeubles, tels que l'exces de climatisation, le stress et les frustrations des travailleurs, l'utilisabilite du lieu de travail, et les relations entre les aspects physiques et les autres aspects du lieu de travail. Le fait de porter attention a ce point de vue pourrait conduire a des ameliorations en termes d'experience vecue par les occupants, de conception des immeubles et des technologies, d'exploitation des immeubles, et d'enquetes par sondage, et pourrait egalement influer sur des initiatives qui exigent l'adaptation et la cooperation des occupants, notamment des initiatives favorisant la reduction des emissions de gaz a effet de serre.

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on information obtained through a photographic Q-sort, supplemented with a literature review, health and safety information related to the design of a facade was collected from subject matter experts. This information was used to develop infographics representing the subject matter knowledge. A facilitated workshop was then held with 20 design professionals to engage them in a hazard identification process using a case study scenario. The designers were provided with the infographics and asked to comment upon how the infographics changed their assessments of the health and safety risks inherent in the case study building design. A sub-set of participants was interviewed to explore their perceptions of the impact and usefulness of the inforgraphics. Findings - Infographics were developed at different levels of detail, representing potential health and safety issues associated with the site location and surroundings, the construction site environment and the detailed facade design. Workshop participants identified a number of potential health and safety issues associated with the case study scenario. However, this number increased substantially once they had viewed the infographic. Further, the health and safety issues identified when participants had access to the infographic were more likely to be less visible issues, relating to ergonomic hazards, procurement or the organisation and sequencing of work. The workshop participants who were interviewed described how the infographics enabled them to make a more global assessment of the health and safety implications of the case study building design because it helped them to understand the design in the physical construction site context. Participants also favoured the visual nature of the infographics and suggested that this format may be particularly useful to communicate important health and safety information to novice designers with limited on- site experience. Research limitations/implications - The infographics developed in this research were relatively simple two- dimensional representations produced and presented in hard copy format. It is possible that more sophisticated forms of infographic could have produced different results. Thus, it is important that future research develops different types of infographics and rigorously evaluates their effectiveness in developing designers' health and safety- related knowledge and improving decision making. Practical implications - The results indicate that simple infographics can help design professionals to better understand the health and safety implications of design decisions in the context of the construction site environment. In particular, the infographics appear to have increased designers' ability to recognize less visible health and safety-related issues. The designers interviewed also described the potential usefulness of the infographics in design workshops as a tool to stimulate discussion and develop a shared understanding of the health and safety aspects of a particular design decision or choice. Originality/value - The value of the research lies in the development and evaluation of infographics as a tool supports the integration of health and safety into design decision making. The potential to develop these tools into digital or web-based resources is also significant.
